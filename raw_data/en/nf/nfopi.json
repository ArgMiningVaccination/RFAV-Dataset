The University's affirmative-action policy is to provide equal access to admissions, educational programs and activities, financial aid, student services, and employment. In compliance with Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 a nd Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a grievance procedure has been established to process student complaints alleging violation of these regula tions or of the University's policy of nondiscrimination based on gender or disability. Inquir ies concerning Title IX may be directed to the affirmative-action officer. Employment-relate d discrimination complaints, including those filed by student employees, are processed in conformity with the provisi ons outlined in existing staff personnel policies. Complaints related to discrimination in a cademic areas are reviewed in conformity with the procedures established by the academic administration. INTRODUCTION 21 Nondiscrimination Policy Loma Linda University was established by the Seventh-day Adventist Church as an integral part of its teaching ministry. The University affirms that Christian principles are incompatible with various forms of discrimination that have divided so cieties, and that all persons are of equal worth in the sight of God and should be so regarded by all His people. Therefore, the University is committed to equal education and employment opportunities for men and women of all races and does not discriminate on the basis of handicap, gende r, race, color, or national origin in its educational or admissions policies, financial a ffairs, employment programs, student life and services, or any University-administered program. To this end, the University is in compliance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended and is in substantial compliance wi th Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (34 CFR 106 et seq.), Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veterans Adjustment Act of 1974; and does not discriminate against any employees or applicants for employment on the basis of age or because they are disabled veterans or veterans of the Vietnam era. In addition, the University administers student programs without discrimination on the basis of age\u2014except in those programs where age is a bona fide academ ic qualification for admission\u2014in accordance with the provisions of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. The University reserves constitutional and statutor y rights as a religious institution and employer to give preference to Seventh-day Adventists in admissions and employment, including but not limited to 42 U.S.C. Secs. 2000e-1, 2000e-2; S ec. 6-15 of Code Sec. 12926(d)(1); Title II, Division 4, Chapter 2, Sec. 7286.5 of the Califor nia Code of Regulations; the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; and Article I, Sec. 4, of the California Constitution. The University believes that Title IX regulations are subject to constitutional guarantees against unreasonable entanglement with or infringements on the religious teachings and practices of the Seventh-day Adventist church. The University expects students and employees to uphold biblical principles of morality and deportment as interpre ted by the Seventh-day Adventist church. The University claims exemptions from the provisions of Title IX set forth in CATALOG Accommodation for Disability Loma Linda University is in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Sec. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, as well as with local and st ate requirements. The University is committed to providing education\u2014including suppor t services and reasonable accommodations for disabilities\u2014to qualified applicants for whom su ch accommodation does not fundamentally alter the chosen program or create an undue burden. For information regarding accommodation for disab ility, the student should consult the office of the dean of the school to which application for admission is being made. Following acceptance, the student may be asked if he or she has a disability requiring accommodation. A student who desires accommodati on for a disability (e.g., physical, learning, or psychological) identified after acceptance shoul d consult the office of the dean regarding a request for accommodation. The accommodation request must be submitted in writing on the designated form. The completed form and th e required supporting documentation will be evaluated by appropriate University entities to determine whether or not the applicant can be expected to perform the essential functions of the program. All discussions will remain confidential.

In an educational institution, the authority sym bolized by the mace derives from respect for the authority of knowledge and for the rights and value of the individual. Thus the leader of an academic communitniversity Mace, Coat of Arms, and Seal ensure for its members a climate conducive to growth in knowledge and grace. The construction of the ceremonial mace of Loma Linda University evokes further ideas. Its two metals, bronze and aluminum, suggest the value of lessons both ancient and contempor ary. Rather than lying prone, an instrument to be wielded, this mace stands up right in celebration of the human spirit. It s open construction implies free exposure to questions, ideas, and conflict.

On the scroll below t MABOUT THE UNIVERSITY 37 University Foundations HISTORY Loma Linda University is part of the Seventh-day Adventist system of higher education. In 1905 the University (formerly College of Medical Evangelists) was founded\u2014through a series of divine providences\u2014at Loma Linda, California, by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The School of Nursing began in 1905. In 1909, the College of Medical Evangelists received its charter as a medical school with the express purpose of preparing physicians who could meet the needs of the whole person. Both schools emphasized the need for healthful living as a part of medical care, a revolutionary concept in 1905. The University was designated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church as a center for educating health professionals. The original schools\u2014Nursing and Medicine\u2014have been joined by Allied Health Professions, De ntistry, Pharmacy, Public Health, Science and Technology, and Religion; and the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The curricula of the University are approved by their respective professional organizations. From its small beginnings, the University has achieved widespread recognition, having sent more of its graduates into internati onal service than has any other university. It remains committed to the vision of its founders and is sustained by its close association with the church. From 1918 to 1962, the University operated within health facilities in two cities: Loma Linda and Los Angeles. In September 1962 all health-professional education was consolidated at Loma Linda. In 1967 Loma Linda University Medical Center opened in its new three-tower facility, a landmark cloverleaf structure. The medical center continues on the cutting edge of health care, providing excellent service for patients and expanding educational opportunities for students. In 1990 the Board of Trustees designated Loma Linda Un iversity a health-sciences university\u2014part of a complex comprised of Loma Linda University Medical Center, faculty-pr actice plans, and affiliated institutions. The University is a leader in the field of health-sciences education, research, and service. The most current campus census figures (January 1, 2006) indicat e that the core of the combined faculties consists of 1,179 full-time teachers. Part-tim e and voluntary teachers (1 ,345\u2014largely clinicians in the prof essional curricula) bring the total to 2,524. As of Autumn Quarter 2006, 705 students from 95 countries outside the United States are represented in the enrollment of 3,970. This imposing three-story structure\u2014the Loma Linda Resort\u2014and its surrounding acreage were purchased in 1905. Incorporated in August of that year as the Loma Linda Sanitarium , in October it opened its doors to patients and nursing students. 38 UNIVERSITY CATALOG A CENTURY OF SERVICE Today the original 1905 property is part of an expanding health sciences campus, which includes: three medical facilities, licensed for 785 beds\u2014 Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC), 1966 Loma Linda University Children's Hospital (LLUCH), 1993 Loma Linda University East Campus Hospital ( LLUECH), 2003 licensed under LLUMC as Loma Linda University Community Medical Center (LLUCMC), 1993--formerly known as Loma Linda Community Hospital; an acute psychiatric care facility, licen sed in 1991 for 89 beds\u2014 the Loma Linda University Behavioral Medicine Center (LLUBMC); five Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Ce nter (LLUAHSC) institutes, two LLU research centers, and various school-related research centers (see Learning Resources); and Loma Linda University (on-campus, distance-education, and online degree programs through the Schools of Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Public Health, and Religion; and the Faculty of Graduate Studies. 1905 School of Nursing opens 1909 School of Medicine, renamed the College of Medical Evangelists (CME) 1922 Department of Dietetics 1937 School of Medical Technology* 1941 School of Physical Therapy* 1945 Radiologic Technology Program* 1948 School of Tropical & Preventive Medicine (reorganized as School of Public Health, 1964) 1954 Graduate School (restructured as Faculty of Graduate Studies in 2005) 1953 School of Dentistry 1958 Dental Hygiene Program 1959 Occupational Therapy Program* 1963 Medical Records Administration Program* 1966 Schools/Programs (see * above) consolidated as the School of Allied Health Professions 1967 Loma Linda University campus merges with La Sierra College 1968 Loma Linda University Medical Center dedicated 1990 Loma Linda and La Sierra campus es become two separate universities 1990 School of Religion 1991 Loma Linda University designated a health-sciences university 1997 Loma Linda University and Medical Center (corporately linked together through Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center\u2014LLUAHSC) 2002 School of Pharmacy 2003 School of Science and Technology ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY 39 UNIVERSITY PHILOSOPHY As implied by its motto, \"TO MAKE MAN WHOLE,\" the University affirms these tenets as central to its view of education: God is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Mankind's fullest development entails a growing understanding of the individual in relation to both God and society. The quest for truth and professional expertise, in an environment permeated by religious values, benefits the individual and society and advances the ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. 40 UNIVERSITY CATALOG FUNDAMENTAL VALUES The University affirms these values as central to its view of education. COMPASSION \u2014The sympathetic willingness to be engaged with the needs and sufferings of others. Among the most memorable depictions of compassion in Scripture is the story of the Good Samaritan, which Loma Linda University has taken as a central symbol of our work. INTEGRITY \u2014The quality of living a unified life in which one's convictions are well-considered and match one's actions. Integrity encompasses honesty, authenticity, and trustworthiness. EXCELLENCE \u2014The commitment to exceed minimum standards and expectations. FREEDOM \u2014The competency and privile ge to make informed and accountable choices and to respect the freedom of others. God has called us not to slavery but to freedom. JUSTICE \u2014The commitment to equality and to treat others fairly, renouncing all forms of unfair discrimination. The God of the Bible is One who calls people continually to justice. According to the prophets, religious faith could be genuine only when it led the believers to \"seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphans, [and] plead for the widow.\" PURITY/SELF-CONTROL \u2014The commitment to be morally upright and moderate in all things, with complete control over one's emotions, desires, and actions. HUMILITY \u2014The willingness to serve others in a sacrificial manner, and the self-respect that renounces haughtiness or arrogance. ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY 41 A Unique University Loma Linda University has always combined a devotion to aca demic excellence with a concer n for spiritual values and a high sense of mission. The motto of the University, \"to ma ke man whole,\" illustrates the sense of destiny felt in the University community to act its part in God's ongoing plan for healing and restoring human beings to live with Him in wholeness, both now and in eternity. While Loma Linda University has changed in many ways since its beginning in 1905, the biblical principles that provide its foundation have remained unchanged. SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST HERITAGE Loma Linda University is owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and has a deep commitment to respecting the rich diversity of its student body. It views resp ect and sensitivity for all people, regardless of their culture and ethnicity, as a part of true Christianity . We recognize that students come from many different faiths. This University has a tradition of religious liberty, and it highly respects students' religious values that differ from ours. We look upon the various perspectives of each spiritually committed student as enriching to our campus and educational environment. OUR UNIQUE FEATURES Two distinctive features of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which are part of the Loma Linda experience, become evident to first-time students. The first is the concept of Sabbath rest, which reminds us of God as Creator. Adventists realize this in part by celebrating Saturday as the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. During these hours University offices, laboratories, libraries, study halls, and re creation facilities are closed to give time for physical and spiritual renewal and worship. A second distinctive feature worth noting is the emphasis on hea lth and wholeness. Students will be able to exercise in our recreation and wellness center, a health-a nd-fitness complex that received a natio nal award for excellence in utility and design. The cafeterias on campus feature well-prepared vegetarian meals. Note also that the Un iversity holds that a drug-, alcohol-, and tobacco-free lifestyle is essential for achieving the goal of \"wholeness.\" This means that all students agree to refrain from the use of tobacco, alcohol, and other \"recreational\" drugs while enrolled at the University. 42 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Spiritual Life Worship experiences represent a critical dimension of the educational experien ce at Loma Linda University and are available to the student many times throughout the week. In addition to regular Friday evening and Saturday services, many class, school, club, and University activities incl ude a component of worship and praise to God. CHAPEL SERVICES In keeping with the commitment of our mission, Loma Linda University students have special requirements, such as chapel service attendance each Wednesday morning in the University Church. The chapel programs provide a variety of opportunities to integrate faith and learning. Undergraduates wh o live in the residence halls are also expected to attend worships in the residence halls each week. RELIGION CLASSES Classes in religion are part of the core curriculum in each of the University's schools and prog rams. These classes deal with the study of the Bible, ethics, clinical mi nistry (which concentrates on ways to understand and meet the spiritual needs of patients in a manner that is noninvasive and individually appropriate), and a variety of other issues related to the student's field of study and personal spiritual journey. All students who choose Loma Linda as their university make a commitment to conduct their lives in a manner that reflects their sense of responsibility for the honor and integrity of th e University and themselves as members of its community. ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY 43 44 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Learning Environment The total resources of the University offe r a wealth of opportunity to the student with initiative and willingness to develop individual capacity to the fullest extent.

The minimum total score requirements are as follows for TO EFL, unless adjustments are made at the discretion of the individual school: undergraduate, 173 (paper based = 500) required of applicants to programs that do not include a clinical component and/or do not lead to licensure in the United States, with a goal of 200 (paper based = 533) upon graduation from a baccalaureate degree program; undergraduate, 213 (paper based = 550) required of applicants to programs with a clinical component and/or programs leading to licensure in the United States; graduate, 213 (paper based = 550). For the Michigan test, requirements are as follows: undergraduate, a minimum score of 90th percentile; graduate (humanities and social sciences), 90th percentile and above; graduate (science), 85th percentile and above. Test of Written English (TWE): a minimum score of 5; Te st of Spoken English (TSE): a minimum score of 50. Pre-entrance examination results Official pre-entrance examination results, as required by each program (e.g., TOEFL), should be sent directly to the Office of University Admissions. Foreign transcripts and credentials Official international degrees, professional credentials, and education transcripts (o r grade sheets or mark sheets) must be sent to an evaluation center approved by Loma Linda Univer sity Office of University Admissions. The center reports the evaluation results directly to the Office of University Admissions. Finances and employment Loma Linda University requires accepted international applicants to pay an advan ce international student deposit. This deposit is refundable, less any courier/mailing fees, under the following circumstances: 1) during the student's last quarter of enrollment at Loma Linda University, 2) when a visa is denied by a U.S. embassy or consulate, or 3) when a student terminates his/her program. United States immigration regulations require a prospective student to document his/her financial resources for tuition, fees, and living expenses. For international students, on-campus employm ent is allowed but limited by visa regulations (e.g., for F-1 and J-1 students, employment is limited to a maximum of twenty hours per week while school is in session). Scholarships, assistantships, and living stipends are rarely ava ilable at Loma Linda University because it is a small, private university (i.e., not supported by the U.S. or California state government but rather is church sponsored). Employment plans require approval by a designated school official (DSO) in International Student and Scholar Services. VISAS F-1 student visas Loma Linda University is authorized by the United States De partment of Homeland Security to issue F-visa applications (i.e., I-20 forms). The F-1 student visa is the visa of choice for most international students coming to Loma Linda University. This visa allows some nondegree study (e.g., certificates, preceptorships, a nd English-as-a-second-language studies). Degree-earning students are subject to study-load requirements and are allowed limited on-campus employment. The I-20 is issued after a student: 1. has been accepted into a program and o fficial transcripts (mark sheets) have been received by the University, 2. has paid the advance deposit, and 3. has documented his/her financial plan for the chosen program. International Student and Scholar Services can be contacted at 909/558-4955 for further information regarding F-1 student visas and the regulations governing these visas. J-visa exchange program Loma Linda University has an Exchange Visitor Program that is approved by the U.S. Department of State. This J-visa exchange program is authorized to sponsor/host degree-earning students, nondegree (continuing education) students, short- term scholars, visiting professors, and research scholars. The J-visa form, DS-2019, is issued after an exchange visitor has been accepted into a program, scholar position, or professor position; and has documented his/her fina ncial plan (including health insurance for J-1 and J-2 dependents). ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY 51 Loma Linda University also hosts exchange visitors who are sponsored by other organizations (e.g., Fulbright scholars). As a hosting institution, Loma Linda University has limited authority over an exchange visitor sin ce the authority resides in the sponsoring organization. Under current exchange visitor regulations, J-2 dependents are allowed to enroll part or full time at Loma Linda University. Also, their credits earned can be eith er degree or nondegree applicable. J-1 exchange visitors are allowed to work; but employment guid elines differ, depending on th e exchange category. Contact International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955 for further information and regulations governing the Exchange Visitor Program. Other visas Internationals may enter the U.S. on a wide variety of visas. However, a visa may have to be changed before a student can commence academic studies at this University. For further information regarding regulations and study options for specific visa types, contact International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. Transfer students International students currently attending other schools in the United States who have either an I-20 or a DS-2019 and who wish to attend Loma Linda University must do a school-to-sch ool transfer. The timing of a tran sfer is critical in order to maintain visa status; therefore, it is im portant to consult with an international adviser as soon as the acceptance letter is received. Study load Both the F- and J-student-visa regulations require the successful completion of a full study load during each quarter of each academic year (as defined by each program). A minimum of 12 units per quarter is usually considered full time for an undergraduate program; 8 units per quarter is considered full time for a graduate program. In any quarter in which there will be a reduced study load, prior approval is needed from an international student adviser in International Student and Scholar Services. 52 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Division of General Studies GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS The Division of General Studies offers general education courses that contribute to the fulfillment of requirements that apply to the Bachelor of Science degree programs in the Sc hools of Allied Health Professi ons, Dentistry, Nursing, and Public Health. In addition, these schools offer a variety of general education courses that are open to students across all schools. The Division of General Studies also provides oversight for courses that may be selected to enrich a student's academic experience but which do no t fulfill Loma Linda University general education requirements. LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY PHILOSOPHY OF GENERAL EDUCATION As a Seventh-day Adventist health-sciences institution, Loma Linda University seeks to exemplify a life of service and sensitivity beyond the requirements of academ ic excellence within a professional discip line. With its rich spiritual heritage, the University places special emphasis on educating its st udents for a life of service in a global community. General education at Loma Linda University consists of co urses, lectures, programs, and activities coordinated with the intent to integrate faith and learning. In addition to the basics of cultural heritage and di versity, scientific inquiry and analysis, communication, and wellness, the curriculum emphasizes the University's spiritual heritage; as well as moral and ethical decision making that is grounded in Christian principles. Thus, a general education is considered to be the cornerstone upon which students begin cultivating their abilities to: 1. Understand the fundamental Christian principles and Adventist heritage that undergird Loma Linda University. 2. Make informed moral and ethical decisions. 3. Incorporate critical-thinking skills into personal and professional experience. 4. Value individuals with diverse capabilities and ideological, ethnic, gender, and generational perspectives. 5. Communicate effectively. 6. Undertake scientific inquiry and analysis. 7. Appreciate the contributions of the arts and humanities to society. 8. Examine the historical basis of the health-sciences professions. 9. Develop self-awareness through balance of mental, physical, social, and spiritual aspects of daily living. 10. Model servant-leadership in health care as exemplified by Jesus of Nazareth. The Loma Linda University philosophy of general education creates a unique learning environment committed to the concept of human wholeness. Faculty are se lected who embrace the spirit as well as the specifics of general education and who purpose to extend its goals into all aspects of univer sity life\u2014from the residence hall programs to the core of professional studies\u2014thus adding an invisible curriculum to the re quired course offerings. It is this spirit in tandem with the specifics of a liberal arts education that inspires students to achieve academic excellence, value diversity, pursue lifelong learning, and live to bless others.

Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook. Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. FROM UNIVERSITY TO STUDENT Loma Linda University was established to provide education in a distinctively Christian environment. Students are expected to respect the standards and ideal s of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Prospective students have the freedom to choose or reject University or school standards, but the decision must be made before enrollment. Application to and enrollment in Loma Linda University constitute the student's commitment to honor and abide by the academic and social practices and regulations stated in anno uncements, bulletins, handbooks, and other published materials; and to maintain a manner that is mature and compatible with the Univer sity's function as an institution of higher learning. It is inevitable that the student will come under question if academic performance is below standard; student duties are neglected; social conduct is unbecoming; or attitudes demonstrat e deficiencies such as poor judgment, moral inadequacy, or other forms of immaturity. ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY 67 Procedures for evaluation of academic and nonacademic performa nce\u2014as well as for the student to exercise his/her right of appeal\u2014are described in the current CATALOG and in each school's section of the Student Handbook. Grievances regarding both academic and nonacademic matters must be processed according to these p ublished grievance procedures. After a student files an appeal or grieva nce, the faculty assesses the student's fitn ess for a career in the chosen profession and recommends to the dean appropriate action regarding the student's continuance or discontinuance. Prospective students who have questions co ncerning the University's expectations sh ould seek specific information prior to enrollment. WHOLE-PERSON HEALTH The University regards the student from a cosmopolitan and comprehensive point of view. It is cosmopolitan in that historically the University's global mission has promoted bond s and opportunities in education and service without regard to gender, or to national, racial, or geographical origin. It is comprehensive in that the University's concern for the welfare of the student traditionally has been an integrated concern for assisting the student toward whole-person health\u2014balanced development of spiritual, social, physical, and mental health. Cultivating the health of any one part enhances the health of all parts. Neglecting or abusing the health of one harms the health of all. Before one can experience whole-person health, there must be a practical appreciation of the interd ependent interaction of each part of the whole. Students from all schools of Loma Linda University may co ngregate and participate in th e multifaceted programs offered that involve the wholistic concept of social, intellectual, physical, emotional, and spiritual wellness. These programs support Loma Linda University's motto, \"To make man whole.\" Spiritual health In addition to personal quiet times, opportunities for the stud ent to further develop rich, personal spiritual resources are provided in scheduled religious exercises and activities and in in formal association with others who cherish spiritual values. Religion classes as well as weekly chapel se rvices are part of the required curriculum. Social health Situated within easy access of the ocean, mountains, and de sert, the University provides numerous opportunities for students to complement their formal learning through participation in a wide variety of recreational, cultural, and other activities. A variety of University-, school-, and group-sponso red events encourages students to relax and become better acquainted with one another. Through these activities and events, students can enrich their group interaction and leadership experiences, increase their enjoyment of an d interest in fields outside their profession, develop their talents, enhance wholesome and memorable association with others, and cultivate supportive and lifelong social relationships. Mental health The University promotes mental health by encouraging students to study and practice principles of sound psychological health and to access state-of-the-art counseling and mental health services, as needed. Physical health The University promotes physical fitness by encouraging recreational interests and by providing courses in field exercises, body building, and health instruction. An effort is exerted to interest each student in some recreational and health-building activity that may be carried over to enhance future life.

Student Health Service pr ovides free service to students who are enrolled in the Student Health Plan. Full-time students are enrolled automatically. Part-time students must buy in. The plan includes the following benefits: Student Health Service, 24-hour coverage, and generous coverage through preferred providers. The Student Health Plan provides a broad range of medical coverage but does not provide dental or vision coverage. Student Health Service Professional services are rendered by the St udent Health Service, which provides basi c care to students. The Student Health Service is located in the Center for Health Promotion in Evan s Hall, corner of Stewart and An derson streets. The hours are Monday through Thursday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.; Friday, 8 a.m.-2 p.m. Services are free to students. Supplementary medical- coverage policy The Student Health Plan is an \"excess\" policy and only supplements other medical plans that provide benefits to the student. The student first obtains direct-provider payment, or reimbursement for out-of-pocket payments, from all other medical plans that provide benefits for the student; only then does the student submit bills to the Student Health Plan for any remaining balance not covered by the other plans. The student must, therefore, follow all rules of his/her primary insurance in obtaining medical treatment. The student should c ontact the primary carrier to determine what procedure to follow. Eligibility The Student Health Plan automatically covers all full-time students at Loma Linda University in any clinical or academic program. Students are covered when enrolled for 7 units or more per quarter (or clock-hour equivalent, as defined by each school) for which Loma Linda University is receiving tuition and applicable fees (e xcluding load validation, \"in progress\" [IP] units, \"employee tuition and \"audit\" units). Students enrolled for field practicum are eligible for coverage if registered for at least 240 hours per quarter. Coverage during clinicals/rotations Students who are accidentally injured while performing their clinical rotation duties do not have to pay their co-payment. If a covered student is doing a school-sponsored clinical or rotation out of the area and becomes ill or injured, any health service and medical care received that is covered by the Student Health Plan will still be covere d as if the student were in the Loma Linda area. Effective coverage date An eligible student's coverage becomes effective on the day of orientation or the first day of class. Any purchased benefits will become effective on the day Risk Management receives the health plan application and paym ent within the open enrollment period, which is only the first two weeks of each calendar quarter. Buy-in rules and deadlines Eligible students are themselves automatically covered by th e plan; however, noneligible students\u2014those on summer break and part-time students (e.g., in a clinical program but enrolled for fewer than 7 paid units)\u2014may, if they wish, purchase coverage at the Department of Office of Risk Management. Those wishing to buy in may enroll in the Student Health Plan only during the first tw o weeks of each new calendar quarter, that is, during the first two week s of January, April, July, and October. For further information about eligibility, the student may refer to the Student Health Plan booklet or call Risk Management. Buy-in rates per quarter For current quarterly buy-in rules, please contact Risk Management. Student responsibility for payment Neither the Office of Student Finance nor Risk Management bills the student's account or sends out reminders. Funds received for buy-in coverage must be in the form of a check or money order (payable to Risk Management). Coverage exclusion for \"pre-existing\" condition If a student or patient has not maintained a continuous \"creditable coverage\" under another health plan during the twelve months prior to the coverage-effective date, the pre- existing-condition exclusion that follows will apply. This plan will not cover any medical condition, illness, or inju ry for which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received by the student or patient during the six months prior to the effective date of health plan ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY 69 coverage. This exclusion will apply for twelve months from the student's coverage-effective date , unless such an individual remains treatment free during the six-month term beginning with the effective date of coverage. If the individual remains treatment free during the six-month term, the pre-existing-cond ition exclusion will apply only during that six-month period. This exclusion will not apply to pregnancy-related medical e xpenses or to medical treatment for a newborn or adopted child. For additional information, the student may contact Risk Management.

GOVERNING PRACTICES At Loma Linda University, nonacademic policies have been esta blished that help foster a fulfilling University experience. Students are expected to uphold these policies, which govern nonacademic student life on and off campus. Information in this section of the CATALOG, as well as in Section III and in the Student Handbook pertains to requirements governing all students. The student is reminded of individual responsibility to be fully informed of the general and specific requirements of his/her school and program. Identification number and card All accepted students will be assigned a unique University identification number. This seven-digit number will be used on all correspondence and noted on all payments to the University . A University identification ca rd using this identification number and a bar code will be issued to each student after s/he completes initial registration and financial clearance. The identification card allows access to various student servi ces, including the libraries, St udent Health, recreation faciliti es (i.e., the Drayson Center), pa rking, etc. Also, the bar code on the card a llows currently enrolled and financially cleared students to charge against their accounts at the Campus B ookstore and campus cafeterias, and for ticket sales available through the Student Services office. In subsequent quarters, the card's bar code is automatically reactivated at each registration with financial clearance. In some cases, a second identification card is necessary for students on clinical rotation in the Loma Linda University medical centers. This card is issued by Loma Linda University's Human Resource Management office and is valid only for medical center-related activities and does not replace the student identification card. For further information regarding these identification cards, please contact Student Services. Residence hall The University is coeducational and accepts both single and married students. Any single student wh o prefers to live on campus may do so. Students are expected to live on campus unless they are: married, twenty-one years of age or older, in a graduate program, or living with their parents. Students who wish to live off campus but who do not meet on e of the foregoing requirements may petition the associate vice chancellor for student services for an exception. This should be done well in advance of registration to allow the student adequate time to plan. Additional information about campus housing can be obtained from the housing Web site at <www.llu.edu/llu/housing>. The student must keep the Office of the Dean of the school informed of his or her current address and telephone number and other contact numbers. Marriage A student who marries or changes marital status during the academic year must provide the school with advance written notification of the change in status in order to keep school records correct and up to date. Students should make every effort to schedule their wedding cerem onies during academic recesses. Name change Currently enrolled students may change their names on University records when they provide evidence (e.g., certified copy of a marriage certificate) that the name change is official. In addition to filing a Request for Change of Name on University Records form with the Office of University Records, the student must present a current ID card or other form of picture ID with his or her name as it appears on University records, along with official documentation of the name change. Name changes must be processed no later than six months prior to graduation if the new name is to appear on the diploma. ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY 71 Professional apparel Clinic and laboratory apparel are distinctive articles of dress sp ecified by the department or school and are to be worn only in the manner prescribed and under the conditions specified in the school or department dress code. Student uniforms are to be maintained in clean, presentable condition. Information on th e required professional dress is provided in section III of this CATALOG and in the University Student Handbook. Personal appearance Students in the classroom or clinical environment must exhibit personal grooming consistent with expectations of the health care institution, the profession, the schoo l, and the University. Specific guide lines regarding grooming and attire are provided in Section III of this CATALOG and in the University Student Handbook. Personal property The School assumes no responsibility for the loss of the student's personal property, instruments, or other items by theft, fire, or unknown causes. The student is expected to assume responsibility for the safekeeping of personal belongings. Cars and transportation Because the student is responsible for transportation arrangemen ts and costs for special projects and off-campus clinics, it is advantageous for the student to have access to a car. All vehicl es used to transport fellow stude nts to University- or school- sponsored off-campus assignments or activities must be registered with the Loma Linda University Department of Security and must have adequate public liability insurance\u2014a minimum of $100,000 bodily injury and property damage liability. The University enforces traffic rules and re gulations as provided for by the State of California Vehicle Code. It is the sole responsibility of the driver of any vehicle on University property to become familiar with these regulations. Drivers are held responsible for any infraction of the regulations. Copies of the brochure entitled \"Loma Linda University Traffic and Parking Regulations\" are available at the Department of Security. Vehicles used by students on campus must be registered with the Department of Security. Returning students must go to the Department of Security annually in September to renew registration. Confidentiality The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 requires that all health care professionals maintain the highest level of confidentiality in matters pertaini ng to clients. Discussions or written assignments relating to client information, either health related or personal, may not include identifying data. Clients' privacy and rights are to be protected. Failure to maintain confidentiality could result in legal ac tion. For additional informatio n, see \"What is HIPAA\" at <http://wisdom.mc.llumc.edu/hipaa/education/ whatishipaa.htm>. Substance abuse As a practical application of its motto, \"To make man whole,\" Loma Linda University is committed to providing a learning environment conducive to the fullest possi ble human development. Because the Univ ersity holds that a lifestyle free of alcohol, tobacco, and recreational/illegal drugs is essential for achieving this goal, it maintains policies that foster a camp us environment free of these substances. All students are expected to refrain from substance abuse while enrolled at the University. Substance abuse is considered to be any use of tobacco, alcohol, and/or other recreational or illegal drugs; any use of a nonprescription mood-altering substance that impairs the appropriate functioning of the stude nt; or any misuse of a prescription or nonprescription drug. Also, possession of an illegal drug may be cause for dismissal. The University offers counseling and other redemptive programs to assist in the recovery from substance abuse. Continuation as a student with the University will be depend ent upon the abuser appropriately utilizing these programs. Failure to comply with these policies will result in discipline up to and including expulsion and, if appropriate, notification of law-enforcement agencies for prosecution. For details regarding the University's drug-free environmen t--as well as information regarding prevention, detection, treatment, relapse prevention, confidentia lity, and discipline\u2014see the Loma Linda University Student Handbook, Section V, University Polic ies: Alcohol, controlled su bstances, and tobacco policy. Sexual harassment Sexual harassment is reprehensible and will not be tolerated by the University. It subverts the mission of the University and threatens the well-being, educational experience, and careers of students, faculty, employees, and patients. 72 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Because of the sensitive nature of situa tions involving sexual harassment and to assure speedy and confidential resolution of these issues, students should contact one of the school's designated, trained sexual harassment ombudspersons. A more comprehensive statement of the policy regarding \"Sexual harassment\" and \"Sexual standards policy\" can be found in the Loma Linda University Student Handbook, Section V, University Policies. Employment It is recommended that students limit work obligations (outside employment for income) that divert time, attention, and strength from the arduous tasks of class preparation, clinical practice, and/or tr aining in their chosen career. A student wishing to work during the school year should consult the Office of the Dean regarding employment restrictions or prohibitions. Employment for international students International students must obtain written authorization from Interna tional Student and Scholar Services before accepting any on-campus employment. Off-campus employment requires prio r issue of a work permit by the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. F- and J-visa students must limit their employment to twenty hours or less per week while registered for courses and while classes ar e in session during three of four quarter s in an academic year. Regulations allow full-time work (forty hours or less per week) during school breaks and summer vacations (if students' programs allow summer quarters off). For questions, please telephone International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. ACADEMIC AUTHORITY The Office of the Dean is the final author ity in all academic matters, with the excep tion of General Education requirements, and is charged with the interpretation an d enforcement of academic requirements. Any exceptions or changes in academic requirements, graduation requirements, or grades are not valid unless approved by the dean. Any actions taken by individual faculty members with regard to these matters are advisory only and are not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY The academically dishonest act considers that academic dishonesty intentionally violates the community of trust upon which all learning is based, intentionally compromises the orderly transfer of kn owledge from teacher to student, and is inconsistent with good professional and moral behavior. Accordingly, the penalty for academic dishonesty is severe. Acts of dishonesty include but are not limited to: theft; falsifying or changing grades or other academic records; plagiarism or excessive paraphrasing of someone else's work; knowingly giving, obtaining, or falsifying information during examinations or other academic or professional practice assignments; using unauthorized aids during examinations; loud and disruptive behavior during lectures, demonstrations, or examinations; excessive unexcused absences from cl asses or from clinical assignments \"Examinations\" are defined as regularly scheduled tests, quizzes (scheduled or unscheduled), final examinations, comprehensive assessments, take-home tests, open-book tests, and any other assignment given by an instructor or preceptor whether for a grade, points toward a grade, or for zero points (e.g., a learning exercise). Instructors and students are responsible fo r reporting instances of academic dishonesty for investigation. An instructor may take immediate action during an examination or other point-generating activity in order to maintain the integrity of the academic process. Substantiated violations are to be br ought before the designated disciplinary body for action. Disciplinary action may include receiving a failing grade on the examination or assi gnment, receiving a failing grade in the course, suspension, or permanent dismissal from the program. CONDUCT Students are expected to conduct themselv es in a professional manner during didac tic and clinical training. Professional conduct includes (but is not limited to) punctuality; and respect for other people, their property, and their right to learn. It also includes an appropriate respect for those in authority. Students of Loma Linda University are expected to behave in a manner that will not bring criticism upon themselves , the program, the school, or the University. Because students may be exposed to patients' relatives and frien ds in any public place, and b ecause their conversations and their attitudes have an effect on those around them, students are asked to observe the following: ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY 73 Any information given to the student by a patient or containe d in a medical record must be held in strict confidence. Therefore, the discussion of a patient's diagnosis and treatment and other clinically related topics should be extremely guarded. A patient's family and community people may be listening and may incorrectly interpret the things discussed. Careless talk may lead to malpractice litigation. A joking or casual attitude toward illness and medical treatment should not be displayed since it may seem uncaring and be disturbing to those who are ill and suffe ring, as well as to the family members. Student and staff behavior in professional situations may be the deciding influence for or against Christian beliefs, values, and a health-enhancing lifestyle. An in-depth description of the professional conduct expected of students is contained in the Loma Linda University Student Handbook. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE Grievances related to sexual harassment, racial harassment, or discrimination against the disabled shall be pursued in accordance with University policies specifically relating to these items. Gr ievances related to academic matters or other issues covered by specific policies shall be made pursuant to the policies of the school in wh ich the student is enrolled. A student who questions whether the process provided by the school has followed the policy of the school in regard to his/her grievance may request the office of the chancellor to conduct a review of the process used by the school in responding to his/her academic grievance. Students who believe that an error has been made or that they have been dealt with in an inappropriate manner by an office or nonacademic department of the University such as records, student finance, st udent affairs, health services, Drayson Center, etc., may seek correct ion by the following steps: 1. The student may put his/her complaint in writing and provide it to the head of the department or office involved. The student may request an appointment and discuss this matter with the department head. The department head will make a decision and provide a written answer to the st udent within 14 days of r eceiving the student's written complaint or meeting with the student, whichever is later. If the answer is not satisfactory to the student, s/he may: 2. Put the complaint in writing and send it to the dean of student affairs for review. The matter will be considered at the next meeting of the dean's council and the student w ill be informed in writing of the council's response within seven days of the council's co nsideration of the complaint. COPYRIGHT VIOLATIONS The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, USC) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted material. Under certain conditions specified in th e law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. One of these specific conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be \"used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research.\" If a user makes a request for or later uses a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of \"fair use,\" that user may be liable for copyright infringement. This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its judgment, fulf illment of the order would involve violation of copyright law. COMMUNICATION DEVICES All communication devices must be set to \"off\" or \"vibrate\" du ring class, laboratory, clinic, or chapel. No cell phones, PDAs, calculators, laptops, or other electronic or communication items may be used in the classroom, testing facility, or laboratory unless specifically a part of that activity and approved by the faculty member in charge. 74 UNIVERSITY CATALOG ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY 75 Academic Policies and Information Students of the University are responsible for informing themse lves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. In this secti on (Section II) are the University regulations. See Section III fo r regulations that pertain to each school and program. REGISTRATION Registration dates are published on the Web at <www.llu.edu/registration>. Posted deadlines for registration and change of registration are in effect and binding. The sc hool will not intercede to obtain a variance. After consultation with their academic adviser, students regist er online. Registration procedur e includes entering classes online, clearing financial arrangements with the Office of Student Finance, and having a student-identification picture taken for the ID card first-quarter registration only). Students are advised to print the Request for Clearance Submitted Web page to retain written documentation that they have requested financial clearance. A late-registration period of at least a week prior to the beginning of the quarter and extending to five days after the quarte r begins is provided, during which a late-registration fee of $5 0 will be charged. (Always check the Web for specific dates of registration, since they vary during some quarters due to ho liday schedules.) Students may not attend class without being registered, and in no case may registration take place later th an the seventh calendar day of a term unless the course is offered as an intensive that requires regi stration before the end of the first day of class. No credit is granted for academic work performed during any quarter without registration. Change in registration A change in registration requires filing a Registration Change Request (Add/Drop) form with the Office of University Records. Students receive written verifica tion each time a change of program is officially approved. Students are advised to retain this written verification as documentation of their regist ration. Changes in registration after the second week affect the student's grade record. Course changes A student may add courses that follow the general University calendar during the first seven calendar days of the quarter. Courses that follow the general University calendar may be dropped during the first fourteen days of the quarter without academic or financial penalty. Course changes after the fourteen th day of the quarter affect the permanent grade record. A Change of Program form must be filed. Students may withdraw from a course prior to the fourteen calendar days before the final examination week, after which time withdrawals are no longer permitted. Study load Usually an academic study load is defined in terms of credit un its. A full undergraduate load is considered to be 12 or more units per quarter; a full graduate load is considered to be 8 units per quarter. Professional programs, however, require considerable clinical experien ce, for which only partial academ ic credit is given at times. Consequently, a full study load often is not reflected by the number of academic credit units carried. To be considered a full-time student, an undergraduate student must be registered for at least 12 units of course work per quarter; and a graduate student must be registered for at least 8 units. A registration of 400 clock hours per quarter is also considered to be full time for any student. This is based on forty hours per week for a ten-week quarter. The normal course load, including all course work for which a student may be registered at this or another institution, is 16 quarter units for an undergraduate student and 12 quarter units for a graduate student. Full-time study loads are those specified by the departments for each prog ram. Students of exceptional ability may register for additional course work upon recommendation of the department and consent of the dean. Non-LLU courses as part of total load for financial aid Regular courses for which a student is registered at another fi nancial-aid eligible institution constitute part of the student' s study load. Courses must be transferable and required for completion of the student's Loma Linda University degree program. Correspondence and independent study courses are excluded, per federal-aid regulations. Only when the student enrolls in such courses usin g the Consortium Agreement form (from the Office of Financial Aid) will the course(s) count on the student's total load as eligible for financial-aid and loan-deferment purposes. A person who is not enrolled in regular classes but who is occupi ed in research, dissertation, or thesis, is classified as a student. By filing an Academic Load Validation form every quar ter at registration, the academic load may be validated for loan deferment. 76 UNIVERSITY CATALOG BACKGROUND CHECK Some clinical affiliation sites require background checks for all incoming students; these checks must be completed no later than two weeks prior to clinical placemen t. The student will be responsible for obtaining the background checks, including the cost. The following elements must be covered by the check, at a mi nimum: past 7 years, 3 counties, Office of Inspector General (OIG), Social Security number, other names (maiden, married, etc.), addresses, and sex-offender database. STUDENT LEVEL Students enrolled in a professional program in which they are cl assified as freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior will be classified according to the level of the course work they are taking (e.g., a stude nt with a previous baccalaureate degree pursuing another baccalaureate de gree would be classified as a sophomore wh ile taking sophomore-level courses, etc.). Students enrolled in block programs are classified according to the level of the block in which they are enrolled (e.g., master's-1st, 2nd, or 3rd year; or freshman, sophomore, junior , senior, as is appropriate for the degree program; or PY1 [professional year 1]). 901-999, continuing educatio n\u2014without academic credit. 500-level course work may not apply toward a baccalaureate de gree unless the instructor approves it, and both deans (dean of the school offering the course and dean of the school in which the student is enrolled) give permission; and provided the credit does not apply toward both an undergraduate and a graduate degree. Approval is not needed if the course is part of a coordinated program. No courses numbered in the 700s, 800s, or 900s may apply toward a baccalaureate degree. UNIT OF CREDIT Credit is recorded in quarter units. One un it represents 10-11 class hours in lecture or 30-40 hours in laboratory practice. ATTENDANCE Regular attendance at all appointments (class, clinic, laborato ry, chapel) is required beginning with the first day of each term. A pattern of absence, excused and unexcused, will be referred to the school's design ated academic authority for consideration and action. Excused absences are defined as follows: Illness, verified by a physician's st atement or official statem ent from Student Health Service submitted to the school's designated academic authority; Participation in an institution-sponsored activity (ver ified by a written statement from a faculty sponsor); Recognizable emergency approved by the school's designated academic authority. Tardiness is disruptive, distracting, and inconsistent with professional behavior. Students who arrive after the beginning of class may be counted absent. Information regarding the school's designated academic authority can be obtained from the Office of the Dean. CLEP The College Level Examination Program (CLEP), a national progra m of credit by examination, offers persons of all ages and backgrounds new opportunities to obtain recognition for college-level achievement, no matter how acquired. As of July 2001, general examinations are no longer offered; however, the policy remains in effect for students who took general examinations prior to that date. No credit is granted for the CLEP general examinations in English composition, mathematics, or science courses requiring a laboratory. ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY 77 As of July 1, 2004, in order to receive Loma Linda Univers ity credit, students must comple te all examinations for CLEP credit within six months after having r eceived their initial degree-compliance report . A student will be allowed to challenge a given course by examination only once. CLEP scores will be accepted at C or better until percentiles are available from CLEP. Credit is granted for scor es at or above the 50th percentile for the subject examinations, and at the 65th percentile for general examinations in the humanities, na tural sciences, and social sciences/history. CREDIT BY EXAMINATION For certain courses offered by the University, a student in an undergraduate degree program may earn credit by passing an equivalency examination administered by the appropriate school and department. Such an examination is at least equal in scope and difficulty to a final examination in the course a nd may include materials supplied by CLEP or other agencies. A graduate program should be used to acquire new knowledge. Since the purpose of credit by examination is to validate prior knowledge, graduate credit may not be earned by examination. If a required course in the degree program is a repeat of prior learning, the student may request a waiver, thus making it possible to take elective courses that would increase knowledge. A student currently enrolled in a degree program at this Un iversity who desires credit by equivalency examination petitions the dean of the school offering the course, and, upon approval, pays a testing fee. See Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section for examination fee. Equivalency examinations may not duplicate credit already earned through course work, including courses taken for audit. A grade of CR (Credit) is given only after the student has completed one quarter, or the equivalent, at this University; and has earned 12 units of credit with a grade-point average of at leas t 2.0 in undergraduate courses. Units earned by equivalency may not be used as part of the enrolled load. Equivalency examinations must be taken before the final quarter of residency. The maximum amount of credit that may be earned by equivalency examination is determined by each school but may not exceed a maximum of 20 percent of the units required for the degree or certificate. COURSE WAIVER Certain course requirements in a program may be waived on the basis of previously completed course work, experience, or licensure. An examination for waiver credit, if required, may be taken only once and must be taken before the last quarter of the program of study. Waiver of a specific course requirement does not reduce the number of units required for a program or residency requirements. A waiver examination does not carry academic credit and cannot be used to make up for a course in which an unsatisfactory grade was received. Fo r examination fee, see Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section. Permission to waive a course requirement in the School of Pharmacy requires prior approval of the department chair and consent of the dean. INDEPENDENT STUDY Independent study may be undertaken subject to the consent of the department chair and/or the Office of the Dean. The student is responsible for completion of the Directed/Indepen dent Study Title Request form in addition to the regular registration. University policy limits directed study to 12 quar ter units of undergraduate credit and 8 units of graduate credi t in a degree program. Individual programs may further limit these units. The Office of the Dean should be consulted regarding limits on credit earned through independent study. In dependent study is to be completed in adequate time before graduation to allow recording in the Office of University Records. CORRESPONDENCE COURSE As a general rule, the student may not register for a corres pondence course that duplicates a course offered at this University. (The School of Nursing makes exceptions when a relig ion or cognate course conflicts with a clinical course; or when scheduling prevents a student from completing a religion or cognate course during the summer in order to reduce the course load during the regular school year.) If the student is a candidate for graduation, the course must be completed no later than one month before graduation. Information and application for Griggs University Home Study International (the Seventh-day Adventist correspondence school) in Washington, DC, may be obtained from the Web at < www.griggs.edu >. In the School of Pharmacy, permission to take a correspondence course for credit requires both prior approval of the department chair and consent of the dean. 78 UNIVERSITY CATALOG EXTENSION STUDY To be acceptable for credit, an extension course must be eval uated as to its equivalence to an accepted course. To assure that the course will transfer to Loma Li nda University, the student should contact the Office of University Records prior to taking the course. Registration for extension study requires prior approval of the department chair and consent of the dean. SCHOLASTIC STANDING Grades and grade points The following grades and grade points are used in this University. Each course taught in the schools has been approved for either a letter grade and/or an S/U grade. A 4.0 Outstanding performance. A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 Very good performance for undergraduate credit; Satisfactory performance for graduate credit. B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C 2.0 Satisfactory performance for undergraduate credit.

This is done by the student's filing with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to fourteen calendar days before the final examination week. Once filed, the grade is not subject to change. U none Unsatisfactory performance\u2014given only when performance for an S-specified course falls below a C grade level in an undergraduate course or a B grade level in a graduate course. Similar filing procedures as given for S grade above are require d. The U grade is not computed in the grade- point average. S/N none Satisfactory performance in a clock-hour course. Not included in total units. Same grading criteria as the S grade given for a credit-hour course. U/N none Unsatisfactory performance in a clock-hour course. Not included in total units. Same grading criteria as the U grade given for a credit-hour course. CR none Credit for Credit by Examination. Counted towa rd graduation/units earned but not units attempted. Such credit cannot be counted for financial aid purposes. NC none No credit for Credit by Examina tion. Does not count for any purpose. ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY 79 W Withdrawal\u2014given for withdrawal from a course prior to fourteen calendar days before the final examination week. Withdrawals duri ng the first fourteen calendar days of a quarter or the first seven calendar days of a five-week summer session are not recorded if the student files with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to the cut-off date. Withdrawals outside this time frame, upon recommendation of the dean, may be removed at the discretion of the vice-chancellor for academic affa irs. In the case of nontraditionally scheduled courses, W will be given for with drawal from a course prior to completion of 80 percent of the course, excluding the final examination period. Withdrawals during the first 20 percent of a course, excluding the final examination pe riod, are not recorded if the st udent files with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to the date when this 20 percent of the course is completed. A student may withdraw only once from a named cognate course that s/he is failing at the time of withdrawal. UW Unofficial Withdrawal\u2014indicat es that the student discontinued cl ass attendance after the close of registration but failed to withdraw officially. I Incomplete\u2014given when the majority of the co urse work has been completed and circumstances beyond a student's control result in the student being unable to complete the quarter. An I notation may be changed to a grade only by the instructor before the end of the following term (excluding the summer sessions for those not in attendance during that term). Incomplete units are not calculated in the gr ade-point average. By use of the petition form\u2014available onlin e at <www.llu.edu/ss web/registration> \u2014the student requests an I notation from the instructor, stating the reason for the request and obtaining the signatures of the instructor, the depart ment chair, and the associate dean.

PRIVACY RIGHTS OF STUDENTS IN ACADEMIC RECORDS Under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), students have full rights of privacy with regard to their academic records, including their grade reports. Grades are available to the student onlin e at <www.llu.edu/ssweb>. The Office of University Records sends one copy of the student grade report to the school. The campus is authorized under FERPA to release \"directory inform ation\" concerning students. Such information may include a student's picture, name, telephone listing, month and day of birth, and major field of study. This information is subject to release at any time unless the campus has received pr ior written request from the student that such information not be released. GRADE CHANGE Faculty members are responsible for evaluating and assigning grades. A grade may not be changed except when an error has been made in arriving at or recording a grade. Such ch anges are permissible up to the end of the succeeding term. The faculty member must obtain the dean's signature on the Ch ange of Grade form after the initial grade has been entered. REPEATING A COURSE A student wishing to improve his/her grade once grades have been posted for a course must repeat the course. When repeating a course, the student must attend class and laboratory sessions as ordinarily required and take all regularly scheduled examinations. The amount of tuition paid for repeated courses is determined by the school. Both the original and the repeat grades will appear on the stud ent's permanent record, but only the repeat grade is computed in the G.P.A. and included in the total units earned. A student may repeat a course only once, and no more than two courses may be repeated in a student's degree program. PERSONAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE A leave of absence, which may be as short as one day but no longer than one year, is defined as being away from school for obligations other than personal health, which may or may not be school sponsored.

The Change of Program form or the Program Withdrawal form should be completed and submitte d on the last day of class attendance. Courses dropped during the first two weeks of the term are not included in the student's permanent record. If a student is discontinuing the entire program, the date the Program Withdrawal form is properly submitted to the Office of University Records will be the date of withdrawal used to calculate tuition refunds. Tuition is refunded according to the ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY 81 practice outlined in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG. Failure to file the Program Withdrawal form may result in avoidable charges to the student's account. The tuition-refund policy for off-campus students is listed under the applicable school in Sectio n III of this CATALOG.

Information regarding the period of inactivity allowed prior to administrative withdrawal can be obtained from the Office of the Dean. FACILITATING THE TRANSFER OF CURRENTLY REGISTERED STUDENTS The following steps apply to processing an application for a student who is currently registered at Loma Linda University: 1. The student submits application (online or paper) to a new program that is not part of a joint/combined-degree arrangement. 2. The Office of University Records prominently flags the transcript as being from a currently registered student. 3. The flagged University transcript is forwarded to new program for evaluation. 4. The new program contacts a designated person in the home school/program to obtain relevant information about the student without revealing that an application is under consideration. 5.

ADMISSIONS POLICIES AND INFORMATION The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committees of the school accomplis h this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant qualities of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. In selecting students, the Admissions Committee of th e School of Allied Health Professions looks for evidence of self-discipline, personal integrity, and in tellectual vigor. The committ ee also looks for evidence that students possess the capabilities required to complete the full curriculum in the allotted time and to achieve the levels of competence required. Acceptance of the applicant into any program is contingent on the recommendation of the department conducting the program. An interview with faculty is required by most progra ms. Loma Linda University was established to provide education in a distinctively Christian environment, and its students are expected to adopt Christian ethical and moral standards as a basis for their conduct. It must be understood further that, in harmony with the University's emphasis on health and the health prof essions and the practices of the supporting church, applicants who use tobacco, alcoholic beverages, or narcotics should not ex pect to be admitted. Loma Linda University is committed to equal opportunity and does not discriminate against qualified persons on the basis of handicap, gender, race, color, or national or ethnic origin in its educational and admissions policies, financial affairs, employment pr ograms, student life and serv ices, or any University- administered program. It does, however, retain the right to give preference in student admissions to qualified Seventh-day Adventist applicants. While this right is retained, it should be emphasized that admissions are not limited exclusively to Seventh-day Adventist applicants.

Academic probation Students whose cumulative G.P.A. at the end of any quarter is less than the minimum required by the school or program will be placed on academic prob ation, and the number of units for subsequent registrations will be restricted to a maximum determined by the school of program. A student on academic probation jeopardizes his or her standing in a degree or certificate program. 96 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Student Life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The most current Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and sch ool expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook. Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS Personal grooming Good taste indicates that haircuts, hairstyling, and pe rsonal grooming be neat, an d conservative rather than ostentatious.

Academic Policies and Information Students are responsible for informing themselves of the policies and regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation; and for sa tisfactorily meeting these requirements. ACADEMIC RESIDENCE In order to graduate from Loma Linda University with a bachelor's degree, a student must complete at least 32 of the last 48 units, or a minimum of 45 total units of course work, at this University. A minimum grade of C (2.0) or better is required for all B.S. and postbaccalaureate degrees. GRADUATION CEREMONIES Graduation events include formal ceremonies identified as conferring of degrees, awarding of diplomas, and recognition of candidates for degrees. Other related graduation events include the baccalaureate and vespers services. The conferring of degrees ceremony(i es) occurs at the close of the Spring Quarter and includes an academic procession, the fo rmal conferring of degrees by the president, and the presentation of diplomas by the dean of the school. Candidates who complete the requirements for degrees and certificates are invited, with families and friends, to attend and participate in these colorful events. SCHOOL OF ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS 97 To be eligible to participate in graduation events, candidates must have completed all requirements for the degree, including prerequisites and/or corequisites, as specified by the school. In certain degree programs, upon authorization of the dean, exceptions will be made for candidates who: Have only clinical experience requirements to co mplete and can project completion by the end of the calendar year; Can complete remaining degree requirements by the end of the Summer Quarter; or Are in a block program. The still in-progress cour se work may not exceed 8 units for graduate students or 12 units for undergraduate students, A student who completes the requirements for a degree or certificate (other than c linical experience) at the end of the Summer, Autumn, or Winter Quarter is invited to participate in the subsequent June commencement events. The official date of graduation on the diploma is ordinarily the last day of the term in which the requirements for a degree are completed. Superior academic performance and achievement in sc holarship and leadership are recognized in the printed graduation program for persons who complete their baccalaureate degree and who at the end of the quarter preceding their final term have acquired a cu mulative grade-point averag e for all college work (includes course work taken at other colleges/universities, except for remedial courses), as follows: 3.5 Graduation cum laude 3.8 Graduation magna cum laude 3.9 Graduation summa cum laude Although the official commen cement program indicates names of graduates who qualify for honors on the basis of their grade-point average as of the end of the quarter preceding their final term, the subsequently issued diploma and transcript may indicate graduation with honors if the student's final quarter's record has increased the grade-point aver age sufficiently to qualify for honors at that time. SCHOLASTIC STANDING Repeating a course A student who receives an unsatisfactory grade in a requ ired course and is required by the faculty to do additional work may request permission of the faculty to pursue one of the following plans. In either plan the student must register and pay the applicable tuition. 1. Review the course work under supervision and take a make-up examination (usually not given before a minimum of two weeks of study). A passing grade resulting from a repeat examination will be limited to a C (2.0). (See the Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG for the tuition rate for tutorial course work.) 2. Repeat the course, attend class and/or laboratory, and take the final course examination. Full tuition will be charged whether regular or occasional atte ndance is required. (See the Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG for the tuition rate.) A student who receives an unsatisfactory grade in a requ ired clinical-experience course and is required by the faculty to do additional work must reregister an d pay the applicable fee. (See the Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section of this CATALO G for the fee for repeat of clinical experience.) Both the original and rep eat grades are entered in the student's permanent academ ic record, but only the repeat grade is computed in th e grade-point average. A course may be repeated only one time. Promotion and probation Each student's record is reviewed quarterly by th e faculty. Promotion is contingent on satisfactory academic and professional performan ce and on factors related to aptitude , proficiency, and responsiveness to the established aims of the school and of the profession. As an indicatio n of satisfactory academic performance, the student is expected to ma intain the following grade-point average: 2.0 Associate and baccalau reate degree programs 2.5 Master's degree program 3.0 Doctoral degree program 98 UNIVERSITY CATALOG A student whose grade-point average in any term falls below the minimum required for the degree, or who receives in any professional or required course a grade less than a C (2.0), or whose clinical performance is unsatisfactory is automatically placed on academic probation. Continued enrollment is subject to the recommendation of the department. If continued enrollment is not recommended, the case is referred to the Administrative Council of the school for final action. If continued enrollment is recommended, the student will be required to institute a learning-assistance plan within the first two weeks of the following quarter and meet regularly scheduled appointments with the academic adviser. The learning-assistance plan should: identify the problem, id entify and list the goals, state the time frame, and include student and adviser signatures and date. A student who is on academic probation and fails to make the minimum required grade-point average the following quarter or fails to have an overall minimu m grade-point average after two quarters will have disqualified him-/herself from the program. Standard of student progress (time framework) After initial enrollment in a program, students must complete program requirements within the following timeframes: A.S. degree 3 years B.S. degree 5 years Master's degree 5 years Doctoral degree 7 years Allied Health Studies The Department of Allied Health Studies provides a va riety of administrative and support services to the school's academic departments, including: development, marketing, admissions, computer support and training, portfolio, and financial services.

Zappia A student who has an interest in science, an inve stigative mind that enjoys the challenge of solving problems quickly and accurately, and a desire to he lp others should consider a career as a clinical laboratory scientist. Clinical laboratory scientists examin e and analyze body fluids, tissues, and cells. They look for bacteria, parasites, or other microorganisms; analyze the chemical content of fluids; match blood for transfusions; and test for drug levels in the blood to show how a patient is responding to treatment. Clinical laboratory scientists perform complex chemical, biological, hematological, immunologic, microscopic, and bacteriologic tests. They use, maintain, and troubleshoot sophisticated laboratory equipment that is used to perform diagnostic tests. The clinical laboratory scientist possesses the scientific and diagnostic skills required for DNA and biomolecula r technology and genetic engineering applications, analyzes these test results, and discus ses them with the medical staff. CLINICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE-AH 115 Opportunities Employment of clinical laboratory workers is expected to parallel the growth of other health care occupations through the year 2010, particularly as the volume of laboratory tests increases with population growth and with the development of new technology. Employment opportunities are excellent, with current vacancy rates of 12 percent. The twen ty-first century is offering clinical laboratory scientists new avenues for test development, experimental design, administration, and education. Clinical laboratory scientists work in hospitals or similar medical facilities, clinical and reference laboratories, home-health diagnostics, transfusion services, physicians' o ffices, and private medical clinics. Employment is also available in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, health information systems, DNA-technology and genetic engineering corporations, research laboratories, federal government agencies, forensics and crime investigation, veterinary hospitals, U.S. Public Health Service facilities, areas of medical-product development, and in customer and patient education.

Wat Cytotechnology is a specialty within the broad field of clinical laboratory scie nce. The cytotechnologist, working under the direction of a pathologist, detects cell changes caused by different disease processes; and is able to differentiate between normal, atypical, and malignant cell changes. In recognizing microscopic abnormalities of cells and cellular patterns from various body sites, the cytotechnologist assists the pathologist in detecting cancer at its earliest and potentia lly most curable stage. As a result, physicians are able to diagnose and treat cancer long before discovering its existence by alternate methods. Opportunities Cytotechnologists work in hospitals, clinics, and independent pathology laboratories. The employment outlook for cytotechnologists is favorable, with the demand for trained workers exceeding the supply. Cytotechnologists can advance to supervisory positions , participate in research activities, or become teachers in the field. Advancement is based on experience, skill, and advanced education.

The data provide a basis for patient care, quality assurance, legal defense, reimbursement, risk management, accreditation, planning, and decision making. Health information management has assumed increased importance with the advent of prospective payment, corporate compliance, an d the electronic health record. A career in health information management is likely to appeal to a person who has organizational and leadership abilities and who is interested in and has aptitude for medical science, but whose talents are suited for participation other than physical involvement in human illness. The health information administrator (formerly known as medical record administrator) designs, develops, and maintains systems for storage, re trieval, and dissemination of information in accordance with federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. This person works with the medical staff and other health professionals in research, administrative studies, functions relative to health information, and patient-care evaluation. The health information administrator in a health care facility will provide management leadership in planning and organizing the department, motivating and evaluating employees, and providing in-service programs for departmental employees or other personnel in the facility. HEALTH INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION-AH 137 Opportunities While many health information administrators are empl oyed in various areas of acute-care facilities, others work in alternative-delivery health care systems, research facilities, quality assurance, software development companies, industrial establishments, government agencies, medical departments of insurance companies, accounting firms, or as consulta nts to skilled-nursing and other facilities. The multiplicity of new technologies, the advent of electronic health records, the demand for health information, the emphasis on evaluation of care, the surge in research, the emphasis on cost control, and other factors combine to require comprehensive knowledge and increased utilization of administrative talent and judgment.

Medical dosimetry is a very dynamic, exciting fiel d involving a combined knowledge of mathematics, physics, and the biological and medical sciences. Dosimetrists plan optimal isodose distributions and treatment-dose calculations for a vari ety of external beam as well as brachytherapy treatments. Medical dosimetrists must possess excellent analytical skills, an ability to critically evaluate data, and an aptitude for physics and mathematics. They must also be able to work closely as a team with physicists, physicians, radiation therapists, and other personnel. Due to a lack of training programs in medical dosimetr y throughout the United States, there is a shortage of medical dosimetrists in many areas of the country. This program will aim to provide a supply of well- trained dosimetrists who will be able to meet the need s of radiation oncology facilities in the local area and beyond. The program objectives Upon completion of the program, the graduate should be qualified to: 1. Demonstrate ability to accurately complete dosimetric calculations and procedures as they pertain to all aspects of treatment planning for external beam and brachytherapy. 2. Develop and define critical-thinking skills to enhance ability to analyze and compute dosimetric data as it relates to all aspects of radiation therapy treatment. 3. Exhibit professional behavior, which includes ab ility to communicate with other professionals and work well both individually and as a team member. 4. Manage patients in an empathetic manner and exhibit basic patient-care proficiencies. 5. Support the professional code of ethics and comply with the stated scope of practice. Admission\u2014educational background Students will either need to have: AART registration in radiation therapy technology with a minimum of two years postgraduate clinical experience or a baccalaureate degree in physic s from an accredited university. Program design The length of the program will depend on the entering qualifications. For ARRT candidates, the course will be four quarters in length. For B.S. degree ca ndidates, the program will be five quarters long. Instruction will be a mixture of lecture, laboratory, an d clinical work. Students will be exposed to a variety of different methodologies within dosimetry, including work with proton therapy treatment planning. All instruction will be conducted in the Radiation Medi cine Department of Loma Linda University Medical Center. The only exception to this will be a two week laboratory session in brac hytherapy at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center. The program faculty consists of physicists and dosimetrists who are extremely e xperienced in their field; many, in both photon and proton therapy treatment planning. MEDICAL DOSIMETRY-AH 145 Accreditation The American Association of Medical Dosimetrists (AAMD) strongly supports the concept of formal dosimetry training, which leads to board eligibility fo r the certificate in medical dosimetry (CMD). This qualification is considered to be the gold standard in dosimetry education.

Dietetics, a vital profession in the field of health promotion, focuses on the sciences of nutrition and management in feeding individuals and groups throughout the life cycle. The coordinated program in dietetics combines supervised professional practice with didactic curriculum to develop professional skills concurrently with cognitive and technical skills to enable the graduate to establish eligibility to become a registered dietitian. Admission to the program is based on a selective proces s. To be eligible for consideration, the applicant must meet the following criteria: completion of subject requirements, as indicated , at an accredited college or university; a 3.0 G.P.A. or above; an interv iew; a letter of application; and recommendations. Opportunities Dietetic practice is the application of principles derived from integrating knowledge of food, nutrition, biochemistry, physiology, business and management, journalism, behavioral and social sciences, and the arts to achieve and maintain health, prevent di sease, and facilitate recovery from illness. Members of the dietetics profession practice in a variety of environments, including hospitals and other health care facilities, schools and universities, government and community agencies, business, and industry. A growing number of dietitians are employed in physicians' offices, clinics, home-health care agencies, mass communication, and many other entrepreneurial roles. By successfully passing the registration examination fo r dietitians, practice opportu nities as a specialist in medical nutrition therapy, administrative dietetics, nutr ition education, community nut rition, or research are available. There is increased recognition of the importanc e of nutrition in the fields of medicine, dentistry, and health promotion\u2014with emphasis on fitness and optimal well-being. This indicates that the dietitian's scope of practice is steadily broadening. Medical nutrition therapy The registered dietitian in medical nutrition therapy ap plies the science of nutrition to the care of people through health promotion and disease prevention and uses medical-nutrition therapy in the treatment of disease. The effective dietitian must be aware of the cultural, social, ec onomic, aesthetic, and psychological factors that affect eating patterns. As a member of the patient-care team, the registered dietitian (RD) is responsible for assessing, implementing, and monitoring the nutritional care of patients. In addition, the RD may serve professionally as a nutrition practitioner in health care; a teacher in an educational institution; a research dietitian; or a nutrition consultant-educator in municipal, state, or federal departments of health. Administrative dietetics The registered dietitian (RD) in mana gement is accountable for the food-s ervice systems. In a health care institution, the RD is responsible for the effective functioning of food service from the standpoint of patients, administration, medical st aff, and personnel. The administrativ e RD may also teach; manage food systems in educational, public, or commercial facilities; serve as a consultant to health care or educational institutions; or enter the field of research. Community dietetitian Community registered dietitians practice in diverse settings, translating nutrition science into improved health status. Challenges may include forming partnerships with various organizations, mastering technology, enacting regulations and policies that protect and improve the public's health, and creatively managing scarce resources. Dietitians working in the community exhibit high-quality leadership and planning skills, and many create positions that are entrepreneurial as well as financially rewarding. THE PROGRAM The Nutrition and Dietetics Program is established to pr epare entry-level dietitians to join the profession and contribute to the wholeness of humankind. The gradua te is awarded the Bachelor of Science degree and is eligible to write the registration examination of the Commission on Dietetic Registration. The program is composed of didactic and supervised professional practice experiences in an environment of liberal arts education to prepare an educated graduate. Admission to the professional program at this University begins with the post-summer session of the sophomore year. Th e applicant will present at least two years of pre-154 UNIVERSITY CATALOG professional education from an accre dited college or university to meet the specific subject requirements for 2007-2008. The professional program of seven or eight quarters includes theory, laboratory, research, and clinical experiences. Ten weeks of clinical ex perience are scheduled at the end of the junior year and ten weeks during the Spring Quarter of the senior year. Stude nts participate as active me mbers of the nutrition-care team in multiple clinical settings. Administrative affiliation experiences involve decision-making assignments in volume-feeding operations.

Jackson* John Kerr Rebecca Larson LeRoy Nattress OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY-AH 159 Madge Oh Christine O'Hagan Annette Richardson Clarissa Saunders-Newton *ex officio The occupational therapist and occupational therapy assi stant work with persons who find it difficult to cope with psychological or physiological dysfunction. The primary concern of both therapist and assistant is to stimulate those changes in behavior patterns that will increase the patient's personal independence and ability to work within his/her cultural and personal milieu. To accomplish this goal, the occupational ther apist evaluates the patient; sets up treatment goals; and works together with the occupational therapy assistant in selecting tasks from the gamut of normal daily self-care activities, using them to assist the patient in gaining independent-living skills regardless of disability or handicap. Essential to the role of occupational therapy is an inte rest in the behavioral sciences and a concern for the individual's need to find proper adju stments to life's circumstances. A desi re to teach and a background or interest in medical science are beneficial. Those inclined to mechanical or scientific techniques are suited to helping patients develop their capacities for employment. Others find that they can use their interests in creative arts, crafts, music, and teach ing to work with disabled homemaker s, children, and retired persons. Opportunities Occupational therapists and occupational therapy assi stants practice in general hospitals, rehabilitation centers, pediatric or psychiatric clinics, schools, skilled-nursing facilities, home care, and outpatient community-centered programs (including hand-reha bilitation, work-evaluation, and adult day-care facilities).

RADIATION THERAPY TECHNOLOGY-AH 193 Radiation Therapy Technology\u2014AH (B.S., Certificate) CAROL DAVIS, Clinical Prog ram Director, Certificate Radiation therapy is a multifaceted career that combines working in a highly technical environment with the opportunity to work closely with patients and members of many other professions to provide a high standard of clinical care. Radiation therapy is the therapeutic application of ionizing radiation to malignant and benign conditions. The therapist is responsible fo r delivering the treatment, which is prescribed by a radiation oncologist; maintaining accurate treatment r ecords; and implementing quality-assurance plans. A radiation therapist must be detail oriented; able to work accurately under pressu re; and, most important, able to interact empathically with patients. Indi viduals who show initiative and are capable of critical thinking and problem solving make good radiation therapists. The job demand in this well-paying field is currently high. RADIATION THERAPY TECHNOLOGY\u2014B.S.

School Foundations HISTORY A small but determined group of dentists met during the summer of 1943 in Grand Ledge, Michigan. Their purpose was to form an organization that would serve as a catalyst, urging the Seventh-day Adventist Church to sponsor a dental school where young adults could learn the dental profession in an environment consistent with their religious beliefs. These men were the founders of the National Association of Seventh-day Adventist Dentists (NASDAD). Under the leadership of Dr. J. Russell Mitchell, the organizati on's first president, the goal of a Christian dental school began taking conceptual form. NASDAD expanded in membership and objectives through men such as Dr. C. C. Ray, who toured the country on his own time in search of fellow Seventh-day Adventist dentists who were willing to pursue NASDAD's goals. Dr. M. Webster Prince served as presid ent of NASDAD in 1948 and 1949. At a meeting in San Francisco in 1949, NASDAD members voted unanimously to support the dental school project. Later that year at a NASDAD session in Hinsdale, Illinois, the members pledged a strong financial base in support of their goals. The momentum of the effort became eviden t in the early 1950s. The General Confer ence of Seventh-day Adventists, under the guidance of President W. H. Branson, asked Dr. Prince to conduct a feasibility study. Official action was taken in 1951 to authorize establishment of the School of Dentistry as a unit of Loma Linda University's School of Medicine. Dr. Prince was selected as the first dean of the Schoo l of Dentistry. His leadership in organizing and eventually administering the new School of Dentistry was facilitated by his prior experience as pr esident of the Michigan Dental Association and as chair of SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY 225 the American Dental Association Council on Dental Education. Forty-two students comprised the inaugural class in the late fall of 1953. A dental hygiene curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science degree was developed in 1959 under the direction of Dr. Gerald A. Mitchell, chair of the Departme nt of Periodontics. Violet Bates became ch air of the new department, and the first class of ten dental hygienists graduated in 1961. In 1960 Dr. Charles T. Smith became dean . During this period the school experienced positive growth in many areas. A dental assisting curriculum was developed in 1968 under the leadership of Betty Zendner. The first class graduated in 1969, receiving the Associate in Scie nce degree. A dental auxiliary utilization (DAU) program was initiated to provide enhanced learning for dental students. The Monument Valley Dental Clin ic for Navajo Indians was started in 1966, and Dean Smith succeeded in finding from public sources fiscal support for the clinic building and for faculty housing. New advanced- education (postdoctoral) programs were initiated in five clin ical disciplines: orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics, and oral pathology. During the 1970s the School of Dentistry continued its evolution into one of the premier clinical programs in the United States. Dr. Judson Klooster became dean in 1971. One of his major contributions was the expansion of Prince Hall, which was completed in May 1976. The new building more than doubled the number of clinical units; provided facilities for specialized areas of clinical instructio n; and included eight new research labo ratories, new classrooms, seminar rooms, amphitheaters, urgently needed teacher office space, and a commensurate expa nsion of support fac ilities and services. The Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic was remodeled, and an outpatient surgicenter was developed to meet the needs of those patients requiring general anesthesia for dental treatment. The School of Dentistry became an important regional resource for providing dental care for developmentally disabled children and adults, many of whom require such a treatme nt setting. The Biomaterials Research Laboratory was constructed; and new advanced-education programs were initia ted in pediatric dentistry, implant dentistry, dental anesthesiology, and prosthodontics. A new program was established in 1985 to provide a U.S. dental education for foreign- trained dentists. An increasing number of dental professionals from other countries were seeking an American education and the opportunity to practice dentistry in the United States or to gain advanced knowledge to share in their own countries. The International Dentist Program continues to offer an intens ive, twenty-one-month course of study leading to a D.D.S. degree. The program has added a six-month certificate program limited to dental missionaries from other countries who sense the need for updated continuing education. In 2000, the first major expansion of the School of Dentistry in more than twenty years added 15,000 square feet to Prince Hall on the east side and provided two new patient entrances. Th e expanded Special Care Dentis try Clinic and the enlarged Pediatric Dentistry Clinic were relocated to the ground floor . An additional student laboratory was also included on that level. On the second floor, the new space allowed for expans ion of the predoctoral clinic, with thirty-six additional operatories. OUR MISSION Loma Linda University School of Dentistry seeks to further the healing and teaching ministry of Jesu s Christ by providing an environment in which: Students learn to provide high-quality oral hea lth care based on sound scientific principles. Patients receive competent care that is preventive in purpose and comprehens ive in scope, and that is provided with compassion and respect. Faculty, students, and staff value the patient relationshi p, respect diversity, and share responsibility by working together toward academic, professional, spiritual, and personal growth. Scholarly activity and research provide a foundation for ev idence-based learning and enhance whole-person care. The workplace environment attracts and retains a superior and diverse faculty and st aff who motivate, educate, and serve.

In broad terms, the following are standards required for admission: Intellectual capacity to complete the curriculum. Emotional adaptability and stability. Social and perceptual skills. Physical ability to carry out observation and communication activities, and the possession of sufficient motor and sensory abilities to practice general dentistry. All materials submitted for admission should be sent to: Office of Admissions School of Dentistry Loma Linda University Loma Linda, CA 92350 Pre-entrance requirements Although the predentistry curriculum in an accredited college can be completed in three years, a baccalaureate degree or equivalent is strongly recommended. The following complete college courses are required for entrance into the D.D.S. degree program: HUMANITIES Freshman English (complete sequence, 2 semesters or 2 quarters) to include composition and literature NATURAL SCIENCES (complete course, one full year or equivalent) General biology or zoology with laboratory General chemistry with laboratory General physics with laboratory Organic chemistry with laboratory Biochemistry (one semester or a minimum of 4 units; 2 quarters or a minimum of 6 units) ELECTIVES (strongly recommended) Molecular biology and/or Cell biology Vertebrate physiology Histology Anatomy Psychology Basic human nutrition Basic accounting Principles of management REQUIRED Students preparing for the predoctoral program are required to complete a minimum of three academic years with no fewer than 96 semester or 144 quarter units in a college or university accr edited by a regional accrediting association. Preference is given to applicants who have completed or will complete the requirements for a baccalaureate degree prior to admission. A maximum of 64 semester or 96 quarter units of credit may be accepted from an accredited junior or community college. A complete academic year of class work (8 semester or 12 quarter units) in general biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, general physics, English composition, and biochemistry (one semester or a minimum of 4 units; 2 quarters or a minimum of 6 units) must be completed within five years prior to admission, with a grade of C or above in each course. A minimum grade-point average of 2.7 in science subjects and in non-science subjects, averaged separately, is required. The average grade-point average for accepted students is substantially higher. Students who are enrolled in another program in Loma Linda University are not considered for admission until they have completed or have been released from the program. Prior to consideration for admission, the applicant must m eet specific criteria related to past academic performance (G.P.A.), performance on the Dental Admi ssion Test (DAT), and a personal intervie w. Applicants are expected to have SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY 231 taken the DAT within the previous two years, preferably not later than October of the year preceding admissions. At the applicant's request, test results are sent to the school by the testing service. Information may be obtained directly from the American Dental Education Association, 211 East Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL 60611. Or an application form and descriptive material may be obtained from the school. In order to be better prepared with specific vocabulary and unde rstanding, the applicant should include science courses with content similar to courses offered during the first year of the professional curriculum. The applicant's purpose should be the pursuit of diverse knowledge, the cultivation of an i nquiring mind, the practice of effici ent methods of study, and the habit of thinking and reasoning independently. These are of paramo unt importance to the applicant's development as a unique and responsible human being. The choice of electives can broaden the applicant's view of the scope of knowledge. Being well-re ad will give a perspective on the sweep of human thought throughout the ages, and often this will be of assistance in written and verbal communication and will improve the ability to think and express oneself well. Psychological, social, philosophical, and religious insights will help to develop basic resources for the solution of personal problems and the growth of self-understanding the student must have in order to understand and help associates. An applicant from a college or university outside the United Stat es or Canada or from a nonaccredited college or university in the United States must complete a mini mum of one full academic year (24 semester or 36 quarter credits) in competition with other preprofessional students in an accredited college or university in the United States. A grade of C or above in each course completed is required. (A grade of C- will not be accepted.) Application procedure The school participates in the American Association of Dental Schools Appli cation Service (AADSAS). Cards requesting an AADSAS application are available at most colleges and uni versities and also on the Internet at <www.adea.org>; or e- mail at <aadsas@adea.org>. The application should be completed and returned to the Washington address indicated on the application. AADSAS processes this application and sends copies to the schools of the applicant's choice. The School of Dentistry at Loma Linda University recommends that applicants file their AADSAS application before August 1 in order to be competitive. To be given consideration for the next entering class, the student's applicati on deadline is December 1. The following is a step-by-step process for completing an application to Loma Linda University. 1. Supplementary application . When an AADSAS application arrives at Loma Linda University, it is screened; and qualified applicants are sent a supplementary application for the School of Dentistry. 2. Supplementary written materials . The applicant must return the completed supplementary application and materials within 30 days. This includes: an essay specifi c to Loma Linda University, a wallet-sized photograph, and the application fee of $75. 3. Transcripts. Official transcripts may be sent to AADSAS and then released by AADSAS to the School of Dentistry. When an applicant becomes an accepted stud ent, official transcripts, mailed directly from all colleges/universities, are required in order for the student to be registered for the first quarter of classes. 4. References. The applicant is asked to supply a minimum of three personal references. It is recommended that these include an academic reference from a science instructor; a reference from an employer; a character or religious reference such as from a minister; and a referenc e from a friend in the dental profession. If the applicant has attended a college or university that has a prep rofessional committee that prepares a preprofessional evaluation, it is required that Loma Linda University be sent a copy of this evaluation from the committee. Members of the applicant's family are excluded from writing the required letters of refe rence, although letters will be accepted for the file in addition to those required. Recommendation letters may be sent to AADSAS and then released by AADSAS to Loma Linda University School of Dentistry. 5. Dental Admission Test . The applicant is required to complete\u2014and must meet specific criteria related to performance on\u2014the Dental Admission Test (DAT). Preference is given to applicants who have taken the test no later than October of the academic year preceding that for which admission is desired. The student entering the first year is expected to have taken the test within the past two years. If the test has been taken more than one time, the most recent scores are used for admission criteria. The committee reviews all sc ores on the test. The DAT scores must be on file at Loma Lind a University before an acceptance to the School will be issued. Test results should be sent to Loma Linda University, School of Dentistry, Office of Admissions. 6. Interview . The applicant's records will be screened when th e supplementary application, recommendations, and transcripts are on file. The applicant may then be invited to the school for a personal interview. An interview is required for admission. The interview provides an opport unity for evaluation of noncognitive factors, including communication skills, personal values, motivation, and commitment to goals of the profession; as well as genuine 232 UNIVERSITY CATALOG concern for others in the service of dentistry. At the time of the interview, a tour of the school will be given by a current student in the program. 7. Observation . It is important that preprofessional students seek experience observing and assisting in a dental office to become familiar with the work of a dentist or a dental hygienist. Prior to interviewing, applicants are expected to complete a minimum of twenty hours of observation/work experience in a dental facility, ten of which must be done in a general practitioner's office. 8. Acceptance . The accepted student receives an acceptance letter an d a follow-up letter with information relative to required forms and deposit deadlines. 9. Pre-entrance health requirements/Immunizations . It is expected that necessary routine dental and medical care will have been attended to before the student registers. New students are required to have certain immunizations and tests before registration. Forms to document the required immunizations are provided for the physician in the acceptance packet sent to the student by the school. In order to avoid having a hold placed on the registra tion packet, the student is encouraged to return the documentation forms in the provided envelope to Student Health Service no later than six weeks prior to the beginning of classes. Students enrolling in the School of Dentistry must provide documentation of having had the following immunizations and tests: MMRs\u2014measles (rubeola), mumps, rubella of two previous MMRs) PPD (TB) skin test (current skin test result or x-ray report) Tetanus/Diphtheria booster Chicken pox blood test and/or immunization. If no known history of chicken pox, then student may choose blood test (which may reveal pre-existing immunity) and/or immunization (if no prior immunity). Hepatitis-B vaccination series. Students who know themselves to have had hepatitis-B in the past should employ extra protection when involved in direct patient care and may request a modified curriculum, if necessary. This series of three vaccinations may be co mpleted at this University (even if it was begun elsewhere) through the Student Health Servi ce. (The student will be charged a fee.) A recent eye examination performed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. For further information, consult the Student Handbook , Section V\u2014University Policies: Communicable disease transmission-prevention policy; and the Student Health Service office, extension 88770. If a returning student is assigned to a clinical facility that requires a tuberculosis skin test, the student is required to have the test within the six months before the assignment begins. 10. Deposits. The student accepted into dentistry must submit a deposit of $1000 and the required forms to the Admissions Office. All deposits become part of the first qua rter's tuition. Failure to submit this deposit will result in the loss of the applicant's position in the class. The re maining balance of the first quarter's tuition and fees is due no later than the day of matriculation in late Septem ber. If the applicant has submitted a completed application for financial aid by March 2, and if the Stafford application has been submitted by June 15, the final installment can be paid utilizing University-assisted sources. Transfer Transfer from another school of dentistry in the United States is not recommended and is considered only in unusual circumstances. Credits from professional schools (business, medical technology, nursing, pharmacy, or medicine) do not fulfill admission requirements. Cr edit for studies taken at a military service school is granted to veterans according to recommendations in the Guide of the American Council on Education and/or the California Committee for the Study of Education.

SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY TECHNICAL STANDARDS In harmony with its own education, research, and service objectives, and using the American Dental Education Association suggested guidelines, Loma Linda University School of Dentis try has identified technical standards for its programs. The qualified applicant will meet, or will have the potential to meet, the following technical standards\u2014standards that every student in the dentistry programs is expected to reach. Cognitive abilities School of Dentistry students must have abilities that allow them to accurately and effectively measure, verify, calculate, reason, analyze, and synthesize. Students must be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures in order to fully and complete ly solve dental problems. In addition, students must be able to visualize and comprehend physical demonstrations in the classroom, laboratory, and clinic. Effective problem solving requires students to gather, organize, and assess relevant in formation in order to arrive at an integrated solution. Observation For learning to occur, students will be required to observe and interpret demonstrations and experiences. Such observation requires the functional use of vision, touch, hearing, and somatic sensation. Observation is further enhanced by the sense of smell. Students must be able to acquire information from written documents; and to visualize information presented in images from papers, films, slides, or videos. They must be able to interpret radiographic and other graphic images, with or without the use of assistive devices. Students must be able to observe patients accurately, at a distance and close at hand. They must be able to observe and appreciate verbal and nonverbal communications when performing dental operations or administering medications. All students in the School of Dentistry must possess adequate visual and tactile skills to perform dental examinations and provide treatment. Visual acuity, accommodati on, and color vision are ne cessary to discern differences and variations in color, shape, and general appearance between normal and abnormal hard and soft tissues. Touch and somatic sensation are required for effective learning, as well as for effective evaluation and treatment of patients. A student must also possess sufficient visual acuity to read charts, r ecords, small print, and handwritten notations. 236 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Communication Students in the School of Dentistry must be fluent in the use of standard written and spoken English. Thus students' communication with patients, faculty, and staff will be fac ilitated when eliciting or providing information; or when documenting changes in patients' mood, activity, and/or posture. Students must also be skilled in observing and understanding nonverbal communication. In addition, they must develop the professional judgment that will enable them to discern when and how to maintain patient confidentiality. Motor skills School of Dentistry students should have sufficient motor and sensory capability in both hands to be able to provide general dental care. They must possess the mo tor and sensory capabilities to perform diagnostic procedures\u2014including such diagnostic maneuvers as palpation, percussion, and auscultation; and to perform basic laboratory tests. Exercising these capabilities requires coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional tactile and visual senses. Students must be able to operate foot controls, utilizing fine movements; and to operate high- or low-speed dental instruments, accurately performing movements of less than one-half millimeter. They must also demonstrate well- developed tactile sense and precise control while using dental hand instruments. Behavioral and so cial attributes Students must be able to perform basic life-support (e.g., CP R), transfer and position disabl ed patients, and physically restrain patients who lack motor control. Additionally, they mu st be able to position or reposition themselves around the patient and dental chair while sitting or standing. Students must possess the emotional stability and resilience re quired for full utilization of their abilities in the context of a full and challenging education program. Success in the educational program requires use of good judgment; prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients; and development of mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients. It is also imperative that students be able to tolerate phy sically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. Students must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, honesty, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest, cultural sensitivity, and motivati on are all personal qualities that will be assessed during th e admissions and education process. Disabled applicants and students It is Loma Linda University's policy to comply fully with the provisions of The Americans with Disabilities Act [42 U.S.C., Sec. 12131 (2) (1990)]. The school is committed to providing dental education\u2014including support services and reasonable accommodations for disabilities\u2014to qualified applican ts who will be able to perform all technical standards with or without accommodations; and for w hom such accommodation does not fundamentally alter the School of Dentistry courses or create an undue burden. During the application process, the sc hool requests that an applicant disclose any disability for which an accommodation may be needed. The Admissions Committee requires written documen tation of the disability, which they will review prior to making an assessment as to whether or not the applicant can be expected to perform the essential functions of the program. A student who desires accommodation for any disability identified after admission must complete a request form available in the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs for ev aluation with appropriate University entities. Appropriate and reasonable accommodation will be provided, as necessary. SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY 237 Student Life POLICIES FOR THIS SCHOOL The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook . Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is av ailable from the respective school. CODE OF ETHICS A school of dentistry is a place where the professionals of tomorrow are select ed and trained in the development of professional and ethical attitudes that are consistent with the hi ghest goals of the profession. It is for this purpose that th e School of Dentistry has a code of ethics. This code is a me ans of educating and training the future dentist in areas of professional ethical activity, and is a means of developing an ethical and moral awareness that will help the individual serve the public and the profession in an enlight ened manner. The Code of Ethics of the School of Dentistry as found in its entirety in the Student Handbook shall apply to all students in the schoo l\u2014including dental hygiene, dentistry, international, graduate, and certificate st udents. In addition, residents, fellows, preceptors, research scholars, and exchange students involved in school advanced-education programs shall also be subject to all school policies. STUDENT ASSOCIATION Membership in the Dental Students Association is open to all students. The objectives of the organization include creating a common bond among students\u2014orienting them to organized dentistry, encouraging and fostering community outreach activities, stimulating interest in current scientific developm ent, providing programs of broad academic scope, promoting students' various interests, and providing social activities for students. SPECIAL OPPORTUNITIES Conventions The annual Alumni-Student Convention, sponsored since 1960 by the Alumni Association, gives opportunity for students to meet alumni and hear presentations by prominent guest lecturers in dentistry. Students have the opportunity to make research presentations in the form of table clinics. The winners are then invited to present their table clinics at state and national dental conventions. A dedication service is held during the convention, giving students an opportunity to dedicate their professional life to Christ. First-year students (D1) are presented with personalized Bibles; graduating students are given personalized Loma Linda University laboratory coats. Academic Information GENERAL POLICIES Registration The student must register on or before the dates designated by the Office of University Records. Early registration is encouraged. Registration procedur es include recording information on forms furn ished by the Office of University Records, clearing financial arrangements with Stud ent Finance, completing requirements of the Student Health Service, and having student identification pictures taken. Late registration is permissible only in case of a compelling r eason; a charge is made if registration is not completed by the designated dates. The student may not atte nd class without being regist ered, and in no case may registration take place later than the first week of the term. A change in registration afte r the second week affects the grade record. A student may not concurrently register for courses in another school of the University without permission of the associate dean for academic affairs. Attendance Regular attendance at lectures, clinics, and other assemblies is required of all students. All lectures and laboratories provid e information essential for successful completion of the progra m. Each student is responsible for all material covered and assignments made. Absences in excess of 15 percent may be sufficient cause for a failing or unsatisfactory grade to be recorded. Clinics and individual courses/instructors may have more stringent requirements. 238 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Length of academic residence To fulfill the requirement pertaining to length of academic residence, the student must be registered for a full course load at the University for the entire senior year for the Bachelor of Science degree; and th e entire D3 and D4 years for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Dean's list Outstanding academic performance will be rewarded by pub lication of the Dean's List each quarter. The eligibility requirements are: complete at least 12 units of graded course work during the quarter; achieve a term grade-point average of at least 3.5 with no grade lower than a B-; receive no Incomplete grad es on the grade report. Course waiver A course requirement may be waived if the applicant has previously taken the course and earned a grade of B or above, but no credit results. Evaluation for waiver of courses will be completed only after an applicant has been accepted to the program, and must be approved by the course director at this University an d the school's associate dean for academic affairs. Tuition is not reduced if courses are waiv ed or if a student takes less than a full load. Special examination It is the policy of the school that all st udents are expected to take examinations at the scheduled time. The only acceptable excuse for not taking an examination on time is major illness (documented by the Student Health Service and conveyed to the course director and the Office of Student Affairs prio r to the examination). The consequences of missing an examination under the circumstances of documented illness are de termined by the course director. If a student appears late for an examination, s/he may be denied admission to the examination site. If a student arrives late for an examination and is allowed to take the examination, s/he will be required to finish the examination at the same time as students who arrive on time. Repeating/Remediating a course If a student receives an unsatisfactory or failing grade in a required course, it will be necessary for him/her to do additiona l work. Based on the original grade earned by the student, and upon the recommendation of the Academic Review Committee, one of the following plans will be pursued: 1. For courses with unsatisfactory performance (D+/D/U grades ) the student must reregister for the course, review the course work independently, repeat required assignments or quizzes, and take any or all course examinations as required by the course director. The highest grade allowed for a remediated course is C. At the discretion of the Academic Review Committee and course director, the student may be required to repeat the course at the next course offering. 2. For courses with failing performance (F grades), the student must reregister for the course, attend the class and/or laboratory, and take all course examinations at the next regular course offering. Both the original and repeat grades are entered into the student's perman ent academic reco rd, but only the repeat grade units are computed in the grade-point average.

PROCEDURES FOR ACADEMIC REVIEW There are six Academic Review Committees: D1, D2, D3, D4, IDP, and Dent al Hygiene. Membership of each committee consists of the associate dean for academic affairs, the associ ate dean for student affairs, th e associate dean for admissions, and the course directors of all courses required of the respective class in the academic year. The associate dean for clinic administration and primary attending faculty are members of the D3/D4 Academic Review Committees. In addition, each committee has two student members appointed by the dean in consultation with the DSA officers. Student committee members will be in the class one year ahead of the class being reviewed. The Academic Review Committees meet once per quarter to evaluate student academic an d clinical performance and progress records. Students whose performance does not meet the stated academic standard s and students who are being considered for discontinuation may be scheduled for a hearing with the committee. The committee also recommends to the dean all appropriate can didates for promotion, academic probation, repeat, or other appropriate actions; as well as stud ents who should receive special recognition for academic excellence. The process for evaluation of academ ic performance is as follows: 1. The Academic Review Committee\u2014by reviewing grades, reports, and other pertinent information\u2014identifies students whose academic and/ or clinical performance is below acceptable levels. 2. The associate dean for studen t affairs notifies a student facing possible academic sanctions regarding the time and place for a meeting called for the purpose of allowing the student to appear be fore the committee to present reasons why action should not be taken. The Academic Review Committee considers the student's presentation and all available information before making a recommendation. SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY 241 3. The dean may enforce one or more of four academic sanction options: Academic probation Remedial action Academic leave of absence Academic discontinuation Please refer to Academic Disciplinary Policy for more specific descriptions regarding each academic sanction. 4. A student may appeal the decision of the Academic Re view Committee to the dean. Such appeals are not expected to be routine and should be considered only in circumst ances where new and relevant information exists that was not available for consideration by the Academic Review Committee. The dean will review the matter and either render a decision or appoint a three-member ad hoc committee. Members of this committee will not have been involved in the Academic Review Committee decision process. The ad hoc committee will determine whether the process was appropriately followed, re view new information, and judge whether the record supports the decision. They will report their findings and recommendation to the dean, who will decide if the appealing student will be permitted to continue participating in classes and/or clinical assignments during the appeal proceedings. ACADEMIC DISCIPLINARY POLICY Academic probation Academic probation is a specified period of time during which the student is given an opportunity to comply with specific academic standards. Such action must be confirmed by letter to the student. Criteria for placement on academic probation A student will be placed on academic probation if s/he meets one or more of the following conditions: 1. Term or cumulative grade-point average (G.P.A.) below 2.0. 2. Unsatisfactory (D+/D) or failing (U/F) grades in any course required for the degree. 3. Clinical performance below minimum expected for current academic level. 4. Social/behavioral/ethical problem s that significantly impact academic and/or clinical performance. Level of academic probation The level of academic probation indicates the seriousness of the cumulative academic deficiency. However, depending on the seriousness or nature of the academic deficiency, a st udent may be considered for academic leave of absence or discontinuation at any level of probation. Level 1 First term on academic probation. Level 2 Second term on academic probatio n, consecutive or nonconsecutive. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to fa iling grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term. Level 3 Third term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. If a student is unable to remove academic probationary status within the followin g term, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to fa iling grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term. Level 4 If a student meets criteria for academic probation fo r a fourth term, consecutiv e or nonconsecutive, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. Conditions for a student on academic probation A student on academic probation: 1. May not serve as an officer for any class, school, or extracurricular organization. 2. May not take any elective courses. 3. May not participate in any elective off-cam pus service learning or mission activities. 4.

Service experiences may last from one day to several weeks. All dental and dental hygiene students are required to complete assigned service-learning rotations and minimum clock hours as described in each program. Dental students are required to complete a minimum of 120 service learning hours. Forty hours will be local, of which at least 28 hours will be from block assignments. The 80 remaining hours can be international trips, local trips with up to 30 hours in nondental service. Students are also required to be in good and regular standing to be eligible to participate in elective international service- learning experiences. LEARNING ENVIRONMENT Because the study of dental sciences and arts is based on a f oundation in essentially the same science subjects as are studied in medicine and allied health curricula, the School of Den tistry shares with the School of Medicine the facilities for teaching basic sciences. Classrooms, laboratories, student lounges, teachers' offices, and clinical facilities related solely to dentistry occupy the School of Dentistry building, named in honor of M. Webster Pr ince, the first dean. Prince Hall is on the University mall facing the University Church and adjace nt to the Medical Center. The facilities effectively accommodate collaboration with the Medical Center in ongoing research and service programs. The total resources of the University constitute a wealth of opportunity for the student with initiative and willingness to develop individual capacity to the fullest extent. Students find varied opportunities for serving and learning in the immediate University community, in school-sponsored service-l earning clinics, in clinical and research electives, and in diverse volunteer programs. 244 UNIVERSITY CATALOG BASIC SCIENCES DEPARTMENTS SERVI NG THE SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY The Loma Linda University departments of basic sciences include anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, and physiology and pharmacology. The basic sciences serve as the foundation for the dental sciences by leading toward an understanding of normal structure and function, as well as introducing the basis for pathology in the practice of dentistry. Subjects are taught in the first year of the dental hygiene and the first two years of the general dentistry curricula as parts of three conceptually integrated sequences of courses\u2014sequences in physiology, in anatomy, and in applied science. Throughout the basic sciences, an appreciation of God's creation and His wisdom is reinforced through the study of human biology. Students are encouraged to extend their knowledge and apply it for their own well-being and for the well-being of their patients. The Department of Anatomy provides students with the opportunity to learn the fundamental morphology of the human body, including gross anatomy, histology, neuroanatomy, and embryology. The Department of Biochemistry enables students to learn the fundamentals of biochemistry as they apply to the practice of dentistry. The Department of Physiology and Pharmacology enables the student to describe the normal physiological functions of the major body systems as they relate to the mastery of dentistry; and to apply the principles and basic concepts of drug action, safety, and disposition. This basic science focus provides a basic fund of knowledge that is essential for the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene. The faculty are dedicated to providing students with tools that expand their thinking and challenge them to ask probing questions and to earnestly search for answers. Their ai m is to prepare students to ex cel scientifically. The higher aim is, through the Christian atmosphere of this University, to prepare students to become truly compassionate dentists.

JONI A. STEPHENS, Chair FACULTY Darlene A. Armstrong Kellie R. Bergendahl D. Darlene Cheek Janeen C. Duff Debra K. Friesen Jean M. Honny Michelle T. Hurlbutt Shirley A. Lee Joyce H. Sanders Joni A. Stephens Colleen Whitt Shelly A. Withers Established in 1959, the Department of Dental Hygiene, the undergraduate program of the School of Dentistry, is largely focused on preventive oral h ealth services and maintenance care. Dental science courses, preclinical lectures and seminars, laboratory exercises, and clinical assignments have been developed to provide training in the variety of procedures delegated to the dental hygienist within the dental practice setting. These experiences are sequenced in an organized manner that provides for continual growth and proficiency in performance of all traditional and expanded function procedures. The purpose of the program is to develop professionals prepared for the current practice of dental hygiene, as well as graduates who are additionally prepared to d eal with future changes in dentistry. Courses that encourage critical thinking and problem-solving techniques and that enhance the ability to evaluate the latest in research are important adjuncts to clinical training. Upon completion of this curriculum, graduates will be prepared to enter a variety of career options available to a dental hygienist. The Degree Completion Program is designed for licensed dental hygienists who graduated from an Associate in Science degree program, or its equivalent , and wish to complete the baccalaureate (BS) degree in dental hygiene. This program is the equivalent of one full academic year and meets the general education (GE) requirements for a Bachelor of Science degree. The program is designed to be completed primarily on line, with a requisite t eaching or public health component that may be accomplished in the geographi cal area of the student. This program offers the challenge and quality of a traditional classroom, yet provides the flexibility to fit education into the life of the busy dental professional. Students can study at their own convenience, learn in small groups with expert faculty, and meet career goals at thei r own speed. Students who tend to be the most successful in this type of program are self-directed, computer literate, and se lf-motivated in their learning and study habits. Two areas of focus are included in this program. The first is teaching and pr epares the student to instruct in a dental hygiene program. The second is a public hea lth focus, which will allow graduates to work in a community/dental public he alth program or allow them to t each in a dental hygiene program. Philosophy A profession in the health arts and sciences calls increasingly for persons of intelligence, integrity, responsibility, and depth of human understanding. Theref ore, the program of instruction is planned on a strong liberal arts foundation. The student is encourag ed to take electives that contribute to breadth of knowledge and quality of values. The choice of elec tives in early college work is important for many reasons. DENTAL HYGIENE-SD 251 The School of Dentistry is interested in applicants with the potential to become hygienists who are well- read and gracious persons\u2014prepared to communi cate effectively in professional and community relationships. They should be able to draw on knowledge of the structure and function of the human body in health and disease, applying resources based on Christian ideals and values to aid in the solution of personal problems. They should also be able to develop the attitudes and skills that will most effectively serve society. Goal The goal of the Dental Hygiene Pr ogram is to educate competent, co ncerned, and active members of the dental hygiene profession who possess the ability to ef fectively perform the expanding scope of practice of the dental hygienist. Loma Linda University emphasizes Christian values and beliefs and the concept of whole-person care. Opportunities for spiritual growth and fellowship among faculty and students are interwoven into daily academic pursuits, clinical practi ce, and social interactions. The advancement of dental hygiene depends on an ever-growing body of knowledge. Therefore, this program also places great importance on providing an atmosphere in which students can develop the skills necessary to objectively assess new theories and trends in dentistry in light of scientific knowledge and principles. By combining Christian values with an appreciation for research and the scientific method, graduates will continually apply sound principles to pa tient care and exhibit God's love in the quality of service they render. Admission Information and procedures for applying to the Dental Hygiene Program can be found under the Application and Admissions section of the general inform ation for the School of Dentistry in Section III. Curriculum Dental hygiene, a profession dating back to 1913, is largely concerned with preventive health services. The hygienist works in association with the dentist in pr ivate-practice offices, industrial organizations, schools, hospitals, state or federal public health services, and the armed forces. The curriculum is organized as a four-year college pr ogram leading to the Bachelor of Science degree. The freshman and sophomore years of largely prescribed, preprofessional study may be taken at any accredited college. The professional program begins with the junior year in the School of Dentistry. The program is approved by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association. The first class at this University graduated in 1961. 252 UNIVERSITY CATALOG COURSES (Units) DNHY 303 Dental Materials and Techniques (2) DNHY 305 Dental Anatomy Lecture (2) DNHY 305L Dental Anatomy Laboratory (1) DNHY 309 Radiology I (3) DNHY 310 Radiology II (2) DNHY 321 Preclinical Dent al Hygiene I Lecture (2) DNHY 321L Preclinical Dental Hygiene I Laboratory (2) DNHY 3322 Preclinical Dent al Hygiene II Lecture (2) DNHY 322L Preclinical Dental Hygiene II Laboratory (2) DNHY 323 Preclinical Dental Hygiene III Lecture (2) DNHY 323L Preclinical Dental Hygiene III Laboratory (1) DNHY 324 Preclinical Dental Hygiene IV Lecture (2) DNHY 324L Preclinical Dental Hygiene IV Laboratory (1) DNHY 375 Dental Hygiene Clinic (1) DNHY 376 Dental Hygiene Clinic (2) DNHY 380 Medically Compromised Patients (2) DNHY 390 Introductory Statistics (3) DNHY 405 Introduction to Periodontics (2) DNHY 406 Orthodontics Concepts for Dental Hygiene (1) DNHY 408 Professional Ethics (2) DNHY 409 Jurisprudence (2) DNHY 412 Dental Hygiene Topics II (2) DNHY 413 Dental Hygiene Topics III (2) DNHY 414 Personal Finance (2) DNHY 415 Applied Nutrition (2) DNHY 416 Dental Health Education I (2) DNHY 417 Dental Health Education II (2) DNHY 418 Critical Issues of Health Care (2) DNHY 421 Research I (2) DNHY 422 Research II (2) DNHY 423 Research III (1) DNHY 431 Dental Public Health (3) DNHY 435 Special Topics in Periodontal Therapy (2) DNHY 451 Clinical Seminar/Dental Hygiene Topics (3) DNHY 452 Clinical Seminar II (1) DNHY 453 Clinical Seminar III (1) DNHY 475 Dental Hygiene Clinic I (4) DNHY 476 Dental Hygiene Clinic II (4) DNHY 477 Dental Hygiene Clinic III (4) DNHY 498 Dental Hygiene Directed Study (1-10) DNHY 499 Research Writing (2) DENTAL HYGIENE-SD 253 DENTAL HYGIENE COMPETENCIES The curriculum is designed to ensure that by grad uation all students will have the skills, attitudes, and competencies important to the successful practice of dental hygiene.

CHARLES J. GOODACRE, Dean, School of Dentistry The goal of the General Dentistry Program is to train practi tioners in the delivery of high-quality dental care that is preventive in purpose and comprehensive in scope, and that is based on sound biological principles. Curriculum Dentistry, like all health professions, exists to benefit society and, therefore, continually assesses its professional service s to ascertain what measures, attitudes, an d skills most effectively serve society. The School of Dentistry is committed to: Beginning the curriculum with a strong foundation in the sciences that are basic to knowledge of the structure and function of the human being in health and in sickness. Providing an educational environment that progressively leads a student to mastery and correlation of clinical sciences and skills. Developing a frame of reference from which to mobilize the resources of dentists and associated professional personnel in both delivery of health care and cont ribution to community well-being by education for the prevention of illness. These concepts include responsibility for contributing to the b ody of scientific knowledge by questioning, investigating, and teaching; for remaining sensitive an d adaptive to the needs of humanity in ever-changing conditions; and for maintaining consciousness of the individual obligation to live, practice, and strive for the good of humanity. The curriculum in dentistry, organized to be completed in four academic years, fulfills requirements for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Objective The primary objective of the dental curriculum is to graduate men and women who attest to the purpose of the University and the goals of the School of Dentistry, which include advancing knowledge and understanding of health, disease, and ways to improve health and the dental health care-delivery system through basic and applied research. Admission Information and procedures for applying to the Doctor of Dental Surgery Program can be found under Application and Admissions in the School of Dentistry general information in Section III of this CATALOG . Regulations The student is also subject to the conditions of registration, attendance, financial policy, governing practices, and graduation requirements outlined in Section II and in the School of Dentistry general information in Section III of this CATALOG . Instruments, textbooks, additional materials The instruments, textbooks, and materials required for the study and practice of dentistry are prescribed by the School of Dentistry. The school issues dental instruments each quarter as needed in the program. Unauthorized or incomplete equipment is not acceptable. Advance administrativ e approval must be obtained for any exception. Employment Because the dental program is very rigorou s, first-year students in dentistry ma y not accept part-time employment during the first term. Such employment thereafter may be accepted by the student only upon receiving written permission from the Office of the Associate De an for Academic Affairs. DENTISTRY, GENERAL-SD 259 Academic incentive program Detailed information on the Academic Incentive Program may be found under that heading in the School of Dentistry general information in Section III of this CATALOG . Licensing Eligibility to take examinations given by the state and region al boards of dental examiners is based on essentially the same requirements as are stipulated by the School of Dentistry for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Information about the examinations of the respective st ates is available from the associate dean for academic affairs. Credentials from the National Board of Dental Examiners ar e accepted in lieu of the written portion of a state examination in most states. Many states require the National Board Examination and provide no alternative. (The national board does not include a clinical examination.)

This CATALOG will provide you with detailed information about our people, programs, and facilities; as well as our requirements and expectations. Medical education remains our number-one priority. The school offers quality programs in medical education for medical students, combined- degrees students, house staff, alumni , and professional peers within a system of demonstrated Christian values and beliefs. Our faculty are committed to ensuring that those we educate will develop the skills and intellectual curiosity needed for success as lifelong learners in a changing world. We welcome your interest. Roger Hadley, M.D. Dean, School of Medicine School Foundations HISTORY The professional curriculum in medicine, usually requir ing four academic years of study and experience in a university and hospital setting, was first offered at Loma Linda University in 1909. More than nine decades later, the events since 1909 seem blurred by the rapid changes that institutions of higher learning experience in an effort to keep pace with the growth of knowledge. Since 1909 The first two years of medicine were always taught on the Loma Linda campus. From 1913 to the mid- 1960s, the third and fourth years were taught in Los Angeles at what is now White Memorial Medical Center (the first part of which was built in 1918) and at nearby Los Angeles County Hospital (now Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center). Construction of Loma Linda University Medical Center (inclusive of clinical, teaching, and research facilities) allowed the entire four-year curriculum to be offered on and near the Loma Linda campus, beginning with school year 1966-67. The medical center was occupied in July 1967. OUR MISSION The mission of the School of Medicine is to continue the healing and t eaching ministry of Jesus Christ, \"To make man whole\" (Luke 9:6). Preparing the physician Our purpose is the formation of Christian physicians, providing whole-person care to individuals, families, and communities. Fulfilling this responsibility requires: Education Creating an environment in which medical students, graduate students, and residents will acquire the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes appropriate to Christian health professionals and scholars. SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 301 Research Cultivating an atmosphere of inquiry and discovering new routes to wholeness through basic and clinical research. Service Providing timely access to cost-effective, comprehensive, whole-person care for all patients, without regard for their circumstances or status. Developing the whole person The Christian view of wholeness holds that the needs of patients go beyond the healing of the body and that the development of students involves more than the training of the mind. We are dedicated to promoting physical, intellectual, social, and spiritual growth in our faculty and our students, and to transforming our daily activities into personal ministries. Reaching the world Providing whole-person care wherever the opportunity arises, participating with the world community in the provision of local medical education, providing inte rnational physicians and scientists the opportunities for professional interaction and enrichment, sharing the good news of a loving God as demonstrated by the life and teachings of Jesus Christ\u2014these are the goals of the students, faculty, and graduates of Loma Linda University School of Medicine. General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for info rming themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school and outlines the subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review speci fic program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs. Application and Admissions The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committees of the school accomplis h this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant qualities of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. THE STUDY OF MEDICINE Preparation for the practice of medicine begins early in life and early in the student's schooling. The greater the aptitudes for and interests in learning widely and appreciatively in the major areas of knowledge--the natural sciences, the humanities, the behavioral scien ces\u2014the more able and versatile the student is likely to become. In selecting students, the Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine looks for applicants who are best suited to fulfill the mission of the school and to su ccessfully practice medicine. The school desires students who demonstrate ability to learn independently , to think critically, and to articulate clearly\u2014both orally and in written form\u2014their ideas and opinions. It is important that students in the School of Medicine demonstrate excellent interpersonal skills and show evidence of sensitivity to the needs of humanity. The Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine puts forth considerable effo rt to ensure that an applicant is qualified for medical school. The applican t's credentials are reviewed to assess scholastic performance. The committee also looks for prerequisite qualities of character and personality, potential for self-direction and the use of discriminating judgment, and dedication to the ideal of service to society. 302 UNIVERSITY CATALOG GENERAL ENTRANCE INFORMATION A total of 85 semester (128 quarter) units of credit fr om an accredited college is required for acceptance by the School of Medicine. Preference is given, however, to college graduates. Credit must be presented for the following subjects: SEMESTER/QUARTER HOURS General biology or zoology with laboratory 8/12 General or inorganic chemistry with laboratory 8/12 Organic chemistry with laboratory 8/12 Physics with laboratory 8/12 English equivalent to satisfy baccalaureate degree requirement Religion as required by the college attended REQUIRED Keyboard and computer skills RECOMMENDED Introductory course in basic statistics Biochemistry, strongly recommended Science credits earned in professional schools (e.g., a llied health professions, bu siness, dentistry, nursing, or pharmacy) do not fulfill requirements for admission to medicine. CLEP and Pass/Fail performances are not acceptable for the required courses. The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) is requ ired. Scores older than three years will not be considered. APPLICATION PROCEDURE AND ACCEPTANCE It is important to know the specifics of the application process and to begin the application process well in advance of the date of anticipated (o r desired) entrance to medical school. Where to write The School of Medicine is a member of the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS). Applications must be submitted through AMCAS. Their application is available on the web at <www.aamc.org/students/amcas/application.htm>. AMCAS deadline Application should be made directly to AMCAS between June 1 and November 1 for entry in August of the following year. Fees The AMCAS fee is required each time an application is submitted. An additional fee to the School of Medicine is required with each supplementary application. Procedure The application procedure is as follows: 1. The applicant submits a formal application to AM CAS, with fee and requested transcripts. The applicant's evaluated data are forwarded to the School of Medicine by AMCAS. 2. When the application is received from AMCAS, Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Medicine requests completion of a supplementary application and reference forms. The prospective student should provide evidence of exposure to health care through personal involvement, or in other ways confirming the applicant's deci sion to become a physician. 3. After the supplementary application and letters of reference have been submitted and reviewed, the applicant may be invited for an interview. 4. The information submitted by the applicant through AMCAS, the supplementary application, the letters of reference, and the interview reports are then evaluated by the Admissions Committee of the SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 303 School of Medicine. This committee determines whether an applicant is accepted or rejected. All applicants are notified of the final decision of the Admissions Committee regarding their application. Acceptance notices are sent to regular applicants beginning D ecember of the year preceding admission to the School of Medicine, continuing until the class is filled. 5. The accepted applicant sends a writte n acceptance of his/her offer of ad mission as a student, together with a $100 acceptance deposit, by the announced da te (about thirty days after the notification of acceptance). This deposit is refund able until May 15 of the year in which the student has been accepted for entry. In summary, the Admissions Of fice requests the following: Loma Linda University School of Medicine supple mentary application and $75.00 application fee. Appraisal of the applicant's character, ability, and suitability for a medical career by persons knowledgeable about the app licant's past performance. A preprofessional recommendation packet, if av ailable, from the app licant's undergraduate college/university. Applicant's availability for interviews. Pre-entrance health require ment and health insurance Students must meet the immunization requirements as st ated. In addition, students are expected to have routine dental and medical care and elective surgery attended to before registering for medical school. All School of Medicine students are provided with a health insurance policy through the University's Department of Risk Management. This policy remains in effect for students who are regularly enrolled, provided they register and pay tuition and fees on time each quarter. Since the maximum benefit of the policy (as of the time this CATALOG went to press) is $100,000 and does not cover preexisting illnesses or dental or optical care, students are encouraged to main tain a personal, current policy that covers preexisting illnesses and/or has a higher benefit. A student who does not have health insurance coverage for his/her spouse/children will need to purchase it through the Un iversity's Department of Risk Management at the time of registration. Government regulations prohibit the use of student loan funds to provide medical insurance or services for a st udent's spouse or children. Students who wish to review a copy of the current student health plan or have further questions about the plan should call Risk Management (909/558-4386). Annual tuition also covers the cost of disability insurance. Details will be presented du ring orientation or upon request. EARLY-DECISION PROGRAM A highly qualified applicant to medical school may apply between June 1 and August 1 and be guaranteed a decision by October 1. During that period of time, the applicant may not apply to any other medical school; and if the applicant is accepted at Loma Linda Un iversity, s/he is committed to that decision. If the applicant is not accepted by October 1, s/he may apply to any school desired. An applicant not accepted by October 1 will be considered in the regular applicant pool. On the AMCAS application, the applicant indicates that s/he is an early-decision applicant and ag rees to comply with the constraints of that program. DEADLINES June 1 to November 1 (of the year preceding the year of admission to the School of Medicine) is the period for submission of applications for the first-year class. August 1 (of the year preceding the year of admission) is the deadline for submission of application under the Early-Decision Program. September 1 (of the year preceding the year of ad mission) is the deadline for the submission of the supplementary application for the Early-Decision Program. November 15 (of the year preced ing the year of admission) is the deadline for receipt of the supplementary application for the regular applicant pool. May 15 (of the year of admission) is the date beyond which the deposit of $100 is not refundable. TRANSFER Under exceptional circumstances, the school accepts applic ants into the junior year who are transferring from other U.S. medical schools. Such transfers must be for compelling circumstances and are subject to 304 UNIVERSITY CATALOG availability of space and approval of the Loma Linda University School of Medicine Dean's Administrative Committee. The University reserves the right to require of an applicant satisfactory completion of written or practical examinations in any course for wh ich transfer credit is requested. Successful completion of USMLE Step I is required. Student Life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The most recent Student Handbook 2006 more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available on the University Web site and to each regi stered student and to prospective students who request a copy in writing from the School of Medicine, Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Students are expected to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook and to abide by its policies. Additional information regarding policies speci fic to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. Student organizations The purpose of Loma Linda University School of Medicine student organizations is to: encourage high Christian ideals among medical students. involve medical students in developing and furthering their education. enhance involvement in and loyalty to Loma Linda University. invite medical students to seek constructive solutions to problems; and foster leadership among medical students. At registration into the School of Medicine, students automatically become members of the School of Medicine Student Association. Other student organizations that operate within the School of Medicine and that are represented on the School of Medicine Senate include the following: 1. The American Medical Association-Medical Student Section (AMA-MSS), Loma Linda University Chapter. 2. The American Medical Student Associatio n (AMSA), Loma Linda University Chapter. 3. The Christian Medical and Dental Association (CMDA). 4. The Organization of Student Representatives (OSR) to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMS). 5. Student National Medical Association (SNMA) LLU Chapter. 6. Hands On Wholeness. Curriculum WHOLE-PERSON FORMATION Personal and professional growth for the student in medicine is the focus of the disciplines in the school, the faculty in the School of Medicine, and the School of Religion. Courses and content are offered to emphasize biblical, ethical, and relational aspects of the physician's personal and professional development. The core for Whole-Person Formation\u2014fourteen quarter units of religion and ethics--is provided during the first three years of the medicine curriculum. Academic Information The academic progress of each student is monitored by the Academic Review Committee. Specific policies for handling misconduct (academic or nonacademic) are published in the Student Handbook 2006. COMMUNICATIONS Communications to the medical student regarding academic and clinical assignments, scholarship opportunities, and other important information are routed through the Office of the Dean. The student SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 305 mailboxes and bulletin board are located in the Medical Ce nter. It is the responsibility of students to check their email and mailboxes and the bulletin board daily. REQUIRED SUPPLIES Microscope The student is expected to have access to a satisfactor y compound microscope (usually one rented from the school) that meets the following requirements: The microscope shall be no older than fifteen years. The lenses shall be in good condition and shall include scanning and oil-immersion objectives. The equipment shall include an Abbe condenser with rack and pinion adjustment, an iris diaphragm, and a mechanical stage. Textbooks Students are required to purchase the textbooks adopted by the School of Medicine Curriculum Committee. Instruments Students are required to purchase the instruments adopted by the physical diagnosis course. PRACTICES AND REGULATIONS Length of academic residence To fulfill the degree requirement pertaining to length of academic residence, it is the usual policy that the student must be registered for full-time course work during the entire junior and senior academic years for the Doctor of Medicine degree. Course exemptions Students who seek exemption from registering for courses that they took prior to entering the School of Medicine must qualify for the exemption by passing a comprehensive examination covering the course material in question. Should the student qualify, in lieu of the regular course the student will be required to participate in an advanced program that may include additional studies, research activities, and/or teaching. A written paper will be required from all students completing the advanced program. The course director, the associate dean of educati onal affairs, and the student will work together to determine the content of the advanced program. Full tuiti on, equivalent to that of the regular program, will be charged. Examinations Students must take examinations at the scheduled time. Students who arrive more than 15 minutes late to an examination\u2014or after another student has left during the examination for any reason\u2014will be denied the opportunity to take the examination. Should a student miss an examination because of an ex cused absence, the examination cannot be made up at a later time. Instead, the comprehensive fina l examination in the course for which the missed examination occurred will be weighted an amount ex tra, proportional to the weighting of the missed examination(s). In addition, course directors may require other remediation at their discretion. In order to have an excused absence, the student must obtain a written excuse from the Office of the Dean prior to the administration of the test in question. This written excuse must then be provided to the course director. Students missing examinations for health reasons must provide documentation from Student Health that they were indeed ill. Whether or not th is documentation is an adequate excuse for missing an examination will be left to the discretion of the Office of the Dean. Students who miss examinations without prior approval from the Office of the Dean have an unexcused absence. As a result, the student will receive a zero fo r the missed examination(s). In the event of a bona fide emergenc y, where prior approval is not feasib le, the Office of the Dean must be contacted as soon as possible. Failure to do so will result in an unexcused absence. 306 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Grading policy Course directors submit grades at the end of the course, indicating the overall evaluation of the student's performance in the course. The grade reflects the success or failure of the student in meeting the objectives of the course in terms of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values. The grade will be recorded as SATISFACTORY if the student exceeded the minimum requirements for overall performance. The grade assigned will be UNSATISFACTORY if the student di d not meet the minimum requirements for overall performance. The grade assigned will be MARGINAL PASS if the student met but did not exceed the minimum requirements for overall performance. Complete promotion and reten tion policies are distributed to each class at orientation. Class standing Class standing is determined by the Office of the Associate Dean for Educational Affairs and is based on student performance on in-house, faculty-generated examinations an d on NBME subject examinations. Promotion Promotion is contingent on satisfactory academic performance. Both cognitive and noncognitive evaluations of academic performance\u2014as well as assessment of personal su itability to assume the responsibilities of the medical profession\u2014are utilized in making promotion decisions. The Academic Review Committee of the School of Medicine periodically reviews student performance and progress and recommends promotion, retention, or dismissal on the basis of the overall academic record. The Student Handbook contains additional details regarding the criteria used by the Academic Review Committee for promotion decisions. Academic probation Students whose cumulative academic record at the end of any academic year is less than satisfactory are placed on academic probation. Withdrawal To withdraw from a course(s), the student must file a Change of Program form; to completely withdraw from school, a Total Withdrawal form must be completed. These forms should be completed and submitted on the last day of class attendance. The date of w ithdrawal used in calculating tuition refunds will be the date on which the properly completed form is submitted to the Office of University Records. USMLE Steps I and II policy States vary in the number of times a student can a ttempt USMLE examinations and still be eligible for licensure. A significant number of states allow no more than three attempts. The school has defined its own limits for number of attempts allowed. Our policy requ ires students enrolled in the Loma Linda University School of Medicine to pass Step I in no more than three tries. Students must complete the clinical course work requ ired for graduation within three years of starting the clinical curriculum; they are permitted a maximum of four sequential attempts to pass Step II of the USMLE. The student's first attempt at passing Step II of the USMLE must take place only after s/he has satisfactorily passed all junior clerkships and prior to his/her completion of all required senior clinical course work. A student who has failed Step II but who has completed all course curriculum requirements must remain enrolled in the School of Medicine as a directed-study student until s/he either has passed Step II of the USMLE or failed Step II of the USMLE for the fourth tim e. During this directed study, the student will be charged tuition. DOCTOR OF MEDICINE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS The School of Medicine requires that a candidate must have met the following requirements for the Doctor of Medicine degree: Completed all requirements for admission. Attended an accredited medical school for four academic years, the last two of which must have been spent at this school. SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 307 Completed honorably all requirements of the curriculum, including specified attendance, level of scholarship, length of academic residence, and credit units. Completed additional special examinations covering any or all subjects of the medical curriculum as may be required. Successfully completed USMLE examinations (Steps I and II), as specified\u2014both clinical skills and knowledge components. Given evidence of moral character, of due regard for Christian citizenship, and of consistent responsiveness to the established aims of the University and of the school. Discharged financial obligations to the University. The candidate is required to participate in graduatio n exercises upon completion of the academic program.

Consent for the student to be absent, granted by the chancellor of the University, is contingent on the recommendation of the dean to the chancellor. The families and friends of graduates are invited to be present at the official conf erring of degrees service. DOCTOR OF MEDICINE/ORAL MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY DEGREE REQUIREMENTS The Doctor of Medicine/Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Program (M.D./OMS) is designed to provide an opportunity for qualified dentists to obtain the Doctor of Medicine degree in a customized, three- year period. Clinical-surgical health care delive ry is emphasized. The content of the program conforms to the Standards of the Commission on Accreditation and is designed to prepare the oral surgeon for certification by the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Oral and maxillofacial surgery residents begin their residency program on the OMS service. They subsequently enter the second year at Loma Linda University School of Medicine with advanced standing. The residents then complete the second, third, and fourth years of medical school. The third year of the M.D./OMS curriculum consists of required clerkshi ps in acute care, neurology, a subinternship in ENT, and preventive and community medicine. An additional 30 units of electives, which include anesthesia and oral and maxillofacial surgery, complete the final year of the medical program. The graduate then enters a one-year general surgery internship, followed by two years of oral and maxillofacial surgery residency. GRADUATE COMBINED-DEGREES PROGRAMS Loma Linda University is committed to fostering the in vestigative skills of its medical students. Students interested in pursuing careers in academic medici ne and medical research may wish to enroll in one of the combined-degrees programs . Combined degrees (M.D. / M.S. or M.D. / Ph.D.)\u2014SM/GS The M.D./Ph.D. combined-deg rees program is available through the Sc hool of Medicine. It includes many of the features of the Medical Scientist Program. St udents in the combined-degrees program complete the first two years of the standard medi cal curriculum. This is followed by three or more years of graduate course work and research to qualif y for a Ph.D. degree, or at least one year for an M.S. degree, before commencing the last two years of the medical school curriculum\u2014the clinical training\u2014for the Doctor of Medicine degree. Majors are offered in anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology and molecular genetics, physiology, and pharmacology. For the M.D./M.S. and M.D./Ph.D. combined-degrees programs, the pr erequisites and Graduate Record Examination requirements are similar to those descri bed for the Medical Scientist Program, except that biochemistry is not required. 308 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Medical Scientist Program (M.D./PH.D.)

MEDICINE\u2014SM 315 Medicine\u2014SM (M.D.) H. ROGER HADLEY, Dean, School of Medicine CURRICULUM The curriculum in medicine consists of four academic years. Instruction is on the quarter system. The first eight quarters are oriented to the sciences basic to the practice of medicine; the remaining two academic years are made up of clinically oriented core instru ction and up to eighteen weeks of clinical electives. THE FIRST YEAR of medical education will begin to es tablish a foundation in the sciences basic to the practice of medicine\u2014with emphasis on the principles and mechanisms of normal development, structure, and function, including the normal changes of aging and the behavioral considerations that influence normal development. Course content will be organized around individual organ systems whenever possible. The first year will also begin to develop the skills, values, attitudes, and professional behaviors that are integral to the safe, competent, compassionate, ethical and Christian practice of medicine both now and in the future. The educational program will make use of a wide variety of pedagogical methods, including but not limited to traditional lecture, small-group, probl em-based and case-based learning, personalized computer-based instruction, quantitative labora tory experiences, and patient-care experiences. THE SECOND YEAR of medical education will continue to establish a foundation in the sciences basic to the practice of medicine\u2014with emphasis on the prin ciples and mechanisms of abnormal structure and function, principles of therapy, and behavioral considerations that affect disease treatment and prevention. Course content will be organized according to indi vidual organ systems whenever possible. The second year will continue to develop the skills, values, attitudes, and behaviors that are integral to the safe, competent, compassionate, ethical, an d Christian practice of medicine both now and in the future. The educational program will make use of a wide variety of pedagogical methods, including but not limited to traditional lecture, small-group problem-based and case-based learning, personalized computer-based instruction, quantitative laboratory experiences , and longitudinal patient-care experiences. THE THIRD YEAR of medical education will establish a body of knowledge, skills, values, attitudes, and behaviors in six core clinical science disciplines to build a foundation for patient care in ambulatory and hospital-based settings. Students will attain this foundation through a process of self-directed learning, independent study, and guided supervision and teaching by house staff and faculty. Students will have ample opportunity to learn the va lue of honor, sh ared responsibility, and acco untability by directly participating in patient-care activities as j unior colleagues on the health care team. The didactic program will emphasize: a) understanding the pathophysiology of disease; b) establishing diagnoses through interpretation of physical examination and diagnostic data; and c) applying management principles to patients with acute and chronic cond itions. Recurring experiences in whole-person care, medical ethics, laboratory medicine, health maintenan ce, and disease prevention will be integrated into the six core disciplines. Students will have the opportunity to explore an area of interest during an elective experience for the purpose of beginning the process of choosing a career in medicine. THE FOURTH YEAR of medical education will require students to integrate the entirety of their medical knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes gained during the first three years and apply it more autonomously to patient care. Students will participate in supervis ed patient-care experiences in neurology or family medicine, emergency medicine, intensive care medicine, and a sub-intern-level experience in medicine, surgery, or pediatrics. Although repetitive clinical duties during the fourth year are a necessary part of preparing students for the rigors of postgraduate tr aining, students will still have ample opportunity to pursue individual interests during a minimum 18 weeks of elective rotations. To reestablish the importance of science in medical practice, at least one month of elective may be in the basic science discipline of the student's choosing. Students will have adequate vacation time to study for Step II of the USMLE and successfully participate in the residency selection process. 316 UNIVERSITY CATALOG WHOLE-PERSON FORMATION Personal and professional growth for the student in medicine is the focus of the disciplines in the school, the faculty in the School of Medicine, and the School of Religion. Courses and content are offered to emphasize biblical, ethical, and relational aspects of the physician's personal and professional development. The core for whole-person formation--14 quarter units of religion and ethics\u2014is provided during the first three years of the medicine curriculum.

SOWERS, Ph.D., Program Director Objectives Loma Linda University is committed to fostering the in vestigative skills of its medical students. Students interested in pursuing careers in academic medicine an d medical research may wish to enroll in one of the combined-degrees programs. The Medical Scientist Program is designed to deve lop a student's independence and competence as an investigative scientist and clinician. It provides stude nts with a broad educational base for the practice of medicine and medically related research. The program is administered by the School of Medicine in cooperation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Program description The program is designed to attract students who are energized by doing research and want to contribute substantially to this enterprise. Students enter this combined-degrees program through the graduate program. In the first year, students participate in a new and revised scientifically integrated program that includes biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, pharmacology, and anatomy. While in the first year, students also rotate through the laboratories of selected faculty members. In the second year, students increase their involvement with individual laboratory projects while continuing to complete graduate course requirements. Students in selected areas may also be asked to serve as teaching assistants for graduate or medical classes. Students pursuing the combined degrees will also be involved with joint basic science and clinical meetings an d conferences with the aim of understanding the interrelationships between laboratory -based and clinical research. Upon demonstration of laboratory su ccess, as indicated by completion of a first-author manuscript, the student will continue on to the traditional first two year s of the medical school curriculum. It is anticipated that the amount of time required to demonstrate la boratory success will be two to three years. Successful students who have acquired essential laboratory skills should continue their affiliation with the host laboratory and continue research progress as time permits while in the medical school curriculum. Upon successful completion of the first two years of the medical curriculum and Step 1 of the USMLE examination, students will begin a series of rotations between the clinical sciences and the research laboratory. During these later years, students will complete all of the standard clinical rotations and continue progress on laboratory projects. It is the intent of this program that students will acquire the requisite skills needed for a successful career at the interface of laboratory-based and clinical research. Program admission Admission into the Medical Scientist Program is competitive and requires evidence that the student is likely to develop into a successful medical scientist. The student must submit separate applications to the School of Medicine for both the M.D. and the Ph.D. degree programs, and meet the stated admissions requirements for each of these programs. The app lication package for the Ph.D. degree program requires scores for the general test of the Graduate Record Examination. Bo th programs must accept the st udent scores before the student is admitted to the Medical Scientist Program. Students entering the M.D./Ph.D. combined-degrees program who determine that a research career is inap propriate may elect to complete the M.D. degree program independently. Students entering the Ph.D. degree program who desire a career in academic medicine may choose to apply for admission to the M. D./Ph.D. combined-degrees program at a point after their entry into the Ph.D. degree program; however, the standard medical school application process will be required at that point.

In 1907 the first class to graduate included seven students\u2014five women and two men. In 1949 the School of Nursing became a college-based progra m granting the baccalaur eate degree. The first master's degrees in nursing were granted in 1957. The Associate in Science degree program was begun as an integral part of the sc hool in 1970. The School of Nursing received its first accreditation by the National League for Nursing (NLN) (61 Broadway, New Yo rk, NY 10006) in 1951. Th e most recent accreditations were by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (One Dupont Circle NW, Suite 530, Washington, DC 20036-1120) in 1999; and the California Board of Registered Nursing (1170 Durfee Avenue, Suite G, South El Monte, CA 91733) in 2003. AGENCY MEMBERSHIP The School of Nursing holds agency membership and actively participates in the following major professional organizations: American Association of Colleges of Nursing, National League for Nursing, and Western Institute for Nursing. Our Mission The mission of the School of Nursing, in accord with the comprehensive mission of Loma Linda University, is the education of professional nurses who are dedicated to excellence in nursing science.

Individuals, created to reflect the whol eness of God's character, have been impaired by the entrance of sin, disease, and death. God's purpose is the restoration of each person to the original state at Creation. God works through human agencies to facilitate individual wholeness. Nursing functions to assist individuals and societal groups to attain their highest potential of wholeness. Through a variety of roles, nurses put into practice a b ody of knowledge and a repertoire of skills to assist the human system with health problems. The School of Nursing provides an environment in which students and faculty can grow in professional competence and Christian grace. In support of the philosophy, mission, and values of Loma Linda University and the philosophy, mission, and values of the School of Nursing, the faculty affirms the following beliefs: Learning is an interactive process that involves all of the learner's faculties. A learning environment nurtures the development of potential, promotes maturation of values, cultivates the ability to think critically and independently, and encourages a spirit of inquiry. Clinical experiences are essential to the deve lopment of professional and technical nursing competence. Students\u2014influenced by the effect of physiological, psychological, sociocultural, developmental, and spiritual variables on their lives\u2014learn in di fferent ways and bring different meanings to the learning experience. Students participate in development of the science and practice of nursing. General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for info rming themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school and outlines the subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs.

For those desiring it, an Associate in Science degree is available at the end of five-to-six quarters when the student meets th e requirements of the California Board of Registered Nursing. Continuing education programs are approved by the Ca lifornia Board of Registered Nursing for continuing education requirements. The master's degree program in nursing offered by the School of Nursing is designed to prepare nurses for Christian leadership in clinical practice, teaching, administration, or research. The Doctor of Philosophy degree program is designed to prepare nurse scho lars for leadership in education, health care administration, clinical practice, and research. STUDENT INVOLVEMENT The school administration encourages the student to become actively involved in the Associated Students of Nursing. Student representatives are members of the Undergraduate Faculty Council, Master's Faculty Council, Doctoral Faculty Council, Curriculum Comm ittee, and Spiritual Life and Wholeness Committee. They may contribute to the administrative decision-making process formally or informally. STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS The following student organizations enable the student to participate in cultural, social, professional, and citizenship aspects of university life. Associated Students of Nursing (ASN) The ASN is a student organization that is sanctioned by the School of Nursing. This association is comprised of all the students of nursing and is admini stered by elected students and two faculty sponsors. The objectives of this organization are to serve as a channel for communication between students and faculty and to facilitate personal and professional growth by meaningful participation in all aspects of student life. Loma Linda University Stude nt Association (LLUSA) The LLUSA has three purposes: to promote communication among students, to present students' views to the administration, and to assist in the programming of social and religious activities. The LLUSA provides opportunities to develop and refine a wide range of professional leadership and fellowship skills. The office is located in the Drayson Center. For more information, call 909/558-4978. Class organizations The members of each class level or ganize, elect officers, and promote such projects and activities as constitute their major interests and concerns. HONOR SOCIETY Through the Nursing Honor Society, which was established in 1973, the School of Nursing further fosters academic excellence and the pursuit of Christian graces. In 1975, in reco gnition of the school's aim of excellence, this honor society, by vote of the national society, became an official chapter of Sigma Theta Tau, International\u2014the international honor society for nursing. Installation of the Loma Linda University School of Nursing's Gamma Alpha Chapter occurred on April 11, 1976. Students and faculty of the School of Nursing, and other nurses of excellence, upon meeting the established criteria and eligibility requirements may, by invitation, become members of the Gamma Alpha Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau, Incorporated. Academic Policies and Practices UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Academic residence To qualify for an Associate in Science degree from Loma Linda University, the student must take a minimum of 24 units while in residence at the Univers ity; to qualify for a Bachelor of Science degree from SCHOOL OF NURSING 373 Loma Linda University, the student must take a minimum of 32 of the last 48 units\u2014or a minimum of 45 total units\u2014while in residence. A minimum of three clin ical nursing courses is required as part of these units. Percentage breakdown for grading The undergraduate division of the School of Nursing uses the following percentages for computing grades: 95-100% A D Below 62% F NURSING COURSES Nursing course grades Most nursing courses in the undergraduate curriculum are divided into approximately equal components of theory and clinical laboratory practi ce. A grade for a nursing course repr esents a combination of the theory and the clinical laboratory grades. In order to pa ss a nursing course, a student must receive a grade equivalent to a C or above in both the theory and clin ical laboratory sections of the course. To receive a passing grade in theory the student must obtain a cumulative score of at least 76% on examinations within that course. A grade of C- or below places the stude nt on provisional status and the course must be repeated. Clinical laboratory Laboratory assignment is under the direction of the instructor. In this assignment the student has supervised experience in the care of patients. Tardiness or unex cused absences from clinical laboratory is cause for failure. Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g ., personal illness or death in the family) must be made up. When a clinical laboratory is made up during nonclinical time, there is a $50 make-up fee. Nursing students are required to practice in client-car e settings under the supervisio n of a registered nurse. Each student will be expected to be able to apply basic theoretical concepts to clinical practice by assessing; planning; implementing nursing procedures; and evaluating the care of individuals, families, and communities. In the performance of routine nursing ca re, all students will function within the policies of the clinical agency and demonstrate the professional behavior outlined in the University CATALOG and the University Student Handbook. Students are expected to be knowledgeable about clients and their problems and about the plans for care prior to actually giving care. They must come prepar ed for the clinical experience and must adequately assess a client using the Neuman-Systems Model. Students are expected to perform skills safely. Students whose performance is deemed unsafe may be dropped from the clinical course. Licensure To be eligible to write the NCLEX-RN examination, the student must have completed all required nursing course work listed in this CATALOG . Further, the student needs to be aware that, under the laws of California, a candidate for the examination is required to report all misdemeanor and felony convictions. If a candidate has a criminal history, the California Boar d of Registered Nursing will determine the eligibility of that individual to write the licensing examination. 374 UNIVERSITY CATALOG CREDIT BY EXAMINATION Challenge/Equivalency examinations An undergraduate student may meet academic requiremen ts by passing an examination at least equal in scope and difficulty to examinations in the course. Un dergraduate students with prior education in nursing or in another health care profession are eligible to challenge nursing courses required for California state licensure. The applicant's background in health care theory and clinical experience must be commensurate with the theory and skills required for the course. Challenge examinations in nursing courses include both a written examination covering theory and an examination of clinical competen ce. See the \"Schedule of Charges\" in this section for fees. Progression to the next level in the program is permissible only after successful completion of the challenge examination. A grade of S is recorded for challenge credit earned by examination only after the student has successfully completed a minimum of 12 units of credit at this University with a G. P.A. of 2.0 or above. A fee is charged for a challenge examination. For fu rther information, see the \"Schedule of Charges.\" Advanced Placement Program Credit toward graduation may be accepted by the school for an enteri ng student who has passed one or more examinations of the Advanced Placement (AP) Program with a score of 3, 4, or 5. Records for AP courses must be sent directly from the Adva nced Placement Program to University Records. ACADEMIC PROGRESSION Progression is contingent on satisfactory schola stic and clinical perfor mance and the student's responsiveness to the established aims of the school and the nursing profession. Students are considered to be making satisfactory progress as long as they maintain a C average (2.0 G.P.A.) and complete the total num ber of units required per year: YEAR CUMULATIVE TOTAL 1st 29 2nd 48 3rd 96 4th 144 5th 193 UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS Withdrawing from a course A nursing student may withdraw only once from a nursing or named cognate course. A student may withdraw (W), failing, from no more than two quarters. Repeating a course A grade of C (2.0) is the minimum passing grade for nursing and required cognate courses. Required cognates include: biochemistry, developmental psychology, epidemiology, ethics, nutrition, sociology, statistics, and writing. Any nursing or named cogn ate course taken while a student at Loma Linda University School of Nursing in which the earned grade is C- or lower must be repeated before the student can progress to another course. A nursing course or required cognate may be repeated only once. When a student repeats a course, both the original and repeat grades are entere d on the student's permanent record; but only the repeat grade and credit are computed in the grade-point average and included in the total units earned. Probation status Students whose cumulative G.P.A. at th e end of any quarter is less than 2. 0, or who have received a C- or below in a nursing course or name d cognate, or who have withdrawn (\"W\") due to failing are placed on academic probation. Students on prob ation status will be required to take NRSG 244 Skills for Academic Success, under the supervision of the Learning As sistance Program (LAP) and to communicate regularly with the academic adviser. Students on probation status may take only one clinical nursing course at a time and no more than 12 units. When the course work has been repeated succe ssfully, the student is returned to regular status. Enrollment in the School of Nursing will be terminated if a student receives two grades of C- or below in nursing or required cognates.

Degrees are conferred at graduations only. The University reserves the right to prohibit particip ation in commencement exercises by a candidate who has not satisfactorily complied with all requirements. GRADUATE PROGRAM POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Academic residence To qualify for a degree from the graduate program in nursing at Loma Linda University, the student must take a minimum of 80 percent of the academic program while in residence at the University. For the master's degree, this would be 42-58 units, depending on the selected concentration area. For the Doctor of Philosophy degree, this would be 66 units. Nondegree student credit A maximum of 12 units may be taken by permission of the instructors pr ior to acceptance into the program. If these courses are part of the curricular plan for the se lected concentration area, and if the grade earned is B or higher, the credits may be applied toward that degree. Extramural study When a student begins a degree program, it is understood that courses taken must be conducted on a campus of the University unless, upon petition for extramural study, the student obtains consent from the program coordinator and the dean. In such instances, the student must arrange with the program coordinator for evaluation of the study and, at its completion, recommendation as to credit and grade. Transfer credits A transfer student who has done acceptable graduate st udy in an approved institu tion may transfer credits up to one-fifth of the units required by the chosen program, to be applied to the degree at Loma Linda University. Such transfer cr edits will not be used to offset work at this University that is less than a B average. This transfer is limited to credits that ha ve not already been applied to a degree and for which a grade of B (3.0) or better has been recorded. A maximum of 9 quarter units that have been previously applied to another degree may be accept ed as transfer credits upon petition. Academic standing The expected earned grade for graduate studies is B or higher, and a cumulative grade-point average of 3.0 or higher. Students must have at least a B (85%) in all the clinical focus courses. If less than a B is the earned grade, the course must be repeated. 376 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Any core or concentration course in which the earned grade is C-or lower must be repeated. Students whose overall grade-point average fa lls below a 3.0 will be placed on academic probation. Should the G.P.A. continue to be less than 3.0 the subsequent quarter, the student will be dismissed from the program. Students who have a grade-point average of less than 3.0 (cumulative or in the nursing major) may not take the clinical focus courses or the comprehensive examination. Clinical probation Clinical work must be evaluated as satisfactory. Faculty may recomm end that the student be placed on clinical probation. While on probation, the student must demonstrate satisfactory clinical work as stipulated by the faculty; or s/he will be dismissed from the school. Application for candidacy A student in the master's degree program will apply for candidacy on Form A after completing at least 25 units of required graduate course work. A doctoral student will follow the policies of the Faculty of Graduate Studies in applying for candidacy. Time limits Any credit transferred to the school or taken in re sidence and submitted toward a master's degree is nullified seven years from the date when the course was completed. Similarly, credit submitted toward a doctor's degree is nullified eight years from the date when the course was completed. The time lapse from first enrollment in a graduate cu rriculum to the conferring of the master's degree may not exceed five years. For the doctor's degree, seven years are allowed after the date of admission; however, students enrolled in an approved combined-degrees program may be permitted nine years. A student desiring reinstatement must reapply to the dean. This procedure implies a re-evaluation of the student's total program. Statistics and research prerequisites Statistics is required as a prerequisite to entry. The courses STAT 414, 415, 509and NRSG 429\u2014described in the University CATALOG \u2014fulfill the prerequisite requirement. SCHOLASTIC STANDING Grade scale The graduate program in nursing uses the follo wing percentages for determining grades: 95-100% D Below 62% F The graduate student is expected to maintain a consis tently high level of perf ormance. The dean receives reports on the quality of work done in order to determine the eligibility of the student for advancement. PRACTICUM EXPERIENCES Practicum experiences shall be individually structured to meet students' needs and program requirements. Practicum experiences are arranged by practicum faculty after consultation with advisers and appropriate agency personnel. Off-campus placement is formalized th rough written contract or le tter of agreement. This process may take as long as six months. Students requesting practicum experiences at sites that will require additional costs\u2014such as faculty travel, phone calls, or legal advice\u2014are responsible for this expense. SCHOOL OF NURSING 377 THESIS AND DISSERTATION The student's research and thesis or dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee.

Zumwalt UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Undergraduate curricula The sections that follow describe the undergraduate cu rricula offered by the School of Nursing (Bachelor of Science degree and the Associate in Science degree option) and list the courses each student must complete. Students are expected to operate under the general policies of the University and school and the specific policies of the degree program in which they ar e enrolled. The school reserves the right to update and modify the curriculum to keep cu rrent with trends in health care. B.S. degree / A.S. degree option The primary aim of the School of Nursing underg raduate nursing program is to prepare competent practitioners who are committed to excellence in practice and to Christian principles. The faculty believe that baccalaureate education in nursing is the basis fo r professional practice. However, in response to both societal and students' needs, an Associate in Science (A.S.) degree option is provided for students after 382 UNIVERSITY CATALOG they have completed all nursing and general education content necessary to prepare for licensure as a registered nurse in California. The basic professional curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in nursing is consistent with the faculty belief that students should be broadly educated. The focus is on the synthesis of nursing knowledge and skills with knowledge and skills from the humanities and sciences. Preparation for practice includes experiences in primary, secondary, and tertiary health care with clients from various age and cultural groups and socioeconomic strata. The curriculum is based on the Neuman Systems Model, which addresses stressors to the client system. Undergraduate program sequence The undergraduate program begins with four quarters of preclinical work, which forms the general education and science base for nurs ing. These quarters may be completed at any accredited college or university. Following six quarters of clinical instruction, additional general education, and cognate courses at Loma Linda University School of Nursing, the stude nt is eligible to receive the A.S. degree and is prepared to write the state board examination. After completion of a nother two quarters, the student is eligible to receive the B.S. degree and is prepared for professional nursing practice at the baccalaureate level. The clinical experience develops the student's technical and theoretical capabilities in a progressive manner and within the context of the nursing process: assessment, analysis, planning, implementing, evaluating. Most of the baccalaureate nursing major is in the upper divi sion, where clinical experience is gained in a broad variety of settings. Integral components of upper-division courses are leadership concepts and skills, research, health promotion, and activities that foster collaboration in planning health care with the family and all members of the health care team. UNDERGRADUATE COURSES Nursing course credits are offered in qu arter units under the following formula: 1. One hour of instruction in theory each week throughout a quarter equals one quarter unit. 2. Three hours of clinical practice each week th roughout a quarter equals one quarter unit. PRECOURSE PREPARATION FOR NURSING (OPTIONAL) These courses\u2014required for students in the PRN\u2014prep are disadvantaged students to be successful in regular baccalaureate nursing classes.

William Hughes, Ph.D. Dean School of Pharmacy School Foundations HISTORY In 1994 a school of pharmacy was proposed to the Loma Linda University Board of Trustees\u2014a program that had been included in earlier University strategic planning initiatives. The board voted in 1995 \"to continue to approve in principle the establishment of a School of Pharmacy at Loma Linda University and to authorize administration to continue with plans for such a school.\" The first dean was appointed in 1996, and a pharmacy advisory committee began reviewing curriculum proposals and drafting a mission statement for the new school. In 2001 an exec utive associate dean was added to the administrative roster. 410 UNIVERSITY CATALOG The primary work of 2001-2002 centered on formulation of program plans, curriculum development, and preparation of documentation for the Accreditation Counc il for Pharmacy Education (ACPE). In addition, recruitment began for faculty and administrative and st aff positions, as well as for students who would enter the inaugural class. On September 19, 2002, orientation began for the first class of the School of Pharmacy. These thirty-four students, \"the pioneering class of 2006,\" adopted as their theme \"working to be patient advocates.\" June 27, 2003, marked a milestone in the history of the school. The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education awarded Candidate status to the program, w ith a school goal of full accreditation status by 2006. Candidate status allowed the School of Pharmacy full membership in the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP). The school's first administrative and faculty delegates were welcomed and seated in the 2003 House of Delegates session. The 34 students of the class of 2006 were joined by 42 students in the class of 2007 and 55 in the class of 2008. The Class of 2009 adds 65 students, which is the intended size of each subsequent class. As of the 2005-2006 school year, the school 's three departments\u2014the Departme nts of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Social and Administrative Sciences, and Pharmacy Practice\u2014were served by twenty-five full-time faculty members, twelve staff, and numerous contract and voluntary educators.

The school will provide one training program for students during orientation week. If students fail to obtain the certif ication at that time, they are responsible for the additional costs required for certification. Class attendance Student attendance in classes is considered to be the cornerstone of professional behavior and is expected in all classes. Instructors may require attendance in class as a condition of passing a co urse or as part of the grade a student earns. Chapel In keeping with the commitment of the mission of the University, all School of Pharmacy students are required to attend a weekly chapel service. The chapel service is a core component of the educational experience at Loma Linda University. By setting aside time each week for a chapel program, the University seeks to emphasize the value it places on spiritual de velopment, corporate wors hip, and community. This also reaffirms the University's commitment to th e ideals upon which it was founded. Chapel services provide opportunities for members of the University community to benefit from programming that integrates faith and learning. Regular attendance is requ ired at the weekly chapel services, as well as the daily services during the quarterly Week of Devotion. Students are expected to fulfill this requirement as they would any other component of the curriculum. Pharmacy forum Pharmacy forum is a scheduled time where professors and students come together to discuss pertinent issues and address professional topics that enhance the student's academic and professional experience. Forum is considered part of the pharmacy curriculum , and each quarter students receive a Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory grade for forum. Attendance is required and is a component of the forum grade. STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS Professional organizations Involvement in professional organizations is an integral part of the educational and professional process within the School of Pharmacy. Activ e involvement and networking with local and state leaders within the professional organizations enhances the overall ed ucational experience and provides opportunities for career development. Active participation in a variety of professional societies is ex pected of all students. Recognized student organizations/S tudent pharmacists association American Pharmacists Association (APhA-ASP ) California Pharmacist s Association (CPhA) California Society of Health Systems Pharmacists (CSHP) American Society of Health System Pharmacists (ASHP) Student National Pharmacists Association (SNPhA) Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP ) National Community Pharmacist Association (NCPA) Christian Pharmacist Fellowship International (CPFI) Tri Health Fellowship Organization membership by invitation The School of Pharmacy endorses three organizations in which student membership is by invitation only. Membership in these organizations is seen as prestig ious and indicative of superior academic achievement and leadership. California Pharmacy Student Leadership (CAPSLEAD) Rho Chi Pharmaceutical Honor Society (RX) Phi Lambda Sigma National Pharm acy Leadership Society (PLS) 414 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Class leadership Each class elects leaders to serve as student represen tatives to administration and to guide the class in addressing student-related issues.

All prerequisites must be completed before a student can enroll in a course. Stud ents must pass all of the professional courses in each year before enrolling in courses in the next year. In addition, each student must pass the end-of-year comprehensive assessment examination. The academic st anding of each student is reviewed quarterly by the Office of Academic Affairs. Students who fail to meet the minimum standards will be notified, in writing, by the Office of Academic Affairs. A minimum grade of C- is required to pass all pharm acy courses and electives. A student's progression will stop following a course failure, and s/he will be placed on leave-of-absence status for two academic quarters (not including summer). The student is resp onsible for completing and filing with the Office of University Records the appropriate paperwork. Failure to do so may result in administrative dismissal. The student must repeat the entire academic term upon return to the program. Petitions for exceptions to this policy must be submitted in writing to the chair of the Academic Standing and Professionalism Committee at 12:00 pm of the first week of the next academic term undertaken by the students. Both the original and repeat course grades are entered on the permanent transcript record; however, only the second (repeat) course grade is used to compute the grade-po int average (G.P.A.). A course may be repeated only once. A student will have a maximum of six (6) calendar years from the initial date of matriculation to complete the Doctor of Pharmacy degree. Progression appeals The Academic Standing and Professionalism Commi ttee will hear student appeals regarding academic progression. The committee's decisions may be appeal ed to the dean of the School of Pharmacy. All SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 415 appeals must be in writing, must follow the proper grievance procedures, and must be filed by the established/stated deadlines. Decisions by the dean of the School of Pharmacy regarding academic progression are final and are not subject to further appeal. End-of-year assessment examinations One of the requirements for progressing from one professional year to the next is passing a comprehensive, year-end, qualifying examination. These examinations are prepared by curricular year-specific teams of faculty members, under the leadership of members of the School of Pharmacy Assessment Committee and under the supervision of the entire School of Pharm acy Assessment Committee. The results of the end-of- year assessment examination will be communicated by the PY1, PY2, PY3 curricular year team chair to the Office of Academic Affairs for communication to individual students. Failure to pass these examinations will delay progression and enrollment in the subsequent year. Students who fail the end-of-year-assessment examination on the first attempt will retake a different, but similar in difficulty, examinatio n as scheduled by the Assessment Committee. Students who fail the second attempt (first retake) must complete an oral examination (second re- take) administered per the Assessment Committee's requirements. The oral examination will be conducted by the curricular year specific team of faculty members. The oral examination will focus on establishing a student's competency in the subj ect matter for the PY1, PY2, PY3 curricular year as appropriate to the specific students. The results will be communicated in writing to the Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs. Students who fail the third attempt (the oral exam) will not progress to the next professional year. GRADING SYSTEM Grades and grade points The following grades and grade points are used in the School of Pharmacy. All courses taught are approved for letter grades only. The exceptions are forum and chapel, which will be graded on a \"satisfactory/ unsatisfactory\" basis. The grades and corresponding grade-point scales are: A 4.0 Outstanding performance. 90-92 A- 87-89 B+ 3.3 83-86 B 3.0 Satisfactory performance. 80-82 B- 2.7 77-79 C+ 2.3 73-76 C 2.0 70-72 1.7 Marginal 67-69 D+ 1.3 Unsatisfactory performance. 60-66 D 1.0 <60 F 0.0 S 0.0 Satisfactory performance in Pharmacy Forum or Chapel. U 0.0 Unsatisfactory performance in Pharmacy Forum or Chapel. Incomplete grade The notation \"I\" (incomplete) in a course is given only for circumstances beyond a student's control. It will not be granted as a remedy for course overload, failure on a final examination, absence from a final examination for other than an emergency situation, or a low grade to be raised with extra work. In order to receive an incomplete, the student must in itiate a request to receive a grade of \"I\" by completing a \"Petition to Receive Incomplete Grade\" form, and stat e the reason for the reques t. If this request is approved, the instructor will report an \"I\" as well as the grade the studen t will receive if the deficiency is not removed within the prescribed time limit. An \"I\" notation must be changed to an earned letter grade before the end of the following term (excluding a summer sessions). Failure to complete course requireme nts will cause the incomplete work to be counted as a zero and factored in with the existing grade to calculate the final grade for the course. 416 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Grade changes A grade may not be changed except when an error has been made in computing or recording a grade. Such changes may be processed only up to the end of the following term. In order to satisfactorily complete a course for which a grade of less th an C- has been earned, the student must repeat the course. This includes attending lect ure and/or laboratory sessions as required, completing the assigned work, and taking any requ ired examinations. Both the original and repeat course grades are entered on the permanent transcript record, but only th e second (repeat) course grade is used to compute the grade-point average (G.P.A.). A course may be repeated only once. Grade appeals A student has the right to file an appeal if there is disagreement regarding the score received on an individual test, final examination, or assignment. The appeal must be in writing using the procedures outlined in the section on STUDENT GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES . Appeals must be filed within 7 business days following the return of the examination or assignment in question. For final examination-grade appeals, the appeal must be filed within 7 days after the end of finals week. Appeals of final course grades must be filed within 21 days after the published date indicating that grades ar e due at the end of an academic term. The st eps outlined in the STUDENT GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES section must be followed. Any examination or assignment returned to the instructor for specific question(s)/review or for an appeal is subject to further review of other questions. Dean's List and honor roll The Office of Academic Affairs co mpiles a list of students who have demonstrated their academic excellence by achieving an outstanding grade point average each quarter. A student who earns a 3.30-3.69 grade point average, with no incomplete grades, during a term is given Honor Roll standing. A student who earns a 3.70 or better grade point average, with no incomplete grades, is given Dean's List standing. Honors and awards The School of Pharmacy awards excellence in scholas tic attainment and leadership abilities. Awards are available to students whose performance and attit udes reflect the mission and goals of Loma Linda University and the School of Pharmacy. Selection of award recipients is a function of the Honors and Awards Committee. The annual honors and awards even t is scheduled at the end of Spring Quarter. PERFORMANCE LEVELS Good academic standing To remain in good academic standing, pharmacy students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade- point average of 2.30. Failure to maintain good academic standing will result in action by the Academic Standing and Professionalism Committee. In addition to the cumulative G.P.A., a grade of at least a C- must be earned in any course for which credit is to be applied towards completion of the requirements of the Doctor of Pharmacy degree. Academic warning Students will be monitored closely for academic prog ression. Faculty members are asked to file mid- quarter grade reports/warnings with the Office of Academic Affairs for a ny student at a C or C- level at midquarter\u2014which is the end of the fifth week or as soon thereafter as possible. The tentative grades provided by the faculty at midquarter will serve as an early alert to the Office of Academic Affairs. A student receiving a midquarter warning from a faculty member will receive notification from the Office of Academic Affairs by letter or email. This notifi cation will request that the student meet with his/her faculty adviser as soon as possible during that quarter. Students are ex pected to monitor their personal academic performance in every course in order to ensure successful completion of course requirements at a C- or better level. A student receiving two or mo re midquarter warnings will be placed on academic warning status and will receive a letter or email copied to the student's faculty a dviser. A student placed on academic warning will be required (as stipulated in th e letter) to meet with his/ her faculty adviser within one week (5 school days) in order to develop a plan for improvement. SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 417 A student risks academic warning when: A faculty member reports a midquarter grade of C or below. Grades of less than C+ are earned on a consis tent basis (monitored by the Office of Academic Affairs, and reviewed by the Academic Standing and Professionalism Committee). There is no appeal process asso ciated with academic warning. ACADEMIC PROBATION Each student's academic status will be reviewed at the end of each acad emic quarter, including cumulative G.P.A. as reported by the Office of University Records. A student with a cumulative G.P.A. of less than 2.30 will be placed on academic probation and will r eceive a letter from the assistant dean of academic affairs. This written notice of academic probation will also include a notice that failure to reach the required G.P.A. by the end of the next two successive academic terms will result in the student being dismissed from the school. Academic probation will also result when a student receives less than a C- in any advanced pharmacy practice experience (A PPE) during the PY4 year Each student on academic probation is required to meet with her/faculty adviser by the end of the second week of the probationary term to develop and agree to, in writing, an academic improvement plan (AIP). The AIP may include mandatory study/advising sessions, mandatory class attendance, and/or other stipulations aimed at encouraging and supporting student academic success. A copy of a student's AIP will be maintained in his/her advising folder, and a copy of the AIP will also be forwarded to the Office of Academic Affairs, which will report to the Acad emic Standing and Professionalism Committee. The faculty adviser is expected to info rm the Office of Academic Affairs of the student's compliance with this policy and of the student's academic progress. Updates will then be provided to the Academic Standing and Professionalism Committee. Failure by the student to seek appropriate assistance from his/her faculty adviser will not be accepted as a valid reason to stop the imposition of the appropriate academic probationary or other status. Academic probation status will remain in effe ct for the two consecutive academic quarters. Upon completion of each academic quarter, a student on aca demic probation will receive in writing, from the Office of Academic Affairs, a notice of his/her current standing. It is expected that students on probation make progress toward good academic standing at the conclusion of each academic quarter. At the conclusion of the second consecutive academic quart er, the student must have achieved good academic standing; failure to do so will result in dismissal. A student risks academic probation when: the cumulative G.P.A. is less than 2.30 for one quarter. s/he fails (less that C-) an APPE during the PY4. Academic probation will be lifted when the student's cumulative G.P.A. rises above 2.30, or when the student successfully completes the type of APPE cour se previously failed. There is no appeal process associated with academic probation. ACADEMIC DISMISSAL As each student's academic status is reviewed at the end of each academic quarter, including the cumulative G.P.A., if it is determined that a student has had a cumulative G.P.A. below 2.30 for two successive academic quarters, the student's case will be brought to the Academic Standing and Professionalism Committee for consideration of dismissal. If previously stipulated probationary requirements have not been met, the student's cas e will be brought to the Academic Standing and Professionalism Committee for consideration of dismissal. Since courses may not be attempted more than twice (i.e., a course may be repeated only once)\u2014including APPEs\u2014grades of D+, D, D-, F, and W are considered to be attempts to complete degree program courses. Failure to complete any course in the program within these limits will also result in dismissal from the program. A dismissed student will receive written notification from the dean of the School of Pharmacy. The notice will include procedures for appeal; and notice of loss of registration, financial aid, housing, etc. It is the 418 UNIVERSITY CATALOG student's responsibility to arrange with the Office of University R ecords for formal withdrawal within one week of receiving the written notifica tion. Dismissed students are requir ed to turn in any school or University ID badges and vacate University residen ce halls. The school will also notify the California State Board of Pharmacy for termination of the student's intern pharmacist license. READMISSION OF DISMISSED STUDENTS A dismissed student may reapply and be considered for readmission. To be considered for readmission, the student must petition (in writing) the Academic Standi ng and Professionalism Committee. Petitions are due in the dean's office by the designated date (following each term), as published and sent to each dismissed student. After review of the written appeal, the A cademic Standing and Professionalism Committee may uphold the dismissal or may recommend the student for re-admission with or without conditions/stipulations. The Admissions Committee reviews each case separately and reserves the right to determine the provisions/conditions for each individual situation. A student who has been dismissed twice is not eligible for readmission to the same degree program for a period of twelve months, or until s/he demonstrates the ability to succeed through course work taken at another institution. Following this twelve-month period, a student may apply for readmission by following the above procedures. The dismissal decisions made by the Academic Standing and Professionalism Committee may be appealed. All appeals must be in writing and submitted to the dean of the School of Pharmacy by the established/stated deadline. A student who questions whether the School of Pharmacy has followed prescribed process with regard to his/her grievance may request the Office of the Chancellor to conduct a review. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PROGRAM It is the student's responsibility to begin the withdrawal process from a course or the curriculum in a timely manner. It is important for the student to seek counse ling or guidance from his/her faculty adviser or other administrative persons regarding a situation that may negatively impact upo n academic performance. Failure to seek appropriate assistance will not be accept ed as a valid reason to stop the imposition of the appropriate academic penalties. If a student finds it necessary to withdraw during the cour se of a quarter, the Offi ce of Student Affairs must be notified in writing. Arrangements for formal withdrawal must then be made in the Office of University Records by completing and submitting a \"Withdrawal from the Program\" form. Courses dropped during the first two weeks of the term are not included in the st udent's permanent record and tuition is refunded. Refer to the University's refund policy in the Financial Information section of the Student Handbook for information that applies after the first two weeks of the quarter. An exit interview with the School of Pharmacy administration is required. EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION The School of Pharmacy participates in the California Board of Pharmacy's approved supervised experiential program. The School will certify 600 of the required 1,500 hours of supervised experience required to sit for the li censing examination. Successful completi on of the School of Pharmacy's didactic and experiential programs, and passing scores on the North American Pharmaci st Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) and the law examination, are required in or der to become a registered pharmacist (RPh) in the state(s) of choice. The experiential program consists of a variety of introductory and advanced experiences designed to provide the student with professional experience through the use of a structured and supervised program of study. Students participating in the experiential program will receive a Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy Experiential Program Manual . Guidelines and policies are listed in this manual and must be adhered to for successful completion of the program. Didactic education is a systematic approach intended to convey instruction and information (classroom, laboratory, recitation, etc.). Experiential education is related to or derived from providing experiences in real-life professional settings. In pharmacy education, the experientia l component is designed to provide in-depth exposure to and active participation in sel ected pharmacy-practice settings. Pharmacy students are exposed to prescription processing, compounding, documenting services, obtaining drug histories, drug- therapy monitoring, counseling, evaluating drug usage, drug-distribution systems, and other relevant pharmacy-practice activities. SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 419 Under the philosophy of pharmaceutical care, the School of Pharmacy offe rs introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPE) that support students' gr owth, strengthen their se lf-confidence, and prepare them to function as self-directed learners. The advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) are designed to help students integrate and refine the skills learned in the first three years of pharmacy (didactic) course work. The ultimate goal of the experiential program is to pr oduce well-rounded, competent, caring, responsible, professionals who can deliver exemplary pharmaceuti cal care; as well as effectively communicate with diverse patients and colleagues. Experiential educ ation requirements The majority of the student's time during experiential courses is out-of-the-classroom activity under the direct supervision of a School of Pharmacy preceptor. Although the student will generally be off campus, Loma Linda University's code of conduct and the guidelines found in the School of Pharmacy Student Handbook are still in effect throughout the completion of this experience. If experiential site regulations and policies differ from University policies, the site policies supersede. In addition to the above-mentioned guidelines, the following items are to be followed by all professional pharmacy students assigned to experiential sites or rotations. Attendance is mandatory. Punctuality is expected, and excessive tardiness will not be tolerated. Students must maintain their University email accoun t and are required to check the account at least daily to keep apprised of important information or announcements. All experiential educational assignments are made through the Division of Experiential Education and are the responsibility of the director of experiential education. No student is allowed to change rotation sites. Students are not to function as an agent or employee of the site. They must identify themselves as pharmacy students from Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy. While participating in this graded experience, students shall not, under any circumstances, receive fina ncial remuneration from the experiential site. Failure to adhere to this po licy will result in suspension and removal from the rotation and receipt of a failing grade in the course. All financial obligations associated with the student 's pharmacy education are the responsibility of the student. These responsibilities include transportation, f ood, lodging, and any other incidental costs related to off-site assignments. Concurrent employment during the experiential experience is not encouraged and does not exclude or excuse students from any responsibilities associated with course requirements. Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy students are required to dress and act professionally at all times. This expectation extends to experiential educat ional activities where the student is not physically on the campus but receives instruction and guidance through a School of Pharmacy preceptor. The Division of Experiential Education requires all stud ents to adhere to the School of Pharmacy dress code and to wear their Loma Linda University identif ication card and short white laboratory coat at all times while at the experiential site. The laboratory co at must be white, clean, and freshly pressed/ironed. Students who attend out of dress code will be considered absent by the preceptor and sent home to fulfill dress code requirements prior to returning to the practice site. In addition to the general school requirements, othe r rules may apply for students who are off site. If the experiential site has special attire or dress-code re quirements, the more stringent of the dress-code requirements prevails\u2014whether that of Loma Lind a University or of the off-site institution. Pharmacy-practice experience In order to complete the curriculum successfully, graduate from the School of Pharmacy, and become a licensed pharmacist, the student is required to complete a minimum of 1,500 hours of practice experiences. The director of experiential education coordinates the two school-based levels of experiential education. Introductory pharmacy practice experience (IPPE) The goal of the introductory experiential education is to expose students to practitioners who provide pharmaceutical care. Under the tutela ge of a School of Pharmacy preceptor, who is also a licensed 420 UNIVERSITY CATALOG pharmacist, the student may have some exposure to di rect patient care. This early exposure helps the student become familiar with the health care environmen t, learn the \"unwritten\" rules of how to navigate in a busy practice setting, and begin to develop the confidence that will be required in future clinical experiences. Advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) Students are also required to complete a total of si x (6), six-week advanced pharmacy practice experiences in specific clinical areas. Four experiences will be in required fields: hospital practice, ambulatory care, internal medicine, and clinical community practice. Two experiences will be in elective fields (see curriculum section). Prerequisites for advanced pharmacy practice experiences In order to progress to the advanced pharmacy pr actice experiences, a student must meet the following requirements: Assessment examination : Students must pass the PY3 end-of-year comprehensive assessment examination PY4 standing: Students must achieve PY4 standing as defined by the School of Pharmacy. The Office of Student and Professional Affairs will notif y the director of experiential education when students successfully complete all PY3 work. Immunizations: Students must safeguard themselves and be sure that all University-required immunizations are up to date. Students are re sponsible for keeping the records of their own immunizations accessible. For the protection of patients and the students themselves, it is highly recommended that students receive the influenza vaccine in Octobe r during their PY4 year. Some sites may require this immunization. Tuberculosis screening: Students must be screened and cleared for tuberculosis (complete a two-step PPD test or chest x-ray) during summer of PY4. Students shall follow specific instructions provided by the Division of Experiential Education. A record of this clearance must be on file in the office of the director of experiential education. Background check: Facilities require a background check of all personnel, including students who are placed on site for APPE. Some ins titutions may require the student to sign a confidentiality agreement or disclosure statement. Background checks are required for entry to the School of Pharmacy; periodic review and update may be required during the program. An updated background check is required prior to starting APPE. Intern license: Students must hold a valid California pharmacists intern license throughout the advanced pharmacy practice experiences . Intern hours: Students must have completed at least 150 intern hours prior to the start of advanced pharmacy practice experiences. CPR/First aid: Students must hold valid certification in both CPR and first aid. Effective dates must be current through the PY4. Student health card: Students must carry the Loma Linda University student heath insurance Card with them at all times. CV: Students must present a copy of their professional CV to the site preceptor at each APPE location. LICENSING Intern pharmacist license All School of Pharmacy students must have a current California intern pharmacist license. Students begin the application process prior to the start of PY1. During the first-year orientation, applications for this license are completed, including a $65 payment by check to the Califor nia Board of Pharmacy. The Office of Student Affairs submits these applications to th e California Intern Pharmaci st Board. All students involved in introductory pharm acy practice experiences (IPPE) an d advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) must hold a current pharmacy inte rn license. Information about the pharmacy intern license can be found on the web page\u2014 <http://www. pharmacy.ca.gov/pdfs2/intern_application_pkt.pdf>. SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 421 It is the student's responsibility to keep his/her pharmacist intern license current and valid. The Board of Pharmacy must be notified of any address, student status, or name change. A photocopy of the student's valid intern pharmacist license must be on file in the school's Office of Experiential Education. Pharmacist intern hours The California State Board of Pharm acy requires each student to accrue 1,500 hours of acceptable intern experience. The School of Pharmacy's introductory and advanced pharmacy practice experiences will fulfill 600 of these hours. The remaining 900 hours must be completed outside the School of Pharmacy curriculum and must consist of employment in a pharmacy under the immediate, direct, and personal supervision of a pharmacist. This experience must be predominately related to selling drugs, compounding prescriptions, preparing ph armaceutical preparations, keeping records, and making reports required by California and federal regulations. A School of Pharmacy graduate is eligible to take the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) after completing 1,000 Internship hours; but the entire 1,500-hour requirement must be completed before licensure can be obtained. Most students begin earning intern hours during the summer after the first professional year (PY1 ). It is the student's responsibility to ensure that all requirements for licensure are met and that all form s are properly completed and sent to the California Board of Pharmacy within the specified timelines. Beginning with the seco nd professional year of study (PY2), internship hours may be earned during quarter breaks and the summer. Hours may also be earned after graduation. GRADUATION RE QUIREMENTS A candidate for the degree of Doctor of Pharmacy at Loma Linda University shall meet all of the following requirements: Satisfaction of all requirements for admission. Satisfactory completion of all requirements of the curriculum, including: o Specified attendance at chapel and forum. o The total number of credit units. o All specified didactic and experiential course work. o All applicable qualifying and comprehensive assessment examinations successfully passed.

Working together, we can empower society to lead health ier and longer lives. Receiving your public health degree is a major step in that rewarding journey. Wishing you success in all facets of your life, David T. Dyjack, Dr.P.H, CIH Dean 434 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Mission, Goals, and Values OUR MISSION The mission of the School of Public Health is to prepare public health professionals for local, national, and international leadership and service through integrating Christian values with public health theory and practice, educational excellence, and research competencies. OUR GOALS The goals of the School of Public Health are to: 1. Educate public health professionals for service in local, national, and international settings. 2. Integrate public health practice with teaching and research in the careers of faculty and the education of students. 3. Expand and disseminate public health knowledge through research and scholarly activities. 4. Promote the development of positive personal health habits in faculty, staff, and students as integral to spiritual values and Christian commitment. 5. Provide public health education through innovative programs to meet the needs of the sponsoring church and populations underserved by public health training and education. 6. Provide health leadership within the University and the community. 7. Encourage responsible management of resources and the environment. 8. Provide appropriate consultation. 9. Encourage an educational environment supportive of diverse population groups. OUR VALUES The School of Public Health believes that the values held by the school and its faculty and staff\u2014and which it seeks to develop in its students\u2014are a consequence of a loving relationship between God and His created beings. This relationship is reflected in the following values: Compassion \u2014The sympathetic willingness to be engaged with the needs and suffering of others. Among the most memorable depictions of compassion in Scripture is the story of the Good Samaritan, which this University has take n as a central symbol for our work. Integrity \u2014The quality of living a unified life in whic h one's convictions are well-considered and match one's actions. Integrity encompasses honesty, authenticity, and trustworthiness. Excellence \u2014The commitment to exceed minimu m standards and expectations. Freedom \u2014The competency and privilege to make informed and accountable choices and to respect the freedom of others. God has called us not to slavery, but to freedom. Justice \u2014The commitment to equality and to treat others fairly, renouncing all forms of unfair discrimination. The God of the Bible is One who calls people continually to justice. According to the prophets, religious faith could only be genuine when it led the believers to \"seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphans, [and] plead for the widow.\" Purity/Self-Control \u2014Morally upright and moderate in all things, with complete control over one's emotions, desires, and actions. Humility \u2014The willingness to serve others in a sacrific ial manner; the self-respect that renounces haughtiness or arrogance. School Foundations History The school's foundation was laid in 1948 with the or ganization of the School of Tropical and Preventive Medicine, the purpose of which was to provide a base for research and teaching. In 1964, plans were made for faculty and facilities to meet the requirements of the Committee on Professional Education of the American Public Health Association (APHA). Three years later, the School of Nutrition and Dietetics (established in 1922) and the Division of Public Health and Tropical Medicine were accredited by AOHA SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 435 and organized under the name Loma Linda University School of Public Health. This name was changed to School of Health in October 1970 to reflect more clear ly the School's emphasis on lifestyle. In response to changing societal perceptions and definitions of \"public health,\" the original name, School of Public Health, was readopted in August 1987. The Center fo r Health Promotion, the Department of Preventive Medicine, and the Preventive Medicine Group were merged into the School of Public Health in 1990. The expanded resources realized by this merger stimulated further growth and development of the school to provide a dynamic learning and research environment for its students and faculty. Accreditation The school has maintained continuous accreditation since it was accredited at its inception in 1967 by the American Public Health Association. It is curren tly accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health, 800 Eye Street NW, Suite 202, Washington, D.C. 20001-1397. The school is also a member of the Association of Schools of Public Health. General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for info rming themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school and outlines the subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review speci fic program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs. University email accounts The University accepts its moral, ethical, and legal re sponsibility for informing an d reminding students of deadlines, regulations, and processes by issuing an email account to every student and communicating with students by email. It is the students' responsibility to read and respond to their email messages from the University. Learning Environment Technology facilities The school is excited by the addition of technology-b lended and fully online courses. Students should be prepared to use email, electronic library resources, online survey tools, course management tools, and other internet communication tools while engaged in the School of Public Health learning environment. With multiple online M.P.H. degree programs and certificates , the School of Public Hea lth is demonstrating its commitment to moving forward with a technology -supported and technology-facilitated learning environment. Note: Tutorials are available to assist members of th is learning community in using the school's various tools. Campus facilities Facilities for the School of Public Health\u2014offices, lecture and seminar rooms, teaching and research laboratories, work and storage areas\u2014are located mainly in and adjacent to Francis Nichol Hall. Additional offices and research facilities are located in Evans Hall and the Parkland Building. DEPARTMENTS AND CENTERS The instructional, research, and service programs within the school are organized and administered by six academic departments and three centers. THE DEPARTMENTS The departments of the School of Public Health ar e as follows: Environmental and Occupational Health, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Health Policy and Ma nagement, Health Promotion and Education, Global Health, and Nutrition. 436 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Department of Environmenta l and Occupational Health The protection of the human environment from natural and man-made hazardous conditions is a major issue of growing concern that affects the health and welfare of people throughout the world. Environmental and occupational health professionals strive to promote health and quality of life by preventing and reducing illness, disability, and death from interac tions between people and their environment over the entire life-span. The science and practice of envi ronmental health currently covers many new responsibilities such as responding to emergencies, educating and training various audiences, and developing new standards and guidelines, or helping formulate public policy. The emergence of new issues and threats\u2014such as food security or natural, technological, humanitarian, and terrorism-related environmental emergencies\u2014establishes the need for an educated and well-pre pared environmental and occupational health workforce. As envi ronmental health professionals must be able to anticipate, recognize, and respond to traditional as well as emerging challenges, they also need to stay current on all of the latest information and technology tools available. Environmental health practitioners are diverse in ba ckground, education, and function. Therefore, the department stresses an interdisciplinary approach to instruction and continually seeks to train individuals with a broad range of backgrounds, value systems, and perceptions of the world. The Environmental and Occupational Health Program provides a California state-approved professional program that leads to the Master of Public Health (M.P.H) degree in environm ental and occupational health.

Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics Although the science of epidemiology began with the investigation of the infectious disease outbreaks, epidemiologists today consider the modern plagues of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and injuries to be a part SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 437 of this relatively young discipline. Contemporary epid emiology builds upon the premise that disease or health is not randomly distributed within populations . Epidemiologists, therefor e, apply a collection of investigative research methods that permeate all fields of public health in order to identify and isolate the underlying causes of disease and injury as well as health. The emphasis placed upon the investigative process has inspired some to describe the epidemiologist as a medical detective. The diversity of this investigativ e science is illustrated by a number of research accomplishments ranging from identification of control and preventive measures for AIDS and diabetes mellitus; to etiologic processes important in the development of malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases, and infectious diseases. Other accomplishments of epidemiology incl ude discovery of social and biological mechanisms involved in the spread of measles, AIDS, and pertussis through human populations; and preventive measures for surgical wound and other hospital-acquired infections. Contemporary epidemiologic inquiry ranges from inve stigation of the roles of prescription medications, nutrition, electromagnetic fields, and pesticides in human cancer; to identification of health benefits of cholesterol reduction, smoking cessation, and use of safety bindings on skis. The efficacy and confirmed success of epidemiology gu arantee an exciting future for those who meet the challenges of this advancing science. The mission of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics is to prepare professionals to serve local, national and international communities as researchers an d consultants qualified to provide an understanding of environmental, genetic, and social characteristics important in disease development and spread; and professionals qualified to select an d apply appropriate statistical theori es, strategies, and techniques to the solution of research problems.

SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 447 MEDICAL RESIDENCIES Preventive medicine and occupa tional medicine residencies Residency training in the two specialties, general preventive medicine and public health, and occupational medicine, is available for qualifie d physicians at the School of Public Health. Both programs are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and prepare residents for certification by the American Board of Preventiv e Medicine (ABPM). Both specialties require the successful completion of an accredited MPH degree. Those applicants who have completed an accredited internship year but not an MPH degree need to apply for the two-year integrated academic and practicum program, while those who have completed an accredited internship y ear and an MPH degree need to inquire regarding applica tion for the practicum year only. Those interested in applying to either of these tr aining programs should cont act the residency office in Nichol Hall, Room 1516 by either calling 909-558-4918 or emailing <ifoster@llu.edu>. Preventive medicine residency The three year program consists of an internship ye ar followed by two years of integrated academic and practicum experiences. Two internship positions are offered through the NRMP Match each year. The program combines the academic and practicum expe rience over two years. During this time, residents will complete their MPH degree and rotate at the community training sites. They are encouraged to major in epidemiology, health administration, or health care practice, but are not required to do so. Practice sites include the Center for Health Prom otion, the Jerry L. Pettis VA Medical Center, Patton State Hospital, Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Fontana, San Bernardino County Department of Public Health, and the Inland Empire Health Plan. A wide variety of intervention programs to reduce health risks and promote healthful living practices are integrated into the second and third year rotations, and an international health emphasis is available for interested residents, including involvement with international projects in developing countries. During the senior year, each resident conducts a resear ch project on a topic of choice, under the guidance of the residency and faculty members at the School of Public Health. Occupational medicine residency Physicians who have completed an internship (Postgradu ate Year 1) year are eligible to apply for the two- year occupational medicine program, which involves an integrated academic and practicum phase. Most residents select an M.P.H. degree major in environm ental health. If an accepted applicant has already completed an accredited degree with a major emphasis in an area other than environmental health, s/he will be required to take the following courses during the training: ENVH 589 Environmental Risk Assessment, ENVH 581Principles of Industrial Hygiene, and ENVH 587 Environmental Toxicology. The program emphasizes the clinical and applied asp ects of occupational and environmental medicine. It focuses on the health of individuals and groups in re lationship to work hazards in the workplace, and on environmental issues. The University takes special inte rest in the assessment of individual health hazards and the identification and promotion of practices that help to reduce ri sk and prevent or postpone disease and injury. During the senior year, each resident conducts a rese arch project on a topic of their choice, under the guidance of the residency and faculty members at the School of Public Health. MEDICAL/DENTAL LEADERSHIP PROGRAM The rising complexity of health care in this countr y and abroad will require increasingly skilled leadership in both the public and private sectors\u2014from sophisticated health care systems to mission hospitals, from research laboratories to primary care. Combining a Master of Public Health degree in an appropriate discipline with an M.D. or D.D.S. degree can provide a sound foundation for young professionals seeking to influence and manage the future. The School of Public Health offers combined de grees programs\u2014M.D./M.P.H. and D.D.S./M.P.H.\u2014for students enrolled in Loma Linda University Schools of Medicine or Dentistry. The didactic course work for 448 UNIVERSITY CATALOG the Master of Public Health degree can be taken in any major within a twelve-month period after either the second or third year of the M.D. or D.D.S. progra m. In some cases, additional time may be required for field work. Each student is expected to concentrate full time on the Master of Public Health degree during the designated year. Applications will be reviewed competitively, with particular focus on potential for future health care leadership. DISTANCE LEARNING PROGRAMS The School of Public Health offers master's degree programs in various majors online and at off-campus sites to meet the needs of qualified individuals who seek to develop graduate-level competencies in public health but who for a variety of reasons choose not to be full-time, on-campus students. The School of Public Health has ha d much experience in offering di stance-learning master's degree programs. For more than thirty years the School of Public Health has adapted its program-delivery style to meet the needs of busy professionals. Currently the Sch ool of Public Health's Online Executive Master of Public Health Degree Program caters to both local and international students. The school also offers M.P.H. degree programs in Russia and Peru, and an M.B.A. program in Guam and Hawaii. The off-campus programs require the scho ol's faculty to travel to the education site and teach courses in the condensed format. The School of Public Health research shows that this form of instruction is just as effective as the less condensed method, especially with experienced professionals eager to learn. General degree requirements All applicants to the Distance Learni ng Programs must meet the general admissions requirements found in Section II of this CATALOG . DISTANCE LEARNING FINANCIAL INFORMATION Financial policies Tuition for the Online M.P.H. degree program courses is the same as the on-campus tuition rate.

SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 449 ONLINE EXECUTIVE MASTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH The Online Executive Master of Public Health Degree Program is o ffered with a major in both public health practice and health education. This is a thre e-year, blended program with online courses as well as two, two-week required residential sessions. A new cohort of students begins each August when students come on campus for two weeks. During this time they plan a program of study with their adviser, complete 5 units of course work, become familiar with the tech nology, and get to know the other students in the group. Students go home ready to study online as well as ready to support and mentor each other. It is a very positive way to learn. At the beginning of the second year, students return to Loma Linda University for two weeks; this is the last on-campus requirement. The program closes with a culminating activity, which includes a comprehensive examination, the community practicum report, preparation of a portfolio, and an exit interview. Course load A full-time graduate course load consists of 8 units , and a half-time graduate course load is 4 units. Students in the Distance Learning Program who need to qualify for financial aid must take a minimum of 4 units per quarter to establish and maintain eligibility. Proctors Some courses require a proctored examination. Each student is required to have on file with the Office of Distance Learning a signed proctor contract with the na me of a person who will serve as his/her permanent proctor. A proctored examination is automatically sent to this person. The proctor may not be a relative or someone living in the same house as the student. The registrar of a local college or university, a librarian, or a minister is considered an appropriate proctor. Residential requirement Only the Online Executive M.P.H. degree program has a residential requirement. Online students must come to Loma Linda University for two weeks in August to start the program and again for two weeks at the beginning of the second year of study. There is no residential requirement in the third year. INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS Peru M.P.H. M.P.H. degree programs are offered in Peru. These programs are designe d around the specific needs of the community. Majors are offered in health education and promotion, as well as in maternal and child health. The programs of instruction are offered in Spanish. Russia M .P.H. In August 2005, an M.P.H. degree program was established in Russia. Two public health practice streams are offered\u2014one with a health education focus; th e other with a research, epidemiology, and program planning focus. These programs are building teams of people who can address the public health needs of the local people and help to build public health infras tructure. The programs of instruction are offered in Russian. Pacific M .B.A. In August 2006, the School of Public Health began Master of Business Administration degree programs in Hawaii and Guam. This degree, with an emphasis in health administration, provides students with a broad understanding of health care management and prac tical experience in applying learned principles. Graduates are prepared for careers in upper administration in health service organizations--including medical centers, hospitals, health plans, physician group practices, and long-term and managed care settings. CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS The School of Public Health offers certificates in various programs to meet the needs of qualified individuals seeking to develop competencies in specialties in public health but who for a variety of reasons do not choose to become full-time, degree-seeking students. 450 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Instruction for the certificate program is primarily prov ided by regular School of Public Health faculty members on campus during regular quarter terms. St udents are responsible to follow regular registration procedures during regularly scheduled time periods. GENERAL CERTIFICATE INFORMATION Course work Course sessions are conducted during regular term sessions. Certificate courses offered are regular School of Public Health courses.

Certif icate courses are taught on a quarter-term system, although selected courses may be offered by special arrangements. Religion course requirement Registration and completion of a 3-unit, graduate-level , religion course is mandatory for completion of each certificate program. Religion courses must have an REL_ prefix and be offered through Loma Linda University. The purpose of the religion requirement is to provide a spiritual dimension to the professional training of public health students, to provide students with an opportunity to further develop their skills in dealing with life's challenges, and to provide opportunity for personal spiritual growth. Course units will not be transferred from other universities and institutions, nor is a waive option available, regardless of educational background. Traditional letter grading is required. GENERAL CERTIFICATE REQUIREMENTS All applicants to the certificate programs must meet the general admissions requirements found in Section II of this CATALOG . Course work is graduate level; therefore, students must demonstrate eligibility for application to a graduate-level program. Course format In general, courses are taught in the same format as regularly scheduled on-campus courses. However, in addition, Web-based courses and/or intensive-format courses may be utilized. These courses are tailored to the adult learner, with clear appli cation and examples from the public health professional world. These courses represent the same course requirements and credit units as those applicable to degree programs. Grade-point average A grade-point average (G.P.A.) of 3.0 (B) must be maintained. Financial clearance The student is expected to maintain a clear financia l status at all times. Financial clearance must be obtained prior to the following: registering for any class; receiving a certificate; or requesting a transcript, statement of completion, or other certification to be issued to any person, organization, or professional board. Application to a degree program Participants completing an advanced certificate prog ram or a second certificate program may apply to a degree program offered at the School of Public Health. In general, this will require adding the public health core courses (28 units) and any additiona l requirements of the degree program. TEN CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS The School of Public Health offers ten certificate pr ograms and information on certification as a fitness instructor for the American College of Sports Medicine. Certificate in Basic Biostatistics Certificate in Basic Epidemiology Certificate in Advanced Biostatistics Certificate in Advanced Epidemiology Certificate in Epidemiol ogical Research Methods Certificate in Health Geoinformatics Certificate in Emergency Preparedness and Response SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 451 Certificate in Reproductive Health Certificate in Tobacco-Control Methods Certificate in Lifestyle Intervention Biostatistics and Epidemiology Five certificate programs are offered through the De partment of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. These programs offer specific skills in the biostatistics and epidemiology areas to professionals and others who desire to add these skills to their practices in public h ealth but who do not necessarily wish to earn degrees. In addition, these programs may serve as an introduction to graduate study. Students who have the opportunity to complete the basic certificate programs may eventually enter the master's degree programs. Students who successfully complete the basic certificat e programs must apply for regular acceptance into a master's or doctoral degree program in the School of Pu blic Health prior to taking course work toward a second or advanced certificate program. The purpose of the certificate program in epidemiological research methods is to enable the holder to be more effective in applying for and designing research studies and surveys and doing basic descriptive analyses of collected data. Health geoinformatics The certificate in health geoinformatics is offered through the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health. The purpose of this certificate is to prepare participants to apply geospatial information science and technologies to public health practice, research, and learning. These skills are highly desired today as an integral part of health informatics competencies that are required of health professionals, as outlined in the 2002 Institute of Medicine (IOM) reports. Upon completion of this program, participants should be able to: State the basic principles of geospatial information science as they relate to health research and practice.

In July of 1990, the Faculty of Religion (now the Sch ool of Religion) was established to assist in this integration. PHILOSOPHY As implied by its motto, \"TO MAKE MAN WHOLE,\" the Un iversity affirms these tenets as central to its view of education: God is the creator and sustainer of the universe. Mankind's fullest development entails a growing understanding of the individual in relation to both God and society. The quest for truth and professional expertise, in an environment permeated by religious values, benefits the individual and society and advances the ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. MISSION STATEMENT The School of Religion is committed to the following f our tasks, as informed by the teachings and practice of the Seventh-day Adventist heritage and mission: 1. To promote Christian wholeness for faculty and students in their personal and professional lives and witness. 2. To provide a religion curriculum with the following emphases: Theological studies (biblical, historical, doctrinal, mission, and philosophical). Ethical studies. Relational studies (applied theology, clinical ministry, and psychology of religion). 3. To foster and support research in theo logical, ethical, and relational disciplines. 4. To serve the University, the church, and the larger world community by personal involvement in fostering deeper spirituality, theological integrity, and social justice. General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for info rming themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school and the subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review specific program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs. Application and Admissions The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committees of the schools accomplis h this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant qualities of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. SCHOOL OF RELIGION 567 APPLICATION AND ACCEPTANCE Where to write Inquiries regarding application and admission should be addressed to: Office of Admissions School of Religion Loma Linda University Loma Linda, CA 92350 Application procedure 1. Two copies of the graduate application should be filled out and mailed, together with the application fee, to the above address. Applications and all supporting information, transcripts, test results, and references should be submitted at least two months before the beginning of the term for which admission is sought. Some programs require applications to be completed by a much earlier date. 2. Two complete official transcripts of all acade mic records from all colleges, universities, and professional or technical schools should be provid ed. It is the applicant's responsibility to arrange to have the transcripts, including official English translations if applicable, sent directly by the registrar of each school attended to the School of Religion Office of Admissions. Transcripts that come via an intermediary are unacceptable. 3. A personal interview is often desirable and should be arranged with the coordinator of the program in which the student wishes to study. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS A four-year baccalaureate degree (or its equivalent ) from an accredited college or university is a prerequisite for admission to the School of Religion. Transcripts of the applican t's scholastic record should show appropriate preparatio n, in grades and content, for the curriculum chosen. Since there is some variation in the pattern of under graduate courses prescribed by different programs, the student should note the specific requirements of the chosen program. Deficiencies may be removed while enrolled; prerequisites must be complete d prior to acceptance into the program. Scholarship Applicants are expected to present an undergraduate reco rd with a grade-point averag e of B (3.00) or better in the overall program and in the field of the major. Some students with an overall grade-point average between 2.50 and 3.00 may be admitted provisionally to graduate standing, provided the grades during the junior and senior years are superior, or there is other evidence of capability. Academic probation Degree students whose cumulative G.P.A. at the end of any quarter is less than 3.0 will be placed on academic probation. The number of units for subsequent registrations is restricted to a maximum of 12 per quarter. Students who are on academic probation and fail to make a 3.0 for the next quarter, or who fail to have a 3.0 G.P.A. overall after two qu arters, jeopardize their standing in a degree or certificate program and may be dismissed from school. Concurrent admission Students may not be admitted to a School of Religion program while admitted to another program at this University or elsewhere.

Schola rs in the natural sciences , the human sciences, and numerous applied sciences recognize the importance of examining religion from their particular perspectives. And religion scholars appreciate the importance of the questions that the methods and conclusions of the sciences raise for religious belief and practice. As a Seventh-day Adventist health-sciences university, Loma Linda University rests on the conviction that there is a positive relation between religion and the sciences. Its commitment to a variety of health professional programs reflects the belief that the natural world is God's good creation and that human beings are inherently part of the physical order of things. Its commitment to higher education, including various avenues of graduate study, expresses the belief th at all truth is God's truth, and that the acquisition of truth calls for the diligent application of all our powers. These convictions support the attempt to bring scientific knowledge within the overar ching perspective of Christian faith. This Master of Arts degree is designed for several types of students: those who want a degree in religion and science before pursuing further graduate work in one or the other of these areas; graduate students in the natural and social sciences who would like to combine their other academic interests with a serious study of religion; students in professional programs who also have an interest in the area of religion and science; and individuals who wish to explore the interf ace of religion and the sciences within the context of serious academic work. The Religion and the Sciences Program is administered by the School of Religion. It draws on resources from various sectors of the campus, including the Department of Earth and Biological Sciences faculty of the School of Science and Technology; the Department of Psychology faculty of the School of Science and Technology; and the members of other faculties in the Un iversity, as well as other scholars and professors with expertise in the area. The program is designed to encourage and assist students to: 1. Understand the various ways people view the relation between science and religion. 2. Appreciate the distinctive features or scientific and religious study. 3. Appreciate religion and science as contrasting, yet complementing, approaches to truth. 4. Participate in the ongoing conversation surrounding the relation of religion and the sciences. Admission In addition to meeting admission requirements for the School of Religion, the applicant to the Religion and the Sciences Program must: 1. Propose clear personal and professional goals an d ways in which the Religion and the Sciences Program may facilitate their realization. 2. Persuade the Admissions Committee, by previous accomplishments, that s/he is able and willing to reach these goals and to make a sign ificant contribution to the field.

It is my hope that the time spent with us will reward you with new knowledge, skills, and attitudes that are transforming\u2014transforming your life, the lives of others, and the world around you. The School of Science and Technology (SST) offers a grand diversity of academic programs that integrate the highest standards of profe ssional competencies with Christian values of service to humankind. Loma Linda University has chosen the following seven core values to identify as life-transforming principles that we wish to emulate and share with all we meet: justice, compassion, humility, integrity, excellence, freedom, purity/self-control. These values are exemplified by the teachings and life of Jesus Christ and are symbolized by the statue of the Good Samaritan that stands in the center of our campus. The School of Science and Technology provides academically diverse graduate school training in fields ranging from geology and ecology to social work, family counseling, and psychology. Given the nature of our diverse professional and research-oriented training, our school emphasizes integration of disciplines. We cherish and foster interdisciplinary studies that seek the blending of knowledge and research approaches found in the traditions of various schools of thought and academic traditions found within and among the eight schools of Loma Linda University. Nearly all of the academic programs offered by the School of Science and Technology are graduate school offerings. As graduate programs, they emphasize the creation of new knowledge. Most programs are research oriented or have major research components as part of their requirements. Many of our degrees are granted in conjunction with the Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS), an academic body of experienced research professors who establish graduate school and research advisement standards for all research- oriented graduate programs at Loma Linda University. SST research advisers will work closely with you to ensure that your program meets or exceeds the standards established and reviewed by the Faculty of Graduate Studies. I am delighted that you have chosen to join our academic family. By pursuing a lifelong commitment to excellence and following in the footsteps of those wh o serve humankind, you will discover a rich way of life that brings healing, health, and knowledge to a suffering world. Thank you for joining us in your journey of service. Sincerely, Beverly L. Buckles Dean, School of Science and Technology 584 UNIVERSITY CATALOG School Foundations The School of Science and Technology (SST)\u2014one of Loma Linda University's newest schools\u2014 includes the Departments of Earth and Biological Sciences, Counseling and Family Sciences, Psychology, and Social Work and Social Ecology. Many of the programs offered have matured on campus for a decade or more; one program was established half a century ago. The school offers degree programs through the doctoral level, postdegree certificates, and a certificate programs in Spanish; as well as courses that meet the University's general education requirements. Technology programs, such as e-Health Technology, are currently being developed by the school. PHILOSOPHY The School of Science and Technology is mission driv en and academically incorporates the University's commitment to the teaching and h ealing ministry of Jesus Christ, which produces wholeness within transformed lives. Transformation is a lifelong faith-and-learning process\u2014a process committed to pursuit of the highest levels of scholarship, professionalis m, and spiritual well-being. This pursuit seeks to understand and promote healthy minds, communities, so cial systems, families, and the environment. Wholeness for self and for others is central to a balance between mind, body, and spirit. Such wholeness manifests itself in a life of service to humanity, to the environment, and to God. The School of Science and Technology values the time-honored and separate traditions in higher education for \"academic\" and \"professional\" programs and advocat es the integration of knowledge and research, blending the \"pure\" with the \"applied\" sciences. In the School of Science and Technology of Loma Linda University, the essential concern of both faculty and students is the quest for meanin g. Because this quest is served by knowledge, graduate students are obliged to achieve both broad and detailed mastery of their field of study. They also participate with the faculty in the process by wh ich knowledge is created and transformed into wisdom. OBJECTIVES The School of Science and Technology attempts to create an environment favorable to the pursuit of knowledge and meaning by: 1. Making available to graduate students who wish to study in a Seventh-day Adventist Christian setting the education necessary for scholarly careers in the sciences and the health professions. 2. Encouraging development of independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication. 3. Relating intellectual achievement to the service of humankind. Application and Admissions APPLICATION AND ACCEPTANCE Application procedure 1. The application instructions, available on the Web at <www.llu.edu/apply>, allow students to apply online and begin an application. Applicati ons and all supporting information, transcripts, test results, and references should be submitted by the deadline posted on the application, per degree. 2. Complete official transcripts of all academic records from all colleges, universities, and professional or technical schools must be provided for official acceptance into a program. It is the applicant's responsibility to arrange to have the transcripts\u2014including official English translations, if applicable\u2014sent directly to Admissions Processing. Transcripts that come via an intermediary are unacceptable. 3. A personal interview is often desirable and is required by some programs. The interview should be arranged with the coordinator of the program in which the student wishes to study. SCHOOL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 585 Acceptance procedure 1. When the program that the student wishes to enter has evaluated the applications and made its recommendation, the dean of the School of Sc ience and Technology takes official action and notifies the applicant. The applicant must resp ond affirmatively before becoming eligible to register in the School of Science and Technology. 2. As part of registration, accepted students will be asked to file with student health service a medical history with evidence of certain immunizations. 3. Transcripts of records and all other application do cuments are retained by the University and may not be withdrawn and used for any purpose. Records of students who do not enroll or who withdraw prior to completion are retained for two years from the da te of original acceptance to the School of Science and Technology program. 4. New students are required to pass a background check before they regi ster for classes. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS A four-year baccalaureate degree (or its equivalent ) from an accredited college or university is a prerequisite for admission to the School of Science and Technology's graduate programs. Transcripts of the applicant's scholastic record should show appropriate pr eparation, in grades and content, for the curriculum chosen. Since there is some variation in the pattern of undergraduate courses prescribed by different programs, the applicant should note th e specific requirements of the chos en program. Deficiencies may be fulfilled while enrolled; prerequisites must be completed prior to matriculation. Scholarship Applicants are expected to present an undergraduate re cord with a grade-point av erage of B (3.0) or better in the overall program and in the field of the major. Some students with an overall grade-point average between 2.5 and 3.0 may be admitted provisionally to graduate standing, provided the grades of the junior and senior years are superior or there is other evidence of capability. Graduate Record Examination Scores on the general test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) are required with applications for admission to many degree programs. New test scores are needed if it has been more than five years since the last test was taken. Applicants are advised to request information specific to their proposed program of study. For complete information about the GRE, please visit their Website at <http://www.gre.org>; or write to Educational Testing Service, 1947 Center Street, Berkeley, CA 94701 (for the West); and P.O. Box 6000, Princeton, NJ 08541 (for the East). For GRE publications (including study materials), call 800/537-3160. When pressure of time makes it impossible to secure the results of the GRE or its alternatives, students seeking admission who have otherwise above-average achievement may be admitted provisionally, subject to review when the required test re sults are received. In such cases, test results are to be submitted within the first quarter of attendance. Certain programs with limited ad missions may require the GRE results prior to acceptance, while some programs require the subject test. Please check student guides from individual programs for further information. Programs that do not require the GRE must submit one additional measure of a candidate's preparation for graduate study. This may be either an evaluation of critical essay writing skills, the Miller analogy test, or the results of a structured interview. Re-entrance Students who are currently enrolled in the School of Science and Technology may request transfer to a different program or a more advanced degree level by contacting the School of Science and Technology Admissions Office for information on an abbreviated application and instructions for submitting the appropriate supporting documents. Transcripts on file with the University are acceptable. 586 UNIVERSITY CATALOG English competence All international students are encourag ed (particularly those who do not have an adequate score on TOEFL or MTELP or other evidence of Englis h proficiency) to attend an inte nsive American Language Institute prior to entering their program because further st udy of English may be required to assure academic progress. FROM MASTER'S TO PH.D. DEGREE Bypassing master's degree A graduate student at this University may proceed first to a master's degr ee. If at the time of application the student wishes to qualify for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, this intention should be declared even if the first objective is a master's degree. If after admission to the master's degree program a stude nt wishes to go on to the doctoral degree, an abbreviated application should be completed and submitted, along with appropriate supporting documents, to the School of Science and Technology Admissions Office. If the award of the master's degree is sought, the student will be expected to complete that degree before embarking on doctoral activity for credit. A student who bypasses the master's degree may be permitted, on the recommendation of the guidance committee and with the consent of the dean, to transfer courses and research that have been completed in the appropriate field and are of equivalent quality and scope to his/her doctoral program. Second master's degree A student who wishes to qualify for an additional master's degree in a different discipline may apply. The dean of the School of Science and Technology and the faculty of the program the student wishes to enter will consider such a request on its individual merits. Concurrent admission Students may not be admitted to a School of Science and Technology program while admitted to another program at this University or el sewhere. The exceptions to this are the combined-degrees programs, discussed in the following paragraph. Combined degrees The School of Science and Technology provides for concurrent registration for two degrees only in its combined therapy/clinical ministry), and M.S./M.P.H. Concurrent application is required in some but not all of these programs. See Combined-Degrees Programs at the end of Section III. Certificate programs The School of Science and Technology offers several postbaccalau reate certificate programs. Students accepted into such programs will be assigned to an ad viser who will work with them as they fulfill the program requirements. Students will be required to main tain a B- (2.7) grade-point average, with no course grade below C (2.0). All certificate students are required to take at least one 3-unit religion course (numbered between 500 and 600). MASTER OF ARTS / MASTER OF SCIENCE / MASTER OF SOCIAL WORK Adviser and guidance committee Each student accepted into a degree program is assigne d an adviser who helps to arrange the program of study to meet University requirements; subsequently (no later than when applying for candidacy), the student is put under the supervision of a guidance committee. This committee is responsible to and works with the coordinator of the student's program in arranging courses, screening thesis topics (where applicable), guiding research, administering final wr itten and/or oral examinations, evaluating the thesis and other evidence of the candidate's fitness to receive the degree , and ultimately recommending the student for graduation. SCHOOL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 587 Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Gaps in an applicant's academic ach ievement will be identified by subject and classified either as prerequisites or as subject deficien cies. Applicants lacking certain subj ect or program prerequisites may not be admitted to the master's degree program until the pr erequisites are completed (at Loma Linda University or elsewhere) and acceptable grades are reported. Ho wever, subject deficienci es do not exclude an applicant from admission or enrollment; but they must be removed as specified by the adviser or dean, usually during the first full quarter of study at this University. Study plan The student's adviser should develop with the student a written outline of the complete graduate experience, with time and activity specified as fully as possible. This will serve as a guide to both the student and the adviser as well as to members of the guidance committee when it is selected. The study plan is changed only after careful consultation. The student is ultimately responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of all required courses. Time limit The time allowed from admission to the School of Science and Technology to conferring of the master's degree may not exceed five years. Some consideration may be given to a short extension of time if, in the dean's opinion, such is merited. Course credit allowed toward the master's degree is nullified seven years from the date of course completion. Nullified courses may be revalidated, upon successful petition, through reading, conferences, written reports, or examination to assure currency in the content. Residence Students must meet the residence requ irements indicated for their partic ular program (never less than one academic quarter). The master's degree candidate must complete one quarter of full-time study at the University or perform the thesis re search at the University. Although st udents may register for up to 12 units each quarter, a student is considered in full- time residence if registered for at least 8 units. Minimum required grade-point average The required minimum grade is B (3 .0) on all work for the master's degree. This average must be maintained in formal courses and in research, computed separately. A student submitting transfer credits must earn a B grade on all work accept ed for transfer and on all work ta ken at this University, computed separately. Research competence Student skills required in research, language, investig ation, and computation are specified in each program description in this CATALOG . Comprehensive and final examinations The student must take the written, oral, and final examinations prescribed by the program on or before the published dates. If a candidate fails to pass the or al or written examination for a graduate degree, the committee files with the dean a written analysis of th e candidate's status, with recommendations regarding the student's future relation to the school. The stude nt receives a copy of the committee's recommendation. Thesis Students writing a thesis must register for at least 1 unit of thesis credit. The resear ch and thesis preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for candidacy. The student must register and pay tuition for thesis cr edit, whether the work is done in residence or in absentia. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and thesis , continuous registration is to be maintained until the manuscript has been accepted. This in volves a quarterly enrollment f ee paid at the beginning of each quarter. 588 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Candidacy Admission to the School of Science and Technology or designation of regular graduate standing does not constitute admission of the student to candidacy for a graduate degree. After achieving regular status, admission to candidacy is initiated by a written petition (School of Science and Technology Form A) from the student to the dean, on recommendation of the student's adviser and the program coordinator or department chair. Students petitioning the School of Science and Technology for candidacy for the master's degree must present a satisfactory grade record, in clude a statement of the proposed thesis or dissertation topic (where applicable) that has been approved by the student's guidance committee, and note any other qualification prescribed by the program. Students are usually advanced to candidacy during the third quarter after entering their course of study toward a degree in the School of Science and Technology. Specific program requirements In addition to the foregoing, the student is subject to the requirements stated in the section of the CATALOG governing the specific program chosen. Religion requirement All master's degree students are required to take at least one 3-unit religion course. Courses (numbered between 500 and 600) in social ethics, bioethics, psychology of religion, or philosophy of religion meet this requirement. Combined-degrees programs A number of combined-degrees programs are offered, each intended to provide more comprehensive preparation in clinical applications and the biomedical sciences. Both require concurrent admission to two programs in the School of Science and Technology and/or a professional school in the University. These curricula are described in greater detail under the heading \"Combined-Degrees Programs\" in this section of the CATALOG . THESIS AND DISSERTATION The student's research and thesis or dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as is feasible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. Format guide Instructions for the preparation and format of the publishable paper, thesis, or dissertation are in the \"Thesis and Dissertation Format Guide,\" ava ilable through the Faculty of Graduate Studies dissertation editor. Consultation with the dissertation editor can help the student avoid formatting errors that would require him/her to retype large sections of manuscript. The last day for submitting copies to the school office in final approved form is published in the events cal endar (available from the academic dean's office). Binding The cost of binding copies of the thesis or dissert ation to be deposited in the University library and appropriate department or school collection will be paid for by the student's department. The student will be responsible for paying the cost of binding additional personal copies. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy degree is awarded for evid ence of mature scholarship; productive promise; and active awareness of the history, resources, and demands of a specialized field. Adviser and guidance committee Each student, upon acceptance into a degree program, is assigned an adviser who helps arrange the study program. Subsequently (no later than when applying for candidacy), the student is put under the supervision of a guidance committee. The School of Science and Technology requires advisers for Doctor of Philosophy degree candidates to have demonstrated consistent research productivity in their chosen disciplines. Each program maintains a list of qualified doctoral degree mentors. The guidance committee, usually chaired by the adviser, is responsible to and works with the coordinator of the student's program in SCHOOL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 589 arranging course sequences, screening dissertation topics, recommending candidacy, guiding research, administering written and oral examinations, evaluating the dissertation/project and other evidence of the candidate's fitness to receive the degree, an d recommending the student for graduation. Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Gaps in an applicant's academic ach ievement will be identified by subjects and classified as either prerequisites or as subject deficiencies. Applicants lacking subject or program prerequisites may not be admitted to the Ph.D. degree program until the prerequisites are completed (at Loma Linda Univ ersity or elsewhere) w ith acceptable grades. Subject deficiencies do not exclude an applicant from admission or enrollment; but they must be removed as specified by the adviser or dean, usually at the beginning of the gradua te experience at this University. Study plan The student's adviser should develop with the student a written outline of the complete graduate experience, with time and activity specified as fully as possible. This serves as a guide to both the student and the adviser, as well as to members of the guidance committee when it is se lected. The study plan is changed only after careful consultation. The student is ultimately responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of required courses. Time limit Completion of the graduate experience signals curre ncy and competence in the discipline. The dynamic nature of the biological sciences makes dilatory or even leisurely pu rsuit of the degree unacceptable. Seven years are allowed for completion after admission to the Ph.D. degree program. Extension of time may be granted on petition if recommended by the guidance committee to the dean of the School of Science and Technology. Course credit allowed toward the doctorate is nullifie d eight years from the date of course completion. Nullified courses may be revalidat ed, upon successful pe tition, through reading, conference, written reports, or examination to assure currency in the content. Residence The School of Science and Technology requires two years of residency for the doctoral degrees\u2014D.M.F.T, Psy.D., Ph.D.\u2014spent on the campus of the University after enrollment in a doctoral degree program. During residence, students devote full time to graduate activity in courses, research, or a combination of these. A full load of courses is 8 or more units each qu arter; 36 or more clock h ours per week is full time in research. Students may be advised to pursue studies for limite d periods at special facilities not available at Loma Linda University. Such time may be considered residenc e if the arrangement is approved in advance by the dean of the School of Science and Technology. The spirit and demands of doctoral degree study require full-time devotion to courses, research, reading, and reflection. But neither the passage of time nor preoccupation with study a ssures success. Evidence of high scholarship and original contribution to the fi eld or professional competence form the basis for determining the awarding of the degree. Minimum required grade-point average Students must maintain a grade-point average of at least a B (3.0) to continue in regular standing toward the doctorate. This average is to be computed separately for courses and research. Courses in which a student earns a grade between C (2.0) and B (3.0) may or may not apply toward the degree, at the discretion of the guidance committee. A student submitting transfer cred its must earn a B average on all work accepted for transfer credit and on all work taken at this University, computed separately. Clinical probation Programs with a clinical component may recommend that the student be placed on clinical probation. Details are contained in the program guides for the programs concerned. 590 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Scholarly competence Doctoral degree students demonstrate competency in scholarship along with research and professional development. Expectations and standards of achievement with the tools of investigation, natural and synthetic languages, and computers are specified in this section of the CATALOG for each program. Comprehensive examinations The doctoral degree candidate is required to take comprehensive written and oral examinations over the principal areas of study to ascertain capacity for independent, productive, scientific work; and to determine whether further courses are required before the final y ear of preparation for the doctorate is undertaken. The program coordinator is responsible for arranging preparation and administration of the examination, as well as its evaluation and subsequent reports of results. Success in the comprehensive examination is a prerequisite to candidacy (see below). Students cannot be admitted to the examination until the following requirements have been met: demonstrated reading knowledge of one foreign language, if applicable; completed the majority of units required beyo nd the master's degree or its equivalent. The final oral examination After completion of the dissertation and not later than a month before the date of graduation, the doctoral degree candidate is required to appear before an examining committee for the final oral examination. If a candidate fails to pass this final examination fo r a graduate degree, the examining committee files with the dean a written analysis of the candidate's status, with recommendations about the student's future relation to the school. The student receives a copy of the committee's recommendation. Project (required for the Doctor of Psychology and Doctor of Marital and Family Therapy degrees) All Doctor of Psychology degree students must register for at least 1 unit of project credit. This should be done in the last quarter of registration prior to completion. The research and project preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research an d project, continuous registration is maintained until the manuscript is accepted. This involves a quarterly fee of $65 (2007-2 008) to be paid during re gistration each quarter. A similar continuing-registration fee is assessed for each quarter the student fails to register for new units. Dissertation (required for the Doctor of Philosophy degree) All doctoral students must register for at least 1 unit of dissertation credit. This should be done in the last quarter of registration prior to completion. The research and dissertation preparation are under th e direction of the student' s guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. Consultation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies dissertation editor can prevent the student from committing formatting errors that would require retyping large sections of the manuscript. Students register and pay tuition for the dissertation, whethe r the work is done in residence or in absentia. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has comple ted all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and dissertation, con tinuous registration is maintained until the manuscript is accepted. This involves a quarterl y fee of $65 (2007-2008), to be paid during registration each quarter. A similar continuing-registration fee is assessed for each quarter the student fails to register for new units. Doctoral dissertations are reported to University Microfilms International and to the National Opinion Research Center. The Faculty of Graduate Studies office provides appropriate information and forms. SCHOOL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 591 Candidacy Admission to the School of Science and Technology does not constitute candidacy for a graduate degree. Admission to candidacy is initiated by a written petition (School of Science and Technology Form A) from the student to the dean, with support from th e student's adviser and the program chair. The student's petition for candidacy for the Doctor of Philosophy degree will include, in addition, confirmation that comprehensive written and oral examinations have been passed. Students expecting the award of the doctorate at a June graduation should have achieved candidacy no later than the previous November 15. One full quarter must be allowed between the achievement of candidacy and the quarter of completion. Specific program requirements Doctoral programs differ from each other. The uniq ue program requirements appear in the programs section of this CATALOG (Section III) and in the program guides available from specific departments. Religion requirement All doctoral students take at least one 3-unit religion course. Courses (numbered between 500 and 600) in social ethics, bioethics, psychology of religion, or philosophy of religion meet this requirement. COMBINED-DEGREES PROGRAMS A number of combined-degrees programs are offered, each intended to provide additional preparation in clinical, professional, or basic areas related to the student's field of interest. All require concurrent admission to the School of Science and Technology and a professional school in the University. The combined-degrees programs provide opportunity for es pecially well-qualified and motivated students to pursue professional and graduate education; and to prepare for careers in clinical specialization, teaching, or investigation of problems of health and disease in man. For admission to a combined-degrees program, the student must have a baccalaureate degree; must qualify for admission to the School of Science and Technology; and must already be admitted to the School of Medicine, the School of Dentistry, the School of Relig ion, or the School of Public Health. Application may be made at any point in the student's progress in the professional school, though it is usually made during the sophomore year. Students in this curriculum study toward the M.A., M.S., M.S.W., Psy.D., or Ph.D. degree. Students may be required to interrupt their professional study for two or more years (as needed) for courses and research for the graduate degree sought. Elective time in the professional school may be spent in meeting School of Science and Technology requirements. The student's concurrent status is regarded as continuous until the program is completed or until discontinuance is recommended by the School of Science and Technology or the professional school. The usual degree requirements apply. The following combined -degrees programs are offered in conjun ction with the School of Science and Technology.

Child life services strive to promote optimum development of children and their families, to maintain normal living patterns, and to minimize emoti onal trauma. As integral members of the health care team in both the ambulatory care and inpatient settings, child life staff provides children opportunities for gaining a sense of mastery, for play, for learning, for self-expression, for family involvement, and for peer interaction. Mission* The mission of a child life specialist is to meet the needs of infants, children, youth, and families in times of stressful or traumatic life events and situations. The philosophy and practice of child life will be applicable to any health care setting and transferable to other e nvironments or situations in which the potential for infants, children, and youth to cope, learn, and master is placed at risk. The serv ices provided by the child life profession will be wholistic an d preventive and will utilize applied child-development and family- systems theory. The objectives of such services will be to minimize the negative impact of situational disruptions while maintaining normalcy in growth, development, and family-systems relationships. The child life profession has developed since the 1920s to improve health care experiences for children by providing play, preparation, and educational prog rams. These child life services are necessary for promoting the emotional stability and healthy development of hospitalized children while mitigating the CHILD LIFE SPECIALIST\u2014ST 601 pain and fear associated w ith treatment. The child life specialist is an early and ardent advocate of frequent family visits and parental participation in the care of the child. Individuals who receive child life specialist certificati on are qualified to apply for professional-level certifi- cation from the Child Life Certifying Committee. The national child life certification fosters uniform and improved standards of practice an d ethical conduct and enhances the status and credibility of the profession. *Adapted from the Child Life Council Web site (CLCC) The programs The Child Life Specialist Program leading to an M.S. degree or certificate is offered by the School of Science and Technology's Department of Counseling and Family Sciences through the Marital and Family Therapy Program.

This degree is an integral part of Loma Linda University's mission, as illustrated by the Good Samaritan sculpture on the mall of the campus. The sculpture depicts the biblical parable told by Jesus in Luke 10:30-37, which cont rasts indifference and ethnic pride with attitudes of empathy and compassion. The California pupil personnel services (PPS) credential in school counseling can be obtained by students pursuing the M.S. degree in counseling (72 units), or by those wishing to add a 28-unit certificate to their 78-unit M.S. degree in marital and family therapy. Students must take the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST) during the first two quarters following enrollment. This is a degree requirement. Stud ents must pass all three sections of the test before they are recommended for the pupil personnel services credential in school counselin g. This is a credential requirement. 608 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Mission and curriculum Guided by the University's mission of whole-person health care, California's new standards for school counseling, and the expanding nature of professional collaboration in mental health, the counseling curriculum is organized into the following three domains: I Educational foundations and beliefs II Theoretical and cognitive competence III Counseling competence and commitment to service Each candidate is expected to combine the knowledge and skills learned throughout these domains with an understanding of the University's mission to formul ate a well-thought-out, clearly articulated personal belief system that is demonstrated in ethical values and behaviors. Development of this personal epistemology requires each candidate to examine lifelong-learning related to meaning, purpose, hope, and service. These issues include: Beliefs about the nature, origin, and future of humans Equality and inclusion Honoring personal and cultural values with sensitivity toward diversity Influence of religious traditions and communities of faith Integrity toward self and others Sources of strength and renewal Spirit of generosity Competence and conscientiousness ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS Entrance: Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer Quarters Minimum G.P.A. 3.0 (on 4.0 scale) in bachelor's degree or final 45 units of program Official transcripts of college work Prerequisite courses: statistics and abnormal psychology Three letters of reference Statement of purpose Interview with faculty PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS (72 units) DOMAIN I PREREQUISITE General statistics (3) Educational foundations and beliefs Foundational courses in learning theory, educational psychology, sociocultural competence, research, and statistics are considered foundational to building compet ence as a school counselor.

They are expected to learn how to deconstruct theories, critically evaluate them, and create a foundation upon which to build their professional skills and relationships. Courses include: COUN 575 Counseling Theory and Applications (3) COUN 556 Psychopathology and Diagnosis Procedures (3) COUN 568 Groups: Process and Practice (3) COUN 576 Exceptional and Medically Challenged Children (3) COUN 577 Assessment in Counseling (3) COUN 584 Advanced Child and Adolescent Development (3) COUN 674 Human Sexual Behavior (3) DOMAIN III Counseling competence and commitment to service The counseling program is based on the assumpti on that counseling competence develops from the foundational knowledge, personal epistemologies, and theoretical understanding learned in Domains I and II. Another assumption is that competence embraces the concept of service. Activ ities involving case study and field experience are designed to emphasize service and the development of altruism. By helping K-12 pupils sense the dimensions of personal need and worth in others, candidates grow in their ability to respond with compassion, empathy, and cultural comp etence. Working in education, school counselors help K-12 students in their person al development, career preparation, and academic achievement in order to become lifelong learners.

FROYLANA MILLER, M.S.W., L.C. S.W., M.S.W.) ADJUNCT FACULTY Emily Ascencio Flavia Jorge Victor Marshall James McElvain Christiane Schubert Sjoekje Sasbone Crime disrupts personal and community relationships, endangers public health and safety, and threatens the moral contours of everyday social life. Loma Linda University's mission \"to make man whole\" provides a powerful and much-needed context in which criminal justice can be ad dressed on the basis of healing and restoration. The principles of restora tive justice elevate the dimensions of justice that: promote the acceptance of responsibility, promote the fulfillment of obligations, embrace forgiveness and reconciliation; and culminate in the restoration of personal and social relationships. This multidisciplinary approach to deviance and the administration of justice takes into consideration the social, physical, and spiritual well-being of victims, offenders, and communities\u2014which provides a deeper understanding of crime and the struggle of the modern criminal justice system. Program objectives The purpose of the Criminal Justice Program is to prepare students to think critically, analytically, and creatively about the problems of crime and social co ntrol in the contemporary world. The program is designed to meet the diverse n eeds of criminal justice professi onals. It will accomplish a number of objectives, including: Prepare students for careers in law enforcement, corrections, crim inal justice administration, and planning. Provide students with a thorough knowledge of social science theory and of applying criminological theory and research to current problems in criminal justice. Provide students with a thorough knowledge of current issues in criminal justice; and of the importance of the relationship of criminal justice to other disciplines and professions, such as social work, psychology, medicine, dentistry, nursing, and public health. Prepare students for the applica tion of various computer technologies to decision-making in the criminal justice system. Prepare students to conduct social research on crime and the effect of policies and programs on crime outcomes. Program description All students must complete a two-year program consisting of 48 quarter units of course work. There are 26 units of foundation content required for all students, followed by one of two concentrations: Policy, planning, and administration\u2014 Students opting for the policy, planning, and administration concentration will study public administration, the ec onomic dimensions of social policy, organizational theory, program planning, and policy analysis as they re late to contemporary problems in criminal justice. CRIMINAL JUSTICE\u2014ST 611 Forensic mental health \u2014The forensic mental health concentration provides students with both global and domestic perspectives on violence, mental health, and drug and alcohol abuse issues. Both concentrations emphasize a thoughtful reflection about public philosophy and ethical issues in criminal justice that will provide students with a deeper understanding of the logic influencing policy, administration, and practice is sues affecting the field. PREREQUISITE This master's degree builds on a broa d liberal arts (general education) foundation. Consistent with this view, the program assesses the liberal arts foundation of students applying for the M.S. degree in criminal justice. The required pr erequisite course work provides students with foundation concepts and/or skills in each of the following: Interviewing and counseling (3) Human growth and development (3) Cross-cultural issues (3) Introductory statistics (3) Unit values represent a quarter system of measurement.

Hayes W. William Hughes V. Leroy Leggitt Kevin E. Nick Samuel Soret The Department of Earth and Biological Sciences in the School of Science and Technology offers a program leading to the Bachelor of Science degree in environmental and earth system science. This program is the integrated study of the earth's biogeophysical systems and how human activities impact earth system sustainability and management. In addition to core courses, students will choose an emphasis from conservation biology and biodiversity, biodata management, environmental geology, health geoinformatics, or global sustainability and health. Graduates are prepared to contribute to efforts that promote better management of human-development activitie s that affect human-environment interaction, as well as promote sustainable development and conservatio n science. This program will prepare students for entry-level employment or for advanced study in a variety of fields--including biology, geoscience, environmental science, natural resources, biotechnology , and diverse health sciences; as well as public policy, law, or planning careers. More detail is given in the career-options section. Part of this curriculum is designed to foster constructive and service-oriented attitudes toward environmental conservation, health, lifestyle, and health care. As described here, it will include courses, seminars, and a community-service requirement (local community environmental and/or health care service, or an environmental conservation or health-oriented mission trip). Objectives The objectives of the program are to: 1. Create awareness and understanding of how ear th systems function and interact to create the conditions for life in the geosphere, at mosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. 2. Explore how human activities have interacted w ith natural systems through time, and how these activities respond to global changes in technology, consumption, and population. 3. Appreciate the enormity of global and regional environmental changes occurring on Earth, and the implications of these changes in our individual lives. 4. Challenge students to rethink their individual behaviors and attitudes about their \"interaction\" with the natural world. 5. Learn to use the systems appro ach to learning and doing research in science and technology, and encourage capable students to pursue careers in science and technology. 6.

MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY\u2014M.S. CANADIAN CAMPUS PROGRAM DIANNA CONNORS, Program Coordinator DORIS HUBBARD, Director of Clinical Training (This program is not accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Marriag e and Family Therapy Education [COAMFTE], the accrediting body for the AAMFT.) The Canadian campus program is an innovative venture that combines the teaching expertise of the Loma Linda University faculty, the Canadian campus program faculty, and adjunct instru ctors and guest lecturers from the local professional community. A clinically ba sed program, courses are taught on campus utilizing two methods of instruction. Approximately half the co urses are taught on an intensive basis. Typically, 2- unit intensives run for three days, Monday through Wednesday; and 3-unit intensives run for four days, Monday through Thursday. Generally, there is one intensive scheduled per month. The remainder of the courses meet once a week (except dur ing intensive weeks) for the full qu arter. Courses are taught three quarters per year, mid-September through mid-June. It should be noted that certain courses cannot be offered on an intensive basis and require weekly attendance. Loma Linda University is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) in the United States, and the Canadian campus program is recognized by Alberta Advanced Education (Private Institutions) as a graduate degree-granting program. The Canadian campus program is officially directed by Loma Linda University and meets th e WASC accreditation requirements. Depending on undergraduate preparation and the course work selected, students graduating from this program may be qualified to become provisionally charte red as psychologists in the province of Alberta, or registered social workers with the Alberta College of Social Workers. Marriage and family therapy is an unregulated profession in Alberta. However, students are encouraged to become concurrent members of the American Association for Marriage an d Family Therapy. This organization has collegial benefits to the student, long-term legislative initiatives, as well as a local chapter, the Alberta Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. 648 UNIVERSITY CATALOG MAJOR AREAS OF STUDY FOR M.S.

Loma Linda University Department of Counseling and Family Sciences offers the Ph.D. and the D.M.F.T. degrees in marital and family therapy. Ph.D. degree in marital and family therapy The Ph.D. degree in marital and family therapy (MFT ) follows the scientist-practitioner model, in which students are expected to develop expertise both in em pirical research methods and clinical practice for careers in teaching and research. Th e Ph.D. degree in marital and family therapy is a 108-unit program requiring three-to-four years for co mpletion\u2014including two-to-three years of course work, a dissertation, and clinical internship. D.M.F.T. degree in marriage and family therapy The D.M.F.T. degree follows the practitioner-evaluator model and focuses on applied-skill development for use in clinical practice and administrative positions. The D.M.F.T. degree is a 101-unit program, requiring three to four years for completion\u2014including doctoral project and clinical internship. Interim master's degree The Ph.D. degree with interim master's degree or the D.M.F.T. degree with interim master's degree requires 168 and 160 units, respectively. These programs are primarily for students whose master's degree is not in marital and family therapy (or equivalent). They take approximately five years to complete. Concentrations All doctoral students must complete a 12-unit concentr ation in a special area of focus of their choice. Examples include, but are not limited to: Families, systems, and health Family studies Systems consultation and professional relations School consultation MFT licensure (for students who have not previously met academic requirements for MFT licensure) Marriage and family therapy is established in California by law as a profession requiring state licensure. Persons who desire to enter the profession must have the proper academic and clinical preparation and must pass two licensing examinations. The doctoral degree prog rams at Loma Linda Univ ersity are designed to provide the academic requirements to meet the California licensing standards according to Business and Professions Code 4980.38. The Ph.D. degree in marital and family therapy and th e D.M.F.T. degree offered by Loma Linda University are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Marriage an d Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE), the accrediting body associated with the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. Purpose and mission The purpose of the doctoral programs in marital and family therapy is to develop family-therapy scholars who will advance theory, research, clinical practice, community involvement, and t eaching in the field of marital and family therapy. Students will be prepared for research, teaching, supervision, administration, and clinical training positions in health-care settings, in training institutes, and in institutions offering graduate degrees. The D.M.F.T. degree program offe rs the opportunity to expand clinical skills and prepares students with expertise in program-evaluation research methods. Ph.D. degree students develop expertise in conducting original research from both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Knowledge and skills promoted Students study the work of the origin al thinkers in marital and family therapy, as well as the most recent developments in the field\u2014such as social constructi onism and evidence-based practice. They will develop a critical understanding of the theo retical and philosophical foundations of MFT; critically examine the interrelationships among socio-historical factors, family structures and relationships, and clinical approaches; be conversant in the curr ent issues in the field; and contri bute to the discourse regarding them. MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY\u2014ST 651 Personal development The program encourages students to develop a clear understanding of themselves and to consider reflectively the impact of their person al values, social positions, and contex ts on their clinical and scholarly practices. Students are supported in the development of their strengths as they create an epistemological framework and ethical conscious ness to guide their work. Practice and supervisory skills Students will apply a critical understanding of theory to the practice of marital and family therapy at the family, community, and societal levels\u2014drawing on the core modalities of the field. They will develop sophistication in their personal clinical skills, supervisory skills, and skills for active multisystemic involvement. Research and evaluation skills Students will develop skills and a critical understanding of the process of research and evaluation related to families and marital and family therapy. This includes the ability to apply research findings to clinical practice and to utilize research findings in creative ways for the benefit of the general population. Students in the Ph.D. degree program will develop expertise in both qualitative and quantitative research methods, leading to publication in scholarly journals and presentations at professional conferences. D.M.F.T. degree students will focus on evaluation of program performance and outcomes in practice-based settings. Core ideas guiding the MFT doctoral programs RELATIONAL SYSTEMS: People are best understood within the cultural, spiritual, and relational systems in which they are embedded. Change, therefore, occurs in the context of family, community, and interpersonal relationships. These programs focus on both the structured relational patterns of communication and interaction and on the systems of meaning that define and shape these patterns. WHOLENESS : These programs encourage wholeness by atte nding to the physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions of human experience. These dime nsions reciprocally interact at every level. SOCIAL FORCES: The programs are guided by a belief th at social contexts and processes influence meanings, values, and people's understandings of self, family, and others. Particular emphasis is placed on: research focusing on social forces relevant to the distinctive multicultural mix of families in the southern California region, the interrelationship between faith and family relationships throughout the world, the effects of the changing health care system and of medi cal technology; and collaboration among education, family, work, and legal systems. HEALING POWER OF RELATIONSHIPS : As people become more connected to each other and their communities, the potential for growth and healing are enhanced, and the opportunities for making positive contributions are maximized. Students are encouraged to develop their therapeutic relationship and community-involvement skills so that they can co-creat e an environment of safe ty, respect, compassion, openness, and community participation. DIVERSITY: An appreciation of the importance of social forces requires interest in and respect for the diverse experiences and perceptions of human beings. Different social contexts such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, and socioeconomic status result in a wide variety of meanings and behavior patterns in marriages, families, and intimate relationships. The prog rams seek to create a diverse mix of students and faculty, and to challenge all who are involved to learn from the richness of multiple perspectives. EMPIRICAL PROCESS: The programs encourage clinical work and theory development grounded in an empirical understanding of human experience. Students are offered the opportunity to develop their capacities to utilize inductive and dedu ctive reasoning; as well as ob jectivity, subjec tivity, and inter- subjectivity in research and therapy. EDUCATION AND PREVENTION: Connections at family, school, and community levels are important components of resilience. The programs emphasize he lping individuals and families access their relational competencies as an important part of prevention, as well as the resolution of their current difficulties. 652 UNIVERSITY CATALOG SPIRITUALITY: These programs view spirituality as central to wholeness and healing. Students are encouraged to integrate their practices of faith w ith their professional work . The programs place strong emphasis on active demonstration of moral and ethical principles as exemplified by, but not limited to, Judeo-Christian teachings. WORLDWIDE FOCUS: The missions of the programs reach beyond the local and national community to the international community. This includes our collabora tion with people from other nations and cultures to promote mutual understanding, resolve problems, and strengthen families.

PREREQUISITE Statistics Institutional and interdisciplinary fit Guided by the University's mission of whole-person health care, California's new standards for school counseling, and the expanding nature of professional collaboration in mental health, the school counseling curriculum has been organized into the following three domains: I. Educational foundations and belief systems II. Theoretical and cognitive competence III. Counseling competen ce and commitment to service Graduate students are expected to combine the knowledge and skills learned in these domains with an understanding of the University's mission to formulate a well thought-out, clearly articulated personal belief system that embodies the student's ethical values. Development of this personal epistemology requires that the student examine hi s or her understanding of the sources of meaning, purpose, hope, and practice. These issues include the following: Beliefs about the nature, origin, and future of humans Equality and inclusion Honoring personal and cultural values with sensitivity toward diversity 676 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Relationships to transitions and communities of faith Integrity toward self and others Sources of strength and renewal Generosity of spirit Competence and conscientiousness CURRICULUM Courses with an asterisk (*) indicate the 28 additional units required of students earning an M.S. degree in marital and family therapy: DOMAIN I: Educational foundations and belief systems Foundational courses in learning theory, educational psychology, sociocultural competence, research, and statistics are considered foundational to building competence as a school counselor.

Another assumption is that comp etence embraces the concep t of service. Activities involving case study and field experience are designed to emphasize service and the development of altruism. By helping K-12 pupils sense the dimensions of personal need and worth in others, candidates grow in their ability to respond with compassion and empathy and cultural competence. As educators, school counselors help K-12 student s in their personal development, career preparation, and academic achievement in order to become lifelong learners.

SOCIAL WORK\u2014ST 681 Social Work\u2014ST (M.S.W., Ph.D.) BEVERLY BUCKLES, Program Coordinator, M.S.W. DIANNA SIMON, Program Coordinator, Ph.D. in Clinical Social Work FACULTY Beverly J. Buckles Terrence J. Forrester Kimberly Freeman G. Victoria Jackson Sigrid James Viola Lindsey Froylana Miller Dianna Simon Ignatius I. Yacoub ADJUNCT FACULTY Ann Curtis Cornelius Driscoll Brenda Flores Sandra Herrera William Loveless William Murdoch Doris Paxton Alan Rawland Crystal Shackleford Kristen Slagter Rhoda Smith Sandy Suarez Frank Tetley Mary Tysor-Tetley Debbie Wright The profession of social work centers on the improvement of the quality of life for people and the enhancement of human potential for full productive par ticipation in society. With this philosophy at its core, the master's degree in Social Work Program offered by the School of Science and Technology emphasizes ecological systems, a perspective that focuses on the interaction of a person or system in relation to his/her environment. Reflecting this stance is Loma Linda University's philosophy, \"To Make Man Whole,\" and its heritage as an international leader in the delivery of services in health care and related facilities. It is the combination of these influences that has guided the development of the foundation curriculum, professional concentratio ns, and selection of practicum site s for the Master of Social Work Program. SOCIAL WORK\u2014M.S.W. Mission The mission of the Master of Social Work Program is to prepare comp etent, ethical, and compassionate social work professionals who will possess the knowledge, values, and skills to equip them for a dedicated life of advanced practice in health and mental health institutions and agencies. Goals The goals of the Master of Social Work Program are to: Provide quality graduate social work education that instills in students the common knowledge, ethics, and values of the profession. 682 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Provide a foundation curriculum to support students' development and application of a generalist practice. Provide quality graduate social work education th at instills in students respect for diversity, populations at risk, and the promotion of social and economic justice. Provide advanced curricula in behavioral health conc entrations in clinical social work practice, and policy planning and administration; Strengthen the student's academic experience through strong collabo rations with area agencies and institutions. Be responsive in addressing the educational needs of social work in health and mental health institutions and agencies in the surrounding community. Express through curriculum and co-curricular activ ities the University's mission of wholeness. Accreditation The Master of Social Work Program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education to provide graduate-level social work education. PREREQUISITE Graduate social work education builds on a broad liber al arts (general educati on) foundation. The program assesses the liberal arts foundation of students applying to the M.S.W. degree program from two perspectives: * 1. Foundation concepts and/or sk ills in each of the following: Interviewing and counseling (3) Human biology: (3) Human growth and development* (3) Cross-cultural issues (3) Introductory statistics (3) Unit values represent the quarter system of measuremen t. Content from multiple courses may be used to meet most requirements. 2. A balance of course work in four liberal arts areas: Humanities (e.g., history, philosophy, literature, art, music, etc.) (20-24) English and communication skills (e.g., oral an d written communication media, etc.) (8-12) Mathematics and natural sciences (e.g., mathematics, human biology, physiology, etc.) (12-16) Social sciences (e.g., psychology, sociology, anthropology, human development, ethnic studies, economics, political science or government, etc.) (12-16) Students not meeting the minimum number of units in any of the foregoing areas are required to complete additional course work prior to enrolling in the related M.S.W. classes. Please note: All prerequisite requirements must be completed before advancement to candidacy (prior to beginning the advanced curriculum). The following table outlines the time frame for completion of prerequisites: SEQUENCING OF PREREQUISITE REQUIREMENTS Courses Time Human biology Prior to SOWK 511, 512 Human growth and development Prior to SOWK 511, 512 Cross-cultural issues Prior to SOWK 511, 512 Introductory statistics Prior to SOWK 549 Interviewing and counseling Prior to SOWK 517 SOCIAL WORK\u2014ST 683 Admission requirements Following are the admission requirements for the Master of Social Work Program: Applicants must have a bachelor's degree fr om an accredited university or college (official transcripts are evidence of courses completed). The department assesses the liberal arts preparation of each of its applicants in two areas: o the balance of course work, in four liber al arts areas, and o specific course work considered preparatory to the program's foundation (first year) courses (see also Liberal Arts Requirements in M.S.W. Student Handbook ). Applicants must submit a completed application, in cluding a personal statement, application fee, all college and/or university transcripts, and three letters of recommendation at least (one from an academic source and one from a work supervisor). Applicants must meet the minimum academic and pr ofessional compatibility criteria established by the program. Applicants must have a cumulative grade-point aver age of 3.0 or above (on a 4.0 scale) (special consideration may be given to applicants with grade-poi nt averages as low as 2.85 if the last part of their college work shows significant improvement). Applicants whose cumulative grade- point average does not meet the minimum requirements stated above may receive further consideration for admission to th e M.S.W. degree program by providing a satisfactory GRE score, or two years related employment experience. Work experience must be verified by employers' statements on official agency stationery. Applicants must show evidence of profession al compatibility, personal qualifications and motivation to complete a graduate program by obtaining a passing score on the admissions interview with the department's Admissions Co mmittee. Evaluation criteria for the interview includes: verbal communication skills, critical thinking ability, values congruent with the social word profession, appreciation of human diversity, evidence of reflective learning, and comportment. No academic credit is given for life ex perience or previous work experien ce for any part for the Master of Social Work Program (i.e., field practicum or courses in the professional foundation or advanced curricula). CURRICULUM The 78-unit curriculum of the M.S.W. degree program provides the mix of academic, experiential, and research experiences essential for M.S.W. degree st udents. Students must maintain a program grade-point average of 3.0 (or a letter grade of B on a 4.0 scal e) and meet the knowledge, skill, and professional performance competencies outlined by the program. The minimum acceptable grade for required (core) courses is a B- (2.7). Grades in selective courses must be a minimum of a C (2.0). Courses with grades falling below the standards set for required and selectiv e courses must be repeated. Students are financially responsible for the cost of repeating courses where gr ades obtained do not meet the minimum standards. General overview The program begins with the professional foundation content (first-year courses) common to all graduate social work education. Courses during this first year of study provide content in human behavior in a cross- cultural environment, social welfare policy and servi ces, practice theory and skills, social research, and practica. These content areas are streng thened by the integration of social work values and ethics; as well as knowledge of special populations (i.e., issues of gender, race, class, disability, and oppression). 684 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Program options Alternate program options have been designed to address the varying needs of students. As such, the program offers a full-time two-year option, a three-year part-time option, and a four-year part-time option. Advanced standing The M.S.W. degree program does not admit students with advanced standing. Rather, it recognizes the knowledge and skills of individuals who have receive d a baccalaureate degree from an accredited social work program. This recognition indicates that the candidate may have already met the proficiency outcomes expected of M.S.W. degree students who have completed the foundation curriculum. Such candidates may transfer up to 30 course units of first-year course work and 280 hours of first-year field practicum. Criterion for course transfers is available through the department. The curriculum for students who are granted these transfers still requires two academic years of residency. The students will have additional time to complete their thesis or advanced research course work for socialization into the profession, as well as opportunity to take advantage of the rich interdisciplinary options available at Loma Linda University. Students may petition to accelerat e the completion of the M.S.W. degree with a minimum of four quarters in full-ti me residence. The academic load fo r each of these quarters cannot exceed 15 units, nor are students a llowed to transfer foundation cour ses when content is required by California state law. In addition, students who have difficulty applying foundation skills in their practicum\u2014regardless of their baccal aureate degree\u2014may have course transfers revoked or denied. Transfer students Individuals transferring from othe r accredited M.S.W. degree programs may transfer units for didactic course work in accordance with Un iversity policy. Field practicum experiences are nontransferable. M.S.W. degree advanced curriculum The advanced curriculum of the program begins with course work that supports integration of the foundational first year with the program's advanced curriculum. As part of the advanced curriculum, students take core courses required of all students and then select one of two concentrations. PROFESSIONAL CONCENTRATIONS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH The Social Work Program offers two concentrations for professional pr actice, which are the focus of the second-year study: clinical practice; a nd policy, planning, and administration. Clinical-practice concentration The clinical-practice concentration requires mastery of advanced-practice roles, modes of intervention, and methods used in clinical health and mental health settings. Study includes the integration of clinical- practice theories, diagnostic assessment, problem-solving skills and techniques; as well as the impact of policy upon the availability of treatment, treatment modalities, and expectation of outcomes. Students' experiences and knowledge are expanded through the selection of practicum sites and selectives concerning special population and problem areas. These include, but are not limited to, children at risk, geriatric dilemmas, mental disorders, substance abuse, and family conflict. The integration of cultural diversity as a factor guiding the analysis and intervention with clinical populations is incorporated into the totality of the concentration. Policy, planning, and admi nistration concentration The policy, planning, and administration concentration is designed to prepare students for management roles in health and mental health care organizations. It focuses on giving students understanding and skill in: interdisciplinary practice; systems establishment and maintenance assisting individuals, families, and groups managing health and illness in the context of the life cycle; social change promotion in health and mental health care organizations; and health and mental health-policy analysis. SOCIAL WORK\u2014ST 685 In this way, students have an opportunity to integrate and explore health and mental health practices and policies from their underlying value base; and to explore the impact of cultural definitions on health, illness, and systems designs. CENTRAL ACADEMIC PROCESSES AND COGNATES Professional practica Professional practica experiences (field practica) are re garded as an integral part of the M.S.W. degree program because these offer students opportunities to integrate and apply theoretical and research knowledge with social work practice and intervention skills in institutional or agency settings. Practica are designed (and selected) to provide maximum learning opportunities under the supervision of a qualified field instructor. As such, experiences are patterned to build upon one another, presenting the increasing challenges present in the continuum of generalist to advanced social work practice. Students complete 21 units of professional practica\u2014which includes 1,080 hours of field work in a qualified setting and 120 hours of concurrent integrated seminar for a total of 1,200 hours. Emphasis during SOWK 757A,B,C Professional Foundation Practicum and Seminar (9 professional practica units requiring 480 hours of practicum and 60 hours of seminar) is placed on achieving generalist social work knowledge, values, and skills\u2014including developing rapport with agency personnel and clients, acquiring interviewing skills, and obtaining beginning-level psychosocial assessment and intervention capabilities. The content of the concurrent seminar further supports this perspective as it provides students with opportunities to integrate their practicum experiences with their developing professional identity. The SOWK 787A,B,C Advanced Professional Practicum and Seminar (12 units of professional practica units requiring 600 hours of practicum and 60 hours of seminar) reflect students' choice of concentration and provide the depth and breadth of learning opportunities that underpin the acquisition of advanced- practice capabilities. More specifically, advanced profe ssional practica experiences are expected to promote increased insight and understanding of agency and/or client systems as these build on the professional foundation skills achieved during the first year of study. Research The M.S.W. degree program includes completion of course work in applied research. An individually authored thesis option is available for students me eting program criteria. These study options aim to develop knowledge for the advancement of social work practice and provide guided experiences in the conduct of research appli cable to a variety of professional and academic settings. Gu idelines for these options are provided by the School of Science and Technology and the department. Professional foundation processes and cognates Two academic review processes take place during the fi rst year of the M.S.W. de gree program. These are: 1. M.S.W. degree advancement G.P.A. The M.S.W. degree advancement G. P.A. provides an initial predictor used for gate keeping. The first 12 units completed towards the M.S.W. degree, including units acquired during non- matriculation, must be completed with a G.P.A. of 3.0. Students who fail to achieve at this level may be dismissed from school. Students receive or ientation to the process and requirements of the M.S.W. degree advancement G.P.A. during the student orientation conducted prior to the Fall Quarter. 2. Qualifying review When all foundation course work is completed, students are required to pass the program's qualifying review. The intent of this process is to: assist faculty and students in assessment of strengths and areas for improvement; provide feedback; foster an environment of self-evaluation; and encourage heightened participation in individualized academic development. 686 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Ultimately, the results of this review help both the stud ent and faculty to develop learning objectives for the concentration year. A specific orientation is held to explain the expectations, format, and scheduling of the qualifying review process. Advanced curriculum cognate\u2014wholeness portfolio All students complete a wholeness portfolio during SOWK 787A, B, C Advanced Professional Practicum and Seminar. This review of the student's individualized objectives and professional development during the second year of study\u2014combined with a discussion of his/her plans for employment and further growth\u2014is seen as a capstone academic experience that facilitates closure and the final stage of reflection and review in the development of a scholar-practitioner.

CLINICAL SOCIAL WORK\u2014PH.D. The School of Science and Technology's Department of Social Work and Social Ecology is an interdisciplinary academic unit committed to the University's mission of human wholeness and to the belief that one's fullest development is achieved when all as pects of an individual's life are in balance. Both conceptually and pragmatically the programs in the Department of Social Work and Social Ecology are guided by an overarching ecological (bio-psycho-social-spiritual) pers pective that employs scientific methods of problem analysis and program design. A key component in this framework is the importance of considering the relationships among behavioral, so ciopolitical, economic, and environmental problems. The result is an interdisciplinar y teaching, learning, and practice environment designed to create interventions that will improve the functions of individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. As such, priority has been given to creating an academic milieu favorable to educating competent, ethical, and compassionate professionals and scholars who are capable of respecting and addressing the needs of diverse populations. Mission and objectives This doctoral program aims to provide social worker s with advanced knowledge to become researchers, educators, and clinicians capable of applying this knowledge to every practice context in professional clinical social work. It purposefully instills a high appreciation for knowledge development and dissemination; and demonstrates respect and appreciation for the needs and issues inherent in human diversity, promotion of social and economic justice, and clinical populations-at-risk. The objectives of the do ctoral program are to: Prepare graduates for leadership ro les in social work education. Prepare graduates to analyze clinical issues and treatment alternatives as a basis for decision- making. Prepare graduates to be researchers engaged in the development of knowledge regarding the bio- psychosocial-spiritual dynamics of human behavior. Admission requirements The Clinical Social Work Program is open to students who demonstrate leadership and scholarly potential. Admission to the program is governed by the policies and procedures established by the School of Science and Technology. An admission committee of social wo rk faculty oversees the admission process, reviews applications, and recommends students for admission to the program.

Anthony J. Zuccarelli Dean Foundations of Graduate Study Recognizing the need to provide advanced education, the College of Medical Evangelists (CME) organized its School of Graduate Studies in 1954. The new school conferred a Ph.D. degree in 1958, the first Ph.D. to be awarded by a Seventh-day institution of higher education. In 1961 when CME became Loma Linda University, the University assumed oversight of the graduate education conducted by La Sierra College in Riverside, California. By 1963 the School of Graduate Studies had been renamed the Graduate School, with a home in a new building, named Frederick Griggs Hall, in honor of a former department chai r. The two campuses comprising Loma Linda University\u2014La Sierra and Loma Linda\u2014were separated in 1990. In 2005 the Graduate School was restructured as the Faculty of Graduate Studies. It continues to provide oversight of graduate programs, supported by other schools of the University; promotes and encourages 698 UNIVERSITY CATALOG independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication; and relates intellectual achievements to the service of mankind. Philosophy In the Faculty of Graduate Studies of Loma Linda University, the essential concern of both faculty and students is the quest for meaning. Because this quest is served by knowledge, gr aduate students are obliged to achieve both broad and detailed mastery of their field of study. They also participate with the faculty in the process by which knowledge is augmented. Objectives The Faculty of Graduate Studies atte mpts to create an environment favo rable to the pursuit of knowledge and meaning by: 1. Making available to graduate students who wish to study in a Seventh-day Adventist Christian setting the education necessary for scholarly careers in the sciences and the health professions. 2. Encouraging development of independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication. 3. Relating intellectual achievement to the service of mankind. General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for info rming themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation.

A minimum of six years is required to complete this combined-degrees program, offered cooperatively by the School of Dentistry and the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Clinical Ministry\u2014SR with Marital and Family Therapy\u2014ST M.A./M.S. SIROJ SORAJJA KOOL, Program Coordinator, Clinical Ministry MARY E. MOLINE, Program Coordinator, Marital and Family Therapy FACULTY The faculty for the combined-degrees program in clin ical ministry and marital and family therapy is drawn from the School of Religion and from the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences, Loma Linda University School of Science and Technology . THE PROGRAM The combined Master of Ar ts degree program in clinical ministry and Master of Science degree program in marital and family therapy (MFAM) have many common subject areas, such as th e spiritual and clinical emphasis in caring for the whole person. The joining of the two degree programs provides the student with the added Christian clinical counseling skills needed to minister to many spiritual and mental health 710 UNIVERSITY CATALOG problems. The MFAM degree also prepares the student for a clinical license. Licensure allows the student in the M.A./M.S. combined-degrees program more op tions for practice, including private practice. The student's ability to provide more services to the comm unity\u2014in addition to the traditional areas of practice, such as hospitals, churches, and schools\u2014is increased. The primary objectives of the combined-degrees program in clini cal ministry and marital and family therapy are to: 1. Produce professionals skilled in clinical ministry and marital and family therapy in a family clinical ministry track. 2. Expose students to the currently available content material in the fields of clinical ministry and marital and family therapy. 3. Provide for supervised field and clinical training that will give students the opportunities to apply and integrate theoretical knowledge toward the development of clinical ministry and family therapy skills and competencies. 4. Provide activities by which students can develop the personal and professional maturity required to identify with the spiritual preventive and curativ e aspects of clinical mi nistry and marital and family therapy. 5. Provide the basis, in the family clinical ministry track, for doctoral work in mental health and religious studies. Outstanding students are encouraged to explore possibilities for further studies. Course requirements In order to receive the Master of Arts degree in clinical ministry an d the Master of Science degree in marital and family therapy degrees from Loma Linda University, the student will complete a minimum of 102 units of course work as specifi ed, with an overall grade average of B or better, with no grade lower than a C and with no grade in a core course lower than a B-.

The combined-degrees program in so cial work and public health reaffirms the heritage of these two professions working together. Simultaneously it addresses the requisite knowledge and skills increasingly needed by professionals working in maternal and child health in low-income communities. As such, the curricula of the M.P.H. degree and M.S.W. degree in maternal and child health have been merged to offer a combined-degrees program with both depth and breadth to address the myriad of intervention and community issues affecting this population. Combined-degrees students must meet all the requirements of each of the participating programs. If completed separately, the M.P.H. degree is 58 units an d the M.S.W. degree is 78 units\u2014for a total of 130 units. In this combined-degrees option, 24 units of the 130 units are counted by both the M.S.W. and M.P.H. degrees programs; this reciprocity reduces the total number of un its required. Interested students should obtain from the department a curriculum plan showing the integration of the M.P.H. degree and M.S.W. degree programs. Medical Scientist\u2014SM (M.D. with Ph.D.) The program is designed to attract students who are energized by doing research and want to contribute substantially to this enterprise. Students enter this combined-degrees program through the graduate program. In the first year, students participate in a new and revised scientifically integrated program that includes biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, pharmacology, and anatomy. While in the first year, students also rotate through the laboratories of selected faculty members. In the second year, students increase their involvement with individual laboratory projects while continuing to complete graduate course requirements. Students in selected areas may also be asked to serve as teaching assistants for graduate or medical classes. Students pursuing the combined degrees will also be involved with joint basic science and clinical meetings an d conferences with the aim of understanding the interrelationships between laboratory -based and clinical research. Upon demonstration of laboratory su ccess, as indicated by completion of a first-author manuscript, the student will continue on to the traditional first two year s of the medical school curriculum. It is anticipated that the amount of time required to demonstrate la boratory success will be two- to-three years. Successful students who have acquired essential laboratory skills should continue their affiliation with the host laboratory and continue research progress as time permits while in the medical school curriculum. Upon successful completion of the first two years of the medical curriculum and Step 1 of the USMLE examination, students will begin a series of rotations between the clinical sciences and the research laboratory. During these later years, students will complete all the standard clinical rotations and continue progress on laboratory projects. It is the intent of this program that students will acquire the requisite skills needed for a successful career at the interface of laboratory-based and clinical research. Program admission Admission into the Medical Scientist Program is competitive and requires evidence that the student is likely to develop into a successful medical scientist. The student must submit separate applications to the School of Medicine for both the M.D. and the Ph.D. degree programs, and meet the stated admissions requirements 720 UNIVERSITY CATALOG for each of these programs. The app lication package for the Ph.D. degree program requires scores for the general test of the Graduate Record Examination. Bo th programs must accept the sc ores before the student is admitted to the Medical Scientist Program. Studen ts entering the M.D./Ph.D. combined-degrees program who determine that a research career is inappropri ate may elect to complete the M.D. degree program independently. Students entering the Ph.D. degree progr am who desire a career in academic medicine may choose to apply for admission to the M.D./Ph.D. combin ed-degrees program at a poi nt after their entry into the Ph.D. degree program; however, the standard me dical school-application process will be required at that point.
