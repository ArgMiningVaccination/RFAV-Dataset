Take Control of Your Health with Ayurveda Migraines, Colitis, Skin Condition--Mayo Clinic confirms Inactive Disease \"I was inflamed. I had trouble keeping weight on, I was diagnosed with incurable ulcerative proctitus, my energy was very low, and I was taking medications daily for a skin condition, and I had severe migraines. Following Veena's guidance, all of these conditions have been nearly eliminated! The incurable ulcerative proctitus was given a Mayo Clinic Score of 0, normal or inactive disease. I'm very grateful to Veena for the wonderful results and the healthier quality of life we have attained together. Without reservation, I highly recommend Veena at Saumya Ayurveda.\" ---Chris Schirber, Yoga Teacher, Minnesota Significant Decrease in Migraines Right Away I have suffered from chronic headaches and migraines for as long as I can remember. I had talked to multiple PCPs and specialists about these issues, had been prescribed a variety of medications that helped somewhat, but never really fixed the issue. Veena promptly put together a plan of action that consisted of herbal remedies alongside some simple changes to my diet. Right away I noticed a significant decrease in the number of headaches I was getting, and when I did get them, they were much less severe than they had been in the past. I am very thankful for Veena's knowledge and advice and would not hesitate to recommend her services to friends and family alike. -Adrienne Sobering, Albuquerque, New Mexico Unremitting and Deteriorating Health -No More! I was struggling with significant, unremitting and deteriorating health issues. Veena's Ayurvedic treatment was always extremely beneficial. She has amazing gifts to share and people should know that. Veena is a great listener whose subtle, penetrating questions effectively bring forward important information. She is also extremely intuitive. I appreciate her collaborative approach as it results in a multimodality Ayurveda plan tailored to my unique symptoms, needs, schedule and goals. Veena stays personally engaged, tracking changes and adjusting for as long as it takes to accomplish maximum healing and health. She is a true healer. I enthusiastically recommend Veena, without hesitation. -Jim Nelson, Psychologist, author Running on Empty, Coon Rapids, Minnesota She Stands By You Veena Haasl-Billie is an Ayurvedic practitioner based in New Mexico and Minnesota with an international practice. Under her care I feel much better and have more energy even though I am not always the most compliant client. Veena is a caring, thoughtful, insightful, pragmatic, and deeply experienced practitioner of Ayurveda. Veena lowers the barriers to success and shines a light on the path. She stands by you. Veena is a very wise woman. --Glenna Case, Minnesota Amazing, Knowledgeable, Intuitive, Highly Skilled Veena is an amazing Ayurvedic Practitioner. She is knowledgeable, highly skilled and intuitive. She also has a great sense of humor. If you are looking for someone to help guide you to better health, work/life balance and awareness of your physical, emotional and spiritual well-being\u2014I recommend Veena without hesitation. After my first consultation and one week of recommended foods, I felt better, had more energy and more mental clarity than I have had in many years. Thank you Veena. --Lynda G, Corrales, New Mexico Digestive Wellness Naturally I came back from India searching for a Certified Ayurvedic Practitioner to help me continue my Ayurvedic journey and I was so grateful to find Veena! During our first consultation, she asked all of the right questions to truly understand the underlying causes of my sleep and digestive issues. Veena was very thorough in her questions, research and follow-up to determine the right treatment plan, recommend the right activities, and practices along with special spices and herbalized oils to help me feel better and restore my energy. I continue to meet with Veena seasonally to reassess and guide me with Ayurveda tools that keep me in balance year-round. Thank you Veena. -B.K. Minneapolis, Minnesota Menstrual Cycles Healthy Again & Skin Clearing Up After six months with no period and increasing concern, I am happy to report that my periods are completely regular. With just two months of Veena's treatment, they are almost symptomless except for mild cramping. I am feeling very good and well balanced overall. My skin has improved as well. I am looking forward to doing the cleanse with you this spring. - A.K. St. Paul, Minnesota Pain Relief \"I have had amazing success working with Veena to calm inflammation and improve digestion. Through her recommendations, I now know what to eat. Her herbalized oils, teas and spice mixes are amazing! My General Practitioner could find nothing wrong with me despite a barrage of blood tests. In just two hours with Veena, she knew exactly how to help me. I have more energy, more focus, more motivation, more patience (just ask my kids), more happiness and less pain. Amazingly less pain. I am a different person thanks to her knowledge and care. I strongly recommend that anyone work with Veena. After seeing the changes, I experienced, my family sees her now too.\" --Angela Bruentrup, PMP, Becoming Consulting, Minnesota I have become more than ADHD Veena help me to become reborn. With her help, I have become more than ADHD. Being a molecular scientist, it was difficult to grasp the simplistic complexity of Ayurveda, but the changes I experienced with Veena allowed me, not only a general understanding of health, but sparked a lifelong journey to use my knowledge to advance the acceptance of Ayurveda as a needed modality of health. This is a feat, considering I had difficulty focusing and digestive issues only four short years ago. Veena's evaluation and treatment is so individualized that it was easy to adjust my life which spawned health. Veena is a skilled healer with a solution to fit all. --Jessica B. Naturopath, Molecular Scientist, Medical School Student, New York City Anxiety, Digestive Problems, 12 Step Support \"When I first met Veena, I had been chronically tired for a few months and I couldn't figure out why or, how to fix it. I also had increased anxiety despite taking an SSRI for years. Something was clearly missing. Veena and I met for two hours, shortly after our initial meeting she had a plan for me, and I was off and running! It was an easy plan to follow and I experienced almost immediate results. A week after starting my customized Ayurveda plan, I felt like a different person. I had energy again and more than before. As a recovering alcoholic, it was disheartening to feel this way despite being active in a 12-step program for years. The liver cleanse Veena suggested was effective and easy to do. It felt good to take some tangible steps to support an organ that had taken such a beating for so many years. Veena's Ayurveda approach has led to wonderfully positive changes in a short time. I have more energy, anxiety has decreased, irritability too, and I'm eating better than ever. I love being able to do simple things that have such a marked impact on my life. I look forward to continued Ayurveda care with Veena.\" --Stephanie M. Minnesota Seasonal Consultations Sustain Balance \"I have been seeing Veena since 2010. Veena's genuinely thoughtful, kind and sensible approach to managing the forces of seasonal change for our overall health is, like her offerings, pure, fresh and refreshing.\" -- Mary K. St. Paul, Minnesota World-wide Consultations Before I met with Veena, I was always tired. I would wake up and then need to take a nap. I had pain all the time. Now I enjoy walks and the other day, I realized I had no pain, for the first time, and I am very happy about that. I am a believer now! --R.D. India Confident in my Health Now I discovered Saumya Ayurveda a year ago, and it changed my life dramatically. I found the answers I was looking for and the underlying causes for the distress I had experienced for years. Veena and I worked together to alleviate an acute problem with a kidney stone as well. In two days, I got rid of it completely and avoided an unpleasant procedure proposed by my MD. I feel very safe and secure working with her and applying Ayurvedic principles and remedies on a daily basis. Ayurveda is definitely a healthy way to lead your life. Thank you!\" --Lenna Alliev, Respiratory Therapist, Minnesota Caring and Easy to Relate I highly recommend Veena at Saumya Ayurveda. She is very professional, knowledgeable, caring and so easy to relate to. Don't hesitate to use her comprehensive services. So, so helpful. - D.W. Corrales, New Mexico Adios Anxiety I've been working with Veena since 2010. She has helped my overall health improve in many ways. We addressed my health using food as medicine and herbs. I used to have chronic sinus infections, but not any more. She also works with my emotional health. My anxiety has decreased significantly and I'm almost completely free of it! Emotional ups and downs are gone. Veena teaches you what to eat to maintain balance from one season to the next. I highly recommend seeing Veena for better physical and emotional health. -M.B. Minneapolis, Minnesota Puts My Mind at Ease Thank you so much! The consultation is super helpful and puts my mind at ease. I'm already feeling so differently--more energized! Like your advice on what to focus on during the craziness. Can't wait for the herbs to arrive. Happy Mother's Day! Thank you for taking such good care of all of us. --Elizabeth D. USA Improvement Week One The guidance and coaching that one receives at Saumya Ayurveda is crucial. It gives one the knowledge and tools to create balance independently at home with one's individual lifestyle. After the first week, thanks to my personal Ayurvedic plan, I discovered what it is to wake up in the morning feeling energetic and vibrant. During the day, I'm no longer drowsy but alert, yet calm. --Don Freeman Managing Editor, Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation Transitioned from Pharmaceuticals to herbal and food to control high cholesterol I found Saumya Ayurveda when I was looking for a holistic approach to my health and lifestyle. The Wellness Consultation, with individual attention and focus, has been wonderful. I have transitioned from pharmaceuticals to herbal and dietary approaches to manage my high cholesterol and calcium deficiencies. Digestive issues that have plagued me my entire life have disappeared. I am a dedicated user of the oils to ease arthritis pain. I was so pleased with my results that I recommended Saumya Ayurveda to my daughters and my mother. My mother enjoys the tea, and the oil is working so well for the arthritis in her hands and shoulders that she has been able to stop using harsh pain medications. Ayurveda is helping me to take care of myself and I am able to enjoy each day.\" --Rachelle Chase, retired Director Business Process, Target Corporation, Minnesota Loving the Changes In Me I am loving the changes in my body and mind as I continue to work with Veena. She always hits the right mark when it comes to the support I need. -Melanie, Albuquerque, New Mexico I've Made Significant Progress Recently I've had the pleasure of working with Veena on some major health issues. She's heard what I said and seemed to really feel what was going on in my body. Because of these things, she knew what I was going through and could guide my life-choices and provide the right Ayurvedic remedies. Over the past few months, I've made significant progress. Not only am I planning on continuing with Veena, but I can wholeheartedly recommend her to my relatives, friends and colleagues. -- Randall Krause, California Physician Testimonial As a physician, I have always believed 'Prevention is better than cure.' In an era of spiraling health care costs, Ayurveda is the logical and natural solution. I started working with Veena at a time when I was at the end of my tether, juggling my professional and personal aspirations. She responded to my desperate call and went out of her way to find ways to work things into my busy schedule. I was encouraged to pursue a steady approach to create lasting changes. Now when I see my patients, I see so many sufferings from similar symptoms related to diet and stress. I have routed several of my patients to Saumya Ayurveda. Veena is a blessing and such a rich resource. I am eternally grateful to Veena for anchoring me to my present state of health and peacefulness and for helping me to embark on a path towards the balance we all are striving for. Thank you so much. \u2014 Gauri Nagargoje, M.D., North Oaks, Minnesota Clients Since 2008 - and We Always Will Be One of the benefits of working with Saumya Ayurveda is the ease of virtual appointments. It's generally easier, in fact, than to see my primary care doctor here in my own town. Every member of my family has had consultations with Saumya Ayurveda - so we know how to eat well, what herbs to use when we need them, and we understand our constitutions and how to maintain balance with them. I particularly appreciate that when one of my children has been sick, Veena can recommend treatment options that are natural and easy to use. She figures out how to treat things that I can find at the local grocery or local health food stores, so we can start treatment straight away. Veena goes the extra mile. I have felt supported during these times of illness, as she continues consultation until health is regained, not just until the symptoms have passed. Saumya Ayurveda's quality of care is beyond compare. Veena has been there for me and my family to help maintain health.\" --C.B. Charlottesville, Virginia Grateful for Veena's Presence On My Journey I found Saumya Ayurveda at a time when I truly needed an ally and an unbiased outside perspective on some health imbalances in my life. After years of reaching out to various conventional medicine practitioners and relying on my own limited knowledge, I felt tired, lost and overwhelmed. The first few minutes of my initial consultation with Veena were a breath of fresh air. I felt a huge sense of affirmation. I felt like my head was finally above water. She helped me gain a holistic look at where I am while devising a wellness plan that was simple and do-able. Transportation limitations and bouts of crippling anxiety have historically prevented me from seeking help, so I really take advantage of Veena's virtual consultations. I'm very grateful for Veena's presence on my journey and look forward to having her at my side for many years to come.\" - Lindsey Madhavi Ruder, Wisconsin Care for Men's Health Update: A year ago, after some lab tests, I was told I had an \"abnormal\" liver. I thought of my mother, who had died fairly young from liver disease. Veena's ayurvedic recommendations, which included herbs and healthy foods, turned things around in less than six months. My liver was retested, and each lab result was in the \"normal\" range. This testifies to my longstanding mantra: In Veena I Trust. -- Don, Golden Valley, Minnesota Keen Awareness of the Healing Powers of Plants Veena possesses a wealth of intuitive knowledge about the subtle influences of the natural and psychical forces Ayurveda obtained by years of intensive meditative practice. She has developed a keen awareness of the healing powers of plants, as both food and medicinal herbs. This powerful combination of yoga practice and experience allows Veena to provide an effective path of healing tailored especially for you. You are in good hands with Veena. - Hame Persaud, Executive Vice President, HP Ingredients, Florida Prostate, Bladder Health When my father first saw blood in his urine, he was dead from bladder cancer in less than 3 years. So, when my doctor told me I had blood in my urine, I was scared to death\u2014almost. Veena recommended specific Ayurveda herbs, cranberry juice, and certain yoga asanas. The blood in the urine, which had persisted despite surgery, was gone in less than a couple of months, thanks to Ayurveda and Veena's treatment. Both have my utmost respect always! --D.F. USA Inflammation, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Healthy Heart I have seen Veena at Saumya Ayurveda for several years--in fact, my family sees her. She has helped me with blood pressure and cholesterol management as well as helping me reduce overall inflammation. I sleep better, my stress has reduced, and my energy has improved. During a period of high stress, I was waking with a racing heart and the herbal and lifestyle recommendations reversed it. I recommend Veena--she will stick by your side and be there when you need her. She is responsive, comprehensive and effective. -- Bryan Stenlund, Licensed Psychologist, Grand Rapids, Minnesota Businesses Who Recommend Saumya Ayurveda Ayurveda Oils & More - A. Muzda Ent.

I work full time, have a family, sports, commute--and this cleanse was manageable! I had such a positive cleanse experience, I plan to do it again and I have it on my planner already. -A.B. White Bear Lake, Minnesota Diabetes Care and Management Veena is experienced and caring. Her knowledge is astounding. She took the time with text support to help me get into habit of taking the herbs on time. She picked me up when I didn't have energy to keep going. My numbers quickly went from 6.3 to 5.7. As a fitness and wellness professional, I strongly recommend you take the first step with Veena. -N.L., Corrales, New Mexico Healing Ability it Soaring!

Thank you! I woke up at 2am again, I had so much to do at work my head was swirling. I remembered to say, \"This is Vata talking\" and fell immediately BACK TO SLEEP. - G.L. Minnesota Chronic Conditions - Effective Treatment! At the heart of Saumya Ayurveda's effective approach to holistic health and healing is Veena's intuitive wisdom and compassionate heart. Her treatment of my various chronic conditions has been effective! Her diagnosis and prescriptions are sometimes surprising at first, but eventually become crystal clear and right on target. --Emilio Bettaglio, Minneapolis, MN Relaxing Love Veena's relaxing spirit and the environment. -G.H. Corrales, New Mexico Recovered and Enhanced Immunity I highly recommend Veena at Saumya Ayurveda. She has helped me so much in leading a life of recovery. I had been dealing with an ongoing illness since 2016 that could not be diagnosed--even after a slew of tests. Between 2016-2019, I was constantly getting sick with severe colds/flu that would last for 2-3 months, I was not able to eat more than a small amount of food. I consulted with Veena at the beginning of 2019. Since then, I have only been sick a few times with it lasting only a few days). This seems to only happen when I haven't been following Veena's recommendations. I can't emphasize how important this has been to me to build my immune system and staying healthy. Just wanted to share. -- [Marisa Hernandez](https://www.facebook.com/marisa.hernandez.129?__tn__=K-R&eid=ARBZvXeUyIihvsP61wlzuWVE_bhpgPKQePCMwaBFonMSMDsQoRPY7EDG96hv29X2zocyb1h4NjRcoq6E&fref=mentions&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAIf8ZRV5gNE02QVSSQ2EmIHFjreSTy0W-3LpXO3G87Gs7CeEvv3YdseXEMNm3Dy5m92CoammGzUIMWXIxX9JnpBWJmY7P8fc9haZJDEqCtnsyJmCDdtDdanhqW1fV5PdPPmpKOM_frzoLUl7nMfoqnz_5zIs5QIjs3MYs26vYz25CCyfWjoiIwZNlV5Tzv9WqGPnXeMUnv1WrFdmHw1tK1PYdtwuZjbPQwZBLpTlalt-eLqBN8J4fOaNJdOcqP29T5dOrOU26pVc6oEK-pszIcMS6aOoHA_hkc4z1rqRqpdd9JDsjBk9HVslIH2XQ9i3-PSJS_ViJEVJ2D1Mf3QSER907W08kIRDMW_cgrglVajJAP7i6EHJ62FQN-F6DU3dBo2LVGQO_pTqgdKCjk_X_6tpEnj4gszxFbGGXOgndNg1GPyyiMV9Nezhocex2J-xzVvbB3EAYUYhrIYm6K_-p6QPuE6PFnhYyoGxcL2FHVewXDv3_0zZoym9WC1A), Corrales, New Mexico Supportive, Knowledgeable, Encouraging I'm so happy I had my consultation.

The treatment plans she devised, based on some of my biggest challenges or symptoms, were very insightful and specifically designed and purposed for me and my situation--which I loved.

There is a saying, \"The mind is more in the body, than the body is in the mind.\" The Saumya 3 step meditation process shifts us from fight-flight-freeze mode, to rest-restore-relax mode. Give it a try for forty days and observe the changes. The more grounded and relaxed we are, the smoother life flows. \"The breath is the connection between the mind and body, so by training the breath, we become calm, focused, and grounded, we slow down the aging process by decreasing stress. These practices are so simple and easy to have as part of our daily life. We actually feel and look younger.\" - Veena, Saumya Ayurveda 1.
