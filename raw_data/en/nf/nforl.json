Observations have been made regarding cellular and humoral immune dysfunction, abnormalities associated with the complement system and major histocompatibility complex gene expression, differences in soluble mediators of the immune response, and the presence of antibrain and antimyelin autoantibodies. In this article, we review these experimental and clinical observations, and examine preliminary efforts using immunomodulatory therapies to treat autism. - Type - Feature Article - Information [CNS Spectrums](/core/journals/cns-spectrums), 61 - 68 - Copyright - Copyright \u00a9 Cambridge University Press "}
