(Paperback) Description This bestselling immunization handbook (new, updated 2015 edition) evaluates each vaccine for safety, efficacy, and long-term effects. It contains important, uncensored information that many doctors don't even know. It includes significant studies, several case histories detailing vaccine-induced damage to children, and pinpoints for parents exact conditions that may put their own child at high risk. In addition, health alternatives are offered, along with legal options to mandatory shots. It contains 30 graphs and diagrams plus more than 900 footnotes and scientific references so that all of the information may be confirmed. Parents, educators, health professionals, and other concerned individuals have very few sources of information permitting them to make informed choices. But concerned parents are pleading for answers to their many questions. Doctors only tell them one side of the story; there is another side. This book helps concerned people make wise and responsible decisions. Includes information on ALL childhood shots, plus current data on HPV (cervical cancer), shingles, smallpox, and influenza vaccines. This book has been translated into many foreign languages.
