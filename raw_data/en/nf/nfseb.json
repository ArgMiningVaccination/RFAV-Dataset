Tea is a popular warm or cold beverage that is available in many flavors. The most popular tea is the one made with the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. However, herbal teas or tisanes are available and made with different plant parts such as roots, leaves, flowers, or barks, which are often used as herbs for culinary and medicinal purposes. Some of these teas are used for therapeutic purposes, especially for treating or managing ailments such as colic and diarrhea. However, limited clinical evidence exists on the general safety and efficacy of teas for toddlers. Read on as we share an overview of the possible benefits and side effects of tea for toddlers with some precautions to observe while offering it to them. Is Tea Safe For Toddlers? According to the NHS, tea (Camellia sinensis) isn't suitable for babies and young children [(1)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/weaning-and-feeding/drinks-and-cups-for-babies-and-young-children/).

Besides, tea contains tannic acid, which can interfere in the absorption of nutrients (iron and zinc), affecting a toddler's long-term health [(3)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279923885_Effects_of_caffeine_on_health_and_nutrition_A_Review) [(4)](https://www.oregon.gov/OHA/PH/HEALTHYPEOPLEFAMILIES/WIC/Documents/modules/infant-feeding-and-nutrition-staff.pdf). Herbal teas usually don't contain caffeine and that is one of the primary reasons why they are popularly known for their calming properties. They may also impart therapeutic effects when used appropriately. However, limited research exists on their safety and efficacy for infants and young children. Thus, its toddler-friendly nature may only be confirmed after consulting with a pediatrician before feeding. Common Herbs Used For Preparing Tea For Toddlers Here are some of the common herbs used for preparing herbal teas for babies, toddlers, and young children. - Catnip: Catnip is a medicinal herb from the mint family.

When used under pediatric guidance, herbal teas may treat and manage some ailments in babies and toddlers. For instance, chamomile tea's use is prevalent in complementary and alternative medicine to alleviate colic and diarrhea in infants and toddlers [(11)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51382558_Complementary_Holistic_and_Integrative_Medicine_Chamomile). Similarly, herbal tea use is also believed to relieve cold and cough, promote digestion, and enhance sleep. Consult an expert before using herbal teas for toddlers as their use needs caution. What Are The Side Effects Of Herbal Tea For Toddlers? Herbal teas have potential side effects that parents should be aware of before serving them to babies and toddlers. - Allergy: A toddler could be allergic to a herb or herbs present in a herbal tea. Some of the common symptoms of an allergic reaction are skin rash (hives), itching, tingling sensation in the mouth, swelling of the face, lips, throat, [and tongue](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/tongue-tied-baby-symptoms-causes-and-treatment_00749744/).

If your toddler is allergic to any food or substance, check with your doctor if the herbal tea can cross-react and cause allergic reactions. For instance, infants allergic to plants in the Apiaceae family, such as carrot, coriander, cumin, and parsley, could also be allergic to [fennel tea](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/fennel-seed-for-babies-water-recipe-benefits-uses_00658163/) [(12)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501793/). - Cross-interaction: Herbs contain active ingredients that may interact with drugs and dietary supplements. If your toddler is on a medication or consumes any supplement, consult a pediatrician before serving them herbal tea. Precautions To Take While Using Herbal Tea For Toddlers Observing precautionary measures could ensure the toddler's safety when using herbal tea for specific purposes. - Consult an expert before using herbal tea for toddlers. Herbal teas are not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA), meaning their safety and efficacy can't be guaranteed. - Communicate the intent of use to the expert. After considering their age and overall health, it will help them advise safe intake limits for your toddler and let you know whether mornings or bedtimes would be the best time to serve the tea. - Buy pure herbal tea from a reputed and trustworthy manufacturer and seller. It will help ensure the product is adulterant-free. - Purchase herbal tea sold in teabags. Loose tea is prone to contamination and adulteration. If you prefer using loose tea, buy it from a reputable store to ensure product quality. - Check the label carefully while buying herbal teas. Often herbal teas contain more than one type of herb and may contain other additives. - Store loose tea in an airtight container and teabags in their original packaging, away from direct sunlight, moisture, and heat. - Prepare tea as directed on the package or as advised by the doctor or expert. Usually, steeping a tea bag or some loose tea leaves in boiling water for three to five minutes is sufficient. - Feed no more than two to four tablespoons initially. If the toddler doesn't show any signs of discomfort or sensitivity, increase the amount gradually to recommended amounts. - Use fewer leaves if using loose tea. Using excess leaves can make the tea too concentrated, making the tea unpleasant to taste and increasing the risk of adverse effects, such as an [upset stomach](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/infant-baby-food-poisoning-symptoms-treatment_00762715/). - Avoid adding sweeteners, such as white sugar, while preparing herbal teas. If the tea tastes bitter, has a sharp taste, or the toddler doesn't like it, serve the tea in small quantities. You may serve it with sweet food items, such as cookies or honey. Do not add honey if serving the tea to a baby younger than 12 months since it may increase the risk of an adverse condition called infant botulismi [X]A rare food poisoning caused due to the toxins produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum. . - Do not serve tea to your toddler in a bottle or sippy cup. Serve the herbal tea in small sips with a spoon or in a small glass/cup. Frequently Asked Questions 1. What tea is safe for 2-year-olds?
