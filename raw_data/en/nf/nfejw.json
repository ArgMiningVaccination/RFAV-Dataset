When two or more states cannot agree which state is the individual 's state of residence , the state of residence is the state in which the individual is physically present.

History: Effective December 1, 1991; amended effective December 1, 1991; July 1, 1993; July 1, 2003; June 1, 2004; May 1, 2006: NDCC Except as provided in section 75-02-02.1-28.1, the following types of assets will be excluded in determining if the available assets of an applicant or recipient exceed asset limits: 1. Property that is essential to earning a livelihood. a. Property may be excluded as essential to earning a livelihood only during months in which a member of the medicaid unit is actively engaged in using the property to earn a livelihood, or during months when the medicaid unit is not actively engaged in using the property to earn a livelihood, if the medicaid unit shows that the property has been in such use and there is a reasonable expectation that the use will resume: (1) Within twelve months of the last use; or (2) If the nonuse is due to the disabling condition of a member of the medicaid unit, within twenty-four months of the last use. b. Property consisting of an ownership interest in a business entity that employs anyone whose assets are used to determine eligibility may be excluded as property essential to earning a livelihood if: (1) The individual's employment is contingent upon ownership of the property; or (2) There is no ready market for the property. c.

Good-faith efforts to sell must be repeated at least annually in order for the property to continue to be excluded. a. Persons seeking to establish retroactive eligibility must demonstrate that good-faith efforts to sell were begun and continued in each of the months for which retroactive eligibility is sought. Information concerning attempts to sell, which demonstrate that an asset is not saleable without working an undue hardship, are relevant to establishing eligibility in the month in which the good-faith efforts to sell are begun, but are not relevant to months prior to that month and do not relate back to prior months. ill A good-faith effort to sell real property must be made for at least three calendar months in which no bona fide offer for at least seventy-five percent of the property's fair market value is received before the property can be shown to be not saleable without working an undue hardship . .(21 A good-faith effort to sell property other than real property or an annuity must be made for at least thirty days in which no bona fide offer for at least seventy-five percent of the property's fair market value is received before the property can be shown to be not saleable without working an undue hardship. b.

(4) Any fund, insurance , or other property given to another person or entity in contemplation that its value will be used to meet the burial needs of the applicant or recipient shall be considered part of the burial fund. (5) At the time of application , the value of a designated burial fund shall be determined by identifying the value of the prepayments which are subject to the burial exclusion and asset limit amounts. (6) Designated burial funds which have been decreased prior to application for medicaid shall be considered redesignated as the date of last withdrawal. The balance at that point shall be considered the prepayment amount and earnings from that date forward shall be disregarded. (7) Reductions made in a designated burial fund after eligibility is established must first reduce the amount of earnings. (8) An applicant shall be determined eligible for the three-month prior period when a burial fund is established at the time of application if the value of all assets are within the medicaid burial fund exclusion and asset limit amounts for each of the three prior months. Future earnings on the newly established burial fund must be excluded. b. A burial plot for each family member. 142 4.

This asset must be identifiable and not commingled with other assets. 7. For nine months, beginning after the month of receipt, unspent assistance received from a fund established by a state to aid victims of crime, to the extent that the applicant or recipient demonstrates that such amount was paid in compensation for expenses incurred or losses suffered as a result of a crime.

It is not always possible to determine the value of assets with absolute certainty, but it is necessary to determine a value in order to determine eligibility. The valuation must be based on reasonably reliable information. It is the responsibility of the applicant or recipient, or the persons acting on behalf of the applicant or recipient, to furnish reasonably reliable information . Because an applicant or recipient may not be knowledgeable of asset values, and particularly because that person may have a strong interest in the establishment of a particular value, whether or not that value is accurate, some verification of value must be obtained. If a valuation from a source offered by an applicant or recipient is greatly different from generally available or published .sources, the applicant or recipient must provide a convincing explanation for the differences particularly if the applicant or recipient may be able to influence the person providing the valuation. If reasonably reliable information concerning the value of assets is not made available, eligibility may not be determined. Useful sources of verification include: 1. With respect to liquid assets: reliable account records. 2. With respect to personal property other than liquid assets: a. Publicly traded stocks, bonds, and securities : stockbrokers. 144 b. Autos, trucks, mobile homes, boats, farm equipment, or any other property listed in published valuation guides accepted in the trade: the valuation guide. c. With respect to harvested grains or produce: grain buyers, grain elevator operators , produce buyers; and, for crops grown on contract: the contract. d. With respect to stock in corporations not publicly traded: appraisers, accountants. e. With respect to other personal property: dealers and buyers of that property. f.. With respect to a life insurance policy: the life insurance company. 3. Real property. a. With respect to mineral interests: appraisers , specializing in minerals, mineral buyers, geologists. b. With respect to agricultural lands: appraisers, real estate agents dealing in the area, loan officers in local agricultural lending institutions, and other persons known to be knowledgeable of land sales in the area in which the lands are located, but not the \"true and full\" value from tax records. c. With respect to real property other than mineral interests and agricultural lands: market value or \"true and full\" value from tax records, whichever represents a reasonable approximation of fair market value; real estate agents dealing in the area; and loan officers in local lending institutions. 4. Divided or partial interests. Divided or partial interests include assets held by the applicant or recipients ; jointly or in common with persons who are not in the medicaid unit; assets where the applicant or recipient or other persons within the medicaid unit own only a partial share of what is usually regarded as the entire asset; and interests where the applicant or recipient owns only a life estate or remainder interest in the asset. a. Liquid assets. The value of a partial or shared interest in a liquid asset is equal to the total value of that asset. b. Personal property other than liquid assets and real property other than life estates and remainder interests. The value of a partial or shared interest is a proportionate share of the total value of the asset equal to the proportionate share of the asset owned by the applicant or recipient. 145 c. Life estates and remainder interests. &m 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 (1) The life estate and remainder interest tables must be used to determine the value of a life estate or remainder interest. In order to use the table, it is necessary to first know the age of the life tenant or, if there are more than one life tenants, the age of the youngest life tenant; and the fair market value of the property which is subject to the life estate or remainder interest. The value of a life estate is found by selecting the appropriate age in the table and multiplying the corresponding life estate decimal fraction times the fair market value of the property. The value of a remainder interest is found by selecting the appropriate age of the life tenant in the table and multiplying the corresponding remainder interest decimal fraction times the fair market value of the property. Life Estate and Remainder Interest Table Life Estate .04545 .95455 (2) The life estate and remainder interest tables are based on the anticipated lifetimes of individuals of a given age 149 according to statistical tables of probability. If the life tenant suffers from a condition likely to cause death at an unusually early age, the value of the life estate decreases and the value of the remainder interest increases. An individual who requires long-term care, who suffers from a condition that is anticipated to require long-term care within twelve months, or who has been diagnosed with a disease or condition likely to reduce the individual's life expectancy is presumed to suffer from a condition likely to cause death at an unusually early age, and may not rely upon statistical tables of probability applicable to the general population to establish the value of a life estate or remainder interest. If an individual is presumed to suffer from a condition likely to cause death at an unusually early age, an applicant or recipient whose eligibility depends upon establishing the value of a life estate or remainder interest must provide a reliable medical statement that estimates the remaining duration of life in years. The estimated remaining duration of life may be used, in conjunction with a life expectancy table, to determine the comparable age for application of the life estate and remainder interest table. 5. Contractual rights to receive money payments : a. Except as provided in subdivision d, the value of contractual rights to receive money payments in which payments are current is an amount equal to the total of all outstanding payments of principal required to be made by the contract unless evidence is furnished that establishes a lower value. b. Except as provided in subdivision d, the value of contractual rights to receive money payments in which payments are not current is the current fair market value of the property subject to the contract. c. Except as provided in subdivision d, if upon execution the total of all principal payments required under the terms of the contract is less than the fair market value of the property sold, the difference is a disqualifying transfer governed by section 75-02-02 .1-33.1 or 75-02-02.1-33.2 , and the value of the contract is determined under subdivision a or b. d. A contractual right to receive money payments that consists of a promissory note, loan, or mortgage is a disqualifying transfer governed by section 75-02-02 .1-33.2 of an amount equal to the outstanding balance due as of the date the lender or purchaser , or the lender's or purchaser 's spouse, first applies for medicaid to secure nursing care services, as defined in section 75-02-02 .1-33.2, if: 150 ( 1 ) Any payment on the contract is due after the end of the contract payee's life expectancy as established in accordance with actuarial publications of the office of the chief actuary of the social security administration ; (2) The contract provides for other than equal payments or for any balloon or deferred payment; or (3) The contract provides for any payment otherwise due to be diminished after the contract payee's death. e. The value of a secured contractual right to receive money payments that consists of a promissory note, loan, or mortgage not described in subdivision d shall be determined under subdivision a or b. For an unsecured note. loan, or mortgage . the value is the outstanding payments of principal and overdue interest unless evidence is furnished that establishes a lower value. History: Effective December 1, 1991; amended effective December 1, 1991; July 1, 1993; July 1, 2003; April 1, 2008; made before February 8, 2006. 1. a. Except as provided in subsections 2 and 10, an individual is ineligible for nursing care services, swing-bed services, or home and community-based services if the individual or the spouse of the individual disposes of assets or income for less than fair market value on or after the look-back date specified in subdivision b. b. The look-back date specified in this subdivision is a date that is the number of months specified in paragraph 1 or 2 before the first date on which the individual is both receiving nursing care services and has applied for benefits under this chapter, without regard to the action taken on the application. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 2, the number of months is thirty-six months. (2) The number of months is sixty months: (a) In the case of payments from a revocable trust that are treated as income or assets disposed of by an individual pursuant to subdivision c of subsection 4 of section 75-02-02.1-31 or paragraph 3 of subdivision a of subsection 3 of section 75-02-02.1-31.1; 151 (b) In the case of payments from an irrevocable trust that are treated as income or assets disposed of by an individual pursuant to subparagraph b of paragraph 1 of subdivision b of subsection 3 of section 75-02-02.1-31 .1; and (c) In the case of payments to an irrevocable trust that are treated as income or assets disposed of by an individual pursuant to paragraph 2 of subdivision b of subsection 3 of section 75-02-02.1-31.1. c. The period of ineligibility begins the first day of the month in which income or assets have been transferred for less than fair market value, or if that day is within any other period of ineligibility under this section, the first day thereafter that is not in such a period of ineligibility . d. The number of months and days of ineligibility for an individual shall be equal to the total cumulative uncompensated value of all income and assets transferred by the individual, or individual 's spouse, on or after the look-back date specified in subdivision b, divided by the average monthly cost, or average daily cost as appropriate , of nursing facility care in North Dakota at the time of the individual 's first application . 2. Except as limited by subdivision i of subsection 2 of section 75-02-02.1-24, an individual shall not be ineligible for medicaid by reason of subsection 1 to the extent that: a. The assets transferred were a home, and title to the home was transferred to: (1) The individual's spouse; (2) The individual 's son or daughter who is under age twenty-one , blind, or disabled; (3) The individual's brother or sister who has an equity interest in the individual's home and who was residing in the individual 's home for a period of at least one year immediately before the date the individual became an institutionalized individual ; or (4) The individual's son or daughter, other than a child described in paragraph 2, who was residing in the individual 's home for a period of at least two years immediately before the date the individual began receiving nursing care services, and who provided care to the individual which permitted the individual to avoid receiving nursing care services; 152 b. The income or assets: (1) Were transferred to the individual's spouse or to another for the sole benefit of the individual 's spouse; (2) Were transferred from the individual 's spouse to another for the sole benefit of the individual's spouse; (3) Were transferred to, or to a trust established solely for the benefit of, the individual's child who is blind or disabled; or ( 4) Were transferred to a trust established solely for the benefit of an individual under sixty-five years of age who is disabled; c. The individual makes a satisfactory showing that: (1) The individual intended to dispose of the income or assets, either at fair market value or other valuable consideration , and the individual had an objectively reasonable belief that fair market value or its equivalent was received; (2) The income or assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaid; or (3) For periods after the return, all income or assets transferred for less than fair market value have been returned to the individual ; or d. The asset transferred was an asset excluded or exempted for medicaid purposes other than: (1) The home or residence of the individual or the individual's spouse; (2) Property which is not saleable without working an undue hardship; (3) Excluded home replacement funds; (4) Excluded payments , excluded interest on those payments , and excluded in-kind items received for the repair or replacement of lost, damaged, or stolen exempt or excluded assets; (5) Life estate interests; (6) Mineral interests; 153 (7) An asset received from a decedent's estate during any period it is excluded under subdivision b of subsection 17 of section 75-02-02.1-28; or (8) An annuity. 3. An individual shall not be ineligible for medicaid by reason of subsection 1 to the extent the individual makes a satisfactory showing that an undue hardship exists. a. An undue hardship exists only if the total cumulative uncompensated value of all income and assets transferred for less than fair market value by the individual or the individual 's spouse is less than the total of all unpaid nursing care bills for services: (1) Provided after the last such transfer was made which are not subject to payment by any third party; and (2) Incurred when the individual and the individual's spouse had no assets in excess of the appropriate asset levels. b. If the individual shows that an undue hardship exists, the individual shall be subject to an alternative period of ineligibility that begins on the first day of the month in which the individual and the individual's spouse had no excess assets and continues for the number of months determined by dividing the total cumulative uncompensated value of all such transfers by the average monthly unpaid charges incurred by the individual for nursing care services provided after the beginning of the alternative period of ineligibility. 4. There is a presumption that a transfer for less than fair market value was made for purposes that include the purpose of qualifying for medicaid : a. In any case in which the individual's assets (and the assets of the individual 's spouse) remaining after the transfer produce income which, when added to other income available to the individual (and to the individual 's spouse) totals an amount insufficient to meet all living expenses and medical costs reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the individual (and by the individual's spouse) in the month of transfer and in the thirty-five months (or fifty-nine months in the case of a transfer from a revocable or irrevocable trust that is treated as assets or income disposed of by the individual (or the individual's spouse) or in the case of payments to an irrevocable trust that are treated as assets or income disposed of by the individual (or the individual's spouse)) following the month of transfer; 154 b. In any case in which an inquiry about medicaid benefits was made, by or on behalf of the individual to any person, before the date of the transfer; c. In any case in which the individual or the individual's spouse was an applicant for or recipient of medicaid before the date of transfer; d. In any case in which a transfer is made by or on behalf of the individual or the individual's spouse, if the value of the transferred income or asset, when added to the value of the individual's other countable assets, would exceed the asset limits at section 75-02-02.1-26; or e. In any case in which the transfer was made, on behalf of the individual or the individual's spouse, by a guardian, conservator , or attorney-in-fact, to the individual's relative, or to the guardian, conservator , or attorney-in-fact or to any parent, child, great-grandchild , aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew, whether by birth, adoption, and whether by whole or half-blood , of the guardian, conservator , or attorney-in-fact or the spouse or former spouse of the guardian, conservator , or attorney-in-fact. 5. An applicant or recipient who claims that income or assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaid must show that a desire to receive medicaid benefits played no part in the decision to make the transfer and must rebut any presumption arising under subsection 4. The fact, if it is a fact, that the individual would be eligible for the medicaid coverage for nursing care services, had the individual or the individual's spouse not transferred income or assets for less than fair market value, is not evidence that the income or assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaid. 6. If a transfer results in a period of ineligibility under this section for an individual receiving nursing care services, and the transfer was made on or after the look-back date of the individual's spouse, and if the individual's spouse is otherwise eligible for medicaid and requires nursing care services, the remaining period of ineligibility shall be apportioned equally between the spouses. If one such spouse dies or stops receiving nursing care services, any months remaining in that spouse's apportioned period of ineligibility must be assigned or reassigned to the spouse who continues to receive nursing care services. 7. No income or asset transferred to a parent, stepparent , child, stepchild, great-grandch ild, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew 155 of the individual or the individual 's spouse, purportedly for services or assistance furnished by the transferee to the individual or the individual's spouse, may be treated as consideration for the transferred ineerne or asset services or assistance furnished unless: a. The transfer is made pursuant to a valid written contract entered into prior to rendering the services or assistance ; b. The contract was executed by the individual or the individual 's fiduciary who is not a provider of services or assistance under the contract; c. Compensation is consistent with rates paid in the open market for the services or assistance actually provided; and d. The parties' course of dealing included paying compensation upon rendering services or assistance , or within thirty days thereafter . 8.

History: Effective October 1, 1993; amended effective December 1, 1996; July 1, 2003; June 1, 2004; May 1, 2006; April 1, 2008: January 1, Disqualifying transfers made on or after February 8, 2006. 1. This section applies to transfers of income or assets made on or after February 8, 2006. 2. Except as provided in subsections 6 and 15, an individual is ineligible for skilled nursing care, swing-bed , or home and community-based benefits if the individual or the individual's spouse disposes of assets or income for less than fair market value on or after the look-back date. The look-back date is a date that is sixty months before the first date on which the individual is both receiving skilled nursing care, swing-bed , or home and community-based services and has applied for benefits under this chapter, without regard to the action taken on the application . 3. An applicant, recipient, or anyone acting on behalf of an applicant or recipient, has a duty to disclose any transfer of any asset or income made by or on behalf of the applicant or recipient, or the spouse of the applicant or recipient, for less than full fair market value: a. When making an application ; b. When completing a redetermination; and c. If made after eligibility has been established , by the end of the month in which the transfer was made. 4. The date that a period of ineligibility begins is the latest of: a. The first day of the month in which the income or assets were transferred for less than fair market value; b. The first day on which the individual is receiving nursing care services and would otherwise have been receiving benefits for institutional care but for the penalty; or c. The first day thereafter which is not in a period of ineligibility. 5. a. The number of months and days of ineligibility for an individual shall be equal to the total cumulative uncompensated value of all income and assets transferred by the individual, or individual 's spouse, on or after the look-back date divided by the average monthly cost or average daily cost, as appropriate , of nursing facility care in North Dakota at the time of the individual's first application . b. A fractional period of ineligibility may not be rounded down or otherwise disregarded with respect to any disposal of assets or income for less than fair market value. 161 c. Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this section, in the case of an individual or an individual's spouse who makes multiple fractional transfers of assets or income in more than one month for less than fair market value on or after the look-back date established under subsection 2, the period of ineligibility applicable to such individual must be determined by treating the total, cumulative uncompensated value of all assets or income transferred during all months on or after the look-back date as one transfer and one penalty period must be imposed beginning on the earliest date applicable to any of the transfers. 6. For purposes of this section, \"assets\" includes the purchase of a life estate interest in another individual's home unless the purchaser resides in the home for a period of at least one year after the date of the purchase. 7. Except as limited by subdivision i of subsection 2 of section 75-02-02.1-24, an individual shall not be ineligible for medicaid by reason of subsection 1 to the extent that: a. The assets transferred were a home, and title to the home was transferred to: (1) The individual's spouse; (2) The individual's son or daughter who is under age twenty-one, blind, or disabled; (3) The individual's brother or sister who has an equity interest in the individual's home and who was residing in the individual's home for a period of at least one year immediately before the date the individual became an institutionalized individual; or (4) The individual's son or daughter, other than a child described in paragraph 2, who was residing in the individual's home for a period of at least two years immediately before the date the individual began receiving nursing care services, and who provided care to the individual which permitted the individual to avoid receiving nursing care services; b. The income or assets: (1) Were transferred to the individual's spouse or to another for the sole benefit of the individual's spouse; (2) Were transferred from the individual's spouse to another for the sole benefit of the individual's spouse; 162 (3) Were transferred to, or to a trust established solely for the benefit of, the individual's child who is blind or disabled; or (4) Were transferred to a trust established solely for the benefit of an individual less than sixty-five years of age who is disabled; c. The individual makes a satisfactory showing that: (1) The individual intended to dispose of the income or assets, either at fair market value or other valuable consideration , and the individual had an objectively reasonable belief that fair market value or its equivalent was received; (2) The income or assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaid; or (3) For periods after the return, all income or assets transferred for less than fair market value have been returned to the individual; or d. The asset transferred was an asset excluded or exempted for medicaid purposes other than: (1) The home or residence of the individual or the individual's spouse; (2) Property that is not saleable without working an undue hardship; (3) Excluded home replacement funds; (4) Excluded payments , excluded interest on those payments , and excluded in-kind items received for the repair or replacement of lost, damaged, or stolen exempt or excluded assets; (5) Life estate interests; (6) Mineral interests; (7) An asset received from a decedent's estate during any period it is considered to be unavailable under subsection 5 of section 75-02-02.1-25; or (8) An annuity. 8. a. An individual shall not be ineligible for medicaid by reason of subsection 2 to the extent the individual makes a satisfactory showing that an undue hardship exists for the individual. Upon 163 imposition of a period of ineligibility because of a transfer of assets or income for less than fair market value, the department shall notify the applicant or recipient of the right to request an undue hardship exception . An individual may apply for an exception to the transfer of asset penalty if the individual claims that the ineligibility period will cause an undue hardship to the individual. A request for a determination of undue hardship must be made within ninety days after the circumstances upon which the claim of undue hardship is made were known or should have been known to the affected individual or the person acting on behalf of that individual if incompetent. The individual must provide to the department sufficient documentation to support the claim of undue hardship. The department shall determine whether a hardship exists upon receipt of all necessary documentation submitted in support of a request for a hardship exception. An undue hardship exists only if the individual shows that all of the following conditions are met: (1) Application of the period of ineligibility would deprive the individual of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities of life or would deprive the individual of medical care such that the individual's health or life would be endangered ; (2) The individual who transferred the assets or income, or on whose behalf the assets or income were transferred , has exhausted all lawful means to recover the assets or income or the value of the transferred assets or income, from the transferee , a fiduciary, or any insurer; (3) A person who would otherwise provide care would have no cause of action, or has exhausted all causes of action, against the transferee of the assets or income of the individual or the individual 's spouse under North Dakota Century Code chapter 13-02.1, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act, or any substantially similar law of another jurisdiction ; and (4) The individual's remaining available assets and the remaining assets of the individual 's spouse are less than the asset limit in subsection 1 of section 75-02-02.1-26 counting the value of all assets except: (a) A home, exempt under section 75-02-02.1-27, but not if the individual or the individual 's spouse has equity in the home in excess of twenty-five percent of the amount established in the approved state plan for medical assistance which is allowed as the maximum home equity interest for nursing facility services or other long-term care services; (b) Household and personal effects; 164 (c) One motor vehicle if the primary use is for transportation of the individual , or the individual's spouse or minor, blind, or disabled child who occupies the home; and (d) Funds for burial of fi\u00b7;~e ttlousafld dollars or less YQ. to the amount excluded in subsection 3 of section 75-02-02.1-28 for the individual and the individual 's spouse. b. Upon the showing required by this subsection, the department shall state the date upon which an undue hardship begins and, if applicable , when it ends. c. The agency shall terminate the undue hardship exception , if not earlier, at the time an individual , the spouse of the individual, or anyone with authority to act on behalf of the individual, makes any uncompensated transfer of income or assets after the undue hardship exception is granted. The agency shall deny any further requests for an undue hardship exception due to either the disqualification based on the transfer upon which the initial undue hardship determination was based, or a disqualification based on any subsequent transfer. 9. If a request for an undue hardship waiver is denied, the applicant or recipient may request a fair hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 75-01-03. 10. There is a presumption that a transfer for less than fair market value was made for purposes that include the purpose of qualifying for medicaid: a. In any case in which the individual 's assets and the assets of the individual's spouse remaining after the transfer produce income which, when added to other income available to the individual and to the individual 's spouse, total an amount insufficient to meet all living expenses and medical costs reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the individual and by the individual's spouse in the month of transfer and in the fifty-nine months following the month of transfer; b. In any case in which an inquiry about medicaid benefits was made, by or on behalf of the individual to any person, before the date of the transfer; c. In any case in which the individual or the individual's spouse was an applicant for or recipient of medicaid before the date of transfer; d. \u00b7 In any case in which a transfer is made by or on behalf of the individual or the individual's spouse, if the value of the transferred income or asset, when added to the value of the individual's 165 other countable assets, would exceed the asset limits in section 75-02-02.1-26; or e. In any case in which the transfer was made, on behalf of the individual or the individual's spouse, by a guardian, conservator, or attorney in fact, to a relative of the individual or the individual 's spouse, or to the guardian, conservator, or attorney in fact or to any parent, child, stepparent, stepchild, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, great-grandparent , great-grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew, whether by birth, adoption, and whether by whole or half-blood, of the guardian, conservator, or attorney in fact or the spouse or former spouse of the guardian, conservator, or attorney in fact. 11. An applicant or recipient who claims that income or assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaid must show that a desire to receive medicaid benefits played no part in the decision to make the transfer and must rebut any presumption arising under subsection 1 0. The fact, if it is a fact, that the individual would be eligible for the medicaid coverage for nursing care services, had the individual or the individual's spouse not transferred income or assets for less than fair market value, is not evidence that the income or assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaid. 12. If a transfer results in a period of ineligibility under this section for an individual receiving nursing care services, and if the individual's spouse is otherwise eligible for medicaid and requires nursing care services, the remaining period of ineligibility shall be apportioned equally between the spouses. If one such spouse dies or stops receiving nursing care services, any months remaining in that spouse's apportioned period of ineligibility must be assigned or reassigned to the spouse who continues to receive nursing care services. 13. No income or asset transferred to a parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, grandparent, great-grandparent, great-grandchild , aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew of the individual or the individual's spouse, purportedly for services or assistance furnished by the transferee to the individual or the individual's spouse, may be treated as consideration for the transferred income or asset services or assistance furnished unless: a. The transfer is made pursuant to a valid written contract entered into prior to rendering the services or assistance; b. The contract was executed by the individual or the individual's fiduciary who is not a provider of services or assistance under the contract; 166 c. Compensation is consistent with rates paid in the open market for the services or assistance actually provided; and d. The parties' course of dealing included paying compensation upon rendering services or assistance, or within thirty days thereafter . 14. A transfer is complete when the individual or the individual 's spouse making the transfer has no lawful means of undoing the transfer or requiring a restoration of ownership. 15.

A child who is living outside of the parental home, but who is not living independently , or a spouse who is temporarily living outside of the home to attend training or college, to secure medical treatment , because of temporary work relocation required by an employer , or for other reasons beyond the control of the spouse, shall be allowed a separate income level during all full calendar months during which the child or spouse lives outside the home. No separate income level is otherwise available. c. During a month in which an individual enters a specialized facility or leaves a specialized facility to return home, the individual shall 183 be included in the family unit in the home for the purpose of determining the family size and the appropriate income level. An individual residing in a specialized facility shall be allowed the appropriate medically needy, workers with disabilities , or children with disabilities income level for one during all full calendar months in which the individual resides in the facility. d. During a month in which an individual with eligible family members in the home enters or leaves a nursing facility to return home, or elects to receive home and community-based services or terminates that election, the individual shall be included in the family unit in the home for the purpose of determining the family size and the appropriate medically needy, workers with disabilities , or children with disabilities income level.

History: Effective October 1, 1999; amended effective August 1, 2005: 75-02-02.2-10. Eligibility criteria. 1. Children ages birth through eighteen years of age are eligible for plan coverage provided all other eligibility criteria are met. Coverage for children who are eighteen years of age will continue through the last day of the month in which the child turns nineteen years of age. 2. A child who has current creditable health insurance coverage or has coverage which is available at no cost, as defined in section 2701 (c) of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 300gg(c)] is not eligible for plan coverage. 3.

History: Effective October 1, 1999; amended effective April 1, 2002; August 1, 2005: January 2010. 75-02-06-03. Depreciation. 1. Ratesetting principles require that payment for services includes depreciation on all capital assets used to provide necessary services. a. Capital assets that may have been fully or partially depreciated on the books of the provider, but are in use at the time the provider enters the program, may be depreciated. The useful lives of such assets are considered not to have ended and depreciation calculated on the revised extended useful life is allowable. To properly provide for costs or the valuation of such assets, an appraisal is required if the provider has no historical cost records or has incomplete records of the capital assets. b. A depreciation allowance is permitted on assets used in a normal standby or emergency capacity. c. If any depreciated personal property asset is sold or disposed of for an amount different than its undepreciated value, the difference represents an incorrect allocation of the cost of the asset to the facility and must be included as a gain or loss on the cost report. The facility shall use the sale price in computing the gain or loss on the disposition of assets. 2. Depreciation methods. a. The straight-line method of depreciation must be used. All accelerated methods of depreciation , including depreciation options made available for income tax purposes, such as those offered under the asset depreciation range system, may not be used. The method and procedure for computing depreciation must be applied on a basis consistent from year to year and detailed schedules of individual assets must be maintained. If the books of account reflect depreciation different than that submitted on the cost report, a reconciliation must be prepared by the facility. b. Except as provided in subdivision c, a provider shall apply the same methodology for determining the useful lives of all assets purchased after June 30, 1995. If a composite useful life methodology is chosen, the provider may not thereafter use the depreciation guidelines without the department 's written approval. The provider shall use, at a minimum, the depreciation guidelines to determine the useful life of buildings and land improvements . The provider may use: (1) A composite useful life of ten years for all equipment except automobiles and five years for automobiles ; or 189 (2) The useful lives for all equipment identified in the depreciation guidelines and a useful life of ten years for all equipment not identified in the depreciation guidelines . c. A provider acquiring assets as an ongoing operation shall use as a basis for determining depreciation: (1) The estimated remaining life, as determined by a qualified appraiser, for land improvements , buildings, and fixed equipment ; and (2) A composite remaining useful life for movable equipment , determined from the seller's records. 3. Acquisitions . a. If a depreciable asset has, at the time of its acquisition , a historical cost of at least one thousand dollars, its cost must be capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. Cost incurred during the construction of an asset, such as architectural , consulting and legal fees, and interest, must be capitalized as a part of the cost of the asset. b. All repair or maintenance costs in excess of five thousand dollars per project on equipment or buildings must be capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the equipment or building repaired or maintained, or one-half of the original estimated useful life, whichever is greater. 4. Proper records must provide accountability for the fixed assets and provide adequate means by which depreciation can be computed and established as an allowable resident-related cost. Tagging of major equipment items is not mandatory , but alternate records must exist to satisfy audit verification of the existence and location of the assets. 5. Donated assets, excluding assets acquired as an ongoing operation , may be recorded and depreciated based on their fair market value. In the case where the provider's records do not contain the fair market value of the donated asset, as of the date of the donation, an appraisal may be made. The appraisal must be made by a recognized appraisal expert and may be accepted for depreciation purposes. The useful life of a donated asset must be determined in accordance with subsection 2. The facility may elect to forego depreciation on a donated asset thereby negating the need for a fair market value determination . 6. Basis for depreciation of assets acquired as an ongoing operation. Determination of the cost basis of a facility and its depreciable assets of an ongoing operation depends on whether or not the transaction is a bona fide sale. Should the issue arise, the purchaser has the burden 190 of proving that the transaction was a bona fide sale. Purchases where the buyer and seller are related organizations are not bona fide. a. The cost basis of a facility and its depreciable assets acquired in a bona fide sale after July 1, 1985, is limited to the lowest of: (1) Purchase price paid by the purchaser ; (2) Fair market value at the time of the sale; or (3) The seller's cost basis, increased by one-half of the increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers , United States city average, all items, from the date of acquisition by the seller to the date of acquisition by the buyer, less accumulated depreciation recognized for cost reporting purposes. b. In a sale not bona fide, the cost basis of an acquired facility and its depreciable assets is the seller's cost basis, less accumulated depreciation recognized for cost reporting purposes as of the end of the report year immediately preceding the date of acquisition by the buyer. c. The cost basis of a facility and its depreciable assets acquired by donation or for a nominal amount is the cost basis of the seller or donor, less accumulated depreciation recognized for cost reporting purposes as of the end of the report year immediately preceding the date of acquisition by the buyer or donee. d. In order to calculate the increase over the seller's cost basis, an increase may be allowed, under subdivision a, only for assets with a historical cost basis established separately and distinctly in the seller's depreciable asset records. e. An adjustment may not subsequently be allowed for any depreciable cost disallowed in rate periods prior to January 1, 2006. f. For purposes of this subsection, \"date of acquisition \" means the date when ownership of the depreciable asset transfers from the transferor to the transferee such that both are bound by the transaction . For purposes of transfers of real property, the date of acquisition is the date of delivery of the instrument transferring ownership . For purposes of titled personal property, the date of acquisition is the date the transferee receives a title acceptable for registration. For purposes of all other capital assets, the date of acquisition is the date the transferee possesses both the asset and an instrument , describing the asset, which conveys the property to the transferee. 191 g. For rate years beginning on or after January 1, 2006, the limitations of paragraph 3 of subdivision a shall not apply to the valuation basis of assets acquired as an ongoing operation between July 1, 1985, and July 1, 2000. 7. A per bed cost limitation based on single and double occupancy must be used to determine the total allowable cost basis of buildings and fixed equipment for a facility with construction, renovation, or remodeling . a. Effective August 1, 2007 July 1, 2009, the per bed limitation basis for double occupancy is $88,872 $112,732 and for a single occupancy is $133,308 $169,098. b. The per bed limitation basis for single occupancy must be calculated using the limitation determined in subdivision a, multiplied by 1.5. c. The double and single occupancy per bed limitation must be adjusted annually on July first, using the increase, if any, in the consumer price index for all urban consumers, United States city average, all items, for the twelve-month period ending the preceding May thirty-first. d. The per bed limitation in effect at the time a construction , renovation , or remodeling project is put in service must be multiplied times the number of beds in double and single occupancy rooms to establish the maximum allowable cost basis of buildings and fixed equipment. e. The cost basis of a facility's buildings and fixed equipment must be limited to the lower of the recorded cost of total facility buildings and fixed equipment or the per bed limitation. f. The per bed limitation is not applicable to projects started or approved by the state health council before July 1, 1994. g. For rate years beginning after December 31, 2007, the limitations of subdivision a do not apply to the valuation basis of assets acquired as a result of a natural disaster before December 31, 2006. The provisions of this subsection may not be applied retroactively to any rate year before January 1, 2008. History: Effective September 1, 1980; amended effective December 1, 1983; October 1, 1984; September 1, 1987; January 1, 1990; January 1, 1992; November 22, 1993; January 1, 1996; January 1, 1998; July 2, 2003; September 7, legislatively approved cost increases . .1.. The department shall increase rates otherwise established by this chapter for supplemental payments or one-time adjustments to historical costs approved by the legislative assembly. 2. Any additional funds made available by the supplemental payments or one-time adjustments must be used for the legislatively prescribed purpose and are subject to audit. If the department determines that the funds were not used for the appropriate purpose. an adjustment must be made in accordance with subsection 5 of section 75-02-06-16 . History: Effective July One-time adjustments. 1. Adjustments to meet licensure standards. a. The department may provide for an increase in the established rate for additional costs incurred to meet licensure standards . The survey conducted by the state department of health must clearly require that the facility take steps to correct deficiencies dealing with resident care. The plan of correction must identify the salary or other costs increased to correct the deficiencies cited in the survey process. b. The facility shall submit a written request to the department within thirty days of submitting the plan of correction to the state department of health. The request must: ( 1) Include a statement that costs or staff numbers have not been reduced for the report year immediately preceding the state department of health's licensure survey; (2) Identify the number of new staff or additional staff hours and the associated costs required to meet the licensure standards ; (3) Provide a detailed list of any other costs necessary to meet licensure standards ; (4) Describe how the facility shall meet licensure standards if the adjustment is received, including the number and type of staff to be added to the current staff and the projected salary and fringe benefit cost for the additional staff; and (5) Document that all available resources, including efficiency incentives , if used to increase staffing, are not sufficient to meet licensure standards . c. The department shall review the submitted information and may request additional documentation or conduct onsite visits. d. If an increase in costs is approved, the adjustment must be calculated based on the costs necessary to meet licensure standards less any incentives included when calculating the established rate. The net increase must be divided by resident days and the amount calculated must be added to the established rate. This rate must then be subject to any rate limitations that may apply. 194 e. Any additional funds provided must be used in accordance with the facility's written request to the department and are subject to audit.
