The ma nual medici ne or therapeutic touc h (TT) is muc h more po werful than man y mod ern, biomedicall y orie nted ph ysicians think. Pain and discomfort can be alleviated just by touching the sick area and in this w ay help the patient to be in better contact with th e tissue and organs of their bod y. Lack of presence in the bod y seems to be connected w ith ma ny sympto ms that can be readi ly reversed simpl y by sensitive tou ch. When t ouch is co mbined with therapeutic work on mind and f eelings, ho listic heali ng seems t o be facilit ated and many probl ems can b e solved in a direct and eas y way in the clinic without drugs. This paper gives examples of the strength of manual medicine or th erapeutic touch in its most si mple form, and points to the po wer of ph ysical contact betw een physician an d his patient in the context of the theory and practice of holistic healing. Intimac y seems highl y ben eficial for the process of healing and it is ve ry importan t to disting uish clearl y betw een intimac y and sexuality for the ph ysician and his patent to be able to give and receive touch without fear and w ithout holding back emotionall y.

In brief, it is *Correspon ding author. \u00a92004 w ith author. 134Ventegodt et al.: Clinical Holistic Medicine (1 ) TheScientificW orldJOURNAL (2004) 4, 134 -147 possible to di vide injuries into visible or external inju ries that c an be taken at fa ce value and internal, less visible injuri es that require the assessment of a skill ed phy sician and som etimes also X-r ay, ultrasound, CT scanning, and bl ood tests. A truly experienced phy sician should be able to see at a glance whether a patient is acutely or chr onically ill, w hether the pa tient is in im minent dang er, as might be the case following a st roke or a heart attack, or a perforated appendix. Here the principles are the good inte ntion to help , combined with often very sim ple steps and procedures \u2014 so me words of co mfort, assuring the patient that i t will grow t ogether again, heal nicely , and beco me as good as new; a bandage; a splint or plaster; and pe rhaps a painkiller or two. While there are new tools such as CT scan ning, which help in m aking a better diagnosis and replace the guesswork and clinical ass essments of former ti mes, most treat ment options are the classic al ones. The modern ph ysician do es not seem to believe in the healing po wer of the th erapeutic touch (TT), but the si mple manual procedures are n ot all that th e skilled and holistically oriented phy sician can do with his hand s. Since ancient times, all the way back throug h histo ry to Hippocr ates (460-40 0 BCE), th e physician has used his hands to cure[ 1]. Many of these treat ments are not used toda y and are looked upon as inefficient, meaningless, or even , when it comes to the fam ous pelvic massage of Hippoc rates ( a cure for \"hy steria\" or in-balance in th e sexual energies in use up to 1900), a nonm edical sexual stim ulation, practically condem ned as sexually abusi ve[2]. There see ms to be a general fear of intimacy in the medical community of our time becaus e intim acy is taken to be the first step towards sexu ality. But it is very important to distinguish between i ntimacy and sexuality and to distinguish between the phy sical cont act between phy sician and patie nt in the intention of healing and sexual behavior in the in tent of pleasure. Intim acy is a prere quisite for holistic healing, while physicians ever since Hipp ocrates have agreed that sexual behavior between a phy sician and h is patient is unethical, destructive for the integrity of the patie nt, and for the professional relationship and therefore forbidden. THE HOLISTIC PROCESS OF HEALING New understanding of the holistic process of healin g seems to cast new light on these old procedures, which could give the m a renaissanc e in the medical clinic. The lif e mission theory [3,4,5,6,7,8 ] states that every body has a purpose of life and happiness co mes fro m living out this purpose and succeeding in expressing the core t alent i n life. To do this, it is important to develop as a person into what is known as the natural condition, a condition where the person know himself and uses all hi s efforts to achieve what is most important for him . The holistic process theory of healing[9,10,11,12] and the related quality of life theories[13,14,15] state that the r eturn to the natural state of bein g is possible whenever the person gets the resources needed for existential heali ng. The resources need ed are, according to the theory , awar eness, respect, car e, acknowledgment, and acceptance wit h support and processing in feeling, understanding, and letting go of negative attitudes and beliefs. The preconditions for holistic healing to ta ke place ar e trust and the intention t hat the healing will take place. Existential healing is not a local healing of an y tissue, but a healing of the wholeness of the person, m aking him much more resourceful, loving, and knowledgeable of himself and his own needs and wish es. In letting go of negative attitudes and beliefs, the person r eturns to a more responsible existen tial position and an im proved qualit y of life. Th e philosop hical change of the person's healing is of ten a change towards preferr ing difficult problem s and challenges, instead of avoiding diffic ulties in life[16,1 7,18,19,20,21,22,23]. The person who becomes happier and m ore resourceful often also beco mes more healthy, more talen ted, and m ore able t o function[ 24,25,26]. In this paper, we will acknowledge the fine art of sim ple, local, and therefore mostly nonholistic manual medicine or therapeutic touch with a nu mber of exa mples of co mplete healing with si mple mechanical means. This is the kind of procedur e by the physician that m ost people acknowledge an d appreciate. In a series of planned papers on clinical holistic medicine, we will sh ow how manual medicine or therapeutic touch, com bined with work on m ind an d feelings, can give healing to the patient on a more 135Ventegodt et al.: Clinical Holistic Medicine (1 ) TheScientificW orldJOURNAL (2004) 4, 134 -147 global and profound level in accordan ce with the holistic process theory of healing and the relat ed theories. PHYSICAL INJURIES The body is frail. The flesh is easily injured. Many structures suc h as the skin, muscles, cornea, eardru m, and m ucous mem branes are vulnerable. If we regard th e body as a mechanic al structure or machine, ther e is every reason to worry. It practically is designed to break by normal use. O bviously, life can only take such liberties with the design because the body has such tremendous healing potential. If so mething breaks, it will knit t ogether again. This means that a great deal of the treat ment is explaining t o the patient that there is no cause for worry , becau se the good body will take car e of itself if you leave it to heal in peace. So metimes, though, we can do much to help pr omote the healing process. Below ar e three short case r eports (as taken fro m the notes of the fa mily physician) that describe cla ssical medical treatment of physical injuries: Male, aged 36 years wit h an eye inj ury: The patient was cutting stone with an angle grinder without wearing glasse s and rec eived a glowing m etal chip (1 mm \u00d7 0.3 mm) in the left cornea at 7 o 'clock , outside the central vision. Chip rem oved with a needle point without an y visible epithelial dam age follo wing ane sthesia. Treatment: ey e pad and e ye drops. He was instructed to return in 3 days if pain persisted. The cornea of the e ye consists of an external mucous mem brane, the epith elium , under which is a crystalline lay er of protei n fibers that turn opaque wh en exposed t o heat because of coagulati on (as with egg white). H owever, the greatest damage to organs is often caused by the body seeking to heal the m. If the foreign object is re moved, the patient can avoi d a lengthy and painful infla mmatory healing process, which in the worst ca se may cause per manent da mage to the cor nea. The art is to re move the foreign object withou t causing damage. When th at is not possi ble, the ph ysician must avoid causing more dam age than the natural healing process woul d do. In this ca se, the chip that was burnt into the cornea of a 36- year-old wor ker was remo ved without a ny significant damage. The patient was m ore frightened than hurt . Male, aged 45 years with a burst eard rum: The patient burst an eardru m when blowing his nose y esterday . Exam ination: s mall cut, 1/4 of t he eardru m diameter, neatl y closed with coagulu m. Should return to co nsult ation in 3 weeks, if hearing is not back to norm al. It is the most exalted job o f the ph ysician to conv ince the patient that the bod y is strong eno ugh and will heal without any problems. Naturally, the latter is not alwa ys true, but we believe that the lack of confidence may dela y the healing of damaged tissu e if it leads to a withdrawal o f attention from the ar ea. The bad habi ts that may spring from the patient's la ck of confiden ce in the bod y following a trau ma can also lead to more damage. If y ou do n ot trust y our foot to carry you after an injur y, protrac ted incorrect use of and pu tting of overl oad on t he foot may lead to new injurie s. Male, aged 45 years with scar ti ssue: Keloid for mation \u2014 hard scar ti ssue 40 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm above right heel \u2014 correspondin g to wound caused earlier by the hoof of a horse. Gentle massage. Prognosis: will pass in the c ourse of 6 months. The patient can continue to do his own mass age. Wounds m ay heal with considerable keloid form ation. We believe that recovery will be quicker if w e massage the tension and shock o ut of the wound , but there is no scientific evidence of thi s. Under an y circu mstances, the patient will beco me familiar with the scar during the massage and will often feel the problem diminishing, whet her the keloid disappears or not. 136Ventegodt et al.: Clinical Holistic Medicine (1 ) TheScientificW orldJOURNAL (2004) 4, 134 -147 PAIN IN THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM Pain in the l ocomotor sy stem constitutes the greates t complaint by people in the western hemisphere, although it is actually quit e easy to reli eve. Neverth eless, many adults and chi ldren do not get the help they need from their fam ily physician or general prac titioner (GP) and therefore have to live with the pain through large parts of their lives. In any school yard, you can find children sitting on benches with growing pains, unless the y are li mping about pla ying. Many cases of stom achache in childre n are caused by tension i n the abdom inal muscles because of f ear or insecu rity. It is oft en easy to r emedy these problem s if the GP and the parents are willing to consider what lies behind the m. Male child, aged 1 3 year s with knee pain and growing pain: Pain in left l ower leg 3 cm below the knee and laterally . Exam ination: there is no patholo gy around kn ee or leg. Only finding is a v ery tender ar ea 3 \u00d7 3 cm about a h andsbreadth below the knee, which is massaged until free from pain, when walking no longer hur ts. Instruction in self- treatment. A young boy co mes limping into the surgery . His kn ee hurts and he can barely walk. After 10 min, the painful area has been identified and massaged until free fro m pain. Miraculously , the boy has a nor mal gait again wi thout any com plaints. Contact, touch, r eassur ance, confrontation of the pain, and when the patient becomes present i n the knee again, the sy mptoms ar e gone. We wonder whether it is mostly in the boy's consciousness that the status of th e knee is upgra ded from bad to healthy? Pain that vanishes on touch can be instructed and e xplained to the m other in order to touch her child, be attentive, and the pain will often disappear. We work with holistic medicine and because we approach the cause of the problem , we are able to help the boy . Fem ale, aged 36 years with knee pain after fall : She fell on her knee 3 months ag o with no swell ing or discol oration at the ti me. Her knee is still hurting. She beli eves that there is a bone frag ment or sim ilar. Pain loca lized in subcutis just below a scar on the knee that bec omes visible with the leg extende d. Kne e is massaged alm ost until free fro m pain. The patient is encouraged to let partner massage 10 min each day for 2 weeks. Should return if the pro blem persists. Children are not alone in finding it diffi cult to repossess their bodies after a trauma. Oft en people really truly hurt, day in and da y out, until som eone asks: \"Is this where you hurt?\" pressing the fingers right into the pain and making the patient catch his breath and then breathe it all out, letting go of whatever he is unconsciousl y guarding, t he painful site. Letting go is a simple cure, as old as the art of healing, but trul y difficult for p eople of the world toda y, who keep han ging on to it all. Fem ale, aged 28 years with sprained ankle: Industrial injury y esterday \u2014 stumbled and twisted her ankle. Slight swelling ar ound left ankle laterally , claim s having difficulties making her toes \" work\". Exa mination: no indirect tendern ess, dire ct tenderness corresponding to strokes from lateral epicondy le to forefoot. No loss of sensitivity . Protective i mmobilization of spra in. Instruction: able to work. Prescribe mobilization until pain thr eshold, analgesics if required. Esti mated time before healing 2- 3 weeks. Some of the jo ys of being a phy sician come fro m knowing the natural course o f healing. Once y ou pass this knowledge on to the patient, who then accepts the situation, the problem is often solved. Pain or disco mfort for 3 weeks is quite acceptable once you know th at this is how it is supposed to be. So a brie f talk to m ake the patient aware of this is very valuable. 137Ventegodt et al.: Clinical Holistic Medicine (1 ) TheScientificW orldJOURNAL (2004) 4, 134 -147 Male, aged 2 1 years with back problem s after football: This pat ient has had back pain for 2 months, since he fell on a hard su rface, l anding straight on his back while play ing football. Exa mination: spine: norm al tensi on correspondin g to nec k and should ers, upper and lower back. It is possible to induce the fa miliar pain by pressing on the tense muscles, but not by pr essing the spinous processes. mmended exercises: press- ups, bending forward as in touching the toes. Break the vicious circle by relaxing an d exhal ing when it hurts instead of getting tense. Should return if the problem persists. Many people see the bac k as a we ak structure. It is not, quite the contrary. When people get \"back trouble\", it is mostly mild sprains or minor m uscular problems that will nor mally resolve easily with training and exercise s. Every now and then a patient does not willingly accept the thesis that the back is strong. When so me people refuse to drop the idea th at \"their back is weak \", until they have had psychotherapy, it is because of the im portant sy mbolic me aning of the spine. A patient who subconsciously feels \"spineless\" cannot have a strong back. There is a lot of roug h play on the sp orts fields and young m en may suffer so me serious tissu e damage when play ing foot ball or doing other sports. Fortunatel y, the bod y has great healing potential, so all they really need to worry abou t is the head (brai n) and knees (cru ciate liga ments). The knee see ms to be the footba ll pla yer's weakest link. Rem aining awar e of the knee during the gam e is the best form of prevention, a nd it can be developed through different exercises in enhanced presence in the body . Fem ale, aged 24 years with back p ain: Back pa in. T2 -T12 very tense and ten der, almost arched, m anipulated into place with 10-20 loud snaps f ollowing a brie f talk about why the patient is tense: she is moving and is findin g it very proble matic. Afterwards sh e feels m uch better. Back pain is another widespread co mplaint often encountered in medical practice. Often people do not realize or simpl y ignore th e correlation between major acute problem s in life and stresses in the back. As soon as the y beco me aware of the correlation, the y virtually hit jackpot. The back pain is almost gone i n a minute and the proble ms resume their full e motional s cope. It se ems possible to t emporarily \"park\" acute emotional problems as str esses in the back. Obvious ly this does not solve the problems, but rather makes them worse. Male, aged 74 years with \"froz en shoulder\": After helping o ut durin g a rem oval, the patient had p ain in the left arm and he found it diffic ult to lie on t he arm or carry things. There is a slight tingling down into th e fingers. He has trouble getting dressed. Exam ination: distinct tenderness correspondi ng to lateral end of left supraspinatus muscle and tenderness in the shoulder. No lowered sen sitivity, but reduced strength in brachial muscles, probabl n: referral ph ysiotherapy and prescription for analgesics and to avoi d lifting heavy objects with ar m for 2 -3 months, but rem ember to use it. Protective i mmobilization can be de ceptive. There is nothing wrong except pain or tenderness, but th e whole ar m may have lost almost all its strength. A few carefully chosen re marks to the effect that all is well will often, as in t his case, restore a lot of the str ength. And i n our opinion, the arm should be used with care and not spared co mpletely . It should be exercised and used to the pain t hreshold. 138Ventegodt et al.: Clinical Holistic Medicine (1 ) TheScientificW orldJOURNAL (2004) 4, 134 -147 INFECTIONS The human body woul d be eaten by viruses, bact eria, fungi , and ot her parasites within just 24 h if not for an effective i mmune defen se sy stem. At the m icrobial level, we fi ght bravely for our survival. Once the bacteria get the upper han d for a while, the alarm is sounded in t he imm une sy stem . Only then do we beco me aware of their existence. In fections are some of the m ost frequent disorders in general practice. Infections come about when the imm une sy stem is weak, which is often the case when a p erson is not thriving . Male, aged 41 years wit h a chronic throat infection: Severe throat com plaints with pain and recurrent tonsill itis. Exam ination: or al cavit y: larynx swollen and tender, no coating. Strep A negative; distinct pain corr espondin g to hyoid bo ne, which is unlikel y to be related to the inflammation; thr ee large ly mph nodes bilaterally along the sternoclaidomastoideus muscle. Diagnosis: ch ronic throat i nfection. We talk abou t potential causes of this proble m and it turns out that the patient sings and has to force his voice. It bega n with a throat infection. Pain probably due to tension in the throat becaus e of incorrect use. He needs to work with hi s voice and learn to relax. We shall wait an d see. A chronic inflammation of the throat i s interesting in that it ofte n appears to be com pletely or alm ost sterile. It is n ot caused by bacteria, but rather by an internal disturbance in the body itself that the patient can suppress with training, exercises, and working with his or her consciousness, while seeki ng the cause of the disease . EDEMA AND ALL ERGY Several other conditions can be relieved by som e simple steps and/or patience. Let us look at some of them in the next case re cords. Female, aged 20 years with ankle edema (swelling): Edem a in l ower li mb, stands a lot. Auscultation of the heart: norm al. Diag nosis: [not caused by another disease] ankle edema. Prescribe exercises to activate skeletal calf muscle pu mp. Should come back for follow-up t o talk about body use, when standing at work. A young woman should n ot suffer swollen legs. There is some imbalance that she ough t to get rid of. But how deep can y ou go when talking to a youn g woman livi ng a fast life? So we provide a \"quick fix\" and tell her that she can come back for more. She does not feel the need to off-hand. She is given ankle- flexing exercises, but not diuretic drugs. Fem ale, aged 51 years with an itching eye: Allergic conjuncti vitis [a sterile inflammation of the conjunctivae, the mucous membranes covering the e ye] in right eye, intensified by her scratching. We tr y prescribing e ye com press and ey edrops. Another class ic: When it itches, y ou scratch, making th e itching worse, and then you scratch even more. Where does i t end? In this case the patie nt had to have her ey e covered. That broke the circle and the ey e was allow ed to heal. Male, aged 35 years with pain in the scrotum: Presented with very tender righ t side of scrotu m a week ago, now no co mplaints except f or worry . He was infor med that the 139Ventegodt et al.: Clinical Holistic Medicine (1 ) TheScientificW orldJOURNAL (2004) 4, 134 -147 finding is qui te normal, an d so is varico cele [swellin g of the scrotum] . Should return in the event of acute problems. Embarrassing parts of the body, the parts most often the objects of teasing when we ar e little, are hard to relate to and often problematic. PSYCHOL OGICAL AND SOCIAL PROBLE MS Often a patient consults a phy sician about pr oblems that are not phy sical. Our mentality and our environm ent are intricatel y connected, so here we ar e really put to t he test. To help a patient with psychological problems, he or she will often need to work on perception of life and hum an nature. Many times it does not take a lot to achieve great results. T he key to the matter is to put the patient on the right track and the rest will follow. In the case of childre n, often the parents are behind the problem and the ones in need of help. Here also phy sical touch and holding see ms mandatory for succes s. Oft en this is not even mentioned in the ca se record as it is taken fo r granted. Sometim es the holding is solely emotional, but of the same intense q uality as phy sical holding. This is \"holdi ng without h olding\", a beautiful art that can solve many problem s. Girl, aged 5 weeks with crying: 5-week exam inatio n. She de velops normally and well. Parents belie ve she has colic. She is ve ry hot because her parents dress her too war mly for the weather, 25 -30\u00baC. She stops crying when the y take some of her clothe s off and begins again when they pu t her clothes back on. Guidance. Parents who cannot m ake their child stop cr ying will often say that it has \"abdominal colic\", spontaneous stomachache of un known cause. In our experience, it is alway s possible to m ake the child stop cr ying if you can satisfy its needs (perhaps except for child ren with severe brain d amage). This child was undressed in the su mmer heat and i mmediately stopped cr ying. After the exam ination, the pa rents dressed their child again, who immedi ately started cry ing. It is someti mes a mystery how parents can be so unobservant. It gives a feeling that r eally skilled specialists are needed in childcare. Modern phy sicians do not believe that \"colic \" can explain why children cry , but in the old day s this wa s considered a reasonable explanation. We have a p atient who was left to cry in the stairway for 3 m onths on end. O bviousl y it is not acceptable to neglect and m altreat infants in this manner. Girl, aged 3 years with a fussy mother: The gir l is thriv ing and lo oking well, but mother thinks she has a sore throat. E xamination: t onsils swollen, but not red or coated. General health not affected. Diagnosis: viral infection. Wait and see for 8 d . The \"fussy mother\" torm ents people around her. It i s difficult to inspire a mother with confidence that her girl is stron g and able to cope if she f undamentally lacks faith in life. We si mply ask the girl, who sa ys that she is fine. If she is not the least aff ected she has the last word on the m atter. Fem ale, aged 25 years a nd a single mother: (1) Ear pain that turns out to s tem from a major blockage/m uscle ten sion in the neck, wh ich is massaged. (2) Crying. She has many problem s with her son, hard to be a lo ne parent. Cannot m anage the son who is far too active and do mineering. She wants to d o really well for him . We talk about her defining her own lim its instead of setting lim its for her son, which coul d be the caus e for the tension in the neck. Instructed not to hit the child. Invited to co me back to talk problems over. 140Ventegodt et al.: Clinical Holistic Medicine (1 ) TheScientificW orldJOURNAL (2004) 4, 134 -147 Things often tie together a nd often the whole situa tion cr ystallizes as soon as t he patient receives help in analy zing it. Here, the mother is having trouble contr olling herself, which is take n out on t he child, who m she feels she cannot manage. She is tense and hurts, which makes her torment her child even m ore. With enhanced consciousness an d acknowledgment things slowly fall int o place. Female, aged 61 years with severe overweight and cervical problems: Weight 1 15 kg. Present with problem s wit h her neck, which locks in an anteflexed position [bending forward ]. Has seen a chiropractor who s aid there is no physical obstacle to her l ifting her head. Exam ination: lum bar lordotic curve much enlarged and compensated by a m uch enlarged ky photic curve. No signs of spinal di sorders. She is instructed to lose weight and strengthen back muscles b y eating less, taking long walks, swi mming 2-3 times a week, preferably doing back tens ion and extension exercise s and exercis e by \"reaching down to the toes from front and side \". The holistic physician is a nightm are to an y severely overweight back patient. After all, it is really your own responsibilit y how much you weigh and what state y our back is in. We encourage them to look at them selves fr om the outside, assu me responsibilit y, and do som ething about their situation. Ei ther we get through to them or they look for anothe r doctor with a more \"understanding\" attitude. In our opinion the latter option would be like ly to lead to a long career as a patient in the healthcare sy stem . Fem ale, aged 38 years with overweight: Slimness plan. 131 kg. Pr esents fully motivated an d has m ade the following plan: (1) swimming twice a week, (2) cycling to town and to bingo, (3) eating low-fat food, mostly crisp bread with low-fat cheese. W e talk about how diet shoul d include m any vegetables and little m eat. She intends to live off her fat deposits and wants to lose 31 kg over the n ext 31 weeks to weigh 100 kg. Thi s means lowering her dail y calorie intake to two- thirds of current lev el. We talk about how to mentally overcome the sensation of h unger. Check -up ever y month. A patient wh o has made her own plan for sli mness shoul d mean b usiness. For some reason, it is al most as difficult to stop overeating as it is to quit s moking. We believe in addressing the dependency directly , but this is often very tou gh on the patient. Beneath a pa ttern of eating disor ders the patient of ten has some serious existential problems. SEXUAL P ROBLEMS AND PAIN DURING INTERCOURSE Disco mfort d uring interco urse is more likely to have a psy chological than a physiological explanation. A large am ount of superfluous testing is done because peopl e are not in sufficient contact with their privat e parts[ 27]. Female, age d 35 years with lack of resour ces: For the past 4 weeks, this patient has suffered from pain, dizziness, headac he, and fa tigue with perhaps a slightly elevated temperature. Pain duri ng intercours e. Tw o young children, full-tim e job, m arital problem s. Examination: a patient w ho is tired with few places to refu el. Pelvic exam ination: tenderness in upper left side of the vagina. Sterilized, faithful to her husband. I nspection: vul va, va gina, vaginal orifi ce all natural except from some yellowish dis charge (m icroscopy ): an i mbalance due to absence of lactobacilli [ lactic aci d bacteria] , otherwise normal, no clue cells [ cells covered b y tiny bacteria only visible under a m icroscope] . Exploration: no a dnexal tenderness or cervi cal motion tenderness correspondin g to the uterus, otherwise as stated ab ove. Auscultation of the lungs and heart: normal . No focus found. Diagnosis: li mited resources. Prescribe lactic aci d bacteria vagitories. et al.: Clinical Holistic Medicine (1 ) TheScientificW orldJOURNAL (2004) 4, 134 -147 When the en ergy of l ife is low, the pa tient often develops s ymptoms fro m all organ s ystems \u2014 fro m headache to abdom inal com plaints. This patient f eels that her bod y is \"slipping\", but she does not recognize the pattern behi nd it, namely that she live s all wrong and that is wh at her sy mptoms are about. It is easy to see fro m the outside. Althoug h we o we it to the patient to exam ine her thoroug hly, the conclusion is alm ost given before hand Two youn g children and a full-tim e job is a lot; marital problems into the barg ain clearly too much. She should stay home fro m wo rk for a week and reconsider her life. Her body tells her that she has reach ed the lim it. But will she understand? And is she ready to do something about it ? The classic art of healing is still a great part of th e work of a GP an d in dail y practice we often call i t \"manual medicine\". It is b ased on a solid understandi ng of the human body , the mind, and the correlation between them causing the sy mptoms that are bot hering the patient. This understanding will help the physician to work on the r elevant a ttitudes and behavior of the pa tient, so that the patient becomes presen t in the body and uses the body in a better manner. T he body is relieve d of some of the pressure and th e self-healing f orces are set free. As illust rated by the above cases, it often takes surprisingl y little and the effect may well be substantial and lasting. In manual medicine, we work with the body as it is. This im poses so me limits on how far we can go; limits that can be expande d considerab ly by the experienced phy sician. DISCUSSI ON There are many way s of touching, li ke therapeu tic massage (TM), healing touch (HT), Reiki o r therapeutic touch (TT), which can be clas sified a s energy or metaphy sical therapies, one of the five domains created b y the National Instit utes of Hea lth (NIH) Office of Com plementary and Alternativ e Medicine (C AM)[28 ]. A Medline (PubMed) searc h on January 29th, 2004 f ound 470 rec ords under th e heading of T T. Many studies are published in nursin g jour nals with evidence that TT has the abilit y to cause rel axation, also laboratory evide nce for ph ysiological change towards relaxation and im proved immune function, but t he last entry was a study on improvement of sy mptoms in cancer[ 29]. crossover inte rvention stu dy[29], where the author s tested the effects of TM and HT in com pariso n to presence al one or standard care, in inducing relaxation and reducing s ymptom s in 230 subjects. TM and HT low ered blood pressure, respir atory rate, and heart rate. TM lowered anxiety and HT lowered fatigue, and both lowered total m ood disturbance. Pain ratings were lower after T M and HT, with a 4-week treat ment with nonsteroidal and anti- inflammatory drug useless during TM. There were no effects on nausea. Presenc e reduced res piratory rate and heart rate, but did not differ from standard care on any measur e of pain, nausea, mood states, anxiety , or fatigue. This treat ment was an addition to receiving cancer che mother apy. We see problem s mainly connected to t hree areas: pain and dam age, love a nd intim acy, gender and sexuality with ethical and legal problems included. Pain and Damage Often, when we work with phy sical pa in in t he clinic, like knee pain, we must actually enha nce the pain to make the p atient confront it and integrate this area of the body with the connected chock (trauma with overwhelm ing pain) and f eelings. It is extre mely important to discri minate bet ween pain that feels like something is wrong or bei ng destructed ( destructiv e pain , as when some bone is broken inside, and you create a pressure on the wounded per iost) and therapeutic pain (called paradoxal pai n) as when sor e shoulders are massaged, which h urt in a goo d, com forting wa y. Intense paradoxal pain is often needed t o heal strong p hysical locom otor pain[ 30], and it is very im portant that t he patient full y understand the integrative process. If not, you can be accused of ca using a worse condition than before and you now beco me the cause of the conditi on in t he mind of the patient. This is a self-defense on the part of th e 142Ventegodt et al.: Clinical Holistic Medicine (1 ) TheScientificW orldJOURNAL (2004) 4, 134 -147 patient, not wanting t o assume responsibilit y for his/ her own pain and not want ing to go i nto this area of the bod y and the connected often stron g and negati ve feelings from a personal past. So the ph ysician's whole attitude towards pain is of extre me importa nce for the s uccess of the therapeutic touch. The physician must be loving and holdi ng on one side an d firm (in a way merciless), direct, an d deter mined and totall y without pity for the patient on the othe r. To acco mplish this, where you can hol d and m ove the patient at the same ti me, is the fine art o f medicine. You are to be trusted by the patient, while y ou inflict pain often rising to alm ost the same int ensity as the original trauma, if just fo r a short moment, for th e patient to con front, integrat e, and heal. There is, in contrast to the nor mal idea of the body' s inner space as hidden, no place of the body which cannot be reached by the han ds of a profic ient phy sician, except from the areas co mpletely cowered with bone (the bra in, deep nasal cavity , spine cavity , bone marrow). \"Manipulation\" is taking touch in to physical m oveme nt. This is highly effective, but needs so m uch sensitivity for the patient's body and f eelings that it is best to avoid it in many situations, not to do harm, especially when it co mes to the neck. Chiropractic, hi gh-energ y manipulations of the back and neck and other join ts can be ver y efficient in \"ope ning\" ol d blockages; doing this in the hi gh neck takes a specialist or very experienced phy sician because o f the danger of causing whiplash-like da mage. The d anger is not really as m uch that you can m ake a phy sical dam age, because th e force of your hands is only a small percentage of the force inflicted in a car accident, but again the patient can believe that you made further damage on his neck. Manipulation of ch ildren also takes an expert. Love and Intimacy The following case re cord from an advanced holistic ses sion[31 ] shows the intimacy needed for healing of the deeper lay ers of the patient' s exist ence (love, power, and sexualit y)[6]. Fem ale, aged 30 b ut em and sexua lly \"dead \": Eleventh conversation and sexologi cal procedure: acceptance through touch. She is so beautiful, fine, and sensitive wit h a pure innocent consci ousness. A nd at the same ti me, she i s to a great extent co mpletely dead. We have agreed that today I (SV) will play the role of the good father she ha s never had. She lies on the couc h cry ing, and I hold her and kis s her neck and tell her that she is the apple of m y eye. We talk about what enneagram subtype she is: social, sexual, or survival, and it is in her judgment as though all her problem s are concerned with gender and sex. I am in agreem ent wi th this. We therefore agre e to work on her acceptance of her own gender and he r own sexualit y through accepting touch: supportive acceptance through contact. She first holds herself on the outside of the vulva (on the outsi de of her briefs), with m y hand su pporting arou nd hers. Afterwards I ho ld right on, whi le she holds her hand on top of mine. If she holds h arder, I hold harder; if she holds m ore softly, I hold m ore softly; if she lets go, I let go too. In that way she controls the session, accor ding t o her need fo r support. Conversation: in the meanti me, we talk about how her bo yfriend onl y wants to do it r ight for her sexually, whil e she onl y wants to do i t right f or him. She is reading a book about wom en's orgasm s - m ostly for his sake! And when the y are together, from his side it is onl y about her desir e. It has completely gone off the rails in m y opini on, but because she feel s completely devoid of value, she cannot allow he rself to feel an y joy or des ire at all. It is a Gordian k not. Here she hits the \"wall\" and sees fa r more clearly than before how ill sh e is and what has to be done to cure her. She sobs inconsolabl y, lies on her side, and asks me to hold he r. Please remark the phy sical and e motional closenes s in the s entence: \"She lies on the couch cry ing, and I hold her and kiss her neck and tell her t hat she is the apple of m y eye.\" Touch has a co mpletely different function here, giving the pa tient the holdi ng she needs. To kiss a patient is a dang erous thing to do, as it is 143Ventegodt et al.: Clinical Holistic Medicine (1 ) TheScientificW orldJOURNAL (2004) 4, 134 -147 very important that the patient is totally clear of the phy sician ' intention. If misunderstood, the patient could interpret the closeness as the be ginning of a se xual relationship. On the other hand, is it very important that the ph ysician does touch, when he understands that this is wh at is needed. The medical session is so important to the patient' s future health, it is definitel y not to be di sturbed, slowed down, or even interrupted by negati ve thoughts, judgm ent, an d lack of phy sical and em otional gen erosity . It is completely fine to take a c rying patient on your lap and h old your arm s around her when sh e is 4 years old ps ychologically and desperately needs that care she never had, to heal her o ld woun ds on her soul. But alway s let the patient know what is goin g on and wh y, by being ver bally explicit about it. Gender and Sexuality Touch is a very dramatic and m utual thing for our physical and e motional being; when I to uch you, you touch m e[32]. As many people onl y know touch in c onnection with sexual behavi or, a sexual reaction to a completely innocent touch is not rare in the clinic. If sexually aroused, the fe male can re act a s \"if she has sexual organs all over her bod y\", making p hysical cont act with her very electric and sexual, and this reaction can come very suddenl y and highl y unexp ected and not alway s convenient. If the phy sician retracts fro m her in this situation, as would be the immediate reaction of m ost norm al people, she will experience th at her body , gender, and sexuality are not acceptable, which destro ys intim acy and trust for the patient a nd the professional relati onship. Being th ere, stay ing in contact, takes a g reat de al of spaciousness on the part of the phy sician. This spaci ousness should be a part of our medical training, but is often not, making so many pelvic ex aminations and ot her proc edures em otionall y painf ul and awkward for both physician and patient. Penetration o f the fem ale vagina is normally considered to be se x, so this takes a specific medica l reason and an extended contract with the patient[ 27,31] . Different countri es have very differ ent juridical practices, so be aware of t he laws that r egulate the behavior of t he phy sician in your countr y. The subject of ethics has been of utmost im portance for the ph ysician si nce Hippocrates and whenever the phy sician touches the patient, the ethic s of the actio n must be considered. The problem of touch is m ostly m uch more of an et hical problem than it is a legal pr oblem : Why do you touch the patient, what is the intention? If the intention is for the phy sician to enjo y his patient \u2014 what we do most of the time with people in pr ivate \u2014 we consider this unethi cal, even if this is just hol ding hands. The phy sician should have the healing of the patient as his sole focus an d if the i ntention of the physician i s wholehearted and rooted in deep medical expertise to heal the patient (and in this intention touch any part of the body including the genital), thi s is ethical . Interestingly, the phy sician's ethics see ms to be proporti onal with his results with his p atients. Only the clearest of intentio ns can bring us outstandin g results [22]. CONCLUS ION Touching or therapeutic touch (TT) is a n almost forgotten art of medicine and many areas of the human body cannot be touched even by the phy sician without a specific reason of exam ination or biom edical treatment. But si mply touching sensitively \u2014 the essence of manual m edicin e \u2014 is a much more powe rful tool than many modern and bi omedically oriented ph ysicians assu me. Many pains and discom forts can be alleviated just b y touchi ng the sick area and help t he patient to be in better cont act with the tr oubled t issue and organs of the body. L ack of presence in the body seems to be connected with many symptoms that can be readily reversed sim ply by sensitive touch in the intent ion of healing. When touch is com bined with therapeutic work on mind and feelings, holistic healing seems to be faci litated and many problem s can be solved in a direct, easy , and effective wa y in the clinic, without the use of drugs. 144Ventegodt et al.: Clinical Holistic Medicine (1 ) TheScientificW orldJOURNAL (2004) 4, 134 -147 Manual medicine, even in its m ost simple form , is a powerful and often underesti mated medical tool. The great power of phy sical contact between phy sician and patient, which is ev en stronger in the context of the theor y, practice, and intent of holi stic healing, is often not ta ken sufficiently into use in the medical clinic today, where every thing is supp osed to be cured with a drug. Much suff ering and m oney could be saved if the phy sician of our time was able to di scriminate more clearly between intim acy and sexuality and th us dared to be m ore intim ate and ph ysical wi th their patients. If the phys ician masters the art of touch he can even give the qualit y of holding with out touching . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was supported by grants from IMK Al mene Fond.
