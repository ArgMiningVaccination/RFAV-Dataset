Now breathe.' Our Rose Quartz gemstone diffuser is designed to couple the therapeutic energy of gemstones with the wellness benefits of aromatherapy. Rose Quartz is thought of as one of the most beautiful of the quartz family, with its gentle pink essence, it is known as a romance stone. The Rose Quartz gemstone has been used to attract love as early as 600 B.C. It is thought to emit powerful energy into your space - to help with compassion, comfort and healing. To use, simply add a couple of drops of your diffuser oil over the gemstones, allow the crystals to absorb the fragrance before it gently releases it into the air over time. I top mine up every time I enter the room and follow with a few deep calming breaths. Add one of our beautiful diffuser oils to receive the full therapeutic benefits of our gemstone diffuser. We make it in small batches to ensure the naturally derived ingredients are as potent as possible. Plant-based, non-toxic and free from bleach, it helps to prevent the build up of harmful contaminants in our rivers and streams. Bottled using recyclable PET. Handmade in Norfolk. "}
