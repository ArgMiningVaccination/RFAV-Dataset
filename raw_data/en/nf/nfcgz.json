She makes your experience safe, easy and relaxing. I wanted to increase collagen growth without the use of chemicals. The acupuncture sessions stimulated collagen and reduced fine lines in my face. I was thrilled. I would highly recommend her for Cosmetic Acupuncture.\" ~ Sue Petersen \"I highly suggest seeing Michelle for acupuncture if you have tight muscles. Not only is the office peaceful, Michelle is very calming and had me relaxed from the moment I walked in. She walked me through everything and was very knowledgeable. I had relief from my tight upper back and neck muscles after only one treatment and look forward to going back in!\" ~ A. A. Chinese medicine has taught me many things, but one lesson stands out the most: Great skin - skin that really glows and looks vibrant - starts on the inside, with good health. I've always loved the idea that taking good care of yourself - giving your body what it needs - is the real foundation of beauty. There's nothing artificial we can put on the skin that gives as much radiance and confidence as genuine wellness. When your body is in balance, you glow from the inside out. Ready for that journey? Let's go there "}
