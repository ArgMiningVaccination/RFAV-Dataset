Ichose to be a specialist \u2014 in general practice. The perception, predominantly Germanic, that general practice is merely the sum of medical specialties spread thinly, finds echoes in the National Plan envisaging 1000 specialist GPstaking referrals from fellow GPs. The implication is that specialist GPs will be superior tothose who provide family medicine and presumably should be paid more. Perhaps this is acareer progression? Another area where multidisciplinary intermediate care GPs may have an extended role is in the envisaged 'rapid response teams, providing emergency care for people at home'. At the other end of primary care it is stated that the 'pressure on GPs will be eased as nurses take on more tasks, making and receiving referrals, ordering investigations and diagnostictests, running clinics, and prescribing drugs'. Elsewhere it has been proposed that 'super-nurses' could take over from GPs if necessary. However, these super-nurses will never betreated as co-equals in family medicine \u2014 by patients, if not by professionals. Financialproximity may occur and the standing of nurses may be enhanced but nurses are nurses anddoctors are doctors. Equally, if the new specialist GPs believe that they can approach thestatus and earning potential of consultant colleagues then I can assure them this is not true.Just as nurses remain nurses, GPs remain GPs. As well as being a GP, I am also a part-time consultant in primary care with my local Trust. After six years it is obvious that, to the other consultants, I remain a GP. I am not consideredfor nomination as a consultant representative on committees but can contribute as a GP.Applications for discretionary points or a distinction award were not even acknowledged bymy Trust or the DoH. Vice-Chairmen of other Royal Colleges would receive an 'A' meritaward. GPs who imagine that their professional standing may be enhanced by becoming a'specialist GP'should reconsider. We are told that the pressures in general practice can be solved by super-nurses. I believe this will undermine and trivialise the specialism. On the other hand we can extend our expertiseby becoming 'super-GPs', accepting the cast-off duties of consultant colleagues. Bothcontrive to marginalise, destabilise, and debase the specialism of general practice and theprofessional standing and financial stability of the practitioners. Only a government that really does not understand general practice could suggest such reforms. To them we are just coughs-and-colds pill-pushers, self-interested moaners who failto offer the service the middle class demand. The case for effective generalism isoverwhelming, on medical and health economical grounds. It becomes ever moreoverwhelming as our specialist colleagues produce sub-specialists and sub-sub-specialists,like a Russian doll. The Government has failed to notice that, when admirers abroad try tocopy bits of the UK healthcare model, it is the primary care bit they copy. To the authors ofthe NHS Plan, a GP who can juggle an endoscope is more admirable than the traditionalmodel. Such myopia threatens general practice with extinction within a decade, and with it,nationalised healthcare. The National Plan contains the seeds for the potential destruction of general practice unless the Government will acknowledge that primary care is the 'jewel in the crown of the NHS'and act accordingly. Promotion, support, understanding, and resources \u2014 both financial andmore importantly human resources \u2014 are needed, coupled with the political will for generalpractice to flourish.

However, all GPs areaware of the damage caused by irresponsiblereporting on health issues, and thepublication of the new Guidelines on Science and Health Communication , which aim to prevent such misleading reports, hasbeen welcomed by the RCGP and otherprofessional bodies. The guidelines were developed by the Social Issues Research Centre and the RoyalInstitution, in consultation with a forum ofscientists, journalists, and doctors \u2014including representatives of the RCGP, theRoyal Society of Medicine, and the RoyalCollege of Surgeons. The guidelines provideadvice to both journalists and scientists, whoshare equal responsibility for ensuringaccurate and unbiased reporting of researchfindings. The SIRC/RI guidelines include a basic rule- of-thumb test to help scientists andjournalists judge the potential effects of theirreports, as well as more detailed guidance onresponsible communication of health risksand medical advances. The rule-of-thumbasks scientists or journalists about to releasea report about a potential health risk orpotential cure to imagine what effect thestory could have on a relative or close friendwho is sensitive or vulnerable to suchinformation \u2014 a parent with cancer, forexample, or a friend on the Pill. The guidelines recommend that journalists and scientists should always state anylimitations or caveats clearly, preferablywithin the first few lines of a report or pressrelease \u2014 particularly where findings arepreliminary; have not been peer-reviewed;have not been replicated; differ markedlyfrom previous findings; are based on small,unrepresentative or animal samples; or havefound only a statistical correlation. Whenreporting on potential health risks, scientistsand journalists should always cite 'absolute'rather than 'relative' risks. When reportingon medical advances, the limitations of anynew treatment, procedure or product shouldbe stated very early and prominently in thereport. Lord Wakeham, Chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, welcomed thepublication of guidelines as they underlinedthe importance of the PCC rules in regard toreporting of scientific and medical stories.He also urge those directly involved in thesematters who are aware of inaccuracies innewspapers to ensure that they lodge acomplaint so that the PCC can deal with it. Kate FoxAdolescent Working Party The RCGP Adolescent Working Party will be holding two conferences in November. The first conference will be on Thursday 30 November at Princes Gate and entitled'Confidentiality and Adolescent Health'. Itwill feature the launch of the tool kit,Confidentiality and Young People ; this publication, produced by the RCGP andBrook, and published by the TeenagePregnancy Unit, aims to encourage primarycare teams to reassess their practice policyon confidentiality. Dr Pat Troop, the DeputyChief Medical Officer, will give the openingaddress and the Teenage Pregnancy Unit andthe Working Party chairman will be inattendance. Other topics for discussion willinclude 'Risk-taking in Sex' 'MentalHealth', Conditions andConfidentiality' and 'Teenage-friendlyPractice'. will include AnnMcPherson, Dr Ruth Chambers, Dr DickChurchill, Dr Aiden McFarlane and Dr ChrisDonovan. The second conference, entitled 'Measuring Adolescent Care in General Practice:Successes, Pitfalls and Problems', will be onTuesday 21 November in the Atrium at theRoyal Free Hospital. Academic departmentsfrom Cardiff, Hertfordshire and Nottinghamwill present the details of this successfulproject during the morning session, followedin the afternoon by a discussion of some ofthe less orthodox examples of GPs'attemptsat measuring adolescent care. The latter conference has been organised by the RCGP Working Party ResearchCommittee and the Department ofPaediatrics and Community Health of theRoyal Free Hospital in London. PGEAapproval has been sought for bothconferences and charges have been kept to aminimum. Further details are available from Kathleen Dyer at the RCGP (tel: 020 7581 3232; London NW3; tel: 0207 8302288. Both conferences should be of interest to GPs concerned about young people's healthand the services available to adolescents. Chris Donovan The British Journal of General Practice, November 2000 931Society of Expert Witnesses General practitioners are in demand as expert witnesses. However, top professionalskills do not necessary go hand-in-hand withthe best expert witness skills: this is wheremembership of the Society of ExpertWitnesses can be of benefit. The SEW is dedicated to providing relevant services that will help anyone involved inexpert witness work. As a non-profit makingsociety it provides a range of services forfor both novice and experienced expertwitness for a modest annual membershipfee. Members can call the Society's helpline, which provides access to a voluntary panelof experts offering members practicalsupport on the professional, legal andbusiness aspects of providing expert witnessservices. Every Society member is entitled to a free listing on the Society's website on request,and the Society's free mentor scheme placesnew members with experienced ones. This isfar more valuable and practical than atraining course, providing one-to-oneguidance. Twice a year the Society organises a low cost conference, offering expert witnessesfrom all disciplines the opportunity to polishup their skills, network, and learn from eachother. All members receive the Society's quarterly newsletter Dispatches , containing news and information on expert witness-related issues. The evolving nature of the role of the expert witness and the changing expectations ofclients reflect the changes brought about bynew laws or the amendment of existingregulations. The work is becoming verycompetitive but is extremely rewarding. If you are a practising expert witness, or are interested in becoming one, and would liketo find out more about the Society of ExpertWitnesses please contact Teresa Baron at theSociety of Expert Witnesses, PO Box 345,Newmarket CB8 7TU; tel 0845 7023014; e-mail Fiona NevileRCGP Spring Symposium: Belfast 2001The Waterfront Hall in Belfast is the venue for the next RCGPSpring Meeting for 2001.This is the first time Northern Ireland hashosted the event and preparations are wellunderway for the conference, which will beheld between Friday 6 and Sunday 8 April.Around 500 delegates are expected to enjoya very full programme of academic andpractical interest, with an imaginative socialcomponent. 'Taking Pride in Primary Care'is the theme for next year's conference. Among thespeakers will be Professor SusanGreenfield, Director of the Royal Institute ofGB and a neuroscientist in Oxford, will lookat the impact of science on the future ofmedicine. An American flavour will begiven by Professor Larry Culpepper ofBoston, with a response from ProfessorMike Pringle, RCGP Chairman. There willalso be a collection of local speakers and theSymposium will be under the chairmanshipof Professor Domhnall MacAuley. The social programme includes a tour of the Stormont Parliament buildings, and a grandbanquet in the luxurious setting of the CityHall \u2014 a chance to get dressed up and enjoya night of entertainment.

Barry MitchellIn a storm it's a good idea to understand the weather. And at a time of unprecedentedchange in primary care it's worthwhile takinga step back to think about the history ofchange in general practice. Where have thechanges that have moulded primary care overthe last 50 years typically come from? Formost hospital specialties, such as cardiology,the roots of innovation derive from researchwithin the profession and external, technicallydriven change. Several things are strikinglydifferent for general practice (Figure 1). First, only a very small amount of technically driven change has originated from withinprimary care itself. Read codes are one of thefew examples and almost the only one to havehad any impact outside general practice. Bycontrast, cardiology, gastroenterology orradiology have produced an enormous amountof technically driven change that has had, inturn, a large impact on general practice. Secondly, research from within primary care has had much less impact on practice thanresearch originating and led by otherspecialties. All the major clinical trials thathave revolutionised clinical care in recentyears (e.g. WOSCOPS, 4S, UKPDS, etc) havebeen conceived and led by hospital clinicians.All could, and perhaps should, have been ledfrom primary care. The RCGP oralcontraceptive studies show that we are quitecapable of generating such world-beatingresearch yet it is very hard to think of anyother piece of GP-led research that has hadsignificant impact on other specialties. Finally, general practice has benefited \u2014 or at least successfully absorbed \u2014 an enormousamount of institutional or organisationalchange that has been imposed from outside.Fundholding, primary care groups, majorshifts in other professions such as obstetrics orpsychiatry \u2014 all have been the cause of majorupheaval.futurology 11 932 The British Journal of General Practice, November 2000This article is the eleventh in a series of 12 commissioned andedited by Paul Hodgkin , and Alec Logan, Deputy Editor, British Journal of General Practice , London.PPostcards from a New Centuryostcards from a New Century The Roots of Change 1111 So development in primary care has often been reactive to other people's change. This isnot necessarily a bad thing. We have provedenormously adaptable and developed a greatability to turned imposed changes, such asfundholding, to best advantage . However, thetime when technology and all its associatedimpetus for change was essentially a hospitalphenomenon, is ending. Near-patient testing,intermediate care facilities, patients withInternet-driven questions \u2014 all demand thatGPs know more about secondary care topics.All demand yet more change from us if we areto shape our future rather than be subject tofurther uncomfortable 'hospital outreach' ordata-mined by outside researchers. In the past, the NHS has taken a grossly simplistic approach to change by assumingthat it was a linear process \u2014 from research,to results, its implementation, and better care. While we are now, quite rightly, paying much more attention to implementation, naivetyabout innovation is still widespread. Mantra-like calls about 'spreading best practice', forexample, assume that good practice can bespread around like butter simply byilluminating it with a few beacons. Yetgenerating widespread innovation is anenormously complex endeavour (Box 1).Industry understands that successfulinnovation demands 'both a developedinnovation and a prepared market. It ischaracterised as series of problem-solvingloops dealing with unexpected difficulties intechnical and marketing areas'. 1Most of us in the NHS simply do not recognise the complexprocesses which are embedded in thisbusiness view. Researchers often cling to pre-set protocols with all the adaptability of alimpet; managers want a clear programme laidout with tick boxes even if it bears noresemblance to any clinical reality; and GPsand those charged with HImPimplementationrarely have time to think about whether, say,creating a market for their change might beimportant. Innovation in the public sector is also constrained by crazy incentives. For industry,making a better widget provides thewherewithal to expand widget production, butimproving patient care by prescribing statinsblows the bottom line. Business worshipsprofit, the NHS worships the balanced budget. So what might we take from all this? First, that professionals in primary care areextremely inventive \u2014 GPs, health visitors,practice managers \u2014 there are many peopleout there who can see great ways to do thingsbetter. This creative independence is the seedcorn of change and needs to be nurtured \u2014especially, perhaps, at a time whichemphasises the clinical governance virtues ofconsistency and transparency. However, mostinnovations in the NHS remain corralled in aghetto called 'one off projects'.

Figure 1The British Journal of General Practice, November 2000 933become skilled at the complex, iterative, political process of taking a successfulinnovation through into widespread adoption.This requires a whole new set of managementskills that are as yet barely articulated 2but which are absolutely crucial to such things asturning HImPs into reality. The PCTor LHCCthat can master these skills will find the worldbeating a track to its door. We also need to build a new order of excellence in primary care research. Oneanswer might lie in groups of PCTs goingdirectly to the research networks that areburgeoning throughout the UK and directlycommissioning large scale studies to answerkey questions. Such a strategy will have beensuccessful when we see major landmarks,such as the STOP IT trial, (study of totaloutcomes in primary care using IT, WessexResearch Network, Lancet2000, which showed unequivocally that primary care hadbetter outcomes than equivalent hospitaloutreach services), actually being performedand published. Many of the most productive changes in primary care \u2014 vocational training, the 1996Contract, PMS, GPco-ops \u2014 have come fromthe happy confluence of good governmentpolicy working in concert with inspiredprofessional leadership and a workforce with astrong desire to provide a good service. PCTsand LHCCs provide opportunities to build theintermediate mechanisms necessary for 21stcentury primary care \u2014 planning, capitalfinancing, risk management \u2014 that have inthe past always been lacking. Whether theycan deliver this, amid the gale force winds ofchange, remains an open question. Paul HodgkinBox 1. The complexity of successful innovation. Successful innovation is complex and involves processes \u2014 such as creating amarket \u2014 that we hardly ever thinkabout. The 3M company once developedan adhesive that was very weak andnever dried. This useless product wasdestined to be dumped when a managerfound some of the glue on the piece ofpaper he used to mark his place eachweek at choir practice. Its re-usability wasimpressive but his colleagues remainedsceptical, so he made up some smallpads backed with the glue and left themround his department. Two days beforethe next product development meetinghe removed them from all his colleaguesdesks. At the meeting everyone wantedto know where those little sticky padsthat were so useful had gone and Post-Itswere finally on their way to the world.Box 2. Why do we say 'Hello' and not 'Ahoy'? Getting the telephone intowidespread use. When Thomas Edison was trying to encourage people to use his new-fangledtelephone he realised that he had toactively help them learn how to use it. Oneuseful way of doing this was to supply freetelephones to hotels and bars so thatguests could surruptitiously observe thenew machine in use. Another problem fora class conscious society was how toaddress whoever answered \u2014 was it themaid or the lady of the house? Edisonrealised that the answer lay in a new \u2014and hence classless \u2014 greeting and his1878 handbook suggests the inventedword 'Hello' as the way to address on thephone. Meanwhile Alexander Bell, thephone's inventor proclaimed that 'Ahoy'should be used. By 1880, 'Hello' had wonthis particular standards battle largely dueto Edison's persistence in finding ways tooverscome the barriers to adoption.Box 3. The difference between inventionand innovation. Some of the most famous inventions of the nineteenth century were invented by peoplewhose names are forgotten. The namesassociated with them are of theentrepreneurs who brought them intocommercial use. For example, the vacuumcleaner was invented by one J. MurraySpengler. He approached a leather goodsmaker who knew nothing about vacuumcleaners but had a good idea of how tomarket and sell them \u2014 one W H Hoover.Similarly, Elias Howe produced the world'sfirst sewing machine in 1846 in Boston,USA. Unable to sell his ideas in England, hereturned home to find Isaac Singer hadstolen the patent and built a successfulbusiness from it. It's all goo now Have you noticed how gadget shops have become full of soft and amoeboid things, brightly pinksquidgy knick-knacks that do nothing in particularbut feel disconcertingly flesh-like? Such 'blobjects' are theephemera of the quiet revolution that is gripping the materialsciences. Fuel cells that can power buses, paper-thin VDUscreens that can be rolled up and plastics that emit light andconduct electricity \u2014 a new cornucopia of products is about torain down on us. Many of these will have medical applications. A recent conference highlighted BioMEMS which are devices that marry atiny microchip to materials with sophisticated drug release or cellsensor properties. BioMEMS are designed to be injected andthen seek out particular cell types. Once there they do their stuff\u2014 release a drug, implant a stem cell or ream outatherosclerosis. Those squidgy blobjects also mark a switch to the next cultural paradigm. The 20th century was the era of the hard-edged: fromblitzkrieg and mass production to R2D2 and the etched pathways of the microchip, the leading edge of the culture wasfull of mechanistic, robotic images. The wave of innovation nowbeginning to drive the 21st century is biological. Hardware ismutating to wetware and geneware. And the sloppy goo of eggsis becoming the culture medium of our dreams and nightmares.

However, there isplenty of good advice available on how tomake it easier. It's just not always possibleto apply it, as I found out last year. I had thought about taking this qualification since finishing vocational training a fewyears ago but, somehow, giving birth tochildren and working as a locum GP got inthe way. It was not until we decided as afamily to uproot and travel to New Zealandthat I thought, now is the time to do it. Atime limit can be a useful motivating tool insome respects; in my case things alsobecame very rushed, but more about thatlater. Having made the decision I read articles in the free doctor magazines and borrowedcopies of the Journalto get advice on preparation. Six months to a year wasrecommended. That was fine \u2014 it wasautumn 1998 and we planned our move toNew Zealand sometime in thesummer/autumn of 1999, so there wasplenty of time to prepare. I had just givenbirth to our fourth child, but that was finetoo. There was the demand of breast-feeding, which seemed to occur every twohours day and night but, heigh-ho, at least Icould do some reading at the same time. Further advice included getting together with other candidates to discuss 'hot topics',attending a course and getting someone,perhaps a GP trainer, to review the videoconsultations, for quality if nothing else. At this point stumbling blocks abounded. No-one in the area was taking the MRCGPor interested in preparing for it. A coursewas out of the question for two reasons. Thefirst was financial; as sole income earner forthe family, having just had six monthsunpaid maternity leave and with locum poststhin on the ground things were a little tight.The second was the baby; I knew shewouldn't be too happy about medisappearing off for three days with her foodsupply! Video consultations \u2014 now that was a problem. First, I asked the practice managerat the practice where I was working as alocum part-time. Yes, I could videotape myconsultations, but no, I couldn't use theirequipment as one of the GP trainers wasusing it. So after a quick think I bought avideo camera, tripod and tapes (after all, itwould come in useful for recording all thosewonderful moments with the children). Thus, to work on the video consultation module. After two mornings of tapingconsultations \u2014 having barely managed todeduce how the video camera worked, letalone whether it picked up sound adequately\u2014 my taping days came to an abrupt end.The practice manager announced that,having discussed it with the partners in thepractice, it was not suitable for me tovideotape consultations as they feared itwould slow me down! (This happened as Ifinished the morning surgery on time,having seen about 25 patients.) I looked at what I had and decided it might just make the grade. I completed theworkbook, failed to show it to my ex-GPtrainer, and sent it off. Then the written examination. I prepared for this by reading as much as I had access to,using practice papers and learning as many'hot topics' as was feasible, which wasn'tthat many when you consider the scope ofthe exam. Anyway, the day itself. Up at 5.00 am to drive to the nearest examination centre. Twoand a half hours later, feeling slightly car-sick and very nervous, I took my place at atable in an enormous room in a motorwayhotel on a hot May morning. The tables wereshared between two people, sitting besideeach other. I found myself sitting beside avery wise, mature-looking GP \u2014 no doubtone of the GPexaminers retaking the writtenpaper, as they are required to do. This wasimmensely intimidating and I almost gaveup as I noticed the copious notes issuingfrom her pen. She gave me an encouragingsmile at one point so I plodded on. TheMCQ paper in the afternoon was slightlybetter, with the end in sight. Then a longdrive home with a headache and breastsengorged with unsuckled milk. Last hurdle \u2014 the oral exam, or viva voce. At this point I was very busy. I had beenoffered a position in New Zealand, starting aweek after the oral examination. That meantcompleting the sale of the house and car,arranging the packing and shipment of ourhousehold contents, and endless paperwork\u2014 passports, visas, medical registration,meeting with our solicitor, bank managerand accountant. There was also thebittersweet experience of seeing friends andbidding farewell to them. Thus I found myself travelling up to Edinburgh with my head spinning, and notjust with potential viva questions. It was anexacting viva, no doubt made more so by mypreoccupations. I cannot recommend thisapproach. We arrived in New Zealand and I waited for the results. Somehow I had managed to passthree out of four modules. I failed the videomodule. All was not lost \u2014 a quick fax to the Examining Board and I could go ahead witha New Zealand-produced videotape. It wasnot easy; I had to learn a different system ofhealth care on the job. Many of the patientsin the low socioeconomic area where I wasworking viewed the presence of the videorecorder in the consultation room with deepsuspicion. I completed another tape, failedto show it to a colleague, sent it off andHow to make the MRCGP more challenging ... Acknowledgement To my husband and children.The British Journal of General Practice, November 2000 935failed again. In desperation I wrote to the Convenor of the Panel of Examiners and was greatlyencouraged by a personal reply from RogerNeighbour. He advised me to try again. This time I enlisted the help of an expatriate GP to review my videotaped consultationsand I was further aided by the improvedinstructions and definitions of the requiredcompetences in the 2000 Workbook. Also,the patients were used to me now and weremore willing to co-operate by taking part. The only dark cloud hanging over me at the time was the possibility of the practiceclosing, because my senior partner andemployer was about to be struck off themedical register! I managed this problem to the best of my ability while keeping the practice running,and managed to get my third attempt off toLondon. I am glad to report that I finally achieved MRCGPin July 2000. What have I learnt from this? Agreat deal. I have learnt that it is possible to communicatewith institutions and receive personal advice.This included not only the RCGP but theMedical Council of New Zealand and theMedical Protection Society. I have learnt atfirst hand the potential hazards of acceptinga post overseas and how it feels to work witha problem colleague. I have learnt how tohold together the morale of a practice teamwhen everything is in dissolution. I havelearnt how to concentrate on a goal whenthere are multiple other distractions. Besidesall that I have learnt about many aspects ofgeneral practice, and had my enthusiasmrenewed in the process. If you want to make it easier for yourself when attempting the MRCGP examinationthen follow all the good advice offered. Takethe MRCGP when you are a GP registrarwith all the support systems in place. Alwaysask a colleague to review your videotapedconsultations before you submit them, forma 'hot topic'group and go on a course. Don'tattempt a move to New Zealand, Malaysia,the USA, or Timbuktu while studying for theexamination. On the other hand, don't be put off if you are a locum GP, or between jobs. It's tough, butnot impossible. If you can get to Londoneasily then opt for the simulated surgerymodule rather than attempting to produce avideotape of consultations. You may not win medals or merits but you will learn more about general practice andyou will learn an immeasurable amountabout your resources and supporters. I'd say give it a go! Nancy LoaderCommentary I felt the ice round my examiner's heartmelting as I read Nancy Loader's tale ofheroism in pursuit of the MRCGP.Replying to it makes such a change frommy usual letters to disgruntled candidates,gently explaining that the reason theyfailed the examination was not ournegligence but simply that they didn't dowell enough to pass. I sometimes think theexam ought to test 'staying power', apremium quality in GPs and one which DrLoader has in spades. One of my first priorities as Convenor was to convert the exam from its previous 'failone bit, fail all'format to the modularstructure without which even Nancy mighthave given up at the first setback. I'm gladwe've got that bit right. She didn't make things easy for herself, though, did she? The exam is intentionallydesigned to be best taken during or shortlyafter vocational training. Certainly, thewritten papers are easiest at that stage of acareer, when factual knowledge and astructured approach to problem-solving arefreshest in the mind. The videotape consultation is another matter. It's the element with the highest failrate, largely because (despite shelfloads ofpundits, including Peter Tate the videoConvenor and me banging on about it forover a decade) newly-trained GPs are notvery good at the patient-centred consultingstyle the exam is unashamedly looking for.The performance criteria that most youngdoctors fail on are: sharing managementoptions, exploring psychosocial contexts,and responding to cues. More worryingly,our evidence is that many trainers haven'teven read the comprehensive workbookwhich sets out in detail what the MRCGPvideo module is looking for, let alonegeared their teaching towards it. And,Nancy, I think the local Dean would beinterested to know which training practicewas so lamentably unhelpful. That said, simply recording two surgeries and hoping for the best is almostguaranteed to result in failure. It takes moreraw material than that to provide a portfolioof highlights of your consulting ability. Byall means get someone (not an examiner,please) to vet your tape before submission.But make sure that person is familiar withthe exam's passing criteria. They are notthe same as for the UKRAsummativeassessment method. Nancy, have a great career. I hope doing the exam has helped you identify the lightsby which you'll judge it. Roger Neighbour Convenor, Panel of Examinersopinion 936 The British Journal of General Practice, November 2000The nature of clinical competence Introduction While there are many qualities that wemight desire our doctors to display, nonecan be so important as clinical competence.That is the ability to find out what is wrongand to make an appropriate response. Howdoesthe 'clinically competent' doctor find out what is wrong, and how does thatdoctor ensure that response isappropriate? Knowledge In this century, knowledge relevant tomedicine has increased by geometricprogression and shows no sign of slowing.By knowledge I mean those refutablestatements that are the best availableapproximation to reality. It has been said that half of what one learns at medical school turns out to be wrong butthat one does not know which half. Thispopular jibe is nonsense. In reality twothings happen: old knowledge becomesrefined and almost always more complexand new knowledge is acquired. Little ofthe old knowledge is completely replaced,although useless therapeutic fashions maybe discarded. The main problem with theknowledge we acquire during education isits short half-life, which seldom exceeds 12months. Only the knowledge which isreinforced or used remains. Most newknowledge is only relevant to the marginsof the discipline and rarely affects ourproper day-to-day practice. The commonconditions seen either in general orspecialist practice can be completelymanaged without recourse to the mostrecent apparent advances. The volume of new knowledge threatens generalists who are aware that there areothers whose in-depth knowledge in certainareas is much greater than their own. Thiscarries real dangers to the well being ofpatients because their care may becomeincreasingly fragmented between superspecialists at the expense of considerationof the unique human being who has themisfortune to be, for the time being, apatient. All practising doctors rely on their experience: a fallacious guide whichusually results in continuing to make thesame mistakes with increasing confidence.Experience is of two kinds \u2014 experience ofdiseases, which leads to statements such as'in my experience this sort of case doeswell with ...', (a statement which isuntenable in the age of the randomisedcontrolled trial), and experience ofindividual patients. This second sort ofexperience is characteristic of generalpractice where continuity of care is still,despite threats to its survival, a notinfrequent reality. This sort of knowledge isvaluable and can lead to an understandingof anxiety which might, in othercircumstances, be seen as inappropriate. Itcan also lead to a more accurate appraisal ofthe significance of symptoms. Some peopleare fearful and easily worried by symptomswhile others can be stoical to the point ofdanger. However, the hypochondriacal arenot immune from serious disease and allsymptoms deserve proper consideration.Experience, despite its dangers, can oftenidentify the discordant, the 'funnypeculiar', which should counsel caution. Listening to people The important evidence base of medicine iswhat people tell you and what we find byexamination and investigation. This is theevidence that leads to sound diagnosis andthe possibility of appropriate therapy. Of course, many decisions we make in clinical practice, such as starting a statin orhormone replacement therapy orconsidering whether a patient should beencouraged to opt for measurement of hisprostate specific antigen, require us toconsider evidence gathered from points farbeyond our consulting room. Nevertheless,if we forget the primacy of what thatindividual patient tells us and what we findon examination, then we flirt withincompetence. A 'good history' is unobtainable by asking questions. It may only be obtained byencouraging the patient to talk and bycareful and attentive listening. It is notnecessary to have attended a course in'communication skills' to know thatencouraging people to talk depends uponthe ambience of the encounter and a bodylanguage which signals commitment andattention. Information that is volunteered isgold dust by comparison with that which isextracted. All clinicians with experiencerecognise the characteristic use of words,accompanied by certain tones of voice andbody language that predict with highprobability the presence or absence ofcertain diseases. Sadly, there has beenalmost no research into the positive andnegative predictive value of the use oflanguage. General practice is in a positionto rectify this deficiency, although it has tobe recognised that the findings will beculturally and locally specific. Looking at people While there are diseases and disorders thatare obvious at first sight (Down's syndromeand many dermatological conditions, forexample), looking at people generally Acknowledgement I am very grateful to Alec Logan andhis reviewers for constructivecriticism of earlier drafts.The British Journal of General Practice, November 2000 937involves some form of examination. There are, however, other kinds of looking at thewhole person that are important. The bodylanguage of apprehension and anxiety, ofsadness, that slight moistness of the eyewhich anticipates weeping. Medical students used to be encouraged to do 'a complete physical' and, I suspect,sometimes still are. This is an impossibletask. Examination must be driven by atleast some notion of diagnostic possibility.It should be used to confirm, or better stillto refute, diagnostic hypotheses.Approaching the abdomen with an openmind is a recipe for disaster and leads tofalse negatives and sometimes falsepositives. The search for tenderness orsplenomegaly must be relevant to thatwhich has gone before, specific, andthorough. The emphasis on skills in eliciting physical signs characteristic of examinations is inmany ways appropriate but ignores theextent of intra- and inter-observervariability. Very few signs are so easy toelicit and so definite that agreement isuniversal. While it may happen that onestumbles upon an unsuspected and real signof disease \u2014 a breast lump, a melanoma onthe back \u2014 findings that are unrelated todiagnostic sense should be viewed withgreat suspicion. Many important signs for are useless. Bycomparison with the substantial body ofresearch on observer variability in theinterpretation of x-rays, cardiographs, andhistological specimens, there is a relativedearth of enquiry into the ability of doctorsto agree about physical findings. Yet thesevery physical findings are the basis ofmany diagnoses. Tests The commonest test in medicine is theattempt to measure blood pressure, and it isappallingly badly done. Digit preference,especially zero preference, is universal;little account is taken of arm thickness orarm difference; Osler's phenomenon isignored; anaeroid machines remainuncalibrated; and mercury sphygmo-manometers uncleaned. Other tests, especially those involving the laboratory, are abused. There is a generalfailure to realise that when the priorprobability of abnormality is low, falsepositives outnumber true positives by alarge margin. There is also failure torecognise that many biological variablesare not stable (serum cholesterol, forexample) and we underestimate the extentof laboratory error. Mindless investigation, like mindless examination, produces misinformation.There is proper concern about the cost ofhigh technology imaging but the cost ofunnecessary and wasteful commonlaboratory and microbiological tests ismany times greater. In addition,inappropriate tests and false positives harmthe health of our patients. Commitment Clinical competence is impossible unlessthere is a commitment to put the patientfirst despite other competing claims ontime and energy. The lack of suchcommitment is the chief cause of patientdissatisfaction, complaints and recourse tothe courts. On the other hand, the provisionof such commitment is the chief cause ofdoctor unhappiness and stress in personaland family life. Unfortunately, this may bea problem without a solution. The best thatcan be hoped for is damage limitation. Such limitation begins with recognition that the practice of medicine is primarily asocial function and that those who are, orbelieve themselves, to be sick have alwaysneeded the possibility of seeking help fromsomeone whom they can trust to mediatebetween themselves and misfortune. Thusthe nature of the relationship is intrinsicallydifferent from that which exists betweenourselves and our plumbers, accountants,or bank managers. Illness is accompaniedby a degree of regression towardschildhood and dependence. People come totheir doctors with their begging bowl andonly become aggressive when it is notfilled. The problem of commitment is made more tolerable if it is appreciated that its rewardsare more than money. Other professionsreceive much less in the way of gratitude,which no matter how little justified, is oneof the major recompenses of being a doctor. Damage limitation may also be reduced by difficult decisions to set some limit tooutside involvements. Outside involve-ments that are often connected withprofessional life \u2014 to committees, to RoyalColleges, to medical associations, to goodcauses. Saying 'no' can only be learnedwith difficulty. An essential component of commitment is enjoyment of the job. Once work becomesa burden, a task to be completed as soon aspossible and with minimum stress, anycommitment to patients is eroded beyondrecovery. Few of us can maintaincommitment throughout our professionallife without some method of recharging ourenthusiasm. For some this may be achievedthrough involvement in teaching, for asmaller number by undertaking research.Perhaps the most valuable protection is theopportunity to share concerns withsupportive colleagues. 'Me too-ing'provides valuable comfort. Scepticism Scepticism is the scalpel that freesaccessible truth from the dead tissue ofunfounded belief and wishful thinking. It isnot a synonym for cynicism. It alwaysseems strange that the word is so oftenaccompanied by the tautologous addition of'healthy'\u2014 it is always healthy. It may bethat those who favour this usage alsorecognise 'unhealthy' scepticism, whichpresumably casts doubt upon the validity oftheir cherished beliefs. Clinical competence must include recognition of ignorance. 'I don't know'tends to reassure rather than appall thosewho seek our help. Recognising ignoranceis an important prompt to appropriatereferral. It is also the best spur toindividually tailored continuing education. Scepticism recognises that all treatments alleviate symptoms, whereas only someaffect diseases. By being aware that thefaith and enthusiasm of the therapist aremajor determinants of therapeutic success,the clinically competent are unlikely to beseduced by the apparent successes ofabsurd placebo therapies. Continuing medical education While it is self-evidently true that topractice medicine with nothing more thanwhatever one acquired in medical school isa recipe for disaster, mechanisms forcontinuing growth are many and varied.The best antidote to fossilisation is notquasi-compulsory attendance at lecturesand courses but fascination with the tasksof medicine; fascination, which is a subsetof commitment to patients and theenjoyment of our profession. Conclusion Clinical competence depends upon aquantum of knowledge, the ability to listento the patient, and to elicit physical signswhile recognising their limitations, and theintelligent use of investigations. There aretwo other essential and relatively neglectedpre-conditions: scepticism andcommitment. James McCormick938 The British Journal of General Practice, November 2000 digestI remember first going abroad and being entranced by the difference \u2014 the smell ofGauloises, the different advertisements, theoddly-shaped cars. Now the cars are Fordsor Peugeots, Virgin is ubiquitous andcigarettes are not discussed in polite society.It is, however, a lot easier to travel, and Idon't have to wait half a day clutching mypassport and sterling in a mahogany bankingemporium. Times change and theglobalisation of medicine will follow theglobalisation of the banking and autoindustries. The French still take theirmedication in unusual ways, the Germansstill believe in unusual compoundprescriptions but international standards areemerging, driven by new technologies andthe convergence of global consumerism. We live in professionally effervescent times. The government is committed tomodernisation and increased funding iscoming our way. The profession no longerexpects to work 24 hours on the trot with awife-led telephone answering service andthe advent of new technologies dailypromises a better life for all, just over thehorizon. We are living through the digitalrevolution. General practice contains anormal distribution curve of attitudes to newtechnologies with those who regard thestethoscope as innovative at one end andfoaming-mouthed disciples of NicholasNegroponte talking technogarb at the other.The truth lies somewhere in between. The advent of the computer means that information does not have to be stored in theprofessional's brain and therefore the powerof the professions no longer lies in amonopoly of specialised knowledge. Therole of the clinician is now to interpret,explain, guide, and mentor the patient. Suchchanges do not happen overnight but meanthat both patients and professionals have toadjust to a new world. This world is lesspaternalistic, more consumer orientated, andwill see an enormous change in the roles ofthe Royal Colleges from Guilds to standard-setting enablers. How we deal with new technologies is therefore crucial. We can try to restrict them,make them conform to the rules of the Guildand hedge them about with rules that willnot contain change. We can be led by themanufacturers and enthusiasts into a seriesof equipment-led experiments that lead tofrustration, disappointment or blame; or, ifwe are enlightened, assemble theparticipants in the process of care anddiscuss where the difficulties lie inproducing the best outcome for the patient.When we do this we obtain the best outcomefor all involved. Re-designing a fragmentedsystem is satisfying. Telemedicine is one of the tools that will help in this process but should not be seen asa stand-alone. The new technologies thatinclude the Internet, digital imaging, anddata transmission together with oldertechnologies, such as the telephone, couldbe better described as being about 'e-health'\u2014 the appropriate use of digital technologyto enhance clinical care. Telemedicine and Telehealth is a reflective, thoughtful, well put together book that looksat the development of e-health from avariety of perspectives. The layout is logicaland includes a sensible philosophyunderpinning practical steps on how wemight use the new technologies for all ourbenefit. A historical perspective is followedby views from professionals and patients.The setting up of systems and theirmanagement and an overview of thebusiness issues and selection of technologycompletes this densely crafted little textbookwhich emphasises throughout that the onlyconstancy is change. Avery useful volume. The Telemedicine Toolkit offers a very different approach to the same subject.Arguably, this is a book written more for thedigital age, with a workbook format, a 'dip-in-and-out'style, lots of learning points, anda generally less academic air. I remembergetting a magazine called Motorcycle Mechanics in my youth which used to feature articles with titles like 'Eight steps tostripping down your Beezer 250'. Readingthe Telemedicine Toolkit brought back a whiff of the past: enthusiastic, breathy, a bitladdish in style; it covers the same ground ina different way. As you would expect of abook co-authored by Roy Lilley, it sets outto be controversial and to point out thepotential for change in a more positive andconfrontational way. This book will beuseful for members of a group from a rangeof backgrounds who want to develop aproject together. Less reflective, more actionorientated and written in a way that mightencourage group discussion, this book willstimulate debate. It's not reflective and it'smuch less philosophical, but it will stimulatethought and discussion. In short, two useful volumes in a fascinating and changing field. Buy the first one forreading, reflection, and planning and thesecond for discussion, and team-building,and giving it a go.

I didn't want my partners to think I was in trouble. I've only known them amonth. 'Stressed, Shaun?' 'No, no! I'mloving the job.' (It's true.) But six monthsago life was quite different. I was then overtwo years into my first partnership and Iwasn't finding life so rosy. I read the bookduring a co-op night shift (no-one saw methen) and even in the small hours, perhapsespecially then, I could relate to thescenarios described \u2014 too many demands,too little time, too much change, too manyexamples to list. Stress is a difficult subject to talk about, and as for buying a book on it ... C'mon! But, Ilearnt a lot about myself and my lastpractice reading this book. Personally orprofessionally, this book's an education. The book is practical but and derives much from a readable academic base. In the firstchapter, Andrew Eastaugh just has tomention the Starling curve and the balancebetween stressors and coping resources.Heard it before? Of course \u2014 but theexplanation is clear and fun: without amodern need to run from sabretooth tigersour bodies instead burn off the adrenalinerush from stress with racing minds, churning The British Journal of General Practice, November 2000 939stomachs, and higher blood pressure. Goodscience? Who cares! Exercise doeshelp. That others find the constant dripping of daily minor hassles worse than rarer majorevents made me feel better, and examplessuch as this, where the reader can think'Yes!', make this a good book. One hasconfidence in the authors throughout \u2014they know what they're talkingabout; something to do withbeing GPs, I guess. The burnoutinventory is scary \u2014 so manyGPs will have a high score that itshould be part of revalidation.Kate Wishart's chapter on'Women and Stress' emphasisedsituations that men often ignore. In this chapter,renowned cartoonist MartinDavies is especially outrageousbut undeniably true and thusshameful. men should readthis chapter. Kevork Hopyian's'Looking After I Burn's commoncognitive distortions is, again,enlightening and reassuring. Haslam wonders if, with soEvidence-based practice is a big industry. There are now many books and workshopsdesigned to help health care professionalsdevelop and practice the skills required forEBP; in particular, finding and appraisingthe evidence. However, the last step \u2014implementing the evidence \u2014 remains asdifficult as ever. As someone involved inhelping clinicians develop their criticalappraisal skills, it doesn't take long until Ihear the question 'Yes, but how can I applyit in practice?'being asked. With the adventof clinical governance primary care groups,trusts, and local health care co-operativesare asking this question as well. This book addresses the issues surrounding the implementation of research evidencehead on, based on the experience of theNorth Thames R&D ImplementationProgramme (a series of 17 projects based inNorth Thames Health Authorities during1996-1998). The programme itself wasexternally evaluated by the King's Fund.This book describes 11 of those projects. The overall aim of each project was to change clinical practice through theimplementation of proven researchevidence. In all but one case, the setting forthese projects was primary care (theexception being an A&E department). Allprojects were led by the health authority.However, the more successful projects werelocated within primary care and had a strongmultidisciplinary ethos, i.e. implementationinprimary care, rather than onit. Topics included H. pylori eradication, leg ulcer treatment, and open-access echocardio-graphy. The strength of the book lies in the 11 chapters in which the project leadersdescribe their experiences 'warts and all'.There is a refreshing degree of honesty inmany of these accounts, describing whyparticular approaches were taken and whythey failed. Each chapter contains a list oflessons learned and things to do differently.In addition, there is a brief commentary onthe project by the King's Fund evaluators.There is also a good introductory chapter onthe overall evaluation, written by theexternal evaluators. There is much to reflect on. No project achieved all of its aims. Few were able todemonstrate improved patient outcomes,although many were continuing to evaluateoutcomes at the time of writing. Audit was akey monitoring tool; strong multidisci-plinary team-working within primary carewas essential; flexibility and a realistictimescale were also essential. Projects usinga variety of implementation strategies weremore likely to succeed. Worryingly,however, many projects depended on thecharisma and hard work of the projectworker \u2014 individuals who were generallyon short-term contracts and who oftenmoved onto other posts. Given the difficulty in 'making a difference' for many projects, it is disappointing that theexternal evaluators chose not to round offthe book with a concluding chapter on howto move on from here. That apart, this bookcontains many lessons for those involved inthe implementation of research evidence andit is surprisingly easy to read. Individualclinicians trying to achieve change withintheir own practice will probably find it to beof least help. Those in PCGs, Trusts andLHCCs concerned with clinical governanceshould certainly read it. Those in charge ofpolicy should be forced to read it, if only tohelp them realise the enormity of the task inapplying best evidence to everyday practice.

At first we were told thatmost 'flights'were booked up when we triedto organise the trip the previous week, butthe pleasant man on the desk took pity on usand he booked us on anyway. Also, on theday we arrived the sun shone, albeitintermittently, and the skies were relativelyblue and clear and we had a great day. Part of the exercise was to entertain our two nieces (aged nine and three yearsrespectively) who, by and large, behavedimpeccably through the day \u2014 though theyhad their moments. On the day, we parked the car about a mile from the 'Eye' and walked to this nowfamous landmark on the south side of theThames. The official instructions are toarrive at least thirty minutes before theflight. Despite this the queues wereworryingly long, as it was the last fullweekend of the summer and tourists werestill in abundance. Once the stewards hadchecked our tickets the progress was fairlyrapid. On board the capsule, or 'pod', therewas a great sense of anticipation, that thewait was finally over and the adventure wasabout to begin. By now the day was cloudy but generally bright, the sun appearing just enough tomake the view \u2014 undoubtedly spectacularfrom all angles \u2014 optimal and without theusual climatic obstacles. Our nieces were overawed. Inside each podThe London Eye in early September geographic directions are clearly marked and obvious landmarks appear almoststraightaway as the giant wheel rotates.Waterloo Station, The South Bank,Centrepoint, Hyde Park, and BuckinghamPalace are instantaneously recognisable. Aswe rose, picking out special features becamequite fun; for example, St Pancras station,the Dome, our own practice area in southeast London, and Hampstead Heath.Because of the Eye's position it felt strangethat parts of south east London appearedbehind us as one looks across at the Housesof Parliament \u2014 apparently it's all aboutperspective, I was told. As our pod reached its zenith the whole of London and beyond became visible. It wasat this stage that I remembered someonetelling me that, on a good day, St Albans wasvisible from the top. My personal thrill wasseeing the River Thames snake its wayeastwards into the distance and beyond theThames Barrier, making us realise thatLondon is at once expansive and yet,paradoxically, compact. How we wished weremembered those binoculars! By this stage our youngest niece was more interested in our rapidly dwindling orangesweets, a sure sign that boredom had set in.On the downward leg of the half-hour flighta few spots of rain seemed to threaten adownpour but nothing, thankfully, appeared. What were our overall impressions? We had managed to acquire tickets for a busySaturday in September, and our two niecesseemed to enjoy it. Our experience of theflight was overwhelmingly positive, and Iadmit that it was so enjoyable that it wastempting to book up the next available nightflight. We even acquired the official guidewhich was glossy, helpful, and full of viewsnot possible from the Eye. It is an impressiveEuropean collaboration, with its variousconstituent parts manufactured in thedifferent EU countries. For example, themain structure is Dutch, the hub and spindleare from the Czech Republic, and thecapsules are French. Winter flights start at 10.00am and finish at 6.00pm. Go on \u2014 be daring and enjoy yourflight! My thanks go to the kind man who managed to get us on the flight, Anya and Nisha fortheir patience, and Lucy who did most of theorganising. Surinder Singh The British Journal of General Practice, November 2000 941John Holden One hundred flowers 'Let one hundred flowers bloom'. Thephrase has a resonance even for those of uswho rarely see meadows, and acceptagricultural monoculture without question.It suggests creativity, spontaneity, variety,life in its natural state, freshness, openspaces. Why not leave a useful phrasealone? For all children of the 1960s the image of Chairman Mao is easily recollected.Benign, faintly smiling, and egalitariandecades before the National Health Servicewas given the task of reducing healthinequalities. It was he who said, in 1957,'Let a hundred flowers blossom and ahundred schools of thought contend'in thesinisterly named 'On the Correct Handlingof Contradictions'. The following year hereturned to his authoritarian instincts andlaunched the Great Leap Forward, which inturn led to the deaths of over 20 millionpeople, the greatest famine in recordedhistory. The 'hundred flowers'phrase remains popular in the type of medical writing ofwhich Mao would approve. Aimed atinspiring the workers, written by those farfrom difficult clinical decisions, it hasbecome a weasel phrase. It is associatedwith exhortations to try even harder, tochange the culture, eliminate errors. So weseparate easily into those who believeothers need constant cajoling, and the rest. My selective memory and a few random photocopies suggest that floral allusionsappear seasonally, less often used at presentas we experience the icy blast of centrallydriven modernisation. Yet those who workin the health services of rich countries arecondemned to experience the cycles weonce associated with our economies, soexpect its re-emergence around the time ofthe next election. When I see it start to be used again I shall know \u2014 Mao lives.matters arising 942 The British Journal of General Practice, November 2000Revalidation Council considered a series of papers on thesubject of revalidation. The RCGP's response (co-ordinated with the General Practitioners Committee) to theGeneral Medical Council revalidationproposals is generally supportive, but anumber of key issues need to be resolved.What resources will be available to supportrevalidation? To what extent can a systemdesigned to maintain minimum standards alsoaspire to excellence? Ambiguities betweenappraisal and assessment in the proposalsshould be resolved. These issues wereincorporated within the RCGP/GPC responsein time for the deadline on 25 September. The remaining papers on revalidation were presented by Chairman of Council, ProfessorMike Pringle. The paper on the criteria, standards, and evidence for revalidation was debated in thecontext of the discussions mentioned above.Council was concerned to guard against astructure that would enable a doctor to providethe evidence for revalidation but which did notreveal incompetence. On the question of local revalidation groups, the proposals were supported. Council notedthat this part of the proposals for revalidationwere where the additional cost would be mostlikely to arise. The evidence and standardswould, under the College/GPC proposals, relyas far as possible on existing standards andsources of evidence that doctors already had tomaintain for other purposes such as clinicalgovernance. Mike Pringle's paper looking at the relationship between College quality standardsand revalidation had been redrafted followingdetailed consideration by the RevalidationWorking Group on 14 September. The recastproposals are now presented as 'acceptableprocesses for evidence', meeting all or part ofthe requirements for revalidation. This paperbegins to explore how College standards, suchas Accredited Professional Development,Membership by Assessment of Performance(MAP), Fellowship by Assessment, traineraccreditation, etc. may provide the evidencerequired in whole or in part. Council agreedthe concept in this paper but wanted theCollege to be able to sign off for the localrevalidation group that a doctor had attainedthe necessary standard, subject to periodicassessment of selected cases by the GMC. Ifthis was introduced then it would avoidsubmission of the whole folder for MAP; forexample, as part of the evidence forrevalidation. The final paper looked at the relationship between appraisal and assessment and whetherthe 'State'appraisals as proposed for Englandin the document Supporting Doctors, Protecting Patients might offer a system on which to build. The question remains as towhether these appraisals would be formativeas the College would wish and provide a routefor appraisal, at least in England. If not thenthere appears to be no alternative but tointroduce a parallel system of appraisal for thepurposes of revalidation leading to the five-yearly summative assessment process.Council was happy for this possibilty to bedeveloped. Once all of these papers have been refined in the light of Council's discussions they,together with associated documents, will forma package for the purposes of consultationwith the entire profession which, jointly withthe GPC, will be sent out this month. NHS Plan for England Council noted the initial responses that havebeen given by the College in conjunction withthe GPC in England to the NHS plan forEngland and the issues to which the plan givesrise. It was agreed by Council that while thethrust of many of the proposals in the Plan isdirected at England alone, aspects do relate toWales and it is important to see what effectsthis could have elsewhere in the UK. TheCollege's major concerns on the Plan are: the shortfall in the planned increases in numbers of GPs, given that the increase innumbers would not meet the needs identified ahead of the Plan, let alone the needs identified and forecast in it; the unwelcome focus on single-handed practice which the College views as an issue of professional isolation and accessibility; the omission of the quality agenda and the lack of reference to 'caring'that thereis in the Plan; the rush into PMS when the result of the pilots have not been evaluated; and the abolition of the Medical Practices Committee and its illogical inclusion in the work of the proposed Medical Education Standards Board (see more on this below). There is a raft of other issues in the Plan which the College will need to monitor. We will belooking to produce a series of papers jointlywith GPC as our detailed response to the Plan.These papers will cover issues such asworkforce, PMS, intermediate care, and healthinequalities, and will be produced over thecoming weeks. One specific proposal in the Plan is the abolition of the Joint Committee onPostgraduate Training for General Practiceand to combine its functions with those of theSpecialist Training Authority to form a newMedical Education Standards Board.

The British Journal of General Practice, November 2000 943neville goodman Young girls starving themselves to supermodel thinness is a worry for doctors,teachers, and parents. There are repeatedcries to the fashion industry to get real, in acountry where the average size forwomen's clothes is 16. I don't usually readthe Daily Mail , but I happened to see a copy containing a letter to the Editorcommenting that 'the whole female worldspends its time slimming [to] emaciate theirbodies into fashionable lines'. With a fairturn of metaphor, the writer asked when thefashion houses are going to stop using'human coat-hangers'. 'Not yet'seems to be the answer: the letter appeared in the Daily Mail of 2 June, 1953. I happened to see it when clearing out myfather-in-law's house. The newspaper hadbeen kept (though probably never looked atagain) for the coverage of the coronation,not for the letter, nor for the story about the16-year-old girl murdered and thrown intothe Thames. Old newspapers are anexcellent way of reminding us that not asmuch changes as we like to think. Another find was the Daily Mail Yearbook for 1938 (price: one shilling). Proposalshad been published to end the'\"irreconcilable conflict\" between the Jewsand Arabs in Palestine'and, among otherconstantly uttered refrains we were assuredthat 'Britain finest servicesin the world'. The BMAwas concernedthat more than 40% of the populationbetween 14 and 40 didn't do enoughphysical exercise. Notwithstanding, it wasreckoned that 1937 would be rememberedfor the many efforts to achieve a 'FitterBritain'by making its citizens 'acutely andpermanently health-conscious'. An advertin the charities section had the Minister ofHealth, Sir Kingsley Wood, asking for'help to remove this blot upon ourcivilisation'by donating to the RoyalCancer Hospital, because cancer 'takes itstoll of 60 000 lives every year'. So, to the recent plans for selecting Key Areas, setting national objectives andtargets, and constructing frameworks fortheir monitoring and development. I'm surewe're all convinced that the initiativerepresents a 'major step forward inimproving the health of the people'. Wenote the particular emphasis on the'importance of active partnerships between... organisations and individuals', thepromotion of 'focus groups', of [to] reflect the priorities'. Indeed,'additional resources are being madeavailable', and I'm sure we can believe itbecause the signature to this document isVirginia Bottomley, and it is dated July1992. Nev.W.Goodman@bris.ac.ukwas concerned that, under this proposal, the accepted efficiency of the Joint Committeemay be lost and there is a danger that the workfor GPs may be overshadowed in the largerbody. Council was especially appreciative of the work of Mike Pringle in his rapid andintelligent initial response which was felt tohave balanced carefully the perspectives of ourthree major audiences: GPs, patients, and theGovernment. Future of GPs and their Training Council considered again a paper from MikePringle which looked at the issues of GPtraining and how these might develop in thecoming years. The 15 broad recommendationscovered aligning the structure and status oftraining for general practice with those of non-general practice doctors. The Europe-wideramifications of general practice training werediscussed. Genetic Testing Council welcomed a motion from SheffieldFaculty which suggested that the Collegeshould urge the Government to ensure thatinsurance companies could not discriminateon the basis of genetic information. Councilsupported the thrust of the motion but felt thatgenetics was a wider issue than itsimplications for insurance. Further discussionwill take place at the next meeting of theCouncil and Executive Committee. Confidentiality Principles Iona Heath, Chairman of the Committee onMedical Ethics, suggested that a fresh lookshould be given to the principles surroundingconfidentiality. The full text of Dr Heath'spaper is available on the RCGP website.Subject to some minor changes, the paper inits final form will be issued as a CollegePosition statement. Recruitment, Retention and Return to General PracticeThe Health Inequalities Task Group has as itsaim to reduce inequality in the health of thepeople of Britain. The Group had produced areport looking at the current evidenceregarding recruitment, retention and return togeneral practice and the distortions there couldbe in the market as a result of inequalities. Aseries of solutions had been proposed toreduce or overcome the issues that have beenidentified. Council agreed that these viewsshould be promulgated and would be valuablein the discussion on workforce planning on theNHS Plan for England. If you require any further information on any of these subjects or others on the agenda, thenplease do not hesitate to get in touch. Maureen Baker Honorary Secretary944 The British Journal of General Practice, November 2000bruce charlton The right side of the line Growing-up, I often heard it said that one must not expect too much from life. That life wasa matter of compromise, with a large element of routine drudgery. One cannot expect to behappy all of the time. All of which is true. But not the whole truth. Because this implies that it is, fundamentally, a matter of indifference what choice one makes of job, spouse, friends, school, college,work, religion. Since all are imperfect the main task is for each individual to accept radicalimperfection and make the best of it. The happiest man is the stoic who accepts theinevitable without illusions or false hopes. In a sense this is the ultimate truth about the human condition. But, within limits set by disposition and the state of the world, there is scope for difference big enough to make adifference. Some time ago when I was single and seeking a mate, I devised the concept of 'side of the line'for evaluating the physical attractiveness of potential girlfriends. I was aware of themore traditional 'marks out of ten'system, but that gave excessive weighting to looks.Looks matter \u2014 true; but it didn't take much experience to realise that looks don't carry arelationship very far, or for very long. On the other hand, since looks do matter, insufficientattention to them can lead to excruciating situations. The idea was that once a woman was attractive enough then she could be classified as being 'on the right side of the line'. From the 'looks'point of view she was suitable as apotential girlfriend. But \u2014 and here is the crux \u2014 all women on the right side of the linewere regarded as equal. Once someone was classified as being on the right side of the line,further physical comparisons were ruled out. Other factors could come into the equation. Similarly, work is terrible: why must we live by the sweat of our brows? Yet I have worked in some jobs that made me dread Mondays and count the days to a holiday; I have workedin other jobs that did not cause me active distress but which I did for as long as I was paidand no longer; and I have also had jobs in which I found myself 'working'throughweekends and holidays purely for my own satisfaction. All these are possible tracks \u2014some jobs are 'good enough'. Choices are important, and the difference can be qualitative. 'Life's like that'. Imperfect but importantly differentiated. And this \u2014 precisely \u2014 is the arena of medicine. Medicine is not about attaining perfect health, a beautiful appearance,optimal fitness, and euphoric happiness. Medicine is about moving people to the right sideof the line. Moving from a life dominated by the consciousness of pain to a life in whichthe pain is controlled enough that we can forget about it. About having skin disease treated,not to the point of a flawless baby's bottom, but to the point that we are no longer self-conscious about our appearance. Accepting that life is not about a continual state oftranscendent euphoria, but that it is well worth alleviating psychiatric symptoms to thepoint that we can engage in creative work and rich human relationships. If personal life is a set of existential thresholds, then we should try for better-than-threshold levels in as many significant areas as we may. When life is on the wrong side of the line inlove, in work, in family, in community. then at best we may suspend judgment. Life is amatter of waiting and hoping. Existence is flawed, the human condition is one of conflict and chaos. But some lives feel good-enough from the inside, and that distinction is worth striving for.Bruce Charlton can be contacted at bruce.charlton@ncl.ac.uk Paul Davis is presently Vice-Chairman of RCGPUK Council Chris Donovan is a retired GPliving in Hampstead, London.
