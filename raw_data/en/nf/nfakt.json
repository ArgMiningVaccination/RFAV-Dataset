Our experts will work with you to identify cost-saving solutions for a variety of systems within your water or wastewater treatment facility. We'll conduct a study of your facility to identify energy efficiency projects and available ComEd incentives to lower your operating costs. Treating wastewater with an activated sludge process requires a lot of energy. Seeking to improve overall efficiency and dependability, the North Shore Water Reclamation District requested a free facility assessment for its Clavey Road operation. Energy experts recommended replacing two blowers, all first- and second-stage diffusers, and upgrading monitoring and control equipment. These upgrades, along with a few process changes and modifications to the PLC SCADA system, improved control of the aeration process and delivered significant savings and energy efficiency to the district. As part of a district-wide aeration system modifications project to save energy and improve facilities, North Shore's Waukegan plant requested a free facility assessment. The assessment report recommended upgrading to high-efficiency EPDM diffusers, replacing an existing blower, replacing monitoring and control equipment and making some process changes. As with its Clavey Road project, North Shore also made modifications to the PLC SCADA system to better control the aeration process, for streamlined energy efficiency *Based on an electric rate of 7 cents per kWh Head over to Business Types or Public Sector for energy-reducing ideas specific to your organization.
