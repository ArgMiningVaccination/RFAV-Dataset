Your doctor may attribute a particular symptom to premenstrual syndrome (PMS) if it's part of your predictable premenstrual pattern. To help establish a premenstrual pattern, your doctor may have you record your signs and symptoms on a calendar or in a diary for at least two menstrual cycles.

Certain conditions may mimic PMS, including chronic fatigue syndrome, thyroid disorders and mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety.
