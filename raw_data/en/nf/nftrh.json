But when it comes to banishing some pregnancy woes like morning sickness and headaches, many moms-to-be sing the praises of acupuncture. In fact, scientific research says acupuncture may help ease many of the common aches and discomforts of pregnancy. What is acupuncture? Acupuncture is a healing art that originated in China thousands of years ago. Traditional Chinese medicine views the body as two opposing forces, yin and yang. When an imbalance occurs between these two forces, it blocks what Chinese medicine refers to as qi (pronounced CHEE), or the flow of vital energy along internal pathways (known as meridians) in our bodies. During acupuncture, a practitioner inserts hair-thin needles through the skin at points along the meridians to correct imbalances and restore health. So does it work? Researchers have found that acupuncture points correspond to deep-seated nerves, so that when the needles are twirled or electrically stimulated (known as electroacupuncture), the nerves are activated. That in turn triggers the release of several brain chemicals, including endorphins, which block pain signals and may help relieve a number of pregnancy symptoms. Benefits of acupuncture during pregnancy Many people credit acupuncture for easing a wide range of pregnancy symptoms including heartburn, [swelling in the legs](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/symptoms-and-solutions/edema.aspx), carpal tunnel syndrome, [sciatica](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/sciatica/), other back pain, headaches and morning sickness. And since pregnancy limits the types of pain medications you can take, it's great to have another tool in your arsenal when Tylenol isn't enough. Here are some of the pregnancy symptoms acupuncture has been used to treat: Morning sickness Some studies have shown that traditional acupuncture that targets the wrist can reduce the [nausea and vomiting associated with morning sickness](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/morning-sickness/), though other studies have found no effect. More About Complementary Medicine During Pregnancy Lower back and pelvic pain Some research suggests that [acupuncture can reduce pregnancy-related pain](//www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001139.pub4/full) in the lower back along with pelvic pain. Depression [Depression during pregnancy](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/depression/) is common, affecting nearly 1 in 4 women \u2014 but a targeted form of acupuncture may help. Women who had acupuncture that was tailored to improve their depression experienced a drop in the severity of their symptoms \u2014 even more so than women who received general acupuncture or massage, one study found. Headaches Research has shown that acupuncture may reduce [pregnancy-induced headaches](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/symptoms-and-solutions/headaches-during-pregnancy.aspx). Women who underwent acupuncture also used less medication. Sleep problems [Getting to sleep and staying asleep](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/sleep-solutions/pregnancy-sleep-problems-solutions/) is trickier than ever during pregnancy \u2014 but some research has shown that moms-to-be who get acupuncture sleep better. Moxibustion during pregnancy Moxibustion is based on the same basic principles as acupuncture, but instead of inserting needles, long sticks of the mugwort herb are burned near certain acupuncture points along your body. Both the heat from the burning and properties of the herb itself are thought to provide physical benefits. Some studies have shown that daily sessions of moxibustion (either alone or combined with acupuncture) may increase fetal activity and therefore [help turn a baby from a breech position](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/breech-baby/) to the more delivery-friendly heads-down position. However, other studies have found moxibustion to be no more effective than doing nothing. Acupressure during pregnancy The points treated in acupressure are usually the same areas used in acupuncture \u2014 but instead of using needles, pressure is applied through a firm massage. Fingers (especially thumbs), hands, elbows, knees and feet are used as tools to rub, knead, drum on and vibrate against the skin on certain parts of the body. Shiatsu, the most well-known style of acupressure, is fairly vigorous. The therapist may apply firm pressure to each trigger point for three to five seconds. Studies have shown that acupressure may help ease lower back pain, labor pain, nausea and headaches, as well as [help naturally induce labor](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/photo-gallery/natural-ways-to-induce-labor.aspx) and reduce stress and anxiety during labor. A word of caution: Since the practitioner has to press and massage very deeply to reach the acupuncture points during acupressure, it's often more painful than acupuncture, and it can cause discomfort or leave bruising. Possible risks of acupuncture during pregnancy When done properly by a trained professional, acupuncture during pregnancy is considered safe and has few risks. One review reported that acupuncture wasn't likely to be associated with miscarriage or other major complications. Instead, most risks associated with acupuncture seem to be fairly minor. They can include soreness, redness or infection at the insertion sites, and injury from needles placed too deeply. A bigger concern during pregnancy is where the acupuncture is performed. There are several acupuncture and acupressure points (like those in the ankle) that are said to induce contractions \u2014 which is why they should be avoided until term (at which point impatient moms might want to give them a try at the hands of a professional). Acupuncture tips for pregnant women Interested in acupuncture to relieve pregnancy symptoms? A few rules of the road: - Check with your doctor. If you're considering acupuncture, talk about it with your practitioner first. Though some [complementary and alternative therapies](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/ask-heidi/week-24/complementary-and-alternative-medicines.aspx)are generally considered safe, it's best to discuss any health conditions, medications or other issues to determine if acupuncture is right for you. - Choose an acupuncturist wisely. Look for one who's licensed by his or her state and certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM). Make sure your therapist has extensive experience dealing with pregnant women. If you need help finding an acupuncturist, try asking your local doula association for recommendations or using the [NCCAOM practitioner search page](//www.nccaom.org/find-a-practitioner-directory/). - Consider costs. Before you begin the treatment, ask the acupuncturist about the number of treatments you may need and how much each one costs. Check with your insurer, too \u2014 some cover the cost of acupuncture while some don't \u2014 to determine if you'll have to pay out of pocket. - Watch for signs of trouble. Unless you're specifically hoping to induce labor at term, you shouldn't feel any unusual contractions during or after a session. If you do, or you notice any other concerning symptoms, contact your doctor immediately. "}
