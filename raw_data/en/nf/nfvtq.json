Recommendations on Immunization Scheduled to vote on the entire document at the October 2014 meeting Estimated publication in 2016 (?)Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedules Information only Discussion topics -status of 2015 schedules -focus group testing of catch -up schedule -\"Job Aids\" for catch -up vaccinationYellow Fever Vaccine Current recommendation is for a booster dose every 10 years -18 vaccine failures documented since 1940 -10 cases in U.S. and European travelers since 1970 World Health Organization recommended 1 lifetime dose (no boosters) in April 2013 Booster dose language will be removed from International Health Regulations in 2016Yellow Fever Vaccine CDC yellow fever group wanted a vote to remove the booster dose recommendation for most travelers There was confusion among committee members about who did and did not need a booster dose Issue was tabled Will be revisited at the October 2014 meetingInfluenza VaccineInfluenza Vaccine 1 vote taken Topics -novel influenza vaccine WG update -vaccine safety -proposed 2014 -2015 recommendationsInfluenza Vaccine Safety -no signals detected using either VAERS or VSD Study by CISA comparing fever rates among children younger than 5 years who received LAIV or IIV -no difference 2014 -15 vaccine -components -minor wording changes in egg allergy and pediatric dosingInfluenza Vaccine Strains 2014 -2015 No change from last year's vaccine strains Trivalent vaccine contains in trivalent vaccine plus: -B/Brisbane/60/2008 -like virusLive Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) for Children Two randomized studies have been conducted in young children that compare the benefits provided by the LAIV and IIV -one study was conducted in children 6 to 59 months of age and the other was conducted in children 6 to 71 months of age Both studies indicated that LAIV provided about 50% better protection than IIV in young childrenInfluenza Vaccine 2014 -2015 Vote: -when available, LAIV should be used for healthy children age 2 through 8 years who have no contraindications or precautions (approved) AAP guidance may say \"should be considered\" rather than \"should be used\" -these 3 words were debated at lengthLive Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) for Children The new ACIP recommendation is based on a review of available studies that suggests LAIV can provide better protection against laboratory -confirmed, medically attended influenza illness than inactivated influenza vaccine among children ages 2 through 8 yearsInfluenza Vaccine 2014 -2015 Text will make clear that both IIV and LAIV are safe and effective Vaccination should not be delayed if LAIV is not available 2014 -15 recommendations will be published in MMWR as a \"Policy Note\" during the summerChoice of Influenza Vaccine Where more than one type of vaccine is appropriate and available, ACIP has no preferential recommendation for use of any influenza vaccine product over another -quadrivalent vs trivalent -high-dose vs standard dose -IIV vs LAIV except in children ages 2 through 8 years www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6207.pdfHuman Papillomavirus Vaccine Information only Topics -9-valent vaccine clinical trial data -Policy considerations and approach to GRADE for 9-valent vaccine -2 dose schedules for existing bivalent and quadrivalent vaccinesHPV 2 -dose Schedules Reasons to consider -cost -simplicity Limited data available -serologic response similar to 3 dose schedule -efficacy may be less -no data on long -term effectiveness HPV WG will continue to discussVaccine Safety Information only Topics -Seizures following multiple vaccines (VSD study) -Febrile seizures after trivalent influenza vaccineFebrile Seizures After Multiple Vaccines -VSD study The concomitant administration of IIV + PCV and IIV + DTaP -containing vaccines had higher risk of febrile seizure than when the vaccines were given separately The concomitant administration of IIV + PCV + DTaP -containing vaccines had the highest risk (rate ratios 2.9 -6.6 depending on year) Analysis continuing No change in policyFebrile Seizures after Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (PRISM study) Studies 2010 -2011 influenza season Administering IIV and PCV13 on the same day did not significantly increase the risk of febrile seizure compared to separate day vaccination No change in policyAdult Vaccination Information only National Health Interview Survey, 2012 -coverage for adult vaccines remains far below HP2020 targets -some improvements from 2011 (modest increases in HPV and Tdap) -racial and ethnic disparities remain13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV13) Information only Topics -consideration for routine adult immunization with PCV13 -discussion of CAPITA trial data Note: PCV13 was approved by FDA for the prevention of pneumonia and invasive disease caused by vaccine serotypes in persons age 50 years and older in December 2011CAPITA trial Community -Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults Intended to determine if PCV13 was effective in reducing the risk of a first episode of CAP among persons 65 years and older Double -blind, placebo controlled ~85,000 persons 65 years or older in the NetherlandsCAPITA trial 46% efficacy against vaccine -type CAP 75% efficacy against vaccine -type invasive pneumococcal disease More effective in persons younger than age 75 35% of recipients reported local AE (mostly pain) Pfizer data presented to ACIP , June 25, 2014PCV13 Recommendations Being Considered by ACIP The Pneumococcal WG believes a recommendation for universal PCV13 vaccination of adults is warranted Options -ADD a dose of PCV13 at age 65 years or older to the currently recommended PPSV23 regimen -REPLACE a dose of PPSV23 at age 65 years with a dose of PCV13 No vote was taken pending additional consideration by WG (schedules, intervals)MeaslesMeasles -United States, 2014* 514 cases reported to CDC -49 importations (23 from the Philippines) Cases among U.S. residents
