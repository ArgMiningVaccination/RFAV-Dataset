Immunosuppression may affect vaccine responses. The [Hayney Laboratory](https://www.medicine.wisc.edu/gastroenterology-and-hepatology/caldera-hayney-lab) conducts research studies of vaccine responses in immunosuppressed patient groups. Mary joined the University of Wisconsin's School of Pharmacy in 1997. Her research interests are in host response to vaccination and protective effects, especially as they relate to immunosuppressed individuals. Her clinical practice is with the lung transplant group at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics. Her postdoctoral training was at the Mayo Clinic and Foundation in Clinical Pharmacology and Vaccine Research. Her laboratory studies responses to vaccines, particularly in immunosuppressed populations.
