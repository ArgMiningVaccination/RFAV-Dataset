She is clinically affiliated to the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC), where she directs the Integrative Headache Clinic for veterans. Her past research has focused on Neuroimaging including fMRI and acute stroke imaging. An ongoing project relates to studying the neural basis of cognitive ability using MRI. In recent years, she has become very interested in Integrative Medicine - especially Ayurveda, Yoga and meditation - and how best to integrate them with the modern medical paradigm. She conducts research into these complementary modalities, and has published the first ever study of stand-alone Ayurvedic treatment of acute stroke. She is able to offer Battlefield acupuncture and Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle counselling as part of medical care to her patients. As a Whole Health Champion at MEDVAMC, she is at the forefront of the transformation of health care to the Integrative care model at the VA.
