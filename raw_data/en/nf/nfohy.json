Starting in January, the first year is dedicated almost exclusively to the foundations of medical science, pathophysiology of disease, and medical therapeutics. Students are introduced to various medical disciplines as well as the principles of physical diagnosis and provided several skill workshops designed to prepare them for the subsequent twelve months in clinical rotations. Students can expect to spend six to eight hours a day in class the first year. Classes are based at the Health Sciences campus in Boston (Chinatown area), where students have easy access to library and study resources as well as faculty and PA Program staff. Due to the demanding curriculum and full-time clinical rotations, it is strongly recommended that students do not work during their time in the PA program. Please note that in addition to all university holidays, students will have breaks in April, August, and December. During the second (clinical) year, a majority of students will travel within a 60-mile radius of Boston to clinical practice sites around eastern Massachusetts. They will have four- to five-week rotations in core clinical disciplines such as Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Surgery, Emergency Medicine, Women's Health, Behavioral Medicine, Family Medicine, and Orthopedics. Students are also permitted to choose one elective in a discipline of their choice after consulting with clinical faculty. Clinical sites and preceptors are assigned by the program, students are not responsible for finding their own. All students must successfully complete the following to meet the program's graduation requirements and earn their degree of Master of Medical Science: - Pass all courses (130 credits) with a 3.0 cumulative GPA or better - Successfully complete all Supervised Clinical Practice Experiences - Pass a comprehensive written examination - Pass the Objective Standardized Clinical Examination - Demonstrate professional conduct throughout the entire program First Year: Didactic Course Sequence Every effort is made to provide an organized, progressive flow of information for our students.

Second Year Supervised Clinical Practice Experiences Students spend the second year rotating through assigned medical disciplines and one elective rotation. These rotations will take place at various clinical sites in the surrounding area. Students are under the direct supervision of their clinical preceptor and will follow the preceptor's work schedule (possible nights and/or weekends). There are three scheduled breaks throughout the clinical year. All additional breaks and holidays during this year will correspond with the schedule of the student's clinical preceptor. The Tufts PA Program has affiliation agreements with over 120 different clinical sites, the majority of which are within 60 miles of downtown Boston. These include major teaching hospitals in and around the city, community hospitals in suburban and rural areas, neighborhood health clinics, and private practices. Through 4-5-week long rotation blocks, our students are given multiple opportunities to experience health care in many different types of settings and medical disciplines in culturally diverse areas. Per ARC-PA Accreditation Standards, Tufts University is responsible for the selection of clinical sites to which PA students will be assigned for clinical rotations. Core rotations are expected to be taken in New England, but the elective can be in any state following selection and approval by Tufts. Students seeking to fulfill their clinical rotation at a new site outside of those previously selected by Tufts may do so by submitting a request for review and selection. Some of our current clinical sites include: Coursework In addition to clinical rotation responsibilities, students are \"called-back\" to campus once a month to complete End-of-Rotation Exams. At this time, students also review additional coursework needed to prepare them for clinical practice, national board examinations, and present their Capstone projects. The Capstone project is an individual effort on a medical topic chosen by the student. This graded project requires considerable effort, including library research and clinical insight, culminating in a poster presentation to PA students, faculty, and staff. - The purpose of the Capstone Project is to foster a clinically-relevant, scholarly activity in a mentored environment. The project serves as the culminating experience for graduate education in physician assistant studies and must be completed prior to the awarding of the MMS degree. Building upon prior clinical experiences, the program curriculum, and specific student interests, the Capstone Project gives students greater insight into healthcare-related issues, such as specific medical conditions, specific therapies, specific diagnostic tests, clinical practice guidelines, healthcare delivery systems, or patient education challenges. The deliverable for the Capstone Project is an 8-10 page paper (excluding references) and accompanying poster presentation that substantiates or refutes a clinical hypothesis through integrating an existing body of knowledge. - Preparation for Clinical Practice includes a wide variety of clinical and practice-related lectures for second-year students in an effort to prepare them for future clinical practice. It also provides formative and summative academic events as part of the concluding curriculum and milestones of the PA curriculum. Students will present selected case studies from actual patient experiences during their clinical experiences. These presentations will be real cases the student has encountered, including\\ medical histories and physical findings, details of the diagnostic workup, differential diagnoses, treatments, and actual outcomes. Students will conclude with a discussion of the disease process and address any questions from the audience of fellow students and principal faculty. These presentations provide students with presentation experience, training in consolidating clinical cases into teaching objects, and an opportunity to address challenging clinical questions from peers. The two formative PACKRAT Examinations provide detailed content feedback for individual students as well as class performance benchmarked against the national cohort taking the examinations. Similarly, summative examinations such as the Comprehensive Examination and OSCE offer similar content feedback on student performance as well as performance as a cohort. Utilizing these results to pinpoint content or performance deficiencies, Principal Faculty will produce a customized board review lecture series designed to address cohort deficiencies in preparation for clinical practice and the national board examination (PANCE). The OSCE results will also permit faculty to identify procedural and skill deficiencies in students and allow for individualized remediation sessions during the final weeks of the curriculum. Using the feedback from the OSCEs, Formative and Summative examinations, the final 4 weeks of the curriculum will be structured to include focused lectures on specific medical topics. The Final Month The final month of the second year is a culmination of all the work students have completed throughout their second year. Students present their Capstone projects in a poster session, take a final Comprehensive Exam, and attend various lectures and workshops to help prepare them for their national board exams and job searches.
