Journal of Viral Hepatitis, Volume: 27, Issue: 12, Pages: (10.1111/jvh. 13366) Analysis of virological response was carried out in 60 patients with longterm followup. Undetectable HDV RNA at followup week 24 was described in 14 patients (seven each of groups I and II, respectively). Of the 14 patients, 6 had a maintained virological response. In the remaining 8 patients, lateHDV RNA relapses occurred between years 2 and 9 Of these 8 patients, five were retreated with IFNbased therapy but this led to HDV RNA negativity during the entire followup in only one patient.TenYear Followup of a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial in Chronic Hepatitis Delta Wranke A et al.
