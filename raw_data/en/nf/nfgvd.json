Gomphrena serrata widely distributed in South America, North America, and India. These plant parts are used as traditional medicine for the treatment of several ailments. This study aims to assess the phytochemical and free radical scavenging of ethanolic extract of G. serrata present in the plant. The preliminary phytochemical study was performed by standard method. The whole plant of G. serrata proved the presence of bioactive constituents such as carbohydrates, alkaloids, steroids, glycosides, triterpenoids, protein and amino acids, saponins, as well as flavonoids. The in-vitro antioxidant study was performed on the ethanolic extract of shade-dried of the whole plant, which determined by hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) 100 \u00b5g/ml assay and was compared to ascorbic acid. The ethanolic extract of the whole plant of G. serrata shows the strong free radical scavenging activity. The present study was the proof for ethanol extract of G. serrata which have medicinally significant and bioactive compounds since these plant species are used as traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases.", "sitename": "Borneo Journal of Pharmacy -", "date": "2018-05-01", "cleaned_text": "Themes by Openjournaltheme.com Novelty OJS 3 Theme by openjournaltheme.com theme Quick jump to page content Main Navigation Main Content Sidebar Borneo Journal of Pharmacy Register Login Online ISSN : 2621-4814 Toggle navigation Home About About the Journal Abstracting and Indexing Publication Frequency Journal History Citedness in Scopus Citedness in Web of Science Article Statistics Journal Diversity Subscribers Sponsorship Journal Policy Aims and Scope Publication Ethics and Malpractice Statement Retraction, Withdrawal, and Correction (R-W-C) Policy Editorial Policies Peer-Review Policy Open Access Policy Licensing Policy Archiving Policy Plagiarism Policy Study Ethics and Ethical Clearance Policy Informed Consent Policy Conflict of Interest Policy People Editorial Board Acknowledgment for past Peer-Reviewers Publisher Contact Issue Current Archives Accepted Manuscripts Author Index Submit Article Submissions Author Guidelines Article Processing Charge Copyright Notice Privacy Statement Announcements Search "}
