Join us at abundant space for a Journey into Vibration: esoteric acupuncture and sound healing at Abundant Space, Scottsdale Az. Irin, with Prickly Pear Acupuncture, will be providing attendees with a blissful acupuncture treatment intended to align your physical, spiritual, emotional and astral bodies. When all your bodies are aligned, you are in tune with your higher power/inner wisdom/soul self so you can receive divine guidance, expand your heart center and show up as your genuine self with confidence. Stephanie, E-RYT with IGNITE wellness collective, will be guiding you though a deep vibrational sound bath using chakra tuned crystal quartz sound bowls, Tibetan sound bowls, and tingsha bells. This sound bath will active the hemispheres of your brain, illuminate your energetic system, and assist the acupuncture treatment in aligning your mind, body and soul. Sound healing and acupuncture goes together like milk and cookies. The acupuncture needles act as antennas, picking up the healing sound waves and transmitting them deep into your tissues, creating waves of healing vibes inside and outside of the body. It will be a euphoric experience for sure. Since it's brunch time and speaking of cookies... @cookiebarqueen is providing us with delicious and healthy cookie bars while we integrate. There will be multiple flavors, all of which are vegan and gluten free to appease all dietary preferences. They will be paired with fizzy and refreshing locally made kombucha by a local brewer.
