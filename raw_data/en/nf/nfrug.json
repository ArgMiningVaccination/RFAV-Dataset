The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to include approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines in the routine immunization schedule and the Vaccines For Children (VFC) program at its October 2022 meeting. The updated immunization schedules will be available in 2023, but the inclusion in the VFC program will not take place until there is a date for vaccine commercialization. This vote does not mandate a school requirement for the vaccines. COVID-19 Bivalent Booster Updates. The ages of eligibility for the bivalent COVID-19 booster have been expanded. COVID-19 vaccine providers are now able to offer omicron variant-targeted bivalent booster doses to children ages 6 months and older. The newly released recommendations include: - Children ages 6 months through 5 years who previously completed a Moderna primary series are eligible to receive a Moderna bivalent booster 2 months after their final primary series dose. - Children ages 6 months through 4 years who are currently completing a Pfizer primary series will receive a Pfizer bivalent vaccine as their third primary dose. - Children 6 months through 4 years of age who have already completed their three-dose primary series with Pfizer are not eligible for a bivalent booster dose at this time. Additionally, the booster recommendations have been simplified. Moving forward, dose counting should be unnecessary; instead, a bivalent booster dose should be offered to anyone eligible.

For children entering child care or school (preschool through 12th grade) in 2022/2023, the following immunizations are required by Washington State: - Hepatitis B - Dtap/Tdap - IPV - MMR - Varicella - PCV (under age 5 years) - Hib (under age 5 years [Vaccines Required for Child Care 2022-2023](https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/348-425-ChildcareImmReqforParents2023-2024.pdf?uid=63d07861e6eef) [Vaccines Required for Preschool-12th Grade School 2022-2023](https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-05/2022-2023%20Parent%20School%20Chart.pdf?uid=63d07861ecb56) In addition to the above, the following immunizations are recommended by ACIP for this population: - Hepatitis A - HPV - Meningococcal - Influenza - Rotavirus - COVID-19 Summary Assessment of Implementation of EHB 1638: Promoting immunity against vaccine preventable diseases. The implementation of this law (passed in 2019/2020 legislative session) have been associated with increases in kindergarten MMR completion rates, but this impact is likely partially offset by increases in religious exemptions for immunizations. Immunization rates differ between public and private schools and vary geographically. There is a sense that eliminating personal belief exemptions while allowing other exemption types for the MMR vaccine only may be an effective approach to increase MMR coverage while balancing parental autonomy. ~Mary Koehnke "}
