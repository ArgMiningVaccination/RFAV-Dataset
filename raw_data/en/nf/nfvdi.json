How we react, what motivates us, and how much we trust ourselves and others are often remnants of our ancestors' fears and fragmentation, keeping us tied to painful patterns and behaviors. Our ancestors lived through traumatic historical events including wars, the legacy of slavery and Native American genocide, the Depression, the immigrant experience, and the Holocaust. It is common for expressions of trauma, such as family suicide, depression, addictions, grief, or physical health conditions, to be passed down from generation to generation. Ceremony, Wild Nature, and Community The journey is both a deeply personal exploration as well as an inquiry into our historical and collective wounding. Through immersion in wild nature, within a safe community and supported by ritual, we can begin a process of reclamation and healing. We give ourselves time and space so that the invisible can become visible. As we bring light to the stories and emotions that may lie dormant from \"looking away,\" we liberate our natural aliveness, inspiration, and gratitude for ourselves and those who came before us. Why It Matters The importance of this work cannot be underestimated. Insights of our time carry forward to new generations, empowering us to connect and repair with our families and communities. In order to gather our creative energies and follow a heart-felt path of service to others and the planet, we must uncover and befriend the entanglements of the past. Flow of the Days The format of the 7-day program is spacious, to allow for profound insights to emerge. We will meet daily in sharing and teaching councils, followed by experiential reflection walks on the land and evening gatherings. The framework of the Four Shields will help us map out our exploration of ancestral wounding. Other rituals and the mirror of nature will enhance our time together. On Day 5, participants will undertake a 24-hour solo with optional fasting. Upon return, participants will share their stories and have them mirrored by the guides. Our last day focuses on how to take the insights forward into daily life.
