Regards, Team Ayur Healthcare Parramatta.Written June 16, 2020This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.Visited March 2020Traveled as a coupleWritten April 20, 2020 - Best Ayurveda in the world!I just love Ayurveda. I've travelled to India five times for treatment. As anyone who has gone along this route would know, Ayurvedic hospitals in India are invariably spartan, usually decaying from age and from the hot sun, and always boring. This year however, I couldn't travel anywhere so I was panicking. Then by some awesome piece of luck I noticed an advertisement for Ayur Healthcare and immediately booked an appointment. I'm so glad I did as now I can never turn back. Ayur Healthcare is God's gift to Ayurveda. Firstly, the clinic is set up in a beautiful old house. The treatment rooms all evoke the feeling of being in a spa with piped music and wonderful aromas. Also the staff are absolutely wonderful - particularly Mr John, the practice manager who has the nicest disposition and is always so obliging. And secondly, I have the best therapist in the world - Dr Anu, who is a Master of Ayurveda from India. She is not only adorable in every way, but she also gives a treatment unlike any I ever had in India. Instead of the generic 'one treatment per session' routine that is the Indian way, she gives 5 -7 treatments per session, all tailored to deal with the patient's specific issues, even using different oils according to the age, weight and gender of the patient. These include the renowned Shirodhara Therapy, warm oil massage, medicated clay treatment, pummelling massage, steam bath and many more treatments. Ayur Healthcare is a fabulous discoveryThank you for leaving us such a wonderful review and 5 star rating. We are thrilled that you loved your experience; all of our team in Ayur Healthcare in Sydney will definitely be happy to read what you wrote.
