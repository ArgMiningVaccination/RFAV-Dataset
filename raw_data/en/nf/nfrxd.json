Most people have no idea how harmful synthetic fragrances can be - or how often we are using them! The chemicals used to create or prolong these \"fresh\" scents impact our neurological health, metabolism, and immune system. We're bringing this topic back to the forefront because Erin will be doing a deep dive on autoimmunity here on the show soon, and exposure to certain chemicals is part of why autoimmune diseases are on the rise. Tune in to hear why cutting out fragrance is a simple, easy step to healthy living.

It's responsible for maintaining fluid balance, for circulating hormones and immune cells throughout the body, as well as transporting toxins out of the body\u2014but it wasn't something many people talked much about. Increasingly over the past few years, however, lymph is getting its time in the spotlight: more and more folks in health spaces are discussing lymph and lymph work. Perhaps you've seen some tutorial videos on lymph drainage massage or how to use gua sha stones and dry brushes. While it's great the lymphatic system is getting the credit it deserves, it's important to know how to approach your lymph and lymph work in a mindful way. That's why Erin sat down with Leah Levitan, licensed massage therapist, massage instructor, and Vodder Certified Manual Lymphatic Drainage Practitioner, to dive into the nitty gritty of the lymphatic system, what it does, how interconnected it is to the rest of our body, and things you can do to improve lymph health\u2014in a way that's safe for your body.

Histamine issues seem to be more and more common - not only are we seeing it more in our practice, Erin received a TON of questions about histamine on Instagram. Because it's such a big deal for clients and listeners, they wanted to bring this discussion to the show. \"How to figure out what's causing my histamine intolerance?\" seemed to be the million dollar question. While histamine issues can have a lot of contributing factors, Erin & Rachel are focusing on one today: HORMONES. Tune in to hear what histamines are, unexpected symptoms that histamines can cause, the histamine + hormone link, and some real life hormone / histamine case studies.

Despite this, fragrance use is ubiquitous: it's found in everything from perfumes, beauty products, and cleaning supplies to plastics, paints, and disinfectants. The problem with these synthetic and artificial fragrances is the health effects they can have on our bodies. Chemicals used to create or prolong these \"fresh\" scents often have deleterious effects on our health like neurological, metabolic, respiratory, and hormonal imbalances. Today's episode continues the summer series, answering your questions about hormones. Listen in as Erin gets into the nitty gritty answering your questions about fragrance effects on hormone health, and lays out what to be aware of in products we often use on our bodies or in our home. This is a topic everyone can benefit from because most people don't even know how toxic synthetic fragrances are, nor how pervasive they are in products many of us use daily.

If you missed part one, be sure to check that out! Last week I talked about how the gut and skin are linked, the different mechanisms that link them and why a healthy diet for your gut is also a healthy diet for your skin. This week I continue the conversation and discuss leaky gut, specific skin conditions, how they often manifest and important things to consider for them. This episode is definitely for you if you've been suffering from a common skin condition like rosacea, acne, eczema, keratosis pilaris or psoriasis. I also talk about histamines and candida, and weave information throughout this episode that's really important to hear from a holistic perspective.

Conventional/allopathic medicine tends to focus on the organ in question. For skin issues, the \"solutions\" are always skin-focused with treatments like dermatology, steroids, cortisone creams, Acutane, etc. They work from the outside. The truth of the matter is that skin is almost always an inside job. Sometimes it's hormones. Sometimes it's overburdened detoxification pathways. Often it's gut-related. Functional medicine likes to take a step back and ask, what's driving the imbalance? What are the triggers? Where did it start? How can we address the root so the organ can self-heal? These are the questions I ask in my practice, and how I attempt to address skin issues from the inside-out.
