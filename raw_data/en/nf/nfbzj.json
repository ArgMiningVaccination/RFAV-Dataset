J Neurol Exp Neural Sci 3: 139. DOI: 10.29011/2577-1442.000139 Abstract Introduction: In Western Medicine, the panic syndrome cause is unknown, but the pathology is related to panic attack episodes, where the patient will become extremely alert and anxious, many times having symptoms as arrhythmia, excessive sweating, high-blood pressure, shortness of breath, chest pain, among other symptoms. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, panic syndrome is associated with deficiency of the Kidney energy and Heat on the Gall-bladder meridian. Purpose: To demonstrate that panic syndrome has energy imbalances as cause, correcting the energy imbalances is essential for the patient's improvement. Methods: One case report of a 14-year-old patient. Started treatment due to panic attacks. Her background showed she received a recommendation of antidepressants used, but her mother looked for another kind of treatment. Treatment was started with Chinese dietary counselling and auricular acupuncture associated with apex ear bloodletting. After a while, it was performed the chakras measurement procedure, which resulted in all chakras depleted in energy (1 in 8), and it was also started treatment with homeopathy and crystal-based medications to replenish the chakras energy. Results: Therefore, treating the energy imbalances improved the emotional and physical state of the patient. The patient presented great improvement after the treatment done. She is more sociable, talks more, made new friends and feels safer, and the symptoms and crisis disappeared. Conclusion: It is important to perform an energy-based treatment for panic disorders, because the use of high-concentrated drugs will harm the vital energy of the patient, maintaining the symptoms in a vicious cycle. Keywords Panic Syndrome; Adolescence; Chinese Dietary Counselling; Auricular Acupuncture; Apex Ear Bloodletting; Energy, Chakras; Traditional Chinese Medicine Introduction Western medicine understands the panic disorders as a mental illness, classified as an anxiety disorder. Panic disorder is the conjunction of spontaneous and unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack appears when the patient becomes extremely alert and afraid with no specific reason for it. The main physical symptoms are chest pain, palpitations, sweating, shaking and shortness of breath [1-4]. Panic attacks are common to the majority of the society, one to every three people in the United States already had a panic attack. [1] The panic disorder, on the other hand, is the recurrence of panic attacks, compromising the daily activities and functions of the patient. The treatment in Western medicine is done in three ways: cognitive behavior therapy, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines [2]. In traditional Chinese medicine, on the other hand, the emotions are not seen as a state of mind, but as influencers and important features in the health of the body. All the ideas within traditional Chinese medicine seek the panorama of a cycle. Therefore, emotions influence the body and the body influence the emotions. A person with lots of repressed feelings, such as fear, anger, and grief, may develop a pathology associated with these feelings, and the opposite is also true. A person who has energy imbalances of other sources may become anxious, stressed or develop a panic disorder, due to the energy imbalances affecting the organs, specifically the Kidney and Gallbladder meridians [5-7]. The author bases herself in the research proposed after the treatment of one specific patient, in 2007. The history of this patient was briefly described in several articles of the author and was responsible for the origin of the metaphor of the tree, present in all the studies of the author and of major importance for the development of the reasoning used in the treatment of the most varied pathologies, including cases of panic disorder [8-13]. This idea started during the treatment of one specific patient in 2006. This patient was a 70-year-old patient, who reported pain in the legs and was diagnosed with Kidney-Yang deficiency, according to TCM. He received treatment with Chinese dietary counseling, acupuncture and auricular acupuncture associated with apex ear bloodletting [8-13]. With the treatment done, the pain in the legs diminished and the patient was submitted to an interview after the treatment. In this interview, 30 days after the treatment, the patient revealed that his eye pressure had also lowered, as his ophthalmologist confirmed. During the treatment, he had not reported being treating glaucoma in the last 40 years with little improvement in his condition. With the treatment performed, his pressure lowered from 40mmHg to 17mmHg, in both eyes [8-13]. Purpose The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the importance of treating panic syndrome in the energy level, considering the diet aspect and treatment using methods that can balance the energy. Methods This article is based on one case report. A patient named M, 14-year-old female patient. Started treatment due to panic attacks. The patient always presented the behavior of a calm kid, however, she was constantly afraid of sleeping on her own. Her mother would still accompany her to her bedroom to sleep until she was 12 years old. In the first panic attack the patient had, the family was preparing to go sleep and she seemed desperate, the heart beating really fast, affirming she would die. Even with the attempts of the mother of calming her down, it did not work. They took her to the emergency room, where several exams were performed, including an electrocardiogram. Nothing was detected, and the patient was oriented to search for psychological help, homeopathic treatment was then started to control the anxiety. The patient started feeling a little better, but she was constantly feeling lots of insecurity, had few friends in school, constantly alone, afraid of tests, had difficulties in concentrating, fear of storms, or the dark, or even loud sounds could trigger a crisis. The crisis appears as shortness of breath, tachycardia, trembling, cold sweat in hands and feet and weaknesses on the legs. The crisis usually happens for only a few minutes. She does not remember in detail what happens during the crisis. She performed the treatment with the homeopathic medications Gelsemium and Ignatia Amara. In the period of treatment with the homeopathy, she would have better and worse moments. The first panic attack happened when the patient was 11 years old. Despite this treatment with homeopathy, the patient was still not completely well, and then she searched for other kinds of treatment and started treatment with the author. After the first appointment, she was diagnosed with Kidney Yin and Yang deficiency, Blood deficiency and Heat retention, according to TCM. She started treatment with several ancient medical tools: 1. Chinese dietary counseling: avoid dairy products, especially melted cheese, cold water, sweets, raw food, coffee, soda, matte tea, fried food, chocolate, honey, coconut and alcoholic beverages, 2. Auricular acupuncture associated with apex ear bloodletting, to rebalance Yin, Yang, Qi and Blood energies. She presented some improvement, but not completely recovered, because the patient did not have enough energy to accompany the activities in school. The patient also had a few memory and concentration problems. Because of these last symptoms, chakras measurement was done, which resulted in level 1 of 8 for all the chakras. This result could explain all the conditions of the patient, including the panic syndrome, as it will be explained further in the Discussion session. Then, it was started homeopathy according to the Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements based on TCM, developed by the author, and crystal-based medications to replenish the energy of the chakras that was very weak, associated with the previous treatment. Results After the beginning of the treatment (Chinese dietary counseling, auricular acupuncture, homeopathy, and crystalbased medications) the results appear as satisfactory. The patient presented great improvement is more sociable, talks more, made new friends and feels safer. Nowadays, the patient is living normally, without having any crisis and continues the treatment, and is able to sleep in her room alone, without the necessity of the mother accompanied her. Discussion Western Medicine and Panic Disorders The panic syndrome or panic disorder is a pathology characterized by the spontaneous and unexpected occurrence of panic attacks. [1-4] The frequency and severity of the attacks may vary, going from many attacks per day to a few attacks per year. Panic attacks are also associated with other anxiety disorders, but for those with panic syndrome, they will occur without any sort of prediction [3]. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSMMD), there are different mental diseases associated with panic attacks, such as pathological anxiety and agoraphobia. The manual separates the mental disorders in types, and the panic disorder is associated with anxiety [8]. Also, according to the manual, the panic attacks bring with them different anxieties, associated with the consequences of the attack, the fear of having another attack and significant behavioral changes related to the attacks [8]. Panic attacks are characterized by a period of intense fear with four to 13 different symptoms, which appear subtly and peak rapidly, less than 10 minutes from the first symptoms. According to the DSMMD, the main symptoms are: Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate Sweating Trembling or shaking Sense of shortness of breath or smothering Feeling of choking Chest pain or discomfort Nausea or abdominal distress Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint Derealization or depersonalization (feeling detached from oneself) Fear of losing control or going crazy Fear of dying Numbness or tingling sensations Chills or hot flashes [8]. Constantly, during the episodes, the patient has urges to escape and fear of dying of a heart attack or suffocating. Strong headaches, cold hands, diarrhea, insomnia, fatigue, intrusive thoughts are other symptoms [3]. In Western medicine, the panic disorder is qualified by the presence or absence of agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is defined as anxiety toward places or situations in which escape may be difficult or embarrassing. When excluding the symptoms of agoraphobia, the patient is comprehended as portable of the panic disorder [1-4]. A panic disorder can lead to significant consequences in lifestyle, many people with agoraphobia cannot travel alone, or be in crowds or malls or public transports. Individuals with panic disorders are associated with depressive disorders as well [1-4]. People with panic disorders also have a much higher risk of alcohol abuse and suicidal tendencies [9]. There are four main types of panic attacks [10]. a) Unexpected panic attacks: With no precipitating reason or trigger, often support a diagnosis of panic disorder without agoraphobia [10]. b) Situationally bound panic attacks: Attacks which occur predictably after a specific situation or trigger, often support a phobia-type diagnosis (agoraphobia, claustrophobia, etc.) [10]. c) Situationally predisposed panic attacks: Likely to occur in relation to a trigger, but they do not always occur, support a diagnosis of panic disorder in conjunction with agoraphobia [10]. d) Non-fearful panic disorder [NFPD]: Associated with high-rates of medication use and poor prognosis [10]. Anxiety disorders are very common around the world. About 6 million American adults will experience a panic disorder during the period of 12 months. The disorder is more common in women, and appear mainly in early adulthood [11]. The introductory part of this discussion, in which we will cover the differences between traditional Chinese medicine and Western Medicine, the origin of this difference and the main principles for diagnosis and treatment of panic disorders in traditional Chinese medicine, has already been shown in other articles of the author [12-17]. As the main principles of traditional Chinese medicine are unknown for many in the current medical field, it is, indeed, important to reinforce these principles, with the main goal of clarifying the different ideas and cornerstones of this ancient form of medicine, which differs from all that is known in Western medicine treatment [18-20]. Western Medicine and Panic Disorders Treatment According to Peter Ham, in his article \"Treatment of Panic Disorder\", analyzes the different medication types available for treatment and its effects in a mild-term use. According to him, cognitive behavioral therapy can be used together with antidepressant medication, having better results [21]. In the United States, however, these patients are known for using the health care resources a lot more than the ones who not have the disorder. Psychiatric case-finding studies showed many people with panic disorders go to the emergency department with chest pain [21]. There are several options of treating. To determine the best option, the physician and the patient have to make tests and discuss [21]. The treatment is done through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and two specific types of drugs: antidepressants and benzodiazepines. Antidepressant medications have been shown to reduce panic severity. The medications are considered effective to reduce the panic attacks and its recurrence, always together with CBT [21]. The Cognitive Behavior Therapy includes many techniques, among them, relaxation, exposure in vivo, panic management, breathing retraining, and cognitive restructuring. The treatment is usually done associating the antidepressants with the CBT. The combination of both treatments has better results than the therapies done alone [21]. Benzodiazepines are also used, and they are more effective than antidepressants in reducing panic symptoms and frequency of attacks. However, they have depression as a side effect and are associated with other negative side effects [21]. The tree metaphor Looking at (Figure 1), is possible to observe the tree metaphor. An allegory of the human body. The part of the tree that is below the earth, that is invisible to the naked eye, are its roots, represented by the Theory of the Five Elements and Yin and Yang. Traditional Chinese medicine sees the individual as a whole, including the environment, includes the external and climatic factors that can be due to excess of Cold, Wind, Heat, Dryness and Humidity [12-17]. In the same way a tree needs to have stronger roots to grow, the body has to be in balance to be healthy. Also, in the same way the environment will influence the health of the tree, the environment will influence the health of the body [12-17]. When studying and understanding panic disorder, the patient's emotional state and the influence of this state in the rest of the body is crucial. Humans are viewed both as a reflection of an integral part of nature, and health results from maintaining harmony and balance within the body and between the body and nature [18]. Yin, Yang, Qi, and Blood Firstly, Traditional Chinese main cornerstone is the concepts of Yin and Yang. The Yin and Yang symbol originated from Oriental cultures and it represents the main source of opposites behaving in a cycle. According to TCM, everything existing in the world is ruled by the main principles of Yin and Yang. These two energy forces would be present in everything including our body, and more specifically our organs [12-18]. There is one symmetric relationship between them, as they are completely opposite and completely complementary: Yin represents darkness, earth, cold, passive and female energy. Yang represents light, heaven, active energy, and male energy [12-18]. The cycle suggests continuous movement, and these can be clearly understood in (Figure 2). Yang cyclically returns to its beginning; the Yin reaches its apogee and yields its place to the Yang. In order to achieve health, the main principle is the balance of the Yin and Yang energy present inside our bodies. These energies can be influenced by many other factors, but their balance is the only way to seek complete health [12-18]. Some traditional Chinese medicine scholars, understand the Yin deficiency or excess as the main source of anxiety. The Yin is replenished by the energy of the Kidney. In the case of the case report described, the patient had a Yin and Yang deficiency of the Kidney. The emotion that imbalances the Kidney is fear. An energy imbalance, when systemic in the body, can cause the most varied symptoms and when not properly treated, it will imbalance other energies of the body, as it is possible to see in Figure 3. The study and development of this dynamic arrangement between Yin, Yang, Qi and Blood energies, was developed by the author and presented in 2015 Acupuncture Research Conference, in Boston, Harvard Medical School, USA. In this study, it was stated that rebalancing these four energies could lead to improvement of different symptoms in the most varied pathologies [14-16]. Acupuncture is recognized as a medical specialty in Brazil since 1995 by the Federal Medical Council. In Figure 4, the proposed idea is that the imbalance of any of the four energies described may cause Heat retention. When there is formation of Heat, this Heat can be present in the Gallbladder meridian, generating the symptoms of panic syndrome, such as fear, arrhythmia, because the Heat on the Gallbladder meridian passing through the Heart. This is why the treatment with apex ear bloodletting, which has the goal of taking out the Heat, improved the condition of the patient, as well as the Chinese dietary counseling to avoid foods that could worsen the formation of Heat directly, and other food that could imbalance other meridians, leading to the balance of the system, shown in Figure 3 and 4. Five Elements Theory The other cornerstone of TCM is the Five Elements theory. According to this theory, there is a relationship between Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, and Wood. This energy relationship is present inside our bodies and is associated with specific organs, called massive organs. They are considered more important because they are responsible for other organs and rule the rest of the body [1218]. The Wood element corresponds to the Liver, the Fire element corresponds to the Heart. The Earth element corresponds to the Spleen, the Metal element corresponds to the Lungs, and the Water element corresponds to the Kidney, as represented in Figure 5. [12-18]. These organs, as well as the elements in the theory will function according to two cycles. The cycle of generation and control. As represented in Figure 5, the generation cycle: Wood forms Fire, Fire forms Earth, Earth forms Metal, Metal forms Water, Water forms Wood. The control cycle: Fire controls Metal, Metal controls Wood, Wood controls Earth, and Earth controls Fire. In this cycle, all organs have the same importance, and they will control themselves in order to maintain health and equilibrium [12-18]. Each element or massive organ have associations with external sensory organ. Liver has the eye as external sensory organ and is responsible for vision. The Heart is responsible for the tongue, and subsequently language. Spleen represents the mouth and is responsible for taste. Lungs has the nose as external sensory organ and is responsible for the sense of smell. The Kidney represent the ear and is responsible for the sense of hearing. The other organs relationship is described in the scheme presented in Figure 6 [12-18]. Each massive organ is linked to a hollow organ (Figure 6), the Liver has the Gallbladder as a hollow organ, is one of the organs that when imbalanced leads to feelings of fear and panic. The Heart has the Small intestine as a hollow organ, the Spleen has the Stomach as hollow organ, the Lungs has the Large Intestine as a hollow organ, and the Kidney has the Bladder as hollow organ. Diagnosis and Main Causes of Energy Deficiencies leading to anxiety and panic disorders Diagnosis In order to make an energy deficiency the patients are submitted to a full questionnaire, here presented in (Table 1) [12-18]. *Blood deficiency can be understood as anemia in the energy level. As Blood deficiency may take years to appear in the laboratory exams, the patient with constipation and a normal complete blood count (CBC) can still be considered a patient with Blood deficiency, according toper TCM, depending based on the symptoms he/she may present. The patient was diagnosed with Kidney Yin and Yang deficiency, Blood deficiency and Heat retention, because she felt hot in her body (Yin deficiency) but had cold feet (Yang deficiency, and did not have bowel movements every day (Blood deficiency). In the physical exam, it was noticed that the patient had acne on the face, meaning that she had Heat retention as well. Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Emotions According to traditional Chinese medicine, the emotions are more important to the health of the body than for Western medicine [22]. Unbalanced emotions are not seen as a mental disorder but as states of mind, which appear when we have unsolved emotions, not recognized and repressed. The emotions have a major influence on the body as a whole, being able to make us sick, not only in a psychological way, but physically as well. Therefore, they may be the cause of diseases [22-23]. In traditional Chinese medicine, not-solved emotions can result in mental stimulation that are bad to the mind and to the spirit. They would imbalance the internal organs and the harmony of Qi and Blood. For this reason, emotional stress is an internal cause of disease which attacks the internal organs directly [22-23]. As in traditional Chinese medicine everything is cyclical, in the same way the emotions influence the body, the health of the body will influence the emotions. As discussed before, traditional Chinese medicine comprehends the Heart, Spleen, Lungs, Kidney, and Liver as the main organs. An energy imbalance resulting in a deficiency of the energy of a specific organ will also influence the emotions, causing different pathologies, in this case, panic disorder, if the organ affected are the Gallbladder, Kidney or both (in the energy point of view) [23]. In traditional Chinese medicine, all the anxiety disorders, such as agoraphobia, claustrophobia, generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder are all treated in the same way and associated with the same pathological cause [5]. The main source of the imbalance, in this case, is the Kidney energy. The Kidney is one of the main organs in the Five Elements relationship, and are also strongly linked to the Yin and Yang energy nourishment inside the body. The Kidney can be weakened by overwork, exposure to different toxins, which may be found within our food, alcoholic beverages and constant intake of medication, stress and poor sleeping [5]. The kidneys are associated with the Water element, and the Water Element is related directly to anxiety, as previously explained. Water is the element with more Yin present, and winter, the season associated with the water, is the most related to Yin season. Therefore, Yin deficiency is the main cause of panic disorders [12-18]. Gallbladder Meridian and Anxiety TCM literature appears to demonstrate that the Gallbladder meridian is responsible for the decisions and judgments, as well as providing courage and initiative. The meridian is linked to the quality and length of sleep as well. It is the weakness of the Gallbladder energy that causes anxiety disorders and attacks and insecurity in Traditional Chinese Medicine [24]. According to Maciocia, the Gallbladder meridian is in charge of decisiveness. Whenc ompared to the Kidneys that are believed to control will in TCM, the Gallbladder is the motive force which results in action, therefore, being extremely linked to anxiety and panic disorders [24]. The Gallbladder is one of the most important meridians as it represents a pivot for when Yang turns back into Yin and the cycle restarts [24]. Someone who is always in a contracted state of being, whether that be energetically, physically, mentally or emotionally, will suffer not only anxiety disorders from a Western psychological perspective, but, from a Chinese medical perspective, a host of Qi circulation disruptions, leading to the pathogenesis of Heat, Phlegm, Damp, more Cold, Blood Stasis, etc [24]. Five Elements Theory and Chakras Theory: Where ancient medical theories overlap The chakras concept, also already presented by the author in several other articles, appears in the Aryuveda medical theories, as well as in Yoga theories. Chakras are the main points of energy concentration. There are seven main chakras present in the body, and their relationship among themselves is extremely important for the body's health [18]. The chakras correspond to the five elements within the Five Elements Theory, as exposed in small trials in the literature. Many ancient medical scholars believe that the Five Elements Theory and the theory of the chakras can connect. One example is entitled The Geometry of Emotions: Using Chakra Acupuncture and 5-Phase Theory to Describe Personality Archetypes for Clinical Use, where the author links the use of chakras measurement with the principles of traditional Chinese medicine. These ideas have been described by the author in other articles, to comprehend the influence of a weakened result in the chakras in the other systems of the body. Although this article is focused on personality archetypes linked to the chakras, it establishes a relationship between the Five Elements Theory and the seven chakras, in the same way as proposed by the author in previous articles [19]. As there are seven chakras and five elements, the seventh chakra is ruled by the first (Wood or Liver), and the sixth chakra is ruled by the second (Water or Kidney). Earth rules the fifth chakra (Spleen-Pancreas), the fourth is ruled by Metal, or Lung, the third is ruled by Fire or Heart. The second is ruled by Water or Kidney, and the first chakra is ruled by Wood or Liver, as shown in Figure 7 [13-14]. The use of the chakra centers measurement was previously analyzed by George Washington, in the article entitled The Scientic Basis of Integrative Medicine. In the article, the author describes the pineal gland as a link between our external environment and the network of internal body systems, comprehending the chakras system as an extension to the body's working systems [21]. The homeopathy and crystal-based medications used in the treatment for the chakras are better described in Table 2. The specific use of all the crystal-based medications and the properties of each crystal and homeopathy are described in the study of the author entitled Why Are Diabetic Patients Still Having Hyperglycemia despite Diet Regulation, Antiglycemic Medication and Insulin?, published by the International Journal of Diabetes & Metabolic Disorders, in March 2019 [12]. Homeopathy is recognized as a medical specialty in Brazil since 1985, by the Federal Medical Council. Arndt-Schultz Law According to the Arndt-Schultz law (Figure 8), all drugs in high concentrations cause a reduction of vital energy. This reduction would generate the patient's energy weakness and other energy imbalances [14-17]. The choice of using homeopathy and crystal-based medication was based on the idea of not generating more energy deficiency and fortifying the energy of the patient that were already low. When maintaining the use of the high-concentrated drug medication, the energy of the patients would only get worse, as demonstrated on this case report, doing the radiesthesia procedure, where all the chakras were found without energy [14-17]. The use of high-concentrated medication, in this case, would harm even further the energy of the patient, producing more internal Heat, and worsening the symptoms of panic syndrome. In order to treat patients with panic disorder in a deeper way, the physician has to comprehend the importance of the different medicine perspectives. The body, and therefore, the possible treatments, is not only physical and constituted by organs and tissues. It is formed by energy. In Figure 9, a metaphor of Yin and Yang as the different kinds of medicine was created by the author. Nowadays, these two perspectives are separated, but they can be complementary [14-17]. Traditional Chinese medicine can be considered as Yang energy, and Western medicine is considered Yin energy, already materialized. In the same way of the relationship of Yin and Yang, traditional Chinese medicine starts where Western medicine ends [14-17]. Conclusion The conclusion of this study is that panic syndrome has energy imbalances as a base, and the correction of this imbalance is important to treat the patient on a different way, at the root of the problem on the energy level. The energies that are usually involved are Gallbladder and Kidney meridian. The replenishment of the chakras energy deficiency is important to treat the patient as a whole, in conjunction with other tools used. All factors that could cause worsening of the energy status of the patients should be reduced or avoided to improve all the patients symptoms simultaneously, as demonstrated in the case report of this study.
