Chinese Herbal Medicine has been used for thousands of years as a treatment for many illnesses. Used alone or in conjunction with acupuncture it can be very powerful yet also very safe. Unlike pharmaceuticals which are isolated compounds in relatively high concentration, Chinese herbal formulas contain multiple herbs providing very small quantities of any one compound.
