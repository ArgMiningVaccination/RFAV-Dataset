HC-NOT1SHBP STANDARD HRA SPD - 01/01/2012 myCIGNA.com 5Introduction This booklet is your Summary Plan Description (SPD) and describes the provisions of State Health Benefit Plan and this Health Reimbursement A ccount Plan Option under the State Health Benefit Plan. This Health Reimbursement A ccount Plan Option is referred to in this booklet as the \"H RA Option,\" and the State Health Benefit Plan is referred to as the \"SHBP\" or \"the Plan.\" You have this SPD because you are enrolled in the HRA Option under the SHBP. Use this SPD as a reference tool to help you understand the Plan and maximize your coverage. The SHBP consists of three plans established by Georgia law: a plan for State employees, a plan for public school teachers, and a plan for public school employees other than teachers. The SHBP is self insured, and is governed by certain Georgia laws, the regulations of the Department of Community Health (DCH), Chapter 111-4-1 Health Benefit Plan , and resolutions of the Board of Community Health that establish requ ired contributions that must be paid to the SHBP. If there are discrepancies between the information in this SPD and DCH regulations or the laws of the state of Georgia, or the Board resolutions setting required contributions, those regulations, laws and resolutions will govern at all times. This booklet is notice to all Covered Persons of the Plan's eligibility requirements and benefits payable under the H RA Option for services provided on or after January 1, 2012, unless otherwise noted. Any and all statements to Covered Persons or to providers about eligibility, payment or levels of payment that were made before January 1, 2012 are canceled if they conflict in any way with the provisions described in this booklet. The Department of Community Health is the Plan Administrator, and reserves the right to act as sole interpreter of all the terms and conditions of the Plan, except where expressly delegated to the Claims Administrator. The Plan Administrator has delegated full responsibility for claims admini stration to CIGNA , the Claims Administrator for the Plan. The Claims Administrator processes and pays claims in accordance with the terms of the Plan, this booklet and the separate medical policy guidelines that serve as supplement to this booklet to more fully define eligible charges. The Claims Administrator has the discretion to interpret the terms of the Plan when processing and paying claims and makes final decisions with respect to medical and pharmacy claims . The Department of Community Health also reserves the right to modify the benefits, level of benefit coverage and eligibility/participation requirements for the Plan at any time, subject only to reasonable notification to Members. W hen such a change is made, it will apply as of the modification 's effective date to any and all charges incurred by Members on that day and after, unless otherwise specified by the DCH.

FPCCL10V1 Case Management Case Management is a service provided through a Review Organization, which assists individuals with treatment needs that extend beyond the acute care setting. The goal of Case Management is to en sure that patients receive appropriate care in the most effective setting possible whether at home, as an outpatient, or an inpatient in a Hospital or specialized facility. Should the need for Case Management arise, a Case Management professional will work closely with the patient, his or her family and the attending Physician to determine appropriate treatment options which will best meet the patient's needs and keep costs manageable. The Case Manager will help coordinate the treatment program and arrange for necessary resources. Case Managers are also available to answer questions and provide ongoing support for the family in times of medical crisis. Case Managers are Registered Nurses (RNs) and other credentialed health care professionals, each trained in a clinical sp ecialty area such as trauma, high risk pregnancy and neonates, oncology, mental health, rehabilitation or general medicine and surgery. A Case Manager trained in the appropriate clinical sp ecialty area will be assigned to you or your Dependen t. In add ition, Case Managers are supported by a panel of Physician advisors who offer guidance on up -to-date treatment programs and medical technology. W hile the Case Manager recommends alternate treatment programs and helps coordinate needed resources, t he patient's attending Physician remains responsible for the actual medical care. 1.You, your dependent or an attending Physician can request Case Management services by calling the toll - free number shown on your ID card during normal business hours, Monday through Friday (Eastern Time Zone). In addition, a claim office or a utilization review program (see the PAC/CSR section of your certificate) may refer an individual for Case Management.SHBP STANDARD HRA SPD - 01/01/2012 myCIGNA. com 102.The Review Organization assesses each case to determine whether Case Management is appropriate. 3.You or your Dependent is contacted by an assigned Case Manager who explains in detail how the program works. Participation in the program is voluntary - no penalty or benefit reduction is imposed if you do not wish to participat e in Case Ma nagement. 4.Following an initial assessment, the Case Manager works with you, your family and Physician to determine the needs of the patient and to identify what alternate treatment programs are available (for example, in - home medical care in l ieu of an extended Hospital convalescence). You are not penalized if the alternate treatment program is not fo llowed. 5.The Case Manager arranges for alternate treatment services and supplies, as needed (for example, nursing services or a Hospital bed and ot her Durable Medical Equipment for the home). 6.The Case Manager also acts as a liaison between the insurer, the patient, his or her family and Physician as needed (for example, by helping you to understand a complex medical diagnosis or treatment plan). 7.Once the alternate treatment program is in place, the Case Manager continues to manage the case to ensure the treatment program remains appropriate to the patient's needs. While participation in Case Management is strictly voluntary, Case Management profession als can offer quality, cost -effective treatment alternatives, as well as provide assistance in obtaining needed medical resources and ongoing family support in a time of need.

The Health Reimbursement Arrangement combines traditional medical coverage with a fund that includes contributions only from State Health Benefit Pla n. 1.SHBP contribution \u2014 SHBP establishes a health fund that can be used to pay for qualified health care expenses during that year. The services you receive and where you get them are up to you. Amounts paid by the fund for covered services count toward the annual deductible. For a list of qualified expenses, please visit CIGNA.com , subject to limits set by State Health Benefit Plan. NOTE: Prescription drug coinsurance does not apply to the deductible or maximum out -of-pocket limit. See the pharmacy section for additional information. 2.Your contribution \u2014 Once you've used the dollars in your health fund, you pay your expenses up to the deductible. 3.SHBP and y ou\u2014 After your deductible is met, you use a traditional medica l plan for covered services. Depending on your plan, you pay pre -determined coinsurance for certain services. Which services are covered by my medical plan, and which will I have to pay out of my own pocket? Covered services vary depending on your plan, so visit myCIGNA.com or check your plan materials in this booklet for specific information. In addition to your premiums deducted from your paycheck, you'll be responsible for paying: Costs for any services needed afte r you've spent your health fund, if you haven't met your deductible. Your coinsurance after you meet the deductible and your medical plan coverage begins up to the plan's out - of-pocket maximum. If all of your medical expenses are covered services and the t otal cost doesn't exceed the amount in your health fund, you may not have add itional out -of-pocket costs. Are services covered if I use out -of-netw ork doctors? You can use the dollars in your HRA to visit any licensed doctor or facility for all services co vered by the State Health Benefit Plan.

Certain employers may choose to stop offering SHBP coverage to employees or take actions that cause a termination of coverage for their employees: Local school systems may withdraw from the plan for public school employees other than teachers. That means they can stop offering SHBP coverage to employees who are eligible for the plan for other public school employees and are not eligible for the plan for teachers. See the Eligibility sec tion for more information. State authorities participating in the ERS may stop offering SHBP coverage to employees and retirees, Charter schools that elected to offer SHBP coverage to employees may revoke that election through action or inaction (such as failure to pay required contributions) and thereby stop offering SHBP coverage to employees, Employers that offer SHBP coverage to employees through a contract with DCH may stop offering SHBP coverage through action or inaction that causes the contract to terminate, and Local school boards may stop offering SHBP coverage to school board members. When coverage ends because the Board of Community Health discontinues the SHBP or because your employer stops offering the SHBP, this termination of coverage d oes not create continuation rights. However, you may have rights to continue coverage if you resign or retire while your employer still offers the Plan. Whenever coverage ends for any reason, your entitlement to benefits automatically ends on the date t hat coverage ends, even if you are hospitalized or are otherwise receiving medical treatment on that date. When your coverage ends, we will still pay claims for Covered Health Services that you received before your coverage ended. However, once your covera ge ends, we do not provide benefits for health services that you receive for medical conditions that occurred after your coverage ended, even if the underlying medical condition occurred before your coverage ended. An Enrolled Dependent's coverage ends on the date the Member's coverage ends. When Coverage Ends For You Your coverage generally will end if: you no longer qualify under any category listed under the eligibility rules and your payroll deductions for coverage have ceased; you do not make direct -pay premium payments on time; you do not submit required premiums to your employer while you are on an unpaid leave of absence; you resign or otherwise end your employment; you are laid off because of a formal plan to reduce staff; your hours are reduced so that you are no longer benefits eligible; you do not return to active work after an approved unpaid leave of absence; you are terminated by your employer ; you intentionally misrepresent eligibility for SHBP coverage for yourself or any covered dependents; you intentionally misrepresent eligibility for waiver of the tobacco or spousal surcharge, either by failing to answer the questions truthfully or failing to notify DCH, SHBP Division of a change to your answers SHBP STANDARD HRA SPD - 01/01/2012 myCIGNA. com 89during the year; Member contributions not remitted to the Plan by the due date may result in suspension/and or termination of coverage ; or your employer stops offering the SHBP, either by action (such as withdrawing from the plan for public school employees other than teachers) or inaction (such as not paying required contributions). Coverage for Member ends at the end of the month following the month in which the last premium is deducted from your earned paycheck or at the end of paid coverage. Premiums will not be deducted from final leave pay. Note: If an Employ ing Entity fails to remit Premiums or documentation or fails to reconcile bills in the manner required by the Plan, the Plan may suspend coverage for all Enrolled Members of the Employ ing Entity . During a period of suspended coverage, benefits will continue to be paid, but the Employ ing Entity will be directly responsible for reimbursing SHBP for all claims paid. If the Employ ing Entity fails to provide the required Premiums or documentation or reconcile bills, coverage may be terminat ed for all Enrolled Members of the Employ ing Entity . In this instance, DCH, SHBP Division will send a notice to Enrolled Members before the coverage is terminated. Although termination of coverage in this situation does not give rise to COBRA continuatio n rights, members who have a right to continue coverage after resignation or retirement under State law will be provided an opportunity to do so if they stop working for the Employ ing Entity while SHBP coverage is in place. Coverage will end beginning on the date that your false response is discovered and new coverage will not be available for at least 12 months thereafter.SHBP STANDARD HRA SPD - 01/01/2012 myCIGNA. com 90When Coverage May Be Continued For You SHBP allows individuals to continue their SHBP coverage in certain situations when it would h ave otherwise ended.

Premium rates for annuitants currently reflect a subsidy for certain options. The Board of Community Health is authorized to set premiums by resolution, and may change premium requirements at any time with advanced notice. The Board approved a change in the methodology for subsidizing premiums for annuitants and their dependents. The new methodology adjusts the subsidy for annuitant premiums based on Years of Service for future annuitants who had less than five Years of Service as of January 1, 2012. This change will impact employees who had less than five years of service as of January 1, 2012 when they retire with an annuity in the future.

Si nce this plan is a Medicare approved plan, this plan does not coordinate benefits with Medicare. If you are retired and are enrolled in a SHBP non Medicare Advantage option, SHBP will coordinate benefits wit h Medicare.

The SHBP is not a supplemental plan to Medicare. The P lan will pay secondary benefits/coordinate benefits if retired and enrolled in Medicare and the Standard or W ellness HRA, Standard or Wellness HDHP, or Standard or W ellness HMO Option. The Plan does not pay secondary benefits with the Medicare Advantage O ptions. All other Plan options pay benefits after Medicare pays benefits. That means that any Medicare coverage you or your dependents have will be the primary plan and the SHBP Plan option you have will be the secondary plan. To maximize coverage, you a nd your dependents should consider enrolling in Medicare Parts A, B and D two months before the month in which you turn 65. Are you not yet eligible for Medicare? You may elect to have coverage under any of the non -Medicare plan options offered by SHBP. Annuitant health premiums are currently similar to those of active employees.

Medicare is the country's health insurance program for people age 65 or older who qualify based on Medicare eligibility rules. Medicare also covers certain people with disabilities who are under age 65 and people of any age who have permanent kidney failure. Medicare becomes your primar y insurance carrier once you are covered by Medicare. You are eligible for Medicare even if you never paid into Social Security. You and/or your spouse can purchase Medicare Part B if you are a U.S. Citizen, reside in the U.S., age 65 or older (or a lega l non -citizen, age 65 or older, who resides and has lived in the U.S. for at least 5 years or longer ). You will need to send a copy of your Medicare Card (A, B or D) to SHBP at P.O. Box 1990, Atlanta, GA 30301 -1990 the first of the month prior to the month in which the retiree turns 65 or becomes eligible for Medicare because of disability. Options and premiums cannot be adjusted until copies of your Medicare cards are received and the change in premium is processed by the retirement system. Delay in subm ission of Medicare information will result in an increase in premiums to the full cost of the non -MA coverage, with no refund of the difference in premiums. Due to Disability If you are disabled under Social Security, you may qualify for Medicare after a w aiting period. What if I have End Stage Renal Disease? If you or your dependents are enrolled in Medicare due to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), you may not enroll in a Medicare Advantage option during your first 30 months of Medicare coverage because SH BP is your primary coverage. After 30 months, when Medicare becomes primary, you may enroll in one of the Medicare Advantage plans. You will need to send the SHBP a copy of the letter advising of Medicare eligibility.

The Qualified Beneficiary is entitled to elect to continue the same coverage that she or he had on the day before the qualifying event. When a Qualified Beneficiary has elected COBRA continuation c overage, that coverage can be extended due to a second qualifying event. The qualifying events are: Termination of the Member from employment with us, for any reason other than gross misconduct reduction of hours below the minimum hours required for eligib ility, or transfer to a position for which SHBP coverage is not offered; or Death of the Member; or Divorce from the Member; or Loss of eligibility by an Enrolled Dependent who is a child; or Entitlement of the Member to Medicare benefits; or The Plan S ponsor filing for bankruptcy, under Title XI, United States Code, on or after July 1, 1986, but only for a retired Member and his or her Enrolled Dependents.

SHBP will cover these medications under the pharmacy benefit at no cost to eligible SHBP members.

CIGNA expects ongoing clarification of the specific requirements of the PPACA legislati on, and their policies and coverage standards will evolve accordingly.
