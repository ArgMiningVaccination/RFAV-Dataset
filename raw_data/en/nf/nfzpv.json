A mucocele or oral mucous cyst is a tiny lump or cyst that develops in the mouth. This cyst on the bottom lip or the roof of the mouth can be painful, but home remedies for mucocele like honey and salt water can help. Lip biting is the leading cause of these cysts in most cases, but there can be a few other reasons for their growth. In this post, we talk about what drives mucoceles and how to identify and confirm if you have one. We also look at medicaland natural remedies for treating mucoceles. So, read on! In This Article Causes Of Mucocele Most mucoceles result from damage to the salivary ducts. This could be due to trauma or lip biting. Sometimes, we accidentally bite the inside of our cheeks. A mucocele can easily form at such a site ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4606697/)). This trauma to the lips can also be caused by misaligned teeth or a badly placed lip piercing that injures your salivary gland. Other factors, such as sports injuries or smoking, can also damage the soft oral tissues, leading to the development of mucous cysts in your mouth. When the mucocele forms under the tongue, on the floor of the mouth, it is known as a ranula ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5713871/)). This happens when the salivary glands present their experience blockage. According to a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560855/), the prevalence rate of mucocele is 2.4 cases per 1000 persons. It was also noted that the highest number of cases (70%) occur in those ranging from 3-20 years old. Ranulas are much less common, with a frequency of 0.2 cases per 1000 persons. They are usually found in teenagers and young adults. In the next section, we will discuss the symptoms of mucocele. Symptoms Of Mucocele The signs and symptoms depend on how deep within the skin the cyst lies. It also depends on where it occurs. Oral mucous cysts or mucoceles do not usually cause severe pain, but they cause discomfort. However, if they recur with time, they can become painful. Some of the common symptoms of cysts on the surface of the skin include ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5447343/)): - A raised bump or swelling. - Lesionsi [X]A condition in which the tissue inside or outside the body gets bigger due to a trauma or injury. Lesions can be cancerous. that are up to 1 cm in diameter. - Increased softness in the affected area. - A blue coloration of the skin surrounding the oral lesion in some cases. This cyst may feel mobile and less firm, while the overlying epitheliumi [X]A layer of cells that live in body cavities and line hollow organs. Their function is to protect, absorb, secret, and filtrate in the body. looks intact. In cases with a deeper cyst, it may appear more rounded and have a whitish appearance. These cases require immediate medical attention. You will mostly be asked to undergo surgical removal of the cyst in this case. When To See A Doctor If you observe any signs and symptoms as mentioned above, you should consult your doctor. This will help you rule out the possibility of any severe conditions that may lead to the development of an oral cyst. If you feel that the cyst is growing larger than 1 cm in diameter, you must seek immediate medical help. Usually, a mucous cyst can be identified during a regular visit to your dentist. In most cases, your dentist will allow the cyst to resolve on its own. However, if the cyst persists for longer than 2 months, you must consult your doctor again. Diagnosis Of Mucocele [Dr. Katrina Zhao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrina-zhao-620399a1/), a dentist, says, \"There is no quick way to get rid of mucoceles. Depending on its size and location, it can go away without treatment, but that takes around 3-6 weeks.\" She adds, \"The quickest and best course of action is to have your dentist or doctor remove it for you. This will ensure that the salivary gland heals faster. This usually reduces the healing time to about 2-4 weeks.\" The standard procedure for diagnosing a mucocele involves your doctor asking you about a history of trauma to your lips, such as the history of lip biting. This helps them make an accurate diagnosis. Sometimes, your doctor may ask for a sample to be taken for further tests. A sample of a small tissue may be sent for a biopsy to rule out any forms of cancer. According to Dr. Zhao, \"Mucoceles are not cancerous. But if you notice any bumps or swelling in your mouth, it's best to seek the advice of your dentist or doctor. They will be able to confirm if it's a mucocele and, alternatively, recommend a biopsy to determine if it's something else.\" Typically, doctors may require a biopsy if the cyst looks larger than 2 cm in diameter, development of the cyst has taken place with no history of trauma or lip biting, or if the appearance of the cyst suggests adenomai [X]A noncancerous tumor that often starts to grow in the tissues which cover glands and organs. or lipomai [X]A fatty lump located just below the skin which continues to grow but is usually harmless. Only in rare cases, it is cancerous. . Medical treatment of the mucocele depends on the severity of the cyst that has developed. If you have a superficial cyst (not too deep), the chances are that it may resolve on its own. However, if the cyst is deep and occurs frequently, it may need immediate medical attention. Medical Treatment For Mucoceles Oral mucocele treatments include: - Laser Therapy This treatment involves the use of a small, directed beam of light from a laser diode to remove the cyst ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5209594/)). The laser diode is used for the excision of the mucous cyst. This procedure involves the use of a beam of laser with the appropriate wavelength and absorption coefficient. This helps to eliminate the cyst and treat the target soft tissue with precision. The advantages of this method include minimal discomfort while the process is carried out, less bleeding, better compliance among patients, and lesser chances of recurrence. Lasers have also been seen to cause lesser injury or trauma to the affected area and allow faster recovery. - Cryotherapy This treatment involves the destruction of the cyst by the application of extreme cold to the affected tissues ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4190797/)). The process emphasizes the rapid application of extreme cold, slow thawing, and repeating the rapid cooling process. This helps maximize the process of destroying the affected soft tissue. The advantage of this process is that it causes less discomfort and bleeding and lesser complications, such as hemorrhagei [X]It occurs when damaged or injured blood vessels start to bleed. It could be from a minor injury or a major bleeding in the brain. , infection, and scarring after treatment. It may also be repeated with no permanent side effects and can be suggested to patients for whom surgery has been contraindicated due to their age or medical history. The disadvantage of this process is that it causes necrosisi [X]It occurs when very little amount of blood flows to the tissues due to an injury, radiation or chemicals, causing them to eventually die. and sloughing along with the treatment. Other disadvantages of cryotherapy include an unpredictable degree of swelling and not being able to determine the exact depth and area of freezing. - Intralesional Corticosteroid Injection This treatment injects steroids into the cyst. Corticosteroid is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that can reduce swelling by shrinking the dilated salivary ducts ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5086369/)). As the term suggests, this process involves the injection of a sclerosing agenti [X]A type of medication to treat enlarged veins, lymphatic malformation and inflammations in the body. or corticosteroid in the lesion. This enables the drainage of the cyst, which, in turn, reduces its size. The benefit of this method is that it can help increase the concentration of the drug used at the site of the cyst. This reduces the complications that can arise as a result of the systemic absorption of corticosteroids. The disadvantage of this procedure is the discomfort that arises if the injection method is not correct. It can cause some pain, and the process may lead to mucosal atrophyi [X]A condition in which appropriate glands are damaged by inflammation and are replaced by either metaplasia or scarring. oral mucosa atrophy as a side effect. If your doctor suspects recurrence in case of severe cysts, you might be asked to go in for surgical removal of the cyst. Besides having the cysts removed by medical methods and if the cyst is not very severe, you may opt for home remedies to manage the symptoms.
