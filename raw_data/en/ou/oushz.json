[Peri-Menopause](https://www.drbatras.com/perimenopause-what-age-does-it-start-what-are-symptoms) is just the opposite of puberty. In puberty your ovaries are waking up to start your reproductive years and in Peri-Menopause the ovaries start to shut down causing a decline in female hormone progesterone and increase of oestrogen. Oestrogen increase can prevent the thyroid hormone from getting to where it needs to go and can prevent it from getting converted into its active form. High oestrogen also affects the immune system. As oestrogen is the dominant sex hormone in women, this explains why autoimmunity and thyroid disease is more common in women. Homoeopathy Homoeopathic remedies work by stimulating the body's own healing capacity by encouraging the body to reactivate hormone secretions. Homoeopathy is a mind-body medicine. Homoeopathy treats not only the physical complaints, but also targets the mind and gently restores mind-body equilibrium- thus it treats the patient as a whole. If a patient is taking conventional medicine for hypothyroid, they can continue taking the medicine with homoeopathic medicine. Homoeopathy helps to produce thyroid hormone naturally by stimulating the immune system and helps in better functioning of the thyroid gland. Homeopathy is free from any side-effects. Homoeopathic medicines have wonderful results in cases of sleeplessness and are above all non-addictive. Stress causes hormonal disturbances in the body like thyroid problems s and is very effectively treated with homeopathy. Slowly and steadily when the thyroid hormones come to normalcy the conventional medicine can be tapered off and the person can continue with homoeopathy to avoid recurrence. Useful Tips to Enter a Happy Menopause Keep a regular check and record of your thyroid hormones through blood test. This helps to monitor and regulate the dose of medicine change if required. A gluten free diet would be of great help especially if you are a case of autoimmune thyroiditis/ Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. Gluten resembles thyroid tissues. If you suffer from a leaky gut your body may mistakenly attack your thyroid believing it is attacking gluten molecules. This would cause the thyroid to remain underactive even after taking hormonal supplementations. Make sure you are taking a high quality multivitamin with iodine, zinc, selenium, iron, vitamin D and B12. Get at least 8 to 10 hours of sleep. Sleep is very essential to facilitate the repair and regeneration process of the body. You need to take extra care if you suffer from a leaky gut. A proper functioning digestive system is critical to good health. Avoid refined vegetable oils including soybean, corn, sunflower and canola. Prefer eating coconut oil. It helps to reduce brain fog and enhance your cognitive performance. Get enough Vitamin A and Vitamin D as they are very critical for optimal thyroid and brain function. Cod liver oil capsules are a great option as it contains Vitamin a, Vitamin D and omega 3 fatty acids all together but under the guidance of your doctor. Reduce stress levels. High levels of physical and mental stress can be detrimental to your thyroid function. This is the reason it is critical that you manage stress, massage, acupressure, meditation and yoga would be of great help. "}
