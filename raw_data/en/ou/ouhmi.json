Rice husk is one of them, and its global production is approximately 140 million tons, annually. In the majority of cases much of the husk produced from the processing of rice is either burnt or dumped as a waste. In the present work, an attempt has been made to synthesize activated carbon (RHACs) from Rice Husk via KOH and K2CO3 chemical activation. Activated Carbon is a potential electrode material of supercapacitor for energy storage applications. Supercapacitors can deliver high power and reasonable energy densities with both electrostatically and electrochemically as compared to batteries. Rice Husk was initially physically activated at temperature 300\u00b0C and 600\u00b0C in a furnace with a holding time of 1hr and the carbonized material thus obtained was soaked in 1M KOH and K2CO3, in 1:1 ratio for overnight and was followed physical activation at 300\u00b0C for 2hrs in a furnace. Activated Carbon thus obtained were characterized by x-ray diffraction method in order to know the presence of amorphous carbon, scanning electron microscopy to know the pore formation, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses in order to identify the appearance and disappearance of functional groups during different activation temperatures and finally the cyclic voltammetry analysis was done to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the activated carbon material. The K2CO3 - activated sample showed higher yield and better pore structures as compared to KOH-activated sample. XRD showed the presence of amorphous carbon at a diffraction peak 2theta equals to 26.2\u00b0and finally CV curves exhibit capacitive behavior showing nearly rectangular shape for different scan rates 50mV/s, 25mV/s, 20mV/s, 10mV/s, 5mV/s. Keywords: Rice activation, FTIR, Cyclic Voltammetry.

Physics Department, City College of the City, University of New York, USA We compute the photoemission intensity and polarization for the surface states electrons in topological insulators and Weyl semimetals. The number of emitted photoelectrons is sensitive to the intensity of the laser intensity, whereas the polarization of the photoelectrons is sensitive to the chirality and topology of the surface electrons. We investigate the effect of the Zeeman field and warping. For the Weyl materials we demonstrate the existence of the Fermi arcs which connect the opposite Weyl nodes. In the presence of a magnetic field the effect of the EB field gives rise to the chiral anomaly which is observed as a change of the chemical potential, resulting in an enhancement of the intensity in the vicinity of one of the Weyl nodes.

The adsorption tests were performed at different parameters. The optimized pH and time were found to be 7 and 40 min, respectively. The equilibrium adsorption data were demonstrated using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and better agreement was attained with the Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption capacity was calculated 435 mg g-1 using Langmuir equation. The kinetic parameters displayed that MG adsorption onto Fe3O4-TSC followed pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The thermodynamic parameters were evaluated and it was found that adsorption of MG onto Fe3O4-TSC was spontaneous and exothermic. The desorption studies showed the best recovery of MG dye in 0.1 M HCl. Finally, it was found that Fe3O4-TSC can be effortlessly separated from mixed solutions using external magnetic field. National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (NIGEB), Iran Alpha1-antitrypsin (1AT) inhibits a broad range of proteases and protects the lung from neutrophil elastase during inflammation or infection. This inhibitor is an acute phase protein, the plasma concentration of which increases manyfold upon inflammation. The absence or inefficient function of 1AT in the lungs leads to uncontrolled function of elastase and elastin breakdown, resulting in respiratory problems such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and emphysema. Association between 1AT and a number of diseases including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, anterior uveitis and systemic lupus erythematosus suggests that 1AT is not only an anti-inflammatory protein but also an immune system regulator. Besides, researchers have shown that the protease-antiprotease imbalance is an important factor in the pathogenesis of COPD and other pulmonary diseases, such as bronchitis. COPD is one of the most important causes of irreversible lung damage and thus the fourth most common cause of death in the U.S. In this process, exogenous proteolytic enzymes lead to lung damage. Besides different physiological roles of 1AT including the control of insulin secretion, antiprotease activity, protecting -cells against cytokine-induced apoptosis, acting as an anti-inflammation compound, it is also regarded as an antiapoptotic factor in lung epithelial cells. Therefore, only with appropriate and adequate concentrations of 1AT the lungs' correct function can be maintained. One of the treatment strategies for optimum activity of 1AT during inflammation is replacement therapy using intravenous infusion (Prolastin, Zemaira, Aralast and Glassia). In the infusion form, only 10%-15% of 1AT reaches the target organ. Another possible treatment strategy is through airway delivery. In this form of treatment not only the aerosolized 1AT directly reaches the target organ, but also prevents the accumulation of excess drug in the blood, therefore, a much lower level of drug is required. The pulmonary drug delivery strategies for protein and peptide-based medicines are based on using particles with a lipid origin (liposomes) and polymeric particles (PLGA, Chitosan). 1AT involves being internalized by endothelial cells mostly by the process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In the case of particle uptake, clathrin-coated pits expand and enclose particles of around 200 nm. In addition, particles with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 0.1m are able to reach the deepest regions of the lung, the alveoli. Therefore my research focused on PLGA nanoparticles for engineered 1AT for targeted delivery to the lung. Engineered 1AT was newly constructed through fermentation in yeast and purified using a novel technique. Subsequently, PLGA nanoparticles incorporating 1AT were synthesized and characterized for targeted delivery to the lung. Different nanoparticles were prepared and nebulized for the rabbit lung perfusion experiment.

Therefore several methods for the assessment such exposure in different workplaces are essential. Needle trap technique is one extraction method that was developed and in this research have been used with nano sorbent to extraction toluene from aquatic samples. Methods: In this study, sorbents based on carbon nanotubes were was synthesized by sol-gel method. Needles were packed with synthesized nano sorbent and extraction of toluene in headspace was done with dynamic headspace needle trap technique. For Analysis of collection samples gas chromatography- flame ionization detector was used. Results: Results showed that repeatability in the extraction of toluene in aquatic sampls with synthesized nano sorbent and NTD was 9% in optimum extraction about temperature and time extraction(50\u00b0c and 30 min). Conclusion: Using needle trap devices that were packed with synthesized nano sorbent has high efficiency in extraction small amounts of toluene in aquatic samples. The use of synthesized sorbent based on carbon nanotubes reduces the cost of using the expensive commercial sorbents. This technique has good reproducibility, is relatively simple and minimize need of toxic solvents.

China The development of energy storage has become a key issue due to both energy security concerns and the environmental issues associated with traditional energy sources such as fossil fuels. Significant advances in electrical energy storage technologies such as supercapacitors and batteries are required because all most all renewable energy sources are intermittent and high energy and power densities are needed to power electric vehicles. Though important improvements in energy storage technologies have been achieved, significant challenges in high energy, high power storage remain limited the widespread adoption of many renewable energy sources. Transformational improvements in these technologies require a molecular-level understanding of energy storage mechanisms in supercapacitors and batteries. In this talk, we would like to present our recent studies on the dynamics of room-temperature ionic liquids in nanopores ofcarbon supercapacitors. Biography: Dr. Suresh M.

Joint Department of Electrochemical Energy Systems, Ukraine Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are now commonly used as power supplies of various purposes, from consumer electronics to hybrid and electric vehicles. In automotive applications, high power densities of lithium-ion batteries are of great value enabling one to ensure the starting acceleration. The power density is significantly governed by the diffusion of lithium ions into (and within) the grains of an electrode material. It is therefore considered that obtaining electrode materials in a nanosized form may allow for attaining greater charge/discharge rates than in the case of the electrode materials of a large particle size. However, the dependence of the power density on the particle size is not convincingly justified yet. The high-rate capabilities of electrode materials for LIBs are reviewed and analyzed. Theoretical predictions of the limiting discharge rates of LIBs are made in terms of the Frenkel kinetic theory. The unexpected definition of an ideal electrode material is suggested: it should consist of nonaggregated, nanosized, perfect single crystals, and a balance between high rate properties and capacities should be determined not only by the size of crystals but also by their perfectness and ability to aggregation. It is stressed that the known values of the lithium ion diffusion in a perfect single crystal ensure the full discharge time of a battery of ca. 0.2 s. This means that nanodimensionality itself cannot be a prerequisite of high-rate properties of electrode materials, as their perfectness is a key value for attaining high discharge rates.

Odessa National Academy of Food Technologies, Department of Physics and Materials Science, Ukraine We have applied the recent methodology of a congruent vapor-liquid (CVL) phase diagram to the study of fullerenes C60, C70 and alkali metals: Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs in the wide temperature range from about zero up to the critical points of latters. The striking asymmetry revealed in the restricted range of standard VLE-diagram for fullerenes distinguishes the results of the present work from those obtained by the conventional GEMC-technique. The similar CVL-reconstruction for alkali metals leads to its evident anomaly observable in the entire range of subcritical temperatures including the states of a condensed (metastable liquid and solid) phase. The possible intercalation of alkali atoms existing in the low-temperature metastable vapor into the crystal lattice interstitial sites of fullerites is confirmed by the superposition of two respective CVL-diagrams.

Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, University of Hail, Saudi Arabia In this study, the results on the design and application of three-structurally related thiodiglycolamides (TDGA) derivatives are presented. The extraction behavior of these new extractants towards selected Platinum-Group and Base Metal Ions from nitric acid medium was studied. The structure reactivity relationship with extraction of investigated metal ions is studied. These extractants showed great extractability and selectivity for palladium than the other investigated metal ions. Pd(II) was found to be easily separated from other investigated metal ions in a single extraction step. A systematic investigation has been carried out. The overall data already achieved suggest that TDGA is good extractantas for palladium and may be candidates for further evolution using real solutions resulting from recycling processes. 1UNESCO-UNISA Africa Chair in Nanosciences-Nanotechnology, College of Graduate Studies, University of South Africa, South Africa 2Nanosciences African Network (NANOAFNET), iThemba LABS-National Research Foundation, South Africa Nowadays, the development of efficient green chemistry methods for synthesis of metal oxides nanoparticles has become a major focus of researchers.

Department of New Drug Development, Inha University, Republic of Korea Research: In this study, we demonstrated that the injection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PLGA/pSMAMPs were prepared with a capillaryfocused microfluidic device. Results: The particle size, observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), was around 22\u00b1 3m. MT1-MMP-responsive peptide and doxorubicin (DOX) were chemically conjugated with pSMA segments on the shell of MPs to form a PLGA/ pSMA-peptide-DOX complex, resulting in high encapsulation efficiency (91.1 %) and loading content (2.9 %). DOX was released from PLGA/ pSMA-peptide-DOX MPs in a pH-dependent manner (~25 % at pH 5.4 and ~8 % at pH 7.4) and accumulated significantly in an MT1-MMP-over-expressing Hep3B cell line. Anin vivo intrahepatic injection study showed localization of MPs on the hepatic vessels and hepatic lobes up to 24 hrs after the injection without any shunting to the lung. Moreover, MPs efficiently inhibited tumor growth of Hep3B hepatic tumor xenografted mouse models. Conclusion: Size-controlled PLGA/pSMA core-shell MPs were successfully produced by using a microfluidic technique. Synthesized MPs were conjugated with DOX, and the MT1-MMP-targeting peptide was introduced as a linker molecule between DOX and MPs to enhance tumor targeting. These MPs showed pH-sensitive sustained drug release for one month. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo release studies of MPs demonstrated that DOX released from PLGA/pSMA-peptide-DOX MPs has more efficient cellular entry into Hep3B cells and improved tumor suppression compared to PLGA/pSMADOXMPs. These results suggest that this material can be deployable as a potential candidate for TACE therapy for HCC.

University of medical science and technology Gold nanoparticles in chemotherapy is the use of colloidal gold in therapeutic treatments, often for cancer or arthritis. Gold nanoparticle technology shows promise in the advancement of cancer treatments. With tumor-targeting delivery vectors becoming smaller, the ability to by-pass the natural barriers and obstacles of the body becomes more probable. To increase specificity and likelihood of drug delivery, tumor specific ligands may be grafted onto the particles to circulate throughout the tumor without being redistributed into the body, Gold nanoparticles can absorb infrared light, resulting in heating and Removes carcinogenic cells in tumors. Gold nanoparticles have also been used for enhancing the X-ray dose to tumors. The combination of body temperature and radiotherapy is interactive, importantly allowing a reduction in X-ray dose with improved therapeutic results. Here we intratumorally infused small 15 nm gold nanoparticles engineered to be transformed from infrared-transparent to infrared-absorptive by the tumor, then heated by infrared followed by X-ray treatment. Synergy was studied using a very radio resistant subcutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in mice. It was found that the dose required to control 50% of the tumors, normally 50 Gy, could be reduced to < 10 Gy (a factor of > 3.5). Gold nanoparticles therefore provide a method to combine body temperature and radiotherapy to drastically reduce the X-ray radiation needed, thus sparing normal tissue, reducing side effects, and making radiotherapy more effective.

Because of the increasing application of pesticides, there is a need for their environmental and biological monitoring to assess the environmental pollution, occupational exposures, and public exposure due to domestic and urban usage of these compounds. Sensors, as the miniaturized instruments, are the appropriate and interested devices to monitor the trace pesticides. The aim of this study was investigation the effect of applying multi-walls carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) to modify the composition of carbon paste electrode. The MIPs were synthesized for diazinon and dicloran pesticides and then, they were used in the carbon paste composition in combination with MWCNTs. After optimization of electrode composition, it was used to determine the concentration of analyte. Instrumental parameters affecting the square wave voltammetric response were adjusted to obtain the highest current intensity. The modified electrode showed very high recognition ability compared to bare carbon paste electrode. The detection limits of the sensors were 1.3\u00d710-10 and 4.8\u00d710-10 mol L-1 for diazinon and dicloran, respectively. These sensors were used to determine diazinon and dicloran in real samples (human urine, tap, and river water samples) without special sample pre-treatment before analysis. The MWCNTs enhance the sensor responses due to increasing of the electrode surface area, as well as improving the electron transfer between the electrode and the supporting electrolyte. The presence of MIPs can greatly increase the selectivity of the electrode. The optimization of electrode composition improved its response considerably.
