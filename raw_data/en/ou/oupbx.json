Here are some of the frequently asked questions and their answers. Whether you're new to our products or have been taking our supplements for years, there is always something new to learn. How to Make the Most of Your Supplements Maharishi AyurVeda supplements contain high-quality herbs that are combined into potent formulas to address the underlying imbalance in the physiology, without causing side effects. Instead of just addressing the surface level, these formulations aim to enliven balance in the physiology and target the root cause of the issue. In Maharishi AyurVeda, we consider symptoms to be like the fruits of a tree. In most cases, there is a common root. There are primary and secondary imbalances. AyurVeda tries to address the primary imbalance first. Addressing the secondary imbalances might help, but that is only a partial approach. To take the guesswork out of the problem, see a Maharishi AyurVeda expert (vaidya) who can determine the root cause of the issue, and address all of your imbalances. Once you meet with an ayurvedic expert, he or she can explain which foods and lifestyle habits are contributing to your imbalance. By knowing the root causes, you can work towards creating balance. As part of your wellness consultation with an ayurvedic expert, you'll receive recommendations that are designed for your body type, imbalances, and age\u2014and which take into account the current season and even the time of day. If you can follow the recommended diet and daily routine, and at the same time avoid the underlying causal factors (i.e. foods and lifestyle habits that aggravate your imbalance), over time, balance will be restored. When your mind, body and emotions are functioning in balance, you will have no need for herbal formulas! Digestion is also a key factor in restoring balance and strengthening immunity. Thus in most cases, the ayurvedic expert will make recommendations for strengthening digestion. Once these functions are restored, the body begins to function in a more balanced way. Focusing on one or two imbalances at a time is best. Start with those imbalances that are the most noticeable. Sometimes, you may find that in addressing those, some secondary imbalances get addressed as well. That depends on what you are taking. [Amrit Kalash](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/amrit-kalash-ambrosia)and [Organic Amla Berry](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/organic-premium-amla-berry-120-tablets)are rasayanas\u2014nutritional formulas that balance all the three doshas. You can take these with any other herbs. Other supplements have stronger, targeted therapeutic effects: for example, [Elim-Tox](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/elim-tox)or [Worry Free](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/worry-free), which balance specific doshas and subdoshas or support detoxification. These you shouldn't overdo. They are very powerful, and too many of them can overstimulate your physiology. As a general rule, don't take more than four formulas at a time in addition to Amrit Kalash. In addition, it is not always wise to take certain supplements simultaneously, because they may have overlapping benefits\u2014for example, [Elim-Tox](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/elim-tox)and [Radiant Skin](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/radiant-skin). It might [Bio-Immune](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/bio-immune), [Sniffle Free](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/sniffle-free)and [Cold Weather Defense](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/cold-weather-defense)all at once to address immunity quickly. However, you shouldn't take more than two products that address the same, related issues without first consulting an ayurvedic expert. Maharishi AyurVeda formulas are designed to take care of several aspects of the same condition, so taking more will not necessarily increase their effectiveness. As far as dosage (i.e. the number of tablets to take at a time), you can follow the recommendations on the bottle. According to Maharishi AyurVeda, the dosage needed to correct an imbalance depends on the strength of the patient and the severity of the imbalance. This is best evaluated by an expert trained in Maharishi Ayurveda. For herbal formulas that are designed for addressing a health issue before it manifests, such as [Bio-Immune](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/bio-immune)and [Aller-Defense](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/aller-defense), it's best to take them regularly for two to three months. For herbal formulas that are designed to restore balance, such as [Clear Throat](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/clear-throat-8-fluid-oz-240-ml), [BP Balance](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/bp-balance), and [Mind Plus](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/mind-plus), it's best to take them until the imbalance has been addressed. Once balance is restored, you can continue for at least two weeks longer to be sure the body has adjusted to the new state of balance. For detoxifying herbal formulas, such as [Elim-Tox](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/elim-tox), [Elim-Tox-O](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/elim-tox-o), and [Herbal Cleanse](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/herbal-cleanse), it's best to use them according to the [guidelines](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/blogs/articles/ayurvedic-detox-internal-cleansing-101)given. For certain ongoing issues, it may be helpful to take the supplement on a regular basis to enjoy balance. [Cholesterol Protection](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/cholesterol-protection), for example, addresses ama (digestive toxins) in the fat tissue. When ama accumulates in the fat tissue, it manifests as cholesterol. Even if cholesterol levels are within a normal range, you should continue taking Cholesterol Protection for ongoing support. You can follow the instructions on the bottle. But there is some flexibility\u2014if those times don't work for you, then take them at your convenience. The main point is to take the herbal formulas regularly\u2014for that is how the results come. Since you use your body's systems and organs every day, they need constant support until the imbalance is addressed. Add supplements into your daily routine, and if you tend to forget to take them, devise ways to remind yourself. Create reminders in your cell phone or put post-it notes on your computer. Keep your supplements on your dining table instead of in the cupboard. Carry them with you in a tablet dispenser. You can facilitate the balancing process by also adjusting your diet and routine. If you are taking Maharishi AyurVeda herbal formulations provide a very powerful way to address imbalances and restore balance and well-being for a long, healthy life. By taking the right amount at the right time, and by adjusting your diet, you can greatly enhance their benefits. [Protection Plus Sinuses](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/protection-plus-sinuses), for instance, you should also reduce heavy food, greasy food, fast foods, cold foods and drinks, and favor cooked warm meals that are easy to digest. Maharishi AyurVeda herbal formulations provide a very powerful way to address imbalances and restore balance and well-being for a long, healthy life. By taking the right amount at the right time, and by adjusting your diet, you can greatly enhance their benefits. Our tablets can be cut in half using a pill cutter. Alternatively, tablets can be ground into powder and mixed with raw unheated honey, applesauce or maple syrup. Our products are most effective when used prior to their best before date. Per our vaidyas (Ayurvedic experts), products can be used up to a year past their best before date, but they may not be as effective as fresh product. Specific Ingredient Concerns You may notice that some of our products contain up to 99.5% organic ingredients, but do not feature the USDA organic seal on the packaging. Why is this? In order to certify a product as USDA organic, any non-organic ingredients in the product, no matter how small a percentage of the formula, must be on an approved list from the USDA National Organic Program (NOP). All of our formulas contain exotic, ayurvedic ingredients. Since many of these exotic herbs are not yet on the NOP approved list, the entire formula cannot be certified as USDA organic even though the formula may contain almost 100% organic plants. It can take many years to petition to add new ingredients to the list and the outcome is uncertain. We don't compromise our formulas. We could remove the small percentage non-organic ingredients and easily obtain the seal, but we don't. Our herbal supplements are made according to the ancient ayurvedic texts, and we intend to continue making them using the same ingredients that have been used for thousands of years. This is our commitment to maintaining the effectiveness and the purity of the ayurvedic tradition. It is the only way to craft ayurvedic formulations that deliver maximum effect for mind and body. Where and when possible, we will continue to introduce organic ingredients. Why is this?

Even Flexcel, which contains barley, is gluten-free because the barley used by our manufacturer is incinerated down into ash, during which any gluten, if present, is completely destroyed. The processing of the barley ash is not done in the same area that the rest of the supplement products are made and bottled, and uses separate equipment. Therefore, none of the products come into contact with the barley, or any other gluten-containing ingredients. None of our products contain soy, and our manufacturing facility doesn't process any products containing soy. No, animals are not harmed while harversting our shell ingredients. It's part of the cycle of nature. Once the animal has vacated its shell, then we collect the shell, pearl or pearl oyster for use in our products. No killing is involved. We source calcium from areas that are not known to be polluted, and test the quality of calcium for heavy metals and pollutants before use. Once harvested, we use only the pure inner layer of calcium and remove the upper layer of calcium which has come into contact with the environment. This process has to be done by hand, but ensures that the calcium used is of the highest quality. It is then purified according to the ayurvedic texts. We process pearl, coral, conch and other shell ingredients using traditional ayurvedic methods that incinerate the minerals, converting them to a fine powder. During the incineration process, the allergen properties, if previously present, are destroyed. The process involves many steps of purifying the original materials. Because of the processing, a customer who is allergic to shellfish shouldn't have any issue using one of our products containing shell ingredients. But it is always best to be cautious and alert to any symptoms when first trying the product. To date we have had no negative feedback. All of our products are vegetarian. For a list of our vegan products, please click [here](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/collections/all-products/vegan). Licorice is a traditional herbal remedy with a lot of benefits in ayurveda. It has a rasayana (health-promoting) effect on the mind and body, and is also balancing to Vata and Pitta. It supports healthy immunity, is good for the eyes and complexion, nourishes the tissues, soothes the digestive tract and promotes circulation. In our synergistic formulas, we process our licorice in a particular way and use it in combination with other herbs that counterbalance any negative effect licorice could cause in the physiology (or to blood pressure) if taken by itself. The licorice used in our products is not deglycerized. However, if someone already has high blood pressure or is concerned about taking a product containing licorice, we recommend you monitor blood pressure when taking the product, and/or consult your health professional before using one of our licorice-containing products.

As part of the USDA organic guidelines, a product must not contain any GMO inputs/ingredients in order to carry the USDA organic seal. Yes, our supplier has confirmed that the organic palm oil in our organic tablet coating (Nutrapure) is sustainably sourced. The jatamansi we use is generally sourced by forest traders and can be considered wild-crafted. We are also working with the forest department and Network for Certification and Conservation of Forests (NCCF) in India to connect with tribes in forested areas to educate them about sustainable wild crafted harvesting to protect jatamansi and ensure a long-term supply of this ingredient. Babies & Children Ayurvedic experts (vaidyas) generally feel that such classical rasayanas as [Organic Triphala Rose](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/organic-digest-tone-triphala-plus)and [Organic Ashwagandha](https://maharishi-ayurveda-products.myshopify.com/products/organic-ashwagandha)are safe in these circumstances, and there is a long history of use.
