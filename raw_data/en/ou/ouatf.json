In the field of oncology immunotherapy it has saved thousands of lives and resulted in the Nobel Prize in Medicine.\" Said Thomas Ichim, Ph.D, Chief Scientific Officer, and Co-Founder of the Company. \"We believe that in using ImmCelz\u00ae and MyeloCelz, we are in the position to advance immunotherapy for treatment of degenerative conditions, an approach that we term \"Regenerative Immunotherapy\". This is a first-in-class therapeutic direction that leverages the specificity, amplification, and memory of the immune system in order to accelerate the body to restore its function.\" \"The unique thing about MyeloCelz, like ImmCelz\u00ae, is that the cellular product is personalized and the patient is receiving their own cells back into themselves. This not only significantly increases the safety of the procedure, but also conceptually may increase efficacy because the body's own cells know best how to interact with the body.\" Said Dr. Courtney Bartlett, Director of Clinical Development. \"Having recently joined the Scientific Advisory Board of the Company, I am astonished at the expedience, innovation, and productivity of the team assembled by Dr. Thomas Ichim, Chief Scientific Officer of the Company.\" Said Dr. Camillo Ricordi. \"MyeloCelz, which is a parallel immunotherapy approach to ImmCelz\u00ae, is another paradigm shifting product and to my knowledge, is covered by one of the most comprehensive patent applications in cell therapy.\" The Company's first regenerative immunotherapy product, ImmCelz\u00ae was demonstrated effective in numerous animal models of autoimmunity and is the subject of a filed and pending FDA IND for use in stroke. ImmCelz\u00ae was featured at the international stem cell conference, The World Stem Cell Summit, with the presentation available at this link \"I am grateful for our team of scientific advisors and collaborators, who have worked diligently and ingeniously to develop a cellular therapy that leverages aspects of the innate immune system in stimulating the body to heal itself naturally. The addition of MyeloCelz to our Regenerative Immunotherapy portfolio, which includes ImmCelz\u00ae and multiple patent filings on the treatment of specific indications, clearly demonstrates our dedication to the immunotherapy space.\" Said Timothy Warbington, President and CEO of the Company.
