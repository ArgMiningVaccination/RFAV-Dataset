It's hot outside and inside too. Sweltering summer days don't just make the environment uncomfortable; they also tend to raise your body temperature. One of the most common problems associated with staying outdoors for too long is catching a heat stroke. According to Dr. Simran Saini, Nutritionist, \"Heat exhaustion is a temporary phase where your body is overloaded with heat, but a heat stroke is a more serious condition. It is caused due to prolonged exposure to high temperatures which may overheat your body and raise its temperature more than the normal body temperature which is 37 degree Celsius. If your body temperature rises above 40 degree Celsius it can even damage your vital organs.\" Simply put, your body tends to absorb more heat than what it can handle.
