Acupuncture, herbs and non-needling therapies can all be effective at relieving acute symptoms, getting to the root of why you are sick and preventing the recurrence. While we understand if you feel lousy, you may not want to come in, we are also happy to have you come in when you are under the weather so we can offer relief. Here are some conditions we can help with: Acute: Common cold, cough, sore throat, stomach flu and food poisoning. Chronic and Auto Immune Disorders: Recurrence of common colds, asthma, seasonal allergies, environmental allergies. Stress Stress is a fact of life. It is said that stress is essential to our survival and even helps us thrive. While this may be true, the quantity and quality of stress can often take a toll on us physically if it's beyond what we can reasonable manage. Regardless of what you are seeking treatment for, we will always ask into your stress levels, your emotions and how you think stress and emotions physically manifest in your body. We treat the manifestations by soothing and calming your nervous system and we go to the root by building up your internal resources so that you can healthfully manage stress. Here are just a sampling of conditions caused by excess stress that can be helped with our therapies. Headaches and migraines Insomnia Jaw pain (TMD) Neck, shoulder and back tension and pain Fatigue Digestive upset including reflux, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea Premenstrual syndrome Mood Swings Hot flashes Infertility Addictive behaviors Transitions and work or life cycle changes: loss and grief, stress, burn-out, weakened immune system, fatigue and body pain Women's Health Having a female body doesn't mean you have to suffer when you go through a life change such as menopause or or even a cycle change from one month to the next. Traditional East Asian Medicine can offer relief and balance when your status quo is pain and suffering. TEAM philosophy also has much to offer us in reminding us to honor these changes and cycles in the female body and not simply try to ignore these rites of passage. In addition to lifestyle recommendations, a combination of Chinese herbs and acupuncture are beneficial for bringing a female's body back into balance. Conditions we can help with: PMS, breast pain, challenging menses, menstrual irregularities, PCOS, menopause, nightsweats, hot flashes, prenatal and post partum care, morning sickness. Men's Health Male reproductive and genitourinary health goes through many changes associated with maturing. When there are imbalances in these systems, Traditional East Asian Medicine can offer many healing tools to rebalance and improve function and decrease pain. Conditions we can help with: Pelvic floor pain, erectile dysfunction, impotence, hormonal imbalance, urinary incontinence and musculoskeletal imbalances that men are prone to having. Digestive & Urinary Concerns Digestive and urinary health are critically important to our health and well being. Even if you are not suffering from any of the following imbalances, as a Traditional East Asian Medicine practitioner I believe it's important to assess the health of both of these systems and be sure they are working properly. Conditions we can help with: constipation, diarrhea, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, nausea, bloating, gas, gastroparesis, vomiting, loss of appetite, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, dysentery, incontinence, bedwetting, frequent urination, nocturia, painful urination. Neurological Disorders The brain and spinal cord health are paramount to us feeling good in our body. Acupuncture can profoundly impact the health of the nervous system both by helping the nervous system to return to its relaxed state and also through rebalancing the nervous system when you have a specific neurological concern such as below. Conditions we can help with: Bell's Palsy, Parkinsons, post stroke sequellae, Herpes Simplex virus related neuropathy, radiculopathy, Cardiovascular Health Tending to the biomedical meaning of the heart and the cardiovascular system is important on so many levels. The heart is considered the ruler of the body in Traditional East Asian Medicine - responsible for pumping blood but also the ruler of our mental and emotional function. Conditions we can help with: chest pain, palpitations, insomnia, varicosities including hemorrhoids, poor circulation and cold extremities, post acute shock, heart and kidney disharmony.
