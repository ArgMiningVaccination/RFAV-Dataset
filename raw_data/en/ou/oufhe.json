Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a comprehensive medical art practiced for over 5000 years. At its core, its goal is to maintain the balance of \"Qi\" (energy) in the body and restore harmony among all the systems of the body. TCM emphasizes a holistic approach to treatment whereby the whole person is considered: aches, pains, feelings, fears, thoughts, and all. Wherever there is stagnation or discord in the mind, spirit, or body, there is a need for healing. Traditional Chinese medicine focuses on preventive health maintenance as well as the treatment of a variety of ailments through natural and holistic means.

Cupping Cupping is a deep-tissue healing method often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Cups are placed in strategic locations, often on specific acupuncture points, or directly on or around the site of pain. Cupping can help relieve muscle spasms and tension, as well as promote Qi and blood circulation and healing. This powerful tool has many applications including detoxification, inflammation, sports injury, headaches and more. Learn more about [The Ancient Art of Cupping](https://blog.arogya.net/the-ancient-art-of-cupping/) on our blog. Moxibustion Moxibustion is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves the burning of the herb moxa, or mugwort, to help move stagnant energy and increase circulation and lymphatic flow. This type of heat therapy can be an excellent remedy for people who have aches and pains caused by injury and arthritis. Moxibustion is often used concurrently with acupuncture and cupping. During a healing session with [Acupuncturist Gregor Bertram](https://www.arogya.net/acupuncture), he may use a technique called \"Indirect Moxibustion,\" where a cigar-shaped tube of moxa is lit and burned close to the acupuncture meridian. Learn more about [Moxibustion](https://blog.arogya.net/moxibustion/) on our blog. Tuina & Acupressure According to Chinese Medicine, there are energy channels throughout the body called meridians. Pressure is applied along these specific pathways, thereby increasing the functionality and circulation of the entire body. When these energies are in balance and blood circulation flows smoothly, health is restored. Tuina and Acupressure massage are helpful for relieving pain, stress, and tension, and improving the circulation of blood and Qi. Acupressure treatments at Arogya can be combined with reflexology and aromatherapy for a session that relaxes and reboots your entire system. Learn more about our complementary [bodywork treatments](https://www.arogya.net/massage-body-work). Wellness Consultation & QiGong Therapy We use Five-Element Theory to determine the strategy for balancing one's Qi, working to bring Yin and Yang into equilibrium. It can help to navigate the cause of ailments and imbalances using classical Chinese diagnostic methods, including observing the pulse and tongue and palpating the organs.
