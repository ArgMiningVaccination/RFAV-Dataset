If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn more. Amazon From melasma and stretch marks to an itchy growing belly, pregnancy tends to change your skin. A good body wash can help hydrate and nourish it, but just like you should avoid some foods and medications while pregnant, you should also refrain from using certain types of body wash and skincare products. Specifically, you should avoid body washes that contain retinol, retinoids, and salicylic acid, as they may harm your unborn baby. And although more research is needed to fully understand the effects of parabens and phthalates, studies have shown that they have the potential to disrupt hormones, harm reproductive organs, and affect birth outcomes\u2014so we recommend avoiding these, too. Another ingredient to be mindful of is cocamidopropyl betaine, an organic compound that comes from coconut oil and helps create foam to lift oil and grease. Although it's generally considered safe for most people, it has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis for some people due to impurities formed during the manufacturing process, says Lauren Penzi, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York. To prevent any potential irritation, make sure to rinse your body wash off entirely before leaving the bath or shower. That said, every body wash that we recommend in this article contains no retinol, retinoids, salicylic acid, parabens, or phthalates\u2014and when one does have cocamidopropyl betaine, we let you know upfront. To determine which body washes are best for pregnancy, we talked to dermatologists, researched scientific literature, and looked for products that include only pregnancy-safe ingredients. Our article and product list were also reviewed by a board-certified dermatologist on our Review Board, who verified the accuracy of our information and the safety of the ingredients in every body wash we recommend.

It contains three essential ceramides, which are the lipids (fats) that hold our skin cells together and keep our skin hydrated and healthy. Specifically, it contains ceramides 1, 3, and 6-11, which are known for healing dry skin. Dr. Penzi personally recommends it because it protects and maintains the skin barrier while cleansing and moisturizing the skin. Another benefit to this body wash is that it doesn't contain soap, fragrance, sulfates, phthalates, or parabens. It also has a Seal of Acceptance from the National Eczema Association, which means that it's undergone a rigorous ingredient review and testing for sensitivity, irritation, and toxicity. However, it does contain cocamidopropyl betaine, which can cause skin irritation if you don't rinse it off correctly or are allergic.

Despite being hypoallergenic, it's strong enough to remove up to 99% of bacteria. It's also phthalate- and sulfate-free and can hydrate your skin for up to 24 hours. Something to consider before using this body wash is that it has a light floral scent, which may be off-putting if you're particularly sensitive to smells while pregnant. Also, it contains cocamidopropyl betaine, which can cause irritation or an allergic reaction in some people.

Specifically, its secret ingredient is organic unrefined coconut oil, which is rich in antioxidants and is able to penetrate the skin quickly and efficiently. In turn, the coconut oil can help reduce itch and improve your skin's overall hydration and elasticity. However, this does make the body wash smell like coconut, which can be a pro or con depending on your taste. This body wash contains a variety of organic ingredients and no parabens, phthalates, synthetic fragrances, or sulfates. It's also a great deal: For $22, you'll get a giant 32-ounce bottle, which makes it nearly as affordable as our Best Budget pick, the Dove Beauty Instant Foaming Sensitive Skin Body Wash.

It's also free from parabens, phthalates, and formaldehyde-releasing ingredients. Instead, Honest uses amino acids and an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) naturally derived from apples. This body wash also contains glycolic acid and lactic acid, which are safe to use during pregnancy. Although its smell may not be the best, it's mild enough that you can use it morning and night on both your body and face.

The brand is certified as cruelty free by the Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics (also known as Leaping Bunny Certified), which means that its products and ingredients are never tested on animals and the company is subject to third-party audits. It also contains vitamins E and B5, which help keep your skin soft and smooth, and has a lavender scent reminiscent of a relaxing day at the spa. It's made without parabens, phthalates, and petrolatum, but it does contain cocamidopropyl betaine, which can cause irritation if you don't rinse it off correctly or are allergic to it.

This soap-free formula contains no dye, fragrance, lanolin, parabens, phthalates, or formaldehyde releasers. You also won't find any botanical extracts, cocamidopropyl betaine, sulfates, or gluten, making this body wash safe for adults and kids with sensitive skin. This oil-free body wash contains coco-glucoside, a cleansing agent formed when combining glucose and coconut oil. It's also pH balanced, meaning it won't strip your skin of its natural moisture, and it bears the Seal of Acceptance from the National Eczema Association. Dr. Penzi uses this body wash on her own children and recommends it to all her patients with sensitive, allergic, or eczema-prone skin, including those with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.

It has only nine ingredients, all of which are derived from coconut oil, salt, or food-grade acid. It contains no dyes, sulfates, parabens, or phthalates, and has a light coconut and vanilla scent. In addition to being all natural, this body wash is a great bargain. A 36-ounce bottle at Walmart costs just $14, making it one of the best values on our list. It even comes with a pump to make dispensing a breeze.

Its hypoallergenic and tear-free formula is even safe to use on your baby. However, it doesn't foam up very well, so you may inadvertently use more than you need to. This is likely because there's no sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) in it, which is primarily used to create foam. Another plus about this body wash is that it doubles as a shampoo, which makes it a great bargain. You also won't find any dyes, synthetic fragrances, parabens, phthalates, or formaldehyde donors, which are chemicals that slowly release formaldehyde to preserve a product's shelf life and can cause skin allergies.

Its unique gel formulation gently cleanses the skin without stripping it of moisture and is free from parabens and phthalates. In addition to aloe vera, this body wash contains olive oil to help the skin stay moist and hydrated. Olive oil is great for removing oily residue from the skin, and is especially effective at removing waterproof makeup. It's also a natural anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial agent, which can help with wound healing. All in all, this body wash is an excellent addition to your skincare routine and can even be used on your baby, too. Price at time of publication: $19 Key Specs:Fragrance: No | Key Ingredients: Olive oil, aloe vera | Size: 13.52 oz Best for Oily Skin La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Face Wash Amazon View On Amazon View On Target View On Laroche-posay.us Pros Controls oil and reduces acne Safe for sensitive skin No soap, sulfates, or fragrances Cons May require extra rinsing to remove from skin This oil-free, purifying cleanser transforms into a clarifying foam that effectively removes dirt, oil, and other impurities.

It's also free from sulfates, parabens, phthalates, and fragrance. A unique ingredient within this body wash is the prebiotic thermal spring water, which has been shown to improve dry skin and be therapeutic for atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. It also contains ceramide-3, which moisturizes the skin and improves its barrier. However, it does have a thicker texture than some of our other body washes, so it may require an extra rinse to completely remove it from your skin. Dr. Penzi uses this body wash on her face almost daily and recommends it for combination and oily skin. Price at time of publication: $17 Key Specs:Fragrance: No | Key water, niacinamide, ceramide-3 | Size: 13.52 oz How We Selected the Best Body Washes for Pregnancy To determine the best body washes for pregnancy, we sought guidance from Lauren Penzi, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology in New York. We also consulted with Tracey Woodruff, PhD, MPH, a scientist and professor at University of California, San Francisco, who studies the impact of harmful chemicals and pollutants on health, pregnancy, and child development. We then spent weeks learning about the various types of ingredients used in body washes and combed through various research studies and articles to determine which ingredients should not be used while pregnant. What to Look for in a Body Wash for Pregnancy Ingredients When it comes to choosing a body wash, the first thing you should do is look at its ingredients. \"My advice for pregnant women is 'less is more,'\" says Dr. Woodruff. \"Choosing products that have less ingredients in general will lower exposure to potentially harmful chemicals.\" With this in mind, we've compiled a list of body wash ingredients that may be helpful during pregnancy and those you should avoid. While this list is not comprehensive, it does highlight common ingredients that may be present in body wash. Ingredients That Are Safe to Use While pregnant, there are a variety of body wash ingredients you may benefit from using, including: Shea butter\u2014a moisturizing oil derived from shea nuts that has no known allergy risks Coconut oil\u2014an oil derived from coconuts that moisturizes and enhances the skin barrierOat extract\u2014a solvent derived from oats that alleviates dry, itchy skinAloe vera\u2014extract from the aloe plant that alleviates acne and burnsCeramides\u2014fats found in skin cells that help retain moisture, protect from environmental damage, and promote anti-aging Ingredients to Avoid While it's likely that your pre-pregnancy body wash is safe to use when you're pregnant, you should avoid the following ingredients as they pose serious risks for your unborn baby: Retinoids\u2014a skincare ingredient that helps reduce acne and wrinkles. Some types of retinoids, such as adapalene, may be safe to use during pregnancy, but this should be done under physician supervision. Retinol\u2014a type of retinoid used to improve skin tone, pigment, and texture The following ingredients have been associated with hormone disruption and adverse birth outcomes when used during pregnancy: Parabens\u2014chemicals that prevent the growth of bacteria and moldPhthalates\u2014chemicals used to make plastics more durable While not necessary for every pregnant person to avoid, you may want to discontinue use of the following if you're allergic or sensitive to it: Cocamidopropyl betaine (if allergic/sensitive)\u2014an organic compound that comes from coconut oil Fragrance Hyperosmia, or a heightened sense of smell, is a temporary side effect of pregnancy that occurs in two-thirds of women. To keep your scent-related aversions at bay, you may want to avoid body washes that contain artificial fragrances, which can also trigger adverse health effects like headaches. \"A good rule of thumb is to avoid products with fragrance, as that term often [means it's] hiding harmful chemicals,\" says Dr. Woodruff. She also recommends choosing products labeled \"fragrance-free\" instead of \"unscented,\" as the latter might include chemicals to cover various scents. Our Best Fragrance-Free pick, The Honest Company 2-in-1 Cleansing Shampoo + Body Wash, is a safe choice for those looking for a body wash that won't bother their skin (or nose). We also recommend La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser and Mustela Certified Organic Cleansing Gel since they're also fragrance-free. Skin Needs and Concerns From stretch marks and eczema to increased sensitivity, pregnancy has the potential to change your skin in many ways. One reason is your immune system, which works harder during pregnancy to protect you and your baby. As a result, your skin may undergo specific changes that may be unpleasant at times. Since your body needs more fluids during pregnancy, you may experience dehydration if you aren't drinking enough water. This can lead to dry, itchy skin and chapped lips. In addition to increasing your water consumption, opt for a hydrating body wash like our Best Overall pick, CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash. You could also try the Alba Botanica Very Emollient Coconut Rescue Body Wash to alleviate itchy skin and Aveeno Restorative Skin Therapy Soothing Body Wash to soothe rashes. Due to the increase of progesterone that happens during pregnancy, you may also experience hormonal acne. While reaching for your go-to acne products may be tempting, it's best to stick with a pregnancy-safe option like The Honest Company Mama's Gotta Glow Face & Body Wash. Frequently Asked Questions Should you change your body wash while pregnant? It depends. If the body wash you used before becoming pregnant doesn't contain any of the ingredients listed above, you can likely continue to use it while pregnant. Specifically, Dr. Woodruff recommends checking your body wash ingredients for phthalates, parabens, and bisphenol A (BPA). \"An excellent resource is the Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep Guide where you can learn more about what's in [your] products and what to avoid,\" she says. What ingredients should be avoided in pregnancy body wash? In addition to ingredients that you may be allergic or sensitive to (such as cocamidopropyl betaine), you should also avoid body washes that contain parabens, phthalates, retinols, and retinoids. See the list of pregnancy-safe ingredients in our What to Look For section above for more information. How much should I expect to spend on pregnancy-safe body wash? While body washes can vary in price, the products on our list range from $9-$22. Keep in mind that the size of a body wash should also be considered alongside price, as larger volume may be more cost-effective in the long run. For example, the Alba Botanica Very Emollient Coconut Rescue Body Wash costs $22 for a 32-ounce bottle, which makes it nearly as affordable as our Best Budget pick, Dove Beauty Instant Foaming Sensitive Skin Body Wash ($9 for 13.5 oz).
