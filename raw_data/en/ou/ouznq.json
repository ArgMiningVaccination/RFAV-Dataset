Helping those who need medical help but are without the necessary resources is not something we just talk about here! As the article below details, Advocate Health Care generously provides charitable care and services. Our dedication to meet the needs of our communities is evident in our actions and not simply in our words.Some of the help Advocate Trinity Hospital offers comes in the form of services, support groups and classes . . . most at no cost to the attendee. Several such classes and groups held here are built around managing depression or deal with a chronic illness that often leads to it. Certainly depression affects our community as frequently as others, but unfortunately many African-Americans are reluctant to seek help for depression. Unnoticed, they plod through day after day, week after week, living life behind a veil of sorrow.As a faith leader, you are in a position to notice depression in a congregant and to introduce options available through our hospital. Your words and your actions can be just the encouragement someone needs to take that rst step out of the darkness.I hope our special feature on depression opens your eyes and your heart to this disease and heightens your awareness of its presence in your world.Rev.

It knows no boundaries. Depression affects every age group and transcends gender, race, ethnicity and socio-economic group. Everyone goes through instances of feeling down or \"having the blues,\" but feelings like these that persist for long periods of time represent depression.Signs and symptomsThose closest to a person are often the rst to notice changes in a person's mood or behavior. Symptoms of depression are emotional, physical and mental. Many people living with depression go undiagnosed and untreated and may not even know its symptoms. While depression varies from person to person, there are some common signs and symptoms:Trouble sleeping or sleeping too muchLoss of interest in doing things you normally like to doFeelings of sadness that lingerUnexplained crying spellsLow energy or fatigueContinual feelings of low self worth, apathy or guiltPersistent irritabilityRestlessnessChanges in sleepDifculty concentrating or thinkingChanges in appetiteSignicant weight lossFeelings of hopelessness or worthlessnessThoughts of death, self-mutilation or even suicideThe stigma of depressionSocial and cultural stigma can keep people from talking about depression or seeking professional help for it. In many families and communities, it is viewed as a sign of weakness or as a personal defect. Some mistakenly think depression is a character flaw which a person ought to be able to control at will. Depression is the 14,000 pound elephant in the room no one wants to talk about. For many people, depression is their best-kept secret. They suffer alone and in silence. Individuals who battle depression frequently hide their condition for fear of being labeled as \"someone with issues\" or being called names.Depression and physical illnessTimes of illness tend to heighten symptoms in general, and those of depression are no exception. The ongoing stress associated with chronic health problems is believed to initiate changes in the brain's stress-response system that may set the stage for depression. The inability to do what we used to do can lead to a decline in mood and increase feelings of hopelessness and sadness. Persons with chronic illnesses such as arthritis, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, HIV/Aids, kidney disease, lupus and multiple sclerosis are at increased risk of being depressed. Undiagnosed and untreated depression can potentially worsen these illnesses, but depression is often overshadowed by the medical complications caused by these illnesses.Clergy and depressionFaith leaders seem more susceptible to depression. They deal with grief far more often than others, and when they are available to congregants every hour and every day, they have no real respite. Focusing on others more than themselves makes it easy to deny their condition and gives clergy an excuse for poor self-care habits such as lack of exercise, unhealthy or hasty eating and working to exhaustion. Each of these can be a precursor to depression.Good news The good news is that depression is a treatable health condition. There is even evidence that treating depression can help improve the health outcomes of persons with chronic illnesses. Dealing with Depression Depression is estimated to affect large segments of the American population. No group is exempt:10% of new mothers (postpartum)3% of children12% of teens15% of those with chronic illness30% of stroke survivors15% of adults over 65 Do you know a friend or family member who is depressed? Are you? Ask your physician for help. Most individuals living with depression can be treated with medication and/or therapeutic approaches, such as counseling and psychotherapy.

Benets continuedBody & Soul Conference - Sept. 10Rev. Bonnie CondonVP , Faith OutreachDear Faith Leader -We at Advocate Health Care recently received a wonderful honor:For the third consecutive year, Thomson Reuters named Advocate Health Care one of the nation's top 10 health systems. This recognition reflects well on everyone associated with our hospitals - our associates (employees), our physicians and our volunteers. Since Advocate Health Care is faith-based, I believe this is also significant for those of us who are faith leaders. For more than 100 years, Advocate and our predecessor organizations have cared for the health needs of people in our communities. We understand spirituality to be an important part of wellness and healing. We value the unique contributions faith communities make in transforming people's lives for health and wholeness.After reading the press release about the distinction Thomson Reuters has once again given Advocate, I felt moved to write to you, a faith leader. This award is in part a validation given to all of us who partner to make certain that the people we are privileged to serve are cared for - physically and spiritually. Thank you for being part of this.Faithfully,Bonnie CondonLink to the Advocate Health Care press release: http://www.advocatehealth.com/body.cfm?xyzpdqabc=0&id=12&action=detail&ref=89Link to the Thomson Reuters press release: www.100tophospitals.comRecreation as Therapy Prayer: Dear God, I am often busy and bogged down in work. Remind me to take the time to relax outdoors and enjoy all of your creation. Amen.The Value of Outdoor Recreation www.advocatehealth.comAmerican Canoe Association - americancanoe.orgNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation - nfwf.orgNational Park Service - nps.gov Leave No Trace - lnt.orgCorps Recreation Information - CorpsLakes.us National Recreation Reservation Service - recreation.govEnjoying outdoor recreation is comparatively rare today. Although Americans have 35 to 40 hours of free time each week, most of it is in small chunks and on weekdays. TV viewing takes up about half of all free time; staring at a variety of other screens adds to that. And if car travel is considered an indoor activity, we spend 95 percent of our lives inside!But humans evolved from a life of hunting and gathering on the plains of Africa. Our species hasn't had time to adapt to today's fatty diets, cars, articial light and heating. This mismatch between our bodies and our environment may account for many preventable illnesses, including some emotional diseases.There is ever-growing evidence that the outdoors is healthy: Nature positively affects blood pressure, cholesterol, outlook on life, stress and behavior problems of children. Pollution is often greater inside homes and ofces than outdoors. Obesity is a greater danger indoors since people are more likely to sit around watching TV and snacking.Our world has changed. Because the major causes of death have shifted from disaster (starvation, war) and contagious disease (smallpox, malaria) to decay (heart disease, cancer), individual behaviors play an increasingly important role in both longevity and quality of life. Spending time outdoors is a choice that is rewarding in so many ways, and summer is the perfect time to get back to nature and enjoy its beauty.Nature heals. Spending time at a lake, in a park, on a horse, watching birds, walking in a forest - these recreations truly do re-create us. They give us new perspective on life as they put us in touch with the power and beauty of nature.Humans simply feel better after spending time outdoors, but doing so is far less prevalent today. For many of this generation's children, vigorous outdoor fun has been replaced by sedentary, indoor videophilia (the love of playing video games, surng the Internet and watching movies and TV). To capture the consequences of not being outdoors, the phrase nature decit disorder was coined. It can result in diminished use of the senses, attention difculties and higher rates of both physical and emotional illnesses. The natural cure is simple - outdoor recreation.Recognition of the benets of enjoying nature led to the development of a new eld. Therapeutic recreation focuses on providing recreational services for people with disabilities. Its goal is to maintain the highest quality of life and function. Through August 18, you can see an example of therapeutic recreation at the Chicago Field Museum's exhibit, The Horse. It explores the special relationship between horses and humans and ends with a lm that captures the positive changes horseback riding makes for people with disabilities. It is a testimony to the power of nature.Recreation is therapeutic whether it is used as your own personal therapy or as a new eld of physical therapy to help those in need. Come closer to nature. You will experience its benets just by sharing an afternoon with it. Therapeutic Recreation Week - July 10 to 16 7-11Healthy Communication Prayer: Caring God, remind me to appreciate those medical professionals who stand ready to care for me in an emergency. Guide them in their work each day. Amen.Q and A About Medic Alert Association: alz.orgQ: I've always thought that Medic Alert jewelry was for people with serious medical conditions. I'm in good health, but am allergic to some medications. Should I get a bracelet?A: If you are in an accident or experience an unexpected health crisis, you may not be able to speak for yourself. By wearing a Medic Alert bracelet or necklace, you can prevent doctors or paramedics from administering drugs that may be dangerous for you.Q: My doctor told me that I should wear a Medic Alert bracelet, but I don't like the way they look. What are my alternatives?A: Medic Alert medallions can be worn as necklaces, watches and even shoelace tags. They also come in different sizes, metals and colors, including sports bands and fashionable beaded bracelets. Today's wearers have a variety of good-looking styles to choose from.Q: A loved one suffers from Alzheimer's Disease. How can a Medic Alert service help?A: A Medic Alert tag lets law enforcement, rst responders and medical personnel know that a person has Alzheimer's and that he or she may not be able to effectively communicate, even if conscious. Medic Alert services can also be combined with a GPS location service: Your loved one can wear a wrist bracelet or carry a pager that allows you to track his or her whereabouts, and the Medic Alert service can notify you when your loved one is found by law enforcement or rst responder services.A doctor's visit usually begins with an interview: The doctor, nurse or medical assistant asks us about our health history and current concerns, then adds this information to our permanent le. The doctor then uses our medical records to make the best possible recommendations about our health care.But when a medical emergency strikes or an accident happens, we may not be able to communicate with rst responders or health care workers. Stroke victims, for example, may be awake and alert but unable to speak or understand speech. People in shock may lose consciousness, and those with head injuries may not be lucid enough to convey important medical information to others.Medic Alert tags communicate when we can't. Your tag identies your major medical condition(s), such as diabetes or drug allergies, so that rst responders can begin treatment. Once you are at the hospital, staff can call the Medic Alert center for your medical records and information about any medications you take or whether you are currently undergoing medical treatment. Medic Alert employees can also contact your family and put them in touch with hospital staff sooner.If you have been thinking about getting a Medic Alert bracelet for yourself or a loved one, now is the time to do it. If you already have a Medic Alert tag, take a few minutes to contact the service and update your medical records or your family's contact information. You'll protect your health and your family's peace of mind by making crucial information about your health available to those who need it.August Is Medic "}
