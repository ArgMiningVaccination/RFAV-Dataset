With its old school Austin/hippy vibes, I felt relaxed the minute I stepped inside this cute little house on South Lamar. The ambiance is unbeatable - with the incense, essential oils, tea station and artwork featured by local artists changes monthly. The receptionist Shay was warm, friendly, and has the same peaceful demeanor I've come to realize is a common trait for all the staff at WorkWell (Ceremony). I've been getting massages for the past 10 years and this is my by far my FAVORITE place! I have worked with a number of different therapists and they were all excellent. The administrative staff is kind and patient and helpful. Their membership program is a good deal and they are transparent about how it works. No surprise fees or cancelation loopholes. Highly recommend WorkWell Austin (Ceremony).
