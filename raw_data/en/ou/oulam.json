Sometimes slightly different vaccines are used in the northern and southern hemispheres.

Preparations of Influenza Vaccine There are 2 basic types of influenza virus vaccine: Inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) Live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) Trivalent vaccines are gradually being superseded by quadrivalent vaccines that cover an additional B virus strain. A quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) and a cell culture-based vaccine (ccIIV4) that do not contain egg protein are available. High-dose quadrivalent vaccines are available for patients 65 years of age. (See also [CDC: Different Types of Flu Vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/different-flu-vaccines.htm).) Indications for Influenza Vaccine Annual vaccination against influenza with an age-appropriate formulation is recommended for all people 6 months of age who do not have a contraindication. (See [CDC: Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule by Age](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html) and [CDC: Adult Immunization Schedule by Age](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/adult.html).) Inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) can be given to all people 6 months, including pregnant women. Recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) can be used in people aged 18 to 49 years. Live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) can be given to healthy people aged 2 to 49 years who are not pregnant and who do not have immunocompromising conditions. Safety of LAIV has not been established in people with disorders that predispose them to complications from influenza, including advanced lung disease or asthma. Adults 65 years should be given any one of the quadrivalent high-dose IIV, quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine, or quadrivalent adjuvanted IIV. If none of these are available, then any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be used. The high dose is recommended only for those 65 years. Health care workers who care for immunocompromised people (ie, those who require care in a protected environment) should be given IIV or RIV4 rather than LAIV (or they should avoid contact with the immunocompromised people for 7 days after getting the vaccine). Contraindications and Precautions for Influenza Vaccine The main contraindication for IIV is A severe allergic reaction (eg, [anaphylaxis](/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/allergic,-autoimmune,-and-other-hypersensitivity-disorders/anaphylaxis) [Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening, IgE-mediated allergic reaction that occurs in previously sensitized people when they are reexposed to the sensitizing antigen. Symptoms... read more](/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/allergic,-autoimmune,-and-other-hypersensitivity-disorders/anaphylaxis)) after previous dose of IIV or to a vaccine component, including egg protein Precautions with IIV include Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever (vaccination is postponed until illness resolves) [Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome](/professional/neurologic-disorders/peripheral-nervous-system-and-motor-unit-disorders/guillain-barr%C3%A9-syndrome-gbs) [Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is an acute, usually rapidly progressive but self-limited inflammatory polyneuropathy characterized by muscular weakness and mild distal sensory loss.

Any influenza vaccine that is otherwise recommended based on the recipient's age and health status can be used. Patients who report reactions to egg involving symptoms other than hives (such as angioedema, respiratory distress, light-headedness, or recurrent emesis) or who required epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention may similarly be given any influenza vaccine that is otherwise recommended based on the recipient's age and health status. If using an egg-based vaccine such as IIV or LAIV, the vaccine should be given in a medical setting and supervised by a health care professional capable of recognizing and managing severe allergic conditions. Dose and Administration of Influenza Vaccine The influenza vaccine is given yearly. For IIV, the dose is 0.25 mL or 0.50 mL IM ( [depending on vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/rr/rr7005a1.htm)) for children aged 6 to 35 months 0.5 mL IM for people 3 years 0.1 mL for people aged 18 to 64 years, given intradermally Children age 6 months to 8 years who have received fewer than 2 influenza vaccine doses or whose influenza vaccination history is unknown should receive 2 doses, separated by at least 4 weeks. The smaller, intradermal dose can be used to conserve vaccine in times of shortage. For LAIV, the dose is 0.1 mL, sprayed into each nostril (total dose is 0.2 mL). For RIV4, the dose is 0.5 mL IM. Adverse Effects of Influenza Vaccine For IIV, adverse effects are usually limited to mild pain at the injection site. Fever, myalgia, and other systemic effects are relatively uncommon; however, people who have been vaccinated may mistakenly think that the vaccine is causing influenza. Such reactions do not contraindicate future vaccination, which should be encouraged. Multidose vials contain thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative. Public concerns possible [link between thimerosal and autism](/professional/pediatrics/childhood-vaccination/vaccine-hesitancy#v82348090) [ Thimerosal and Autism Despite the rigorous vaccine safety systems in place in the United States, some parents remain concerned about the safety of the use and schedule of vaccines in children. These concerns have... read more ](/professional/pediatrics/childhood-vaccination/vaccine-hesitancy#v82348090) have proved unfounded; however single-dose vials, which are thimerosal-free, are available. For LAIV, adverse effects are mild; rhinorrhea is the most common, and mild wheezing may occur. More Information The following English-language resources may be useful.
