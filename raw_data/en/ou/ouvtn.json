You can safely eat or refreeze food in the freezer if it is below 40 degrees. - If your freezer does not include a thermometer, then check the temperature of each food item. If the item still contains ice crystals or is at or below 40 degrees, you can safely refreeze it. - Discard any perishable food \u2014 for example, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, milk \u2014 that has been in a refrigerator or freezer at or above 40 degrees for more than two hours. - When in doubt, throw it out.

Here's how to keep safe as you dry out and clean up after a storm Moisture that enters buildings from leaks or flooding accelerates the growth of mold. Mold can cause disease, trigger allergic reactions, and continue to damage materials long after the storm. As you clean up, wear personal protective equipment such as N-95 masks, goggles, protective gloves, and rubber boots. Here's what you should do: - Take it out: Anything that got wet and can't be cleaned and dried completely within 24 to 48 hours should be taken outside for waste removal. - Air it out: Open all doors and windows as you're removing items or cleaning surfaces. - Drying it out: When you have power, use fans and dehumidifiers to help remove moisture indoors. Dry your home within 24 to 48 hours, if possible. - Scrub surfaces: Clean with water and detergent. Remove all mold you can see. Dry right away. - Don't paint or caulk over mold; it'll still grow. - People with suppressed or impaired immune systems, mold allergies, asthma, or other chronic lung disease should not clean or remove moldy materials. After the flood: [Did your home or car get flooded from Hurricane Idalia? Here's what to do now](https://www.naplesnews.com/story/weather/hurricanes/2023/08/30/hurricane-idalia-house-car-was-flooded-underwater-tips-insurance/70718366007/) [Private wells in flooded areas](https://www.floridahealth.gov/about/_documents/083019-em-prep-factsheets-private-wells.pdf), what you should know If your well is affected by flood waters, there may be disease-causing organisms in your water making it unsafe to drink. The Florida Department of Health recommends you do one of the following: - Boil tap water and hold it at a rolling boil for at least one minute. - Disinfect tap water by adding eight drops of plain, unscented household bleach per gallon of water. Mix the solution and let it stand for 30 minutes. If the water is cloudy after 30 minutes, repeat the procedure one more time. If still cloudy after the second treatment, dispose of water and start the process over again, or use bottled water. - Use commercially available bottled water. After flooding: Learn about [testing your well water.](https://www.floridahealth.gov/environmental-health/private-well-testing/index.html) You can also have your [water tested](https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/local/2023/08/21/smelly-sulfur-water-safe-to-drink-water-red-stains/70617891007/) by a certified laboratory for coliform bacteria. What you should know about [septic tanks and sewer systems](https://www.floridahealth.gov/about/_documents/083019-em-prep-factsheets-flood-septic.pdf) under flood conditions If you have a septic tank at your home and your plumbing is slow or sluggish: - Minimize water use. - Do not have the septic tank pumped. Exceptionally high water tables might cause the surrounding area to cave into a septic tank. - Consider renting a portable waste receptacle. - Do not have the septic tank or drainfield repaired until the flood water has receded. Flooding and electrical outages can impact sewer systems. - While pump stations and sewage treatment plants are out of power, avoid adding additional water to sewer lines. - Report any sewage spills. - If sewage backs up into your house, wear foot coverings, such as rubber boots, and waterproof gloves during cleanup. - Thoroughly clean walls and floors, countertops, refrigerators, and surfaces. [Tetanus is serious bacterial infection](https://www.floridahealth.gov/about/_documents/emergency-information-factsheet-tetanus.pdf) Everyone cleaning up after a storm should make sure their tetanus vaccination is current. Adults need a booster shot every 10 years to maintain protection. Tetanus, commonly known as lockjaw, is a serious bacterial infection that can affect your ability to breathe and may be life-threatening. - If you sustain a wound or deep cut, seek medical attention as soon as possible. - Clean wounds with soap, disinfectant, or bottled water. [Vibrio vulnificus](https://www.floridahealth.gov/about/_documents/emergency-information-factsheet-vibrio.pdf) may be present in flood waters Commonly nicknamed the \" [flesh-eating\" bacteria, Vibrio vulnificus](https://www.naplesnews.com/story/news/local/2023/08/21/vibrio-vulnificus-so-called-flesh-eating-bacteria-killed-florida-how-prevent-infection/70639442007/) can be found in raw or undercooked seafood, saltwater, and brackish water. These bacteria typically grow faster during warmer months and flooding may increase bacteria levels. Vibrio vulnificus can invade the bloodstream, [causing a severe life-threatening illness](https://www.floridahealth.gov/about/_documents/emergency-information-factsheet-vibrio.pdf) with symptoms such as fever, chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock), and skin lesions. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, or wound infections, seek medical attention immediately. [Injured while cleaning up](https://www.floridahealth.gov/about/_documents/emergency-information-factsheet-woundcare.pdf) after a storm? Here's what to do The risk for injury is increased during and after a natural disaster. Floodwaters and standing waters pose several risks, including infectious diseases, chemical hazards, and injuries. Prompt first aid can help heal small wounds and prevent infection. - Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and clean water, if possible. - Avoid touching the wound with your fingers while treating it. If possible, use disposable gloves. - Remove obstructive jewelry and clothing from the injured body part. - Apply direct pressure to any bleeding wound to control bleeding. - Clean the wound after bleeding has stopped. - Check the wound for dirt and foreign objects. - Gently flood the wound with bottled water or clean running water (if available, saline solution is preferred). - Gently clean around the wound with soap and clean water. - Pat dry and apply an adhesive bandage or dry clean cloth. - Leave unclean wounds, bites, and punctures open. Wounds that are not cleaned correctly can trap bacteria and result in infection. - Provide pain relievers when possible. - Monitor the wound every 24 hours for signs of infection. Seek medical attention if you experience or see: redness, swelling, oozing, fever, increasing pain, shortness of breath, fast heart rate, confusion or disorientation, or high heart rate.
