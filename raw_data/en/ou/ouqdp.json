Would it surprise you to learn that people with a healthy digestive system have two bowel motions per day? Some of my patients can't get over this. They go once a week at best and are so used to it that they say, \"it's normal for me\". Many of them are bloated, feel heavy and uncomfortable, some experience cramping and feel generally \"toxic\". Homeopathy for constipation can solve this issue once and for all. Side effects of chronic constipation Of course, the discomfort is only a minor issue compared to the myriad of side effects of chronic constipation. It wreaks havoc inside your body. Chronic constipation is a huge health risk. It's not just an annoying symptom, more often than not it's the root cause of other health problems. First of all, issues arise as a result of large stools and straining. These include haemorrhoids, anal fissures, rectal prolapse, and even faecal impaction in severe cases. In a more subtle way, chronic constipation contributes to fatigue, low mood, and weight gain. It often sets off skin problems such as [eczema](https://gentle-healing.com/services/eczema/) and [acne](https://gentle-healing.com/services/acne-treatment/), triggers allergies, leaky gut, and [food sensitivities](https://gentle-healing.com/services/food-allergies/). Toxic bowels and poor digestion give rise to nutritional deficiencies. These in turn cause thinning hair and brittle nails, amongst other things. The list goes on and on. In addition, recent advances in gut-brain connection research have linked mental health to the microbiome. These days they call the gut a second brain, and some would even argue it's the first brain! Impaired detoxification, toxic buildup and chronic inflammation in the gut lead to compromised immune system and increase the risk of cancer. Natural laxatives and home remedies for constipation relief People who struggle with this issue are usually well aware of constipation relief strategies. It is vital to remain hydrated, especially if you are a thirstless person by nature and forget to drink. Remember, tea and coffee are dehydrating, so they don't count! It is a good idea to start your day with a large glass of warm water with lemon juice. Some older people may limit their fluid intake because they are worried about having to get up to the toilet at night. Dehydration coupled with the lack of fibre in their diet is a guarantee they will end up constipated. - Incorporating lots of fruit and veg in your daily menu to increase the fibre intake is key. - Keeping active and mobile also helps. - Try going to the toilet at the same time every morning. This helps create a healthy habit. Your colon is most active in the morning. - Go as soon as you feel the urge. Don't ignore it because the urge will pass. The longer stool stays in your colon, the harder it gets to expel. - Magnesium is brilliant at relieving constipation. It's a reliable go-to for fast constipation relief. - Regular Epsom salt baths draw toxins out through the skin. If you want to mitigate the side-effects of toxic buildup due to chronic constipation, a few baths every week would be a huge help. If you can't manage a bath, an Epsom salt foot soak is an alternative. - I also recommend including meat stock and bone broth into your daily menu. They help rebuild the gut lining and improve the elimination process. - Adding [fermented foods](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/learn/category/natural-fermentation/)to your diet is an excellent way to populate your gut with good bacteria and promote regular bowel movements. Homeopathy for constipation when natural laxatives don't work If natural laxatives and home remedies for constipation relief don't work for you, it doesn't mean that you need to resort to conventional medication. Adding drugs to the mix will put a further strain on the already compromised, toxic and inflamed system. Homeopathy for constipation offers a safe, natural and effective alternative that is bound to get things moving. The homeopathic treatment will help you clear out your gut, feel lighter, have more energy and reduce the risk of those nasty side-effects. For best results, homeopathy for constipation is prescribed considering all the minute nuances and details. This requires a thorough case taking and analysis. However, below is a list of the most commonly indicated remedies. For details and keynotes, see [this article](https://gentle-healing.com/homeopathic-remedies-constipation/). - Bryonia - Nux-vomica carbonica Sepia - Sulphur - Lac defloratum Homeopathy for constipation - addition of Chinese Medicine recipes In addition to prescribing homeopathy for constipation, I support my patients who struggle with this issue by incorporating two brilliant tips. I picked them up while attending a seminar by an esteemed and highly experienced homeopath and TCM practitioner. I'm not an expert in Traditional Chinese Medicine, but it is my understanding that chronic constipation is the direct result of Kidney Qi deficiency. Kidneys are responsible for directing fluids of the body, including sending the right amount of fluid to the bowel. Therefore, in addition to increasing the water intake, we need to strengthen the Kidney Qi. A special seed and nut mixture prepared in a particular way achieves just that. Another little treasure that I incorporate in the homeopathic treatment of chronic constipation is a mix of herbs. It also comes from Traditional Chinese Medicine. These herbs have an intense cleansing effect on the liver and the hepatic portal system that connects the bowel to the liver. This mix also strengthens the colon and the peristalsis, and adds bulk to the stool. When I introduced these recipes in addition to the individually selected homeopathy for constipation, the results improved dramatically.
