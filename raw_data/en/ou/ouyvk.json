It arises out of a deep understanding of life and an acceptance of human foibles; and paradoxically, it invites the person to move through their pain. Compassion is part of the healing process. Applying this concept to ourselves is quite challenging! Many of us are self-critical even while trying our best to be loving and kind to others. And yet, self-compassion is the foundation of true empathy for others. Our capacity to see a larger picture helps us move away from reactivity and self-judgment, and respond from a place of kindness and understanding. In this livestream presentation, Dr. Carrie Demers and Judy Moulton will discuss what yoga philosophy has to say about cultivating compassion and kindness for ourselves. They will also explore key ayurvedic practices that can fit into our daily routine, providing a nourishing foundation for a deeper understanding of personal compassion and kindness. Tune in to learn both the philosophy and the practice of understanding and embracing the person closest to us\u2014ourselves.
