Globally, around 13.32 billion [COVID-19 vaccine]doses of diverse platforms have been given, and up to this date, 69.7% of the total [population]received at least one [injection]of a [COVID-19 vaccine]. Although these [vaccines]prevent [hospitalization]and severe forms of the [disease], increasing evidence has shown they do not produce sterilizing [immunity], allowing people to suffer frequent [re-infections]. Recent [research]has also raised concerns that [mRNA vaccines]could induce [immune tolerance], which, added to that caused by the [virus]itself, could complicate the [clinical course]of a COVID-19 [infection]. Furthermore, recent investigations have found high [IgG4]levels in people [who]were administered two or more [injections]of [mRNA vaccines]. It has been suggested that an increase in [IgG4]levels could have a protecting [role]by preventing immune over-activation, [similar]to that occurring during successful [allergen]-specific [immunotherapy]by inhibiting [IgE]-induced effects. Altogether, evidence suggests that the reported increase in the [IgG4]levels detected after repeated [vaccination]with the [mRNA vaccines]is not a protective mechanism; rather, it may be a part of the [immune tolerance]mechanism to the spike [protein]that could ...
