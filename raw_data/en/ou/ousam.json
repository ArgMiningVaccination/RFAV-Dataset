Assessment for the Strands 4 CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION / PREAMBLE Curriculum reform is a global issue and drives educ ation policy directives around the world. The broad framework is usually provided by a nation al apex body, the narrower focus is around the syllabi based on the disciplines and the learning outcomes expected at age appropriate levels. 1.1 RATIONALE 1.1.1 Health and Physical Education is concerned with tot al health of the learner and the community. Besides physical health, it includes men tal and emotional health of the learners. Health is often a state of physical, ment al, emotional, social and spiritual well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. 1.1.2 The aim of Mainstreaming Health and Physical Educat ion is to enable the student to attain an optimum state of health, by incorporating each of the aforementioned aspects. 1.1.3 In this respect, it is a truism to say that the pra ctice of healthy living will serve as the foundation for Physical Education. It is envisaged that any effort to promote aesthetic values at the school level will include a natural e steem for physical well-being. The mastery of the body, its powers and qualities, requ ires knowledge, methodical training and exercise. The skills and capacities ne ed to be developed, the muscles and nerves trained, the senses cultivated and hygienic and proper dietary habits inculcated for this purpose. 1.1.4 Therefore, provision has to be made much more syste matically than before, in the school curriculum for Health and Physical Education imbued with Life Skills 1.1.5 Research has demonstrated that there is a positive correlation between brain development and exercise which also has an impact o n cognitive development thus helping to improve academic grades. 1.1.6 A comprehensive view of Health and Physical Educati on includes and encompasses the three areas of Health Education, Physical Educa tion and Yoga as integral to achieving holistic health (physical, mental, intell ectual, emotional, social and spiritual). Given the interdisciplinary nature of t his subject, it needs to be transacted in innovative ways across the curriculum. 1.1.7 The ubiquitous digital presence can be an added res ource for the student, teacher educator and the teacher. It provides endless possi bilities of resorting to online resources to add value to PE. 1.1.8 At the Secondary level acquisition of the habits of healthy living and participation in games and sports and athletics for neuromuscular co ordination and physical fitness are the aims which should be taken care of while de veloping any syllabus of Health and Physical Education. 1.1.9 While at the Senior Secondary level, through the in tegrated PE approach, students will acquire the knowledge, skills, right attitudes and values towards the pursuit of a lifelong physically active and healthy lifestyle. 5 With these aims in mind, the overall and specific o bjectives for a HPE curriculum are outlined below: 1.2 Overall Objectives of Health and Physical Education: 1.2.1 To develop awareness regarding the importance of ph ysical fitness in individual and social life including Life Skills. 1.2.2 To bring the overall awareness of values with regar d to personal health and fitness, and to inculcate among students the desired habits and attitudes towards health to raise their health status.* 1.2.3 To make the pupils physically, mentally and emotion ally fit and to develop such personal and social qualities that will help them t o be good human beings.* 1.2.4 To take action individually and collectively to pro tect and promote (i) own health (ii) health of family members: and (iii) health of the surrounding community and seeking help when required from available community resources.* 1.2.5 To develop interest in exercise, sports and games f or self-satisfaction and make it a part of life; 1.2.6 To enable an individual to enhance inner qualities - self-mastery, discipline, courage, confidence and efficiency.* 1.2.7 To enable an individual to display a sense of respo nsibility, patriotism, self-sacrifice and service to the community * 1.2.8 To develop awareness of the importance of self-defe nce.* 1.2.9 To create awareness among children about rules of s afety in appropriate hazardous situations to avoid accidents and injuries. To acqu aint them with first-aid measures about common sickness and injuries. * 1.2.10 To help children learn correct postural habits in s tanding, walking, running, sitting and other basic movements so as to avoid postural d efects and physical deformities. * 1.2.11 To help children grow as responsible citizens by in culcating in them certain social and moral values through games, sports, Red Cross, Scouts and Guides etc. * 1.2.12 To inculcate values and skills in children in order to promote self-control, concentration, peace and relaxation to avoid the il l effects of stress, strain and fatigue of routine everyday life. * 1.2.13 To address the physical, psycho-social needs of CWS N (Children with Special Needs) in an integrated fashion. * 1.2.14 To seek in instilling self-worth thus helping stude nts to become confident, assertive, emotionally stable, independent and self -controlled. * 1.2.15 To help release of emotional stress, anxiety and te nsion, leading to a reduced risk of depression. * 1.2.16 To help strengthen peer relationships, social bondi ng, buddy mentorship and team camaraderie. 1.2.17 To develop more positive attitude towards challenge s, winning and losing, thus preparing students for life and for the workplace.* * Values Integrated across HPE 6 1.3 Mainstreaming HPE 1.3.1 With the above objectives in mind, the CBSE in cons ultation with MHRD and Ministry of Sports, Govt. of India has attempted to integrat e and mainstream Health and Physical Education across the secondary and senior secondary levels. This is to ensure that the Physical Education component which will co ntinue to be assessed internally, is taken up as a cross-curricular, interdisciplinar y discipline across the four strands. 1.3.2 Mainstreaming would require the coming together of the Class Teacher, PE teacher and teachers of other disciplines. 1.3.3 The mandatory nature of this discipline needs all s tudents to participate in an innovative way through the strands detailed hereaft er. 1.3.4 It will be mandatory for the school to upload a report of work accomplished acro ss the strands of grade X and XII in the prescribed ma nner, for enabling students to sit for the Board exam. 1.3.5 The stipulation is to ensure all schools take this aspect seriously so as to ensure lasting and lifelong benefits for their students. 1.3.6 The following subjects of internal assessment are b eing subsumed in Health and Physical Education from session 2018-19 onwards: Class IX-X i. Work Education (500) ii. Health and Physical Education (506) Class XI-XII i. Work Experience (500) ii. Physical and Health Education (502) As the above subjects of internal assessment are be ing subsumed in Health and Physical Education, so the schools should not alloc ate any period to these above-mentioned subjects from session 2018-19 onwar ds. The same periods should be allocated to Health and Physical Education. 7 CHAPTER 2: FOUR STRANDS 2.1 Introduction 2.1.1 The new format of HPE envisions that each student w ill undertake activities categorized under four strands 2.1.2 The work education aspect of the syllabus is subsum ed under this format, hence there will be no need to take it up as a sepa rate subject 2.1.3 This format is to be compulsorily implemented for c lasses IX, X, XI and first half of the year for class XII 2.1.4 This is an essential requirement for writing the Bo ard examination. 2.1.5 Unless schools undertake HPE seriously and are read y with records of all strands as well as Health and Activity Cards for all studen ts, they will not be allowed to register their candidates for Board examinations 2.1.6 All schools need to fill in the HPE School Report f or the ongoing session before registering their candidates in classes IX and XI. The report should reflect the activities undertaken under each strand separately for each class right from class IX to XII. The format of the HPE School Repor t is given in the Annexure 2.1.7 No theory classes will be taken as a part of this f ormat 2.1.8 The class teacher shall be responsible for ensuring that each child participates in all strands 2.1.9 The class teacher shall also guide and facilitate s trand 3 and strand 4 2.1.10 In the absence of a sports/games teacher, the class teacher may facilitate strand 1 and 2 also and ensure that all children pa rticipate in the games/sports of their choice. 2.1.11 Internal assessment is to be jointly done by the cl ass teacher and the sports/games teacher 2.1.12 From Strand 1, at least one activity is to be taken up by each student as a class or as an individual. The choice will be left to the students and the class teacher will facilitate each child to decide, based upon th e sports facilities available at the school. Schools are encouraged to provide more options by adding to the infrastructure each year 2.1.13 Children are free to choose more than one activity from strand 1, as long as the school sports infrastructure supports it. 2.1.14 Children are also free to change their choices duri ng the course of a year 2.1.15 A class as a whole could be encouraged to take up a ny one team game and/or invasion game, by delineating the role of each stud ent of the class. Roles should be decided by students among themselves. Roles coul d include player, captain, umpire, cheer leaders, commentators, event manager, coach, organizers, reporters for school magazines, etc. 2.1.16 The Board will be inspecting records for Strand 1 a nd 2 such as attendance and participation by all students. Evidences such as Po rtfolios, Journals, Essays, Video recordings etc. in case of SEWA may be kept r eady for scrutiny by the CBSE at any time during the year. 2.1.17 Schools are encouraged to place the activities they undertake under various strands on their own website under the 'Sports Corn er' which should be updated at regular intervals. 8 2.2 THE OBJECTIVES: Regular, high quality PE programs should also provi de all students with opportunities to develop: 2.2.1 An inclination towards, and strong motivation for l ifelong maintenance of health and fitness * 2.2.2 Cardiovascular fitness, muscular endurance, muscula r strength and flexibility to meet the demands of everyday life * 2.2.3 Agility, balance, coordination, reaction time, powe r and speed to be able to perform a wide range of daily tasks * 2.2.4 The techniques necessary to become a skillful perfo rmer and competitor in different sports and activities * 2.2.5 Such traits of character as self-mastery, disciplin e, courage, determination and confidence * 2.2.6 Good sportspersonship, fair play and ability to be an informed spectator * 2.2.7 An ability to perform in different activity - relat ed roles such as attacker, defender, supporter, supported, referee, leader, ca ptain * * Values integrated across HPE STRAND 4 Health & Activity Card (for record) STRAND 1 GAMES/SPORTS - At least one of following: A) Athletics or Swimming B) Team Games C) Individual Games D) Adventure Sports STRAND 3 SEWA STRAND 2 Health and Fitness Four Strands 9 TABLE 1.1 DISTRIBUTION OF MARKS FOR INTERNAL ASSESSMENT Strand Marks Periods (Approx) Levels * 1.

Learning about how body responds to health and fitn ess interventions. An understanding of the connection with the inner w orkings of the body and how the body responds to external stimuli 41 42 43 YOGA Over a prolonged period of time, too much stress le ads to too much cortisol being released in our bodies, which in turn lowers the immune functions and metabolism, leading to rapid weight gain, susceptib ility of body to pathogens, osteoporosis, blood pressure imbalance, muscle weak ness, etc. It is proven that long term stress also has links to insomnia, chroni c fatigue syndrome, depression, thyroid disorders, etc. Modern research accepts three aspects of yoga ( Asanas, Pranayama and meditation) as one of the best methods for moderating the production of cortisol, thereby mana ging the stress response of the body. By reducing cortisol levels, yoga therefo re raises the immunity levels of the body. Secondly, when we hold our body in a y oga posture for a few breaths/counts, our parasympathetic nervous system is stimulated, which in turn lowers our BP to enable a better post-stress r esponse. Thirdly, exercise in the gym or outdoors cannot massage our internal org ans, which are nothing but muscles performing a particular function. Yoga keep s these muscles exercised and active. Fourthly, yoga is able to enhance the b ody's natural defense mechanism against free radicals. There are many mor e benefits of Yoga, that students may like to research on themselves. 44 45 CHAPTER 5 STRAND 3: SEWA (Social Empowerment through Work Educ ation and Action) 5.1 Introduction Several years ago, the noted educationist Paulo Freire pointed out that there is no such thing as neutral education. Any education, to be meaningf ul, has to fit into the context of the society in which it is given and which is relevant to the times. In the context of the multiplicity and the rapidity of the changes that a re taking place, the students need to know and understand the contexts in which they are livin g today and the demands that will be made on them, in the immediate future, to fit into the changing patterns of society. SEWA aims to develop a whole person in their intell ectual, personal, social, emotional and social growth. Learners engaged in this program are expected to be life-long learners and through experiential learning develop as active cit izens and caring and compassionate humans. The experiential and constructive modes of learning emphasize the immediate personal experience of the learner and view learnin g as a process. SEWA takes learning beyond the walls of the classro om and sometimes even beyond the boundaries of the school, building bridges with the authentic and real world in meaningful and positive ways. The following maybe noted with r egard to SEWA: SEWA is an integral component of HPE. This aspect aims to focus on the mental/emotional a nd social health of the child All students of classes IX to XII (for XII, only ti ll end of the first semester/ term) will participate in SEWA program around the year. 5.2 Objective: There is an urgent need to foster strong mental and social health amongst today's children so that they can connect with their peers, their el ders, the community, the environment, etc. The main objective of the SEWA projects is to direc t children's mind in constructive activities with positive outcomes through the facilitation of creative and critical thinking. This would help them to develop self-confidence and self-estee m. Another objective of this programme is to underline the significance of the interdependence of all human beings and our dependence on the envir onment in this shrinking global village. Students must acknowledge that they have a responsi bility towards the less privileged, the disadvantaged, the CWSN (Divyang), the society, and the environment. The principle of giving to society has to become second nature to th em. 5.3 The SEWA Philosophy SEWA is all about social or community service; it c an include environmental, civic responsibilities or democracy or health and fitness related projects, international and other projects too, as long as the project is able to con nect the child to his surroundings or to a cause, and is able to generate a sense of responsib ility towards it (even if it is towards health and fitness of the class itself). The Social Empowe rment component to a large extent inspires SEWA philosophy, which in the Indian environment refers to the concept of service to the community. 46 5.4 Note to Class Teachers SEWA has been designed to integrate social awarenes s into the regular curriculum of the students. The teacher must be careful in facilitati ng the child's activities so as to provide a suitable learning environment. This in turn would a lso give a boost to a positive school environment. The teachers need to create opportunities for stude nts to engage with learning activities to develop core competencies such as: a) Social Awareness, Self Awareness and Empathy b) Self Management and Leadership Skills c) Creative and Critical Thinking d) Interpersonal Skills and Effective Communication Sk ills e) Responsible Decision-making through Problem Solving The teachers need to be open-minded about errors co mmitted by learners while implementing the SEWA programme. The learners may f ind themselves in ambiguous situations and sometimes suffer from moral conflict s. As adults, we need to facilitate the widening of the scope for the learner so that they find alternative ways of making informed decisions. Here, one cannot undermine the responsib ility of the school as a community. Thus, one can develop and establish a caring commun ity encouraging collaborative learning activities by weaving Self-empowerment into their d aily school activities. 5.5 The learning outcomes expected to be developed and fostered through participation in SEWA are experiential: The Learner : Develops Life Skills of Self-Awareness and Empathy . * Develops Creative and Critical Thinking Skills. * Becomes a caring and compassionate individual.* Responds as a socially empowered change maker. * Acquires the skills to be an active leader and init iator of change. Plans, implements and delivers projects connected t o the real world. Visualizes and participates in a world going beyond the classroom and often/ sometimes beyond the boundaries of the school. Formulates strategies to deliver meaningful program s and projects Critiques premises as a reflective enquirer . Demonstrates fair play and non-judgmental ethical behavior . * Actively engages in SEWA activities as an individua l and at a team level. Participates in various activities in age appropriate ways across disciplines . Selects and applies skills, facts and compositional ideas. Competes with oneself to improve self-performance and evaluate strategies for further enhancement. * Knows, understand and applies rules. * Integrated values across HPE 47 The integrated SEWA program helps to acquire the fol lowing learning skills: Plan, initiate and implement activities Learn to work in teams and collaborate through orga nizing activities/events in terms of skills, interest, motivation and professional gr owth Identify and nurture areas of strength and identify areas requiring further growth Engage with issues of social concern in the communi ty, society, state and nation Develop new life skills and strategies and become l ifelong learners. 5.6 Guidelines for Schools School can Design and announce school SEWA policy. School can also decide on yearly focus theme for SE WA and class-wise sub themes. Each class as a whole can decide to take up one SEW A activity for the entire year The choice of activity can be left to the students of the class, with guidance and facilitation by the class teacher and will depend u pon the school policy too. Schools are encouraged to allow children to suggest SEWA themes for the year. Once a SEWA activity is decided for a particular sc hool/class/year, the class students themselves will decide upon the role of each studen t of the class. Orient parents about SEWA and seek support from sta keholders. Appoint School SEWA Mentor and Class-wise SEWA Ment ors, if required. Mentors could also be from amongst the parents or teachers. Arrange administrative support for the activities i nvolving government and outside agencies. Dedicate day/s for SEWA exhibition or presentation day at the end of the year or as suitable. Ensure that each child in a class actively particip ates in his/her assigned role of SEWA. Arrange training and create support structure for a ll involved as required. Ensure 100% dedicated involvement. 5.7 Guidelines for Students Discuss how they can improve/impact the community/ environment/ health and fitness of the students and choose the focus area f or the project. Brainstorm and create mind-maps on the chosen area Identify the causes they want to support and choose one/or more ways of carrying it forward. Outline the objectives of the projects they have ch osen and present plans for the implementation as well as ways of measuring the suc cess of the project. Assign roles to each member of the class community by consensus. Ensure each and every child is included. Learn to research on the chosen area of SEWA Seek guidance from the teacher when they need it. Learn how to plan, implement, review and take respo nsibility for their decisions. Examine the effect of their intervention and suppor t for the causes they have chosen and present them to the rest of the class/school. Capture the hours spent as well as documents as evi dence wherever required in the student Portfolio/dossier Share the impact of the SEWA work undertaken as Pow er Point with the school community and as part of a special exhibition at th e end of the year, clearly highlighting the role of each student in the class. 48 5.8 What forms a Social Empowerment activity? The activities conducted 'in school' as part of Eco -clubs, Sports Club, Literacy Clubs or 'out of school' as community outreach activities etc. can b e considered as Social Empowerment activities. It may range from a small role as 'volu nteer' and a 'contributor' to running an entire project over the year. Social Empowerment ac tivities are bound to germinate some thought process in young minds. The class may decide to take up any innovative soci al empowerment activity every year; students may decide the role of each child; at the end of each year the class as a whole may present its project report. Even sports activities can be taken up as a SEWA pr oject by the class. Some of the activities under sports that can be taken up are as follows (i llustrative list): Organizing sports meet for CWSN (Children with Spe cial Needs) Planning, organizing and delivering a League tourna ment (Basketball, Cricket, Football) Planning and holding a friendly cricket match betwe en alumni and the current grade XI and XII Organizing sports competition for primary school Organized Inter-class/ Inter-school sporting activi ties (basketball, volleyball, swimming, hockey, netball, squash, cricket and boxi ng) Long distance runs (half and full marathons) for a cause Researching on Yoga, Running/Jogging, Dance, Trekki ng/ Hiking/Biking/Cycling, Camping, Military training as part of planned proje cts. There are multiple other possibilities of projects that can be taken up under SEWA, such as (illustrative list): Organizing a fund raising Musical Extravaganza for school Holding an Art Exhibition for fund raising Inviting professionals from industry to develop car eer pathways (App on mobile) Running school caf\u00e9 with focus on nutrition School gardening project Collaborating as part of Photography Club and creat e Exhibitions across the city with a social message. Projects on social awareness or cross curricular th emes initiated, planned and implemented by students with teacher as initiator. As volunteer for 'in school activities' such as organizing a school-based event based on Life Skills. Participating or volunteering in Youth Parliament o r mock UN Sessions Activities from 'Revised School Health Manual (see under Resources) Life Skills Activities (Creative and Critical Think ing, Problem Solving and Decision Making, Effective Communication, Self Awareness and Empathy) (see under Resources) 'Buddies' or 'Peer Mentors' for Adolescence Education , School Health Program , Life Skills Program etc. 49 Anti Bullying or Anti Ragging Committee and awarene ss raising As volunteer for charities 'outside of school' such as orphanages, old-age homes Collecting and distributing used and unused books a nd clothes to the underprivileged Volunteer work with stray animals and organizations connected with the same cause Helping to raise funds for beneficiaries involving natural disasters (flood, earthquake victims) Adopting an old age home for interactive activities Adopting an orphanage for conducting joyful activit ies Online volunteering for counseling peers for raising awareness regardi ng career pathways. Enrichment Activities of different Ministries can be taken up in project mode, such as Swachhta Parv - creating awareness about historical sites and tourist spots in your city, etc. Organising and volunteering for various 'in-school activities' and Language Club, Theatre and Dramatics Club, Social Science Club, Da nce club, Science Club, Science Fairs, Heritage Club, Nature Clubs. 5.9 Activities complying with SEWA Criteria SEWA activities require involvement and interaction . When students assume a passive role and no contributory service is performed, it cannot be defined as a SEWA activity/project. Activities which do NOT fall under SEWA: An activity through which a student attains financi al or some other type of benefit (unless this benefit is passed on in full to a wort hy cause). Getting involved in effortless, monotonous, and rep etitive work - like returning library books to the shelves. Work experience that only benefits an individual st udent.

Prepare a report on the above with respect to your school/community highlighting the issues and its impact on them. Draft a letter to th e school/local authorities informing them about the issue and send the letter to them along w ith the report. 6.2.2.4 Make a School Compost pit- Organic waste co nstitutes 35-40% of the municipal solid waste generated in India. This waste can be r ecycled by the method of composting. Composting ensures that this waste is not carelessl y thrown or left to rot but nutrients are recycled and returned to the soil. a) A group of students may conduct a survey on the kind of waste produced in the school. b) Identify a cool, shady corner in your schoo l compound or garden where a pit can be dug. Cover the pit with a net or mesh to keep away flies and birds. c) Start a waste segregation project in the sc hool. Install two dustbins in the school for biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste. d) Put a layer of biodegradable waste (Bits of paper, leaves, twigs, fruit peels, leftover food etc.) into the pit and cover it with a thin la yer of soil or dried leaves to prevent bad odour. e) Turn the waste over and over once every thr ee days. In about 45 days, the pure, rich and organic waste will be ready to be used in the s chool's garden. 6.2.2.5 Plan an awareness campaign for water conser vation/plastic free school/neighbourhood in your school and execute it. a) Create a poster to dissuade the local commu nity members from using plastic bag or waste water and display the posters in public place s. b) Write slogans against use of plastic bags/w ater wastage/pollution. d) Have these community members take pledge to avoid using plastic bags/ prevent water wastage. 6.2.2.6 Form groups of volunteers in your neighbour hood for making it greener and cleaner. Undertake any of the following activities in the locality- a) Conduct cleanliness drives in the locality b) Carry out plantation drive in the locality 77 c) Install dustbins in the area d) Write a letter to the local authorities to ban plastics e) Run anti fire cracker campaigns in the loca lity. f) Encourage community households to segregat e waste and educate them about proper disposal of waste. 6.3 PRE VOCATIONAL AND SKILL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES 6.3.1 Learning Outcomes: Students will - 1. Prepare a plan to start a small scale eco -friendly business (Entrepreneurship) 2. Set up Vermicompost pits/compost bins, Upcy cle (Paper, Glass bottles, plastic), installing vertical gardens for earning profits. 6.3.2 Activities - 6.3.2.1 As more consumers demand that companies beh ave in a socially responsible way, it's becoming more common for businesses to impleme nt environment friendly practices. You can take this initiative one step further by st arting an eco friendly business and scale it. - Prepare a mind- map of desirable and sustainable future in local community or neighbourhood. For example, following is the map fo r describing environmental issues- - List the changes needed in the local community to ensure that the business does not harm or degrade the environment in any way. Each require d change is a business opportunity. - The business can be service/product based. - Fix upon a business based on your knowledge an d skills. - Describe your business idea. (What to sell? Ho w to sell? Where to sell? Who will buy? Why will he buy?) 78 - Find the investment on the basis of operationa l and human resource costs. Fix the pricing. - Plan a fundraising activity (refer to next ac tivity). - Analyze the risks & threats. Prepare a strategy to overcome it. - Analyze strengths and opportunities and plan to use them for running your business. - Build your network.

Fund- Raising for Eco Friendly businesses- - Explain who you are, what you are all about and w hy someone should support you in 15 seconds. - Remember fundraising is not just about raising mo ney, it's also about building relationships with your community for the longer term. - Tell the prospective supporters following things. - Share a report of expenditure with your donors/su pporters to ensure transparency and credibility in your efforts. 6.3.4. Environmental consciousness and sustainabili ty should infuse in every aspect of our living. This will require every individual to devel op certain skills that will enable them to manage their resources more efficiently. a) Make a list of skills that are required to mana ge resources in a more sustainable way such as vermicomposting, paper recycling, gardening, rai nwater harvesting etc. b) Find an expert and invite him/her to conduct a workshop. c) Organize the workshop in the school. d) Have students form groups and undertake the pro ject. e) Organize an exhibition to display the projects. 79 Project - 7: Reduce, Recycle, Reuse (most important 3 R's) and Now Respect Project Focus - Conservation, Caring for the Planet, Segregation of garbage Target Area - It enables children to learn about the original s ource of material and also which materials can be recycled. Every living organism is important in this world, b e it an elephant, a banyan tree, a rabbit, an insect, a mustard plant, or inanimate resources suc h as water, air or soil. They are members of one or the other food chain and are dependent on one another. Every food chain starts from a plant source and man is the last consumer in almost all the food chains. But with increasing population the resources are depleting. We need to establish a balance between human populations and available resources so that r enewable sources find sufficient time to renew themselves and others can be recycled and reu sed. Learning Outcomes: Learners- learn about the original source of material goods s uch as glass, aluminium, iron, paper, plastic, petroleum, coal. learn the importance of segregating garbage. learn which materials can be recycled. . learn to coordinate between plan and action, within the volunteer group as well as with the target group. find new ways of cooperating with each other. learn social skills and ability to solve problems i n a group. understand the importance of conserving resources. explore and internalize the importance of Reduce, R ecycle, Reuse. learn to use resources judiciously. Project Process: Prepare: Students will make a rough layout and plan the acti vities to practically implement the project. Conduct a class discussion. Discuss the meaning of recycling. (The teacher may tell a story with a message - \"There is enough for everyon e's need but not for their greed)\". Students will make a list of things that can be rec ycled at home or at school. Discuss the reasons for recycling. Ask students if they know what the source of the original material is. Many students do not know the actual origin of mate rials and how material is recycled. Prepare and use the resource sheets to se quence the steps from original product to recycling for each material. Draw story boards about where materials come from. Display stories. Identify locality or target area for the execution of the project. Form groups of 10 to 12 students and elect a group leader for each group. The students in each group should preferably be from th e same residential area to make it practically easy for them to target their projec t area. 80 Divide larger areas into smaller target areas, and allot them to each group accordingly. Do a door to door survey to find out things that ar e needed to be recycled by the people living in the neighbourhood and collect data to fill in the provided survey sheet. Talk to the local area welfare society and arrange a presentation. Conduct a survey an environmental hygiene of your s chool (classroom, corridors, washroom, public spaces) and suggest solutions. Prepare a presentation to :- o spread awareness about Reuse and Recycling. o sensitize people about conservation of nature by re cycling. o make residents aware about the benefits of segregat ing the trash. o tell them about the various benefits of understandi ng the origin of various goods so that recycling becomes easy for th em.. Ask students to prepare two lists by following the steps given below: o Make a list of all man-made things around them. o Try to find out where they come from. o The materials, about which they have a doubt (its o rigin), will be marked in the list. o The teacher will help them find the origins of thes e materials. Share the list prepared by you with the residents a nd prepare a consent list of those who would agree to segregate the trash in order to facilitate the garbage disposal. Prepare an evaluation sheet after monitoring and ta king feedback from the residents to make a record of people to know how they have be nefitted from the project. Reflective Musings: After the collection of the data from survey, ask s tudents to assemble all the collected data at one place. We have to start caring about our planet. That is wh y we should recycle. \"Why should we recycle? To talk is good, to act is bette r.\" Guide students to research and prepare two lists- o ne with the materials that can be recycled and another one with the materials that ca nnot be recycled. Guide students to prepare a presentation highlighti ng the following: o Meaning of Recycling. o The need for reuse. o Does it help in easy disposal if the garbage is seg regated? o Why do some materials need to be recycled while oth ers cannot? o Why does man need to control greed and utilise Moth er Earth's resources thoughtfully? o Why do we need to respect the resources provided by nature? o What should be reduced and why? Discussions will be held in class on the activities of the project. The students will think, talk and write about what they have learned and observed. Questions will be discussed in class about their ex periences and response of the community; e.g., 81 o Describe what you have learned and felt about your project: o How far was the activity beneficial for you? o What have you learned about yourself and your surro undings from this project? o How do you think we can sensitize people about cons erving and respecting resources? o How can we make the project more effective? The students will be given a Performa to fill in so that they can assess their own learning from the project. Share and Celebrate: An assembly can be arranged to award the outstandin g students. The students will display the charts and models on school notice-board. Certificates can be awarded to all students. The classroom can also be decorated with charts and models. The students can also keep imparting information re garding cleanliness through a practical demonstration to other students. The report of the project may be published in the n ewspapers and the school's magazine. 82 Survey Sheet SN Name Residenti al Address People who started segregating garbage People who did not start segregating garbage People who were benefitted (Those who Changed) Student Evaluation Sheet to be filled by the Mentor after the completion of each activity:- Scheduled Activity Proposed Date Suggested number of hours Hours invested Date of completion of the activity Learning Outcomes achieved Skills developed Self Assessment 1.

Activities leading to 'Physical Fitness' as an outc ome and contributing to a healthy lifestyle will fall under SEWA. The assessment criteria will be evidence based taki ng the readings from Health Card (Fitnometer, Actometer and Nutrometer) . These will be used as scientific evidence towards fulfilling the weighting assigned to this component . These activities need to be taken up in larger groups and organized as a motivational and a spirational tool of outreach to the community. The illustrative list of activities suggested under this theme are as under: Being part of adventure camps either at school or as part of collaboration with uniformed services, this is in addition to the 'adv enture' activities under the strand Part of ' Swachh Bharat ' activities such as cleaning and clearing fields a nd other initiatives of Ministries. Creating leagues of Sporting activities (basketball , volleyball, swimming, hockey, netball, squash, cricket and boxing) as interclass, school, city, district or even at national levels Long distance runs (half and full marathons). 'Fun runs' for a cause Yoga, Running/ Jogging with fitness trackers with a goal in mind at the end of the year. Dance and choreography in groups Trekking/ Hiking/ Biking/ Cycling as meaningful fit ness activities with a goal in mind at the end of the year. Camping, Military training with a goal in mind at t he end of the year. Gardening and creating herb gardens/medicinal garde ns/vegetable garden Disciplined and responsible dietary habits as outco me-based fitness projects Managing Sport Events: An Exemplar Activity: All participation in any of the above activities or those under scheme of games and sports must be consistent and on a daily basis. The by-product and outcome of these will be health and wellness and overall fitness . Physical fitness also leads to choosing good dietary practices , thus ensuring good nutrition habits . Organizing and managing sport events are complex. I t includes integration of modern management skills like budgeting, sponsorship manag ement, venue management logistic management, facility management are required. Learning outcomes: The learner: Creates court/ground marking as per specifications Learns to use equipment for marking such as nails, ropes, pegs, hammer, measuring tape, chalk powder Prepares fixtures as per the specifications: 84 Maintains props and equipment as per the requiremen t e.g. pressure for various balls, plans budgets, organizes venue, logistics Implements to make it a positive learning experienc e Marks restricted area around the field servings, ar ea, pitch, scorers table Uses chalk powder to make a 5 cm line as per the di mension of the field depending on the game. Understands cross curricular linkages through conce pt of dimensions (Length, breadth, depth on height), radius, diameter Understands the methods of conducting a league and implements them League Format League is a way of conducting a tournament where each team plays against all the teams or within a group. In league format, teams play all th e pre-fixed matches and get the advantage to recover even if the team losses the first or sec ond match. For example, in a tournament, if 4 groups are made and each group has 4 teams in each group, one team may play against 3 other teams. Likewise, the champion of all 4 groups move to the next level. In the next level, the group champion teams may play against each other (all the teams) and the winner is decided based on the maximum number of wins. This method is known as league-cum-league. The other method is league-cum-knockout where in th e champion team of a group plays with the other group champion and the winners play the final. The method of league or league-cum-knockout solely depends on the organizers. Organizers decide on the basis of time availability, no. groun ds available, funds and no. of teams. In a league format, the total no. of matches is cal culated as n (n-1)/2 'n' is the total number of teams. Each group has 4 teams. So the total no. of matches in each group will be n(n-1)/2 4(4-1)/ 2 = 6 matches Total no. of matches including all the groups will be 24 only (6 matches per group X 4 groups). Post group league, it may continue as league format or knockout format. 85 Knockout Format Knockout is another way of conducting a tournament where in the teams get knocked out on losing. The winning teams keep moving to the nex t level and finally 2 teams compete for the championship. The above fixture is applicable only if the total n o. of teams is exponential power of 2 that means 22 =2 x 2 = 4, 23 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 and so on ( 16, 32, 64 .........). 86 87 88 Maintaining the Props and Equipment? Check the pressure carefully. Pressures for various balls are: Footbal l - 0.6 - 1.1 atmosphere (600 - 1,100 g/cm2) at sea level Basketball - 3.17 - 4.0 atmosphere (3170 - 4000 g/cm2) at sea level Volleyball - 0.30 - 0.325 atmosphere (300 - 325 g/cm2) at sea level Before using balls: 1. Inflate balls to correct pressures. 2. Before you inflate the balls, moisten the needle. 3. To inflate balls, squeeze balls while gradually add ing a small amount of air at a time. 4. Inflating balls with too much air at once will dama ge the inner tube/ bladder. 5. Avoid inflating balls with machines as it may over inflate resulting in bursting. After using balls: 1. Deflate little air after use. If the same air press ure remains in balls after use, balls may expand or deform. 2. Wipe the surface with a soft cloth. 3. If you are unable to remove dirt easily, wipe balls with a moistened cloth. 4. If you are unable to remove dirt with water, wipe b alls with a cloth moistened with water-diluted mild detergent. 5. If you use mild detergent to clean balls, thoroughl y wipe off any remaining detergent to ensure that it does not remain on the ball surfa ce. (Detergent may cause stain). 6. If you use water to clean balls, wipe the ball afte rwards with a dry cloth. 7. Dry balls out of direct sunlight in a well-ventilat ed place. 8. If the ball has been soaked by rain, wipe away mois ture and dirt using a cloth. Dry the ball out of direct sunlight in a well-ventilated pl ace. To store balls: 1. Avoid leaving balls in a place that is exposed to d irect sunlight. 2. Avoid storing balls in hot or damp places. 3. Store balls in a well-ventilated place. 4. Inflate balls regularly, in a well-ventilated place out of direct sunlight. To maintain props and equipment: 1. After the activity, use a dry cloth to wipe the pro ps/ equipment and store in a well- ventilated place out of direct sunlight. 2. Check the condition of the props/ equipment regular ly to avoid any unobserved crack/ breakage. 3. Do not leave the props/ equipment in direct sunligh t for the whole day. It would reduce the life of props/ equipment. 4. Do not store the props and equipment made of iron/ metal in a damp place. The moisture may lead to rusting. 5. The equipment which has not been in use for long du ration (posts, flags, poles, hurdles etc.) needs special care. 6. Wrap it properly and store it in a well-ventilated place out of direct sunlight. Such equipment should be checked at least once in a year to ensure the good condition. 7. Do not apply water in any leather props and equipme nt. Always use dry cloth to clean. 89 Project/ Activity 8: Studying the nutrition and health s tatus of people in a peer group/ village/city slum/ tribal area/ neighbourhood The nutrition and health status of the people refle ct and present status and future prospects of a country. Enhancement of the nutrition and heal th status of the people should, therefore, be the first priority of the national pl anning for development.

Online data analysis and graphical presentation of findings Assessment Rubric may be developed in consultation with teache rs Project/ Activity 9: Participating in the community heal th programme through door-to-door contact programmes. Malnutrition and infection are the major causes of the precarious status of health in the developing world. Malnutrition is not only due to p overty or non-availability of food resulting from social and distributive injustice, but also du e to ignorance of nutritional facts and undesirable practices. Malnutrition problems can be resolved to a great extent if judicious selection of food is made possible within economic means and the available foods are better utilized. Infectious diseases are caused mainly by the lingering existence of two fundamental problems of environmental sanitation, mainly unsafe water supply and unhygienic disposal of waste, specially human excreta. The application of modern scientific knowledge to environmental sanitation can lead to 80 percent of the diseases being effectively controlled. Thus, by developing desirable nutrition, health and environmental sanitation practices in the communities, health problems can be considerably re solved. This can be achieved through environment-based education for all age groups of p opulation. A door to door contact programme is the most effective way of environment- based education. Without any nutrition, health and sanitation intervention, the status of nutrition, health and sanitation in the community can be enhanced through functional ed ucation by door to door contact. Process May be done in groups Developing a checklist to collect data Analyze data and prepare a graph Record the findings in the report Specific Activities Correlating the nutrition, health and sanitation pr oblems in the adopted community.

The subject raises the trunk in a smooth motion, keeping the arms in position, curling up the desired amount (at least 6 inches above ground). The trunk is lowered back to the floor so that the shoulder blades or upper back touch the floor. Flat, clean, cushioned surface, stopwatch, recording sheets, pen Record the maximum number of sit ups in a certain time period, such as 30 seconds (Age 9- 14 years) or 1 Minute (Age 15+) Flexed/ Bent Arm Hang Upper body functional strength and muscular endurance The subject is assisted into position, the body lifted to a height so that the chin is level with the horizontal bar. The bar is grasped using an overhand grip (palms are facing away from body), with the hands shoulder width apart. The timing starts when the subject is released. They should attempt to hold this position for as long as possible. Timing stops when the person's chin falls below the level of the bar or the head is tilted backward to enable the chin to stay level with the bar. Stopwatch , an elevated horizontal bar The total time is seconds is recorded. Sit and Reach Common measure of flexibility, and specifically measures the flexibility of the lower back and hamstring muscles. This test is important as because tightness in this area is implicated in lumbar lordosis, forward pelvic tilt and lower back pain This test involves sitting on the floor with legs stretched out straight ahead. Shoes should be removed. The soles of the feet are placed flat against the Sit and Reach box. Both knees should be locked and pressed flat to the floor - the tester may assist by holding them down. With the palms facing downwards, and the hands on top of each other or side by side, the subject reaches forward along the measuring line as far as possible. Ensure that the hands remain at the same level, not one reaching further forward than the other. After some practice reaches, the subject reaches out and holds that position for at one-two seconds while the distance is recorded. Make sure there are no jerky movements. Sit and Reach box with the following dimensions: 12\" x 12\" (sides) 12\" x 10\" (front and back) 12\" x 21\" (top) Inscribe the top panel with centimeter/mm gradations. It is crucial that the vertical plane against which the subject's feet will be placed is exactly at the 23 cm mark. The score is recorded to the nearest centimeter as the distance reached by the hand 600 Mt Run Cardiovascular Fitness/ Cardiovascular Endurance Participants are instructed to run 600 mts. in the fastest possible pace. The participants begin on signal, \"ready, start\" as they cross Stopwatch, whistle, marker cone, lime powder, Time taken for completion (Run or Walk) 100 the finish line elapsed time should be announced to the participants. Walking is permitted but the objective is to cover the distance in theshortest possible time. measuring tape Flamingo Balance Test Ability to balance successfully on a single leg. This single leg balance test assesses the strength of the leg, pelvic, and trunk muscle as well as dynamic balance. Stand on the beam/line with shoes removed. Keep balance by holding the instructor's hand. While balancing on the preferred leg, the free leg is flexed at the knee and the foot of this leg held close to the buttocks. Start the watch as the instructor lets go. Stop the stopwatch each time the person loses balance (either by falling off the beam or letting go of the foot being held). Stopwatch, can be done on just standing on one leg on a thin line (Age Group: 5-8 years) or a beam locally procured (Age Groups: 9-14, 15+ years) Total time till the subject loses balance. Shuttle Run Test of speed and agility Marker cones and/or lines are placed 10 meters apart. Start with a foot at one marker. When instructed by the timer, the subject runs to the opposite marker, turns and returns to the starting line. This is repeated four times without stopping (covering 40 meters total) for Age 9-14 years OR repeated five times without stopping (covering 50 meters total) for Age 15+ years. At each marker both feet must fully cross the line. stopwatch, measuring tape, marker cones, a flat non-slip surface Record the total time taken to complete the 40 mt/50 m course. Sprint/ Dash Determines acceleration and speed The test involves running a single maximum sprint over 20 meters (Age 5-8 years)/30 mts (Age 9-14 years)/50 Mts (Age 15+), with the time recorded. A thorough warm up should be given, including some practice starts and accelerations. Start from a stationary position, with one foot in front of the other. The front foot must be on or behind the starting line. This starting position should be static (dead start). The tester should provide hints for maximizing speed (such as keeping low, driving hard with the arms and legs) and encouraged to continue running hard through the finish line. Measuring tape or marked track, stopwatch, cone markers, flat and clear surface of at least 60 meters. Time taken for completion Standing Vertical Jump (Sargent Jump) Measures the Leg Muscle Power The subject stands side on to a wall and reaches up with the hand closest to the wall. Keeping the feet flat on the ground, the point of the fingertips is marked or recorded. This is called the standing reach height. The athlete then stands away from the wall, and leaps vertically as high as possible using both arms and legs to assist in projecting the body upwards. Attempt to touch the wall at the highest measuring tape or marked wall, chalk powder for marking wall The jump height is usually recorded as a distance score. 101 point of the jump. The difference in distance between the standing reach height and the jump height is the score. Plate Tapping Test Tests speed and co- ordination of limb movement If possible, the table height should be adjusted so that the subject is standing comfortably in front of the discs. The two yellow discs are placed with their centers 60 cm apart on the table. The rectangle is placed equidistant between both discs. The non- preferred hand is placed on the rectangle. The subject moves the preferred hand back and forth between the discs over the hand in the middle as quickly as possible. This action is repeated for 25 full cycles (50 taps). Table (adjustable height), yellow discs (20cm diameter), rectangle (30 x 20 cm), stopwatch. The time taken to complete 25 cycles is recorded Alternati ve Hand Wall Toss Test Measures hand-eye coordination A mark is placed a certain distance from the wall (e.g. 2 meters, 3 feet). The person stands behind the line and facing the wall. The ball is thrown from one hand in an underarm action against the wall, and attempted to be caught with the opposite hand. The ball is then thrown back against the wall and caught with the initial hand. The test can continue for a nominated number of attempts or for a set time period (e.g. 30 seconds). By adding the constraint of a set time period, you also add the factor of working under pressure. tennis ball or baseball, smooth and solid wall, marking tape, stopwatch Score of the number of successful catches in a 30 second period 102 Chapter 7 Transactional Strategies for the Strands of HPE (Except Health and Activity Record) The cross-cutting themes of the transactional strat egy are as follows: Transacting it through cross curricular linkages cu tting across subjects, thus creating interest and motivation, enhancing physica l fitness levels thus leading to overall health. Enhancing Life Skills such as creative and critical thinking, problem solving and decision making, inter personal and Intra personal skills, empathy and self awareness, effective communication and collaboratio n and team-work. Focus on inclusion The ways of transaction across the curriculum would include: Recognition of HPE as a compulsory component across stages beginning with pre-primary, primary, upper primary, secondary and senior. The CBSE in its previous circulars and advisories h as already mandated at least forty-five to sixty minutes of compulsory transacti on on a daily basis. PE has been an integral theme of the Comprehensive School Health Manuals (brought out in four volumes by the Board in 2005, revised in 2010). (Available under Resources) Resources for transacting PE by providing linkages across subjects at the Pre- primary, and Primary level are already available in Physical Education Cards brought out for teachers and students. (Available u nder Resources) PE Cards are also available for differently-abled c hildren as PEC ability cards and also for secondary level (SPEC). (Available under R esources) Life Skills Manuals for Primary, Middle and Secondary have activities and themes for transaction of PE across classes in age appropriate ways. (Available under Resources) Specific transactional methodology for Class IX - X II Students should select the activities they want to pursue further whether as specialists or for personal enjoyment. If students are to prepare themselves for using the ir leisure time effectively, they will need to acquire the knowledge and skills of a broad range of activities, sports and games so that they are able to make truly informed choices about the activities they want to get involved in as part of their own health y lifestyle management. Therefore, facilitate sports/games/health and fitness/SEWA act ivities by discussing with students about the knowledge, attributes, skills, s trategies and / or compositional knowledge required to meet the outcomes of the acti vity and involve students as performers and officials, judges and/or referees. Inter-class/ school games, competitions and perform ances must be encouraged and used as opportunities for assessing students using the continuous and comprehensive assessment framework. 103 All schools cannot include every physical activity within its time table. The list of physical activities available to young people these days is vast and ranges from the very traditional, indigenous games of our country to the increasingly popular games and pastimes of the west. Combination s of activities chosen must take the choices of the students into account. Schools may add their own games, sports and activit ies to the relevant category Schools may choose the activities they wish to incl ude depending on the infrastructure and expertise available as well as i nterest of their students. In classes IX and X, whereas all students are expec ted to involve themselves in games, activities and sports, it is possible that some of them may choose to excel in areas of their interest. It is therefore, recommended that s uch students be permitted to pursue one activity out of the strands over each year. This will allow for specialization whilst still providing breadth to th eir learning. As far as PE is concerned, there is a need to creat e a skilled class of PE educators or trainers through the TOT, cascade model, a beginnin g of which was made by CBSE in the PEC program. (Physical Education Cards) PE card s are age appropriate tools for implementing the PE curriculum using a cross-curric ular approach. 104 Chapter 8 Assessment for the Strands The strands conceptualized will be assessed interna lly through a blended approach of self-assessment and teacher assessment. There will be no separate theory part as was the tr end earlier. Students will be assessed in each of the strands on the basis of evidence such as - direct observation, checklists, and/or use of video . In case of SEWA Projects Students plan and conduct projects and communicate their fin dings. Evidence in this case can include journals, diaries, essays, laboratory repor ts, oral presentations and/or the use of video, etc. Maximum marks allotted for each strand are given in table 1.1. SEWA can be assessed on the basis of the rubric developed by the class teac her for the project chosen by the class for that year. Each game/ sports/ activity should b roadly be assessed on the basis of following criteria and marks should be given accord ingly: Participation in game/ sports/ SEWA/ activity Basic Knowledge & understanding of the game/ sports / SEWA/ activity Skills learnt/ development or enhancement of skills of game/ sports/ SEWA/ activity Motivation to excel Improvement in performance (competing with self) Team spirit Development/ enhancement of o Organizational skills for game/ sports/ SEWA/ activ ity o Leadership skills/ qualities Sensitivity towards o CWSN (children with special needs) / inclusion in t eam o Sensitivity towards gender in team "}
