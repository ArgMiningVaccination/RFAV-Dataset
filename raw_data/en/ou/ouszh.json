You can catch it from using a shared shower, walking barefoot at a public pool, or even getting a pedicure. It can grow quickly under your toenail and cause the nail to thicken and crumble. If the toenail fungus is severe, you should visit your local foot doctor for treatment. However, you can also try a natural toenail fungus treatment to solve the issue without chemicals or medicines. Here are six of the best natural remedies: 1. White Vinegar White vinegar other wise known as Acetic Acid can help eliminate fungus when diluted in lukewarm water. The acidity of vinegar creates an environment that most fungus find in hospital and may help eliminate a fungal toenail infection. 2. Listerine and White Vinegar The thymol and menthol in Listerine evaporate quickly and cause dehydration of superficial fungus infecting a toe nail plate. Soak for 15-20 minutes 3-4 days per week. 3. Tea Tree Oil Tea tree oil is a popular home remedy for many skin infections, including fungal infections. Dab a few drops of the oil onto your toenails twice a day, or mix a few drops of oil with some water and soak your entire foot. 4. Urea Paste You can buy over-the-counter urea paste to dissolve the infected portion of the toenail. Then, use an over-the-counter antifungal cream to prevent infection in the area. Before you do this, though, you should consult your local foot doctor. 5. Pau D'arco Tea Pau d'arco is the bark of a South American tree. It can work just as effectively as prescription antifungal medication if you soak your feet in the tea for 20 minutes twice a day. 6. Vicks VapoRub Vicks VapoRub has some antifungal ingredients, including: - Menthol - Camphor - Eucalyptus oil Apply a small amount of Vicks VapoRub to the affected toenail once a day, and it should eliminate or greatly reduce the infection. 7. Time Some fungal nail infections will grow out on their own. Infections caused by excessive use of nail polish or trauma may grown out if you are patient. You may have to wait as much as 12-18 months but many infections can grow out with your nail if you create a healthy environment for the nail to grow normally. Home treatments are inconsistently effective and need to performed regularly for extended periods of time. Our local foot doctor can provide you with more information about toenail fungus treatment.
