Herd Immunity COVID-19 vaccines in India Who can take the vaccine? What to expect during and after vaccination? Vaccine Hesitancy Determinants of Vaccine Hesitancy Scheme of presentation 3 Vaccination Vaccinationis a simple, safe, and effective way of protecting people against harmful diseases using body's natural defenses, before they come into contact with them. How does it work? Recognizes the invading germ, such as the virus or bacteria. Produces antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced naturally by the immune system to fight disease. Remembers the disease and how to fight it. If you are then exposed to the germ in the future, your immune system can quickly destroy it before you become unwell. Once exposed to one or more doses of a vaccine, we typically remain protected against a disease for a long time. 5 Herd Immunity Herd immunity is the indirect protection from an infectious disease that happens when immunity develops in a population either through vaccination or through previous infection. 6 COVID-19 Vaccines in India Covaxin Covishield Sputnik V Type of vaccine Inactivated Corona virus Recombinant (Viral vector) Recombinant (Viral vector) Manufacturer Bharat Biotech Oxford-AstraZaneca, UK Gamalaya Institute, Moscow Number of doses 2 2 2 Schedule for second dose 4 to 6 weeks 12 weeks 21 days Efficacy 78% 70% 92% 7 Who can take the vaccine? All individuals above 18 years of age are eligible to take the vaccine. Who cannot take the vaccine? Persons with history of: 1. Anaphylactic or allergic reaction to a previous dose of COVID-19 vaccine 2. Immediate or delayed-onset anaphylaxis or allergic reaction to vaccines or injectable therapies, pharmaceutical products, food-items etc. 8 Who can take the vaccine? Wait for 3 months for the vaccine if 1. You had contracted COVID-19 2. If given anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma 3. Contracted COVID-19 after getting first dose of vaccine Also, wait for 4-8 weeks if acutely unwell and hospitalized (with or without intensive care) due to any illness. 9 Who can take the vaccine? There is no need for screening of the vaccine recipients. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all lactating women and pregnant women. COVID-19 vaccines are safe and efficacious in adults with comorbidities like the cardiac, neurological, pulmonary, metabolic, renal and malignancies etc. In fact, the benefit of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 disease and death is for those who have these comorbidities. An individual can donate blood after 14 days of receiving the vaccine or testing RT-PCR negative, if suffering from COVID-19. 10 During vaccination 1. Follow COVID appropriate behaviour (mask, hand hygiene and physical distancing) at the vaccination site. 2. Assessment done by medical professional to check eligibility. 3. Administration of vaccine. 4. Waiting for 15-30 minutes to ensure there are no unexpected reactions. 11 Post vaccination Other side effects Covishield\u00ae: Some mild symptoms may occur like fatigue, myalgia, malaise, pyrexia, chills and arthralgia, nausea. Very rare events of demyelinating disorders have been reported following vaccination with this vaccine but without the causal relationship establishment. Covaxin\u00ae: Some mild symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, dizziness-giddiness, tremor, sweating, cold and cough. COMMON SIDE EFFECTS 13 Vaccine Hesitancy What is Vaccine hesitancy ? It refers to delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccine services. Vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specific, varying across time, place and vaccines. Low uptake does not always mean vaccine hesitancy It could be low because of poor availability e.g. lack of vaccine (stock outs), lack of offer or access to vaccines, unacceptable travel/distances to reach immunization clinics, poor vaccine program communication, etc. 14 Determinants of Vaccine Hesitancy Trust in vaccines, in the system that delivers and in the policy makers Physical availability, affordability, willingness-to-pay, geographical accessibility, health literacy affect uptake Low perceived risk of disease Vaccination not deemed as necessary preventive action Other responsibilities seen as more important Important References 16 MY GOV https://www.mygov.in/ PIRAMAL SWASTHYA https://www.piramalswasthya.org/ MINISTRY OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE https://www.mohfw.gov.in/ UNICEF IEC Warehouse https://iec.unicef.in/category/index/covid-19 COVID-19 news by Ministry of "}
