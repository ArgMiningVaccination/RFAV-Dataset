Anthroposophy: A Concise Introduction to Rudolf Steiner's Spiritual Philosophy $ 16.00 USD Rudolf Steiner's work is recognized today largely due to the prominence of the international Steiner school movement, biodynamic agriculture, anthroposophical (holistic) medicine, and so on. However, the comprehensive spiritual philosophy that stands behind these practical initiatives is not so well known. In this concise presentation, based on years of giving introductory courses on the subject, van Oort presents an overview of key aspects of Steiner's thought. He deals with concepts such as body, soul and spirit, the relationship between man and animal, and the evolution of consciousness. The latter subject opens up panoramic vistas of human development in the form of successive cultural periods extending over thousands of years. - Written by Henk van Oort - 96 pages - 0.5 x 5.5 x 8.5 inches - Published 2008 - Paperback "}
