At our Melbourne based Acupuncture and Chinese medicine clinic we use mindfulness as a nice little addition to many of our acupuncture sessions. We find including mindfulness during an acupuncture session especially useful to introduce mindfulness and meditation to our patients. Although we use a few different mindfulness apps such Headspace and Smiling Mind, the one we regularly use in the clinic is one called [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com/). This app allows you to be able to choose a from a variety of different guided meditations based upon how much time you have. Since introducing mindfulness in our acupuncture sessions our patients have reported feeling more relaxed and finding guided meditation less overwhelming to begin. A more detailed discussion of the different apps can be found in our article [Acupuncture and Anxiety 3 Top Tips](https://www.coburgchinesemedicine.com.au/acupuncture-blog/2018/2/27/acupuncture-and-anxiety-top-3-tips). Mindfulness for Stress and Anxiety Management Today we will look at our 3 favourite guided mindfulness sessions - - a 7 minute guided meditation - a 10 minute guided meditation - an almost 15 minute guided meditation What we aim to convey to you the reader is that mindfulness can be easy, accessible and doesn't really take that much time. You are likely to spend more time on the toilet ithroughout the day than doing these sessions. In actual fact we will often suggest people who are having a hard time during their workday to take their phone and headphones into the toilet to do a bit of mindfulness. Now of course this may be a bit of stretch for some, but it is worthwhile to provide options. For many people it is just about getting in the habit of doing something, once the behaviour becomes routine, it becomes much easier to continue doing. Our Top 3 Guided Mediation Picks Manoj Dias - Listening meditation (7min) [Manoj ](http://www.manojdias.com.au/whoami/)is a Melbourne based meditation and mindfulness instructor. He has his own Collingwood based Mindfulness studio called [A-Space,](https://a-space.com.au/studio/) where he conducts classes. He has learnt from many different teachers, including both Jack Kornfield and Sharon Salzberg, who also appear on our list. We have found both personally, and anecdotally, that an American accent may be disjointing for some when attempting guided mediation. Manoj's warm Australian voice is the perfect solution to guide you through to a deeper relaxation. Jack Kornfield - Breathing Meditation (9mins) [Jack](https://jackkornfield.com/) has been involved in teaching meditation for at least 4 decades. He is a prolific writer and is active within the buddhist community. He also has his own podcast called [Heart Wisdom](https://beherenownetwork.com/category/jack-kornfield/). This particular guided meditation we have chosen is very popular especially for those who just wish to concentrate on their breath throughout their meditation session. Jack is very skillful and he gently brings you back to the breath when your mind wanders. Sharon Salzberg - Breathing Meditation (14min) Sharon is a contemporary of Jack Kornfield's and she, together with him and another meditation practitioner, Joseph Goldstein, established the insight meditation society. Sharon is a well respected teacher of Vipassana and Metta Meditation. Her podcast the Metta Hour is also on the same [podcast network](https://beherenownetwork.com/category/sharon-salzberg/) as Jack's. Sharon's guided meditation is for those able to make a little bit more time in their day. A Parting Note We may sound like a broken record, but give guided meditation and mindfulness a go. Look at your calendar and see where you can slot a small session in on most days, or even put some reminders in your phone to beep at you on the same time, each day. A great way to include some mindfulness is at the end of a gym session. Find a quiet space and pop in your headphones, even better do it in the car before heading home from work. You only need 5-10 minutes to take some time for yourself. The insight timer app even has 1-3 min express mindfulness sessions. Start small and achievable, and work your way up. We wish you the best on your mindfulness journey.
