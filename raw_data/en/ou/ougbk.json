RD.COM, VIA MERCHANT (3) While lots of products claiming to be \"natural\" or \"non-toxic,\" if you are looking for truly natural cleaning products, read the fine print. \"Generally speaking, natural cleaning products are solutions with natural, non-toxic ingredients without harsh chemicals or synthetic fragrances,\" explains Alicia Sokolowski, president and co-CEO of AspenClean. \"They are safer and healthier alternatives to traditional cleaning products, often containing harsh chemicals that harm people and the environment.\" The [Environmental Working Group](https://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/content/cleaners_and_health) (EWG) suggests avoiding products with problematic ingredients like formaldehyde, sodium hypochlorite, ammonium hydroxide and Borax and boric acid, which may negatively impact your health in a variety of ways. \"Instead, natural cleaning products feature various ingredients, such as vinegar, baking soda, lemon juice, essential oils and plant-based surfactants,\" says Sokolowski. \"These ingredients effectively clean and disinfect surfaces without leaving behind any harmful residues or fumes.\" Natural cleaning products are also typically biodegradable and designed to be environmentally friendly, and safe to use around children, pets and people with allergies or sensitivities to harsh chemicals. \"They often come in recyclable packaging and are produced using sustainable manufacturing practices,\" adds Sokolowski. \"Overall, natural cleaning products are a fantastic option for anyone who wants to clean their home effectively while minimizing their environmental impact and reducing their exposure to harmful chemicals,\" she says.

Avoid products with artificial fragrances, colors or harsh chemicals like ammonia, [bleach](https://www.rd.com/list/bleach-mistakes/)or chlorine. - Certifications: \"Look for products that have been certified by recognized third-party organizations like EcoCert, Leaping Bunny or the Environmental Working Group (EWG),\" she suggests. These certifications ensure that the products meet strict environmental and health standards. - Packaging: Consider the product's packaging and look for options that use biodegradable or recycled materials. \"Avoid products with excess packaging or that come in single-use plastic containers,\" Sokolowski says. - Performance: \"Natural cleaning products should be effective, so look for reviews and recommendations from other users to ensure that the products work well,\" says Sokolowski. - Price: Expect to pay more for natural cleaning products than traditional ones, \"but they are also more cost-effective in the long run,\" Sokolowski points out. \"Consider the value for money and the overall impact on the environment and personal health.\" - Brand reputation: Sokolowski suggests looking for brands with a good reputation for producing high-quality, effective and eco-friendly cleaning products. Types of natural cleaning products Just like traditional cleaning products, there are many types of natural cleaning products. There are all-purpose cleaning products available for many different surfaces, and then other products specific to a type of cleaning or place in the house. There are natural cleaning products for [pets and carpets](https://www.rd.com/list/best-carpet-cleaner-for-pets/), hardwood floors, upholstery, stainless steel, bathrooms, glass surfaces, grout and dishes.

Yes, natural cleaning products are effective at cleaning, but it depends on the specific product and the task at hand. Many natural cleaning products are for tough cleaning tasks and work just as well as chemical cleaners. For example, natural all-purpose cleaners and disinfectants containing plant-based ingredients like citrus or tea tree oil effectively remove dirt and kill germs. It's also important to note that using natural cleaning products requires a different approach than using chemical cleaners. For example, natural cleaners may require a longer dwell time. Why should you use natural cleaning products? For one, they are better for your health. \"Many conventional cleaning products contain harsh chemicals that harm our health. These chemicals may cause respiratory problems, skin irritation and other health issues,\" Sokolowski says. On the other hand, natural cleaning products feature non-toxic, biodegradable and safer ingredients for you and your family. Natural cleaning products are also better for the environment. \"Conventional cleaning products often contain chemicals that harm the environment. When these chemicals wash down the drain, they pollute our waterways and harm wildlife,\" states Sokolowski. Natural cleaning products contain renewable resources and are biodegradable, which means they break down naturally in the environment. Natural cleaning products are also extremely versatile and clean a wide range of surfaces, including floors, [countertops](https://www.rd.com/article/how-to-clean-countertops/) and bathrooms. \"They also wash clothes and dishes, making them a versatile alternative to conventional cleaning products,\" Sokolowski adds. Are all-natural cleaning products safe? Natural cleaning products are generally safe. However, some natural cleaning products may contain ingredients that may be irritating or harmful, especially for people with allergies or sensitivities. \"Some natural cleaning products may contain essential oils that may cause allergic reactions in some people,\" Sokolowski points out. So, to ensure the safety of natural cleaning products, it's important to carefully read the ingredient labels and use the products according to the manufacturer's instructions. \"It's also a good idea to test new products on a small area before using them on a larger scale,\" she adds.
