Based on UniversityHospital's policy, read the fictitiousscenario that was posed in the lastissue of Upstate Update and answerthe question \"Should law enforcementbe notified?\" A patient presents to UniversityHospital bleeding heavily from awound to her chest. She stated she wasin a fight with a friend who stabbedher with a sharp object.Answer: Hospitals and physiciansa re re q u i red under law to re p o rtwounds appearing to be inflicted by aknife or sharp object which are likelyto or may result in death. The deter-mination of whether the wound mayresult in death is made by a healthcareprovider and once determined that thisis the case a member of the EmergencyRoom staff will contact law enforce-ment. She also states that her friend,whom she does not name, has awarrant out for his arrest. Answer: Only if the patientrequests that we contact law enforce-ment so she can assist them withlocating her friend can we do so. The patient is 19-years old anddoesn't want anyone to know she is infor care because she is involved in gangactivity and the police are looking forher as a witness to a possible crime.Answer: We are not permitted tocontact law enforcement, but if lawenforcement comes to us to confirmwhereabouts of the patient or with arequest for information because theyhave knowledge that the patient is herewe may (are not required to) disclosesome specific types of information asoutlined on the flow diagram. Theadministrative supervisor must becontacted regarding the inquiry andwill coordinate the decision-makingprocess. While helping her up onto theexam table a green leafy substance in aplastic bag falls out of her pocket.Answer: The University HospitalPublic Safety Office must be notifiedand they in turn will take possession ofsuspected contraband material. Staffmay provide limited inform a t i o nincluding the patient's name, ro o mnumber and address so that thesuspected contraband can be labeledappropriately. The University Police inconsultation with HospitalAdministration makes the decisionwhether outside law enforcement willbe notified. Patients trust that when they cometo University Hospital for health careand share their confidential healthinformation, it will be afforded theappropriate privacy protection. If thisbond of trust is broken patients may behesitant to seek health care or nots h a re vital information needed toprovide them with appropriate care. University Hospital also has anobligation to provide a safe patientcare environment. It is a delicatebalancing act that can sometimes beconfusing. For this reason it is impor-tant that staff be aware of and consultUniversity Hospital's policy beforemaking a disclosure of patient infor-mation to law enforcement.
