Even the [best TVs](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/best-tv) are magnets for dust in the air, which can cause glare and dull the picture. And laptops that constantly get stuffed into backpacks are bound to pick up grime. Depending on what kind of TV or monitor you have, the exact best way to clean it might change. But in general, these are the best ways to clean pretty much any display. Advertisement Advertisement How to clean a TV screen or monitor Before you do anything, remember to be gentle. TV screens and monitors are both sensitive, and high-end TVs, like OLED and QLED displays, tend to scratch easily. Take care, or you risk causing problems bigger than just dirt and dust. - Unplug your TV or monitor before cleaning it. Turning off and unplugging the screen reduces any chance of electrical damage, and the dark screen makes it easier to see dust, dirt, hair, and grime. If you can't unplug the display, just turn it off. - Use a soft, dry cloth. [Microfiber cloths](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biauto-52265-20&h=24ebb1afe95eb957a59110b1fe3b8aa1e8564cc3c977be396e5d02073aa6ec97&postID=6304ee6c77ad0bf5744e1d37&postSlug=guides%2Ftech%2Fhow-to-clean-tv-screen&site=bi&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB000XEGEWG&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false)are a great choice. You can pick them up cheaply online or in stores, and their soft material grabs dust and hair without scratching or leaving fibers behind. If a soft cloth came with your TV or monitor when you bought it, use that. - Slowly wipe the screen in a circular pattern. If your TV is wobbly, you can hold the cloth with one hand and support your TV with the other. Again, be gentle: Don't apply too much force with the cloth or push on your screen. - If you need to clean the screen more thoroughly, use a small amount of distilled water. Distilled water doesn't have any minerals in it, reducing the risk of scratching your screen. Don't ever pour or spray water directly onto your screen. Instead, dampen your cloth slightly and gently wipe the mess. For caked-on messes, you can use a tiny drop of mild dish soap on your cloth. And after you've cleaned it, go over the screen once more with a soft dry cloth just to be safe. - Wipe the sides and back of the TV. Your screen isn't the only area that collects dust \u2014 wipe away any debris you can see on the frame and cables, especially in the back. You'll also want to wipe down the ports and plugs. If you're using any water, be sure to let everything dry before you start plugging cables in again. - Don't use harsh chemicals. Harsh chemicals can damage your screen, and any moisture that drips into gaps in the frame can potentially cause an electrical fire. If you feel that distilled water isn't enough, you can try specially made screen cleaning solutions, [like this "}
