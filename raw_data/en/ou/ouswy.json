People at high risk of flu complications include: If you get the flu, certain over-the-counter medication can be used to treat your illness. If you have a prescription from your doctor, be sure to take the medication as prescribed. When used for treatment, these medications can mean the difference between a milder or a more serious illness, such as pneumonia, possibly resulting in a hospital stay. Everyone 6 months and older should receive a yearly flu vaccine, with rare exceptions. The flu vaccine causes your body to make antibodies that fight the flu, decreasing your risk of becoming sick with the flu. Since the viruses in the vaccine are not live, they cannot cause the flu. The flu vaccine is recommended annually, as immunity decreases over time. It takes about two weeks for the vaccine to be effective, so it is important to get the vaccine before the flu starts spreading in your area. There are several different types of flu vaccines available. Rite Aid offers the following flu vaccines: Quadrivalent flu vaccine - this vaccine protects against two Influenza A strains and two Influenza B strains. For those 65 years of age and older, there are two types of flu vaccines that are designed to provide a greater immune response. Ask your [Rite Aid pharmacist](https://locations.riteaid.com/locations/search.html) which vaccine is right for you. Common side effects of the flu vaccine include: soreness, redness or swelling at the injection site, fever, headache, nausea, and muscle aches. Less common side effects may include: fainting, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and allergic reactions (e.g., Egg allergy). Egg Allergy: Since eggs are used in the production of some flu vaccines, those with a life-threatening egg allergy should only receive a flu shot in a medical facility that is prepared to handle a severe allergic reaction (difficulty breathing, swelling of the eyes or lips, wheezing). Those who have experienced only hives from a flu shot may still receive the vaccine. Yes. Those who have been vaccinated may still get the flu. This can be caused by one or more of the following: In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviews the flu data and determines the combination of viruses most likely to prevent the flu each year. Despite the amount of research that goes into the flu vaccine composition, the virus is constantly changing. Therefore, the vaccine may not be a perfect match to the current circulating virus. The good news is, those who have been vaccinated generally have a milder case of flu than those who are unvaccinated. Common flu symptoms may include fever or chills, muscle aches, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, headache and fatigue/tiredness. If you have flu symptoms get plenty of rest, drink fluids, and manage symptoms with over-the-counter [OTC medications](https://www.riteaid.com/shop/medicine-health/cough-cold-flu) when appropriate. If symptoms continue to worsen, contact your healthcare provider. There are several products available to treat flu symptoms. Prescription medications can help lessen fever and flu symptoms, shorten the length of flu illness, and reduce the risk of complications. It is best if they are taken within 2 days of the start of flu symptoms. The four FDA approved prescription medications for the treatment of flu are oseltamivir ibuprofen can be used to treat fever, headache, body aches, and sore throat. Products containing dextromethorphan (a cough suppressant) and/or guaifenesin (an expectorant) are helpful for cough. Runny/stuffy nose symptoms can be treated with an antihistamine and/or decongestant. Be sure to always read the product label to understand the active ingredient(s), uses, warnings, doses, and directions.

When you are sick, you should stay at home, wash your hands often and avoid contact with other people to minimize the chance of infecting others. You may return to work, school, etc. once you have been without a fever for 24 hours (without the use of fever reducing medications). If you have flu symptoms and are in a high risk group, contact your healthcare provider. If you are not in a high risk group but have symptoms, get plenty of rest and drink fluids, and manage symptoms with Over-the-counter (OTC) medications when appropriate. People diagnosed with the flu or with suspected flu infection and at high risk of serious flu complications should seek treatment immediately.
