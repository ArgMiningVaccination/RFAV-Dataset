In the winter, we are inside a lot more, giving us more opportunities to pass illnesses to one another. Also, cold air irritates the mucus membranes in the respiratory tract, which makes them more susceptible to invasion by viruses and other respiratory pathogens. This decreases the body's natural defenses to fight infections. What sets the flu apart from a cold is a high fever, around 102 degrees, achiness and overall illness. Vomiting and diarrhea are also not present in the common cold but can be symptoms of the flu. Children up to 8 years old require two doses of the flu vaccine given about one month apart, but only the first season they are vaccinated. After that, they need only one flu vaccine dose per year. The most common side effects of the flu shot are: Yes, flu vaccines are only effective for one season, therefore getting the flu shot in previous years does not protect you from getting the flu in future years. Flu viruses change often and require a new vaccine. The level of prevention the flu shot provides varies each year. If you still end up getting the flu, the vaccine will help you by minimizing symptoms of the flu, leading to faster recovery. In addition to receiving a flu shot, remember to follow these preventive measures to protect against the flu: You can get the flu anytime in the year, although we see more cases of the flu between October and as late as April or May. Since there are typically multiple peaks in the flu season, we recommend everyone get a flu shot, especially those at high risks, such as children and the elderly. Seasonal flu affects tens of thousands of Americans each year. It's possible to get the flu at the same time as COVID-19. Protecting yourself and others is more important than ever. Please do your part by getting a flu shot & following other CDC guidelines. Find the nearest Mercy location offering "}
