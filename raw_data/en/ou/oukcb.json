The core treatment principle can be accomplished through acupuncture treatments, Chinese herbal medicine and many at home measures. According to TCM, blood is not simply a physical substance running through arteries and veins. Rather it is the substance that nourishes and lubricates the body as well as circulates the nutritive Qi and vital energy. Nutritious bone broths is a easy at-home tool to build blood and improve overall health and wellness. Last month we shared our [winter tea tonic](https://www.northshoreacupunctureandnaturalmedicine.com/north-shore-acupuncture-blog/winter-tea-tonic) and this month we would like to share our bone broth recipe with you. Ingredients: 1) 3-5 lb of bones (ideally a mix of \"cuts\" pasture raised from a local farm) 2) 2 yellow onions (peeled and halted) 3) 1 bunch of celery (bottom removed) 4) 3-4 large carrots (snapped in half) 5) 2-3 garlic cloves (peeled) 6) 3-4 Shiitake mushrooms 7) Olive oil 8) Salt (i.e. celtic, sea salt, grey salt, etc - avoid table salt) 9) 2 tablespoons of apple cider vingear 10) Water Recipe: 1) Preheat oven to 425 F 2) Place bones, onions, celery, carrots, garlic and shiitake mushrooms into a heavy bottomed pan and coat in olive oil and generous amount of salt and toss until all ingredients are covered in olive oil and salt. Roast for about 20 minutes or until bones and vegetables \"appear roasted\" \" and then remove. 3) Place bones and vegetables into large stock pot and fill about 3/4 full with water and add 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. Bring to boil and then simmer for 8 - 48 hours. For those who need a broth more quickly an instant pot or equivalent can be used. When I use an 8 quart instant pot, I divide the ingredients in half, fill to the \"max line\" and cook for 1 hour and let the instant pot go through a natural release the whole process is about 90 minutes per batch. Both methods produce a high quality bone broth far superior to store bought bone broth. However, we believe it is important to note that the long and slow method results in the highest quality broth.
