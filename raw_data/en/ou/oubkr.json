Composed of fire and water, Pitta dosha governs metabolism and transformation in the body, including digestion. Pitta is associated with heat, and its effects are especially felt during the hot summer, from July to October. Whether you have a lot of Pitta in your constitution or not, you need to pay attention to pacifying Pitta during the summer. Signs of an aggravated [Pitta](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/understanding-pitta-dosha) include excess stomach acid, heartburn, skin eruptions and irritability. Following a Pitta-pacifying diet can help keep this fiery element in balance. A Pitta-pacifying diet What's the first thing you reach for on a hot summer day\u2014a cold drink? We instinctively know that cool drinks and cool foods help balance Pitta and replenish fluid levels in the body. But if a drink is ice-cold, it will douse your digestive fire and disrupt digestion, so it's best to avoid iced drinks, especially during meals. Also stay away from carbonated drinks, because they slow down digestion. Freshly-blended fruit juices and nectars drunk at room temperature are nutritious, satisfying and delicious. Grapes, sweet pineapple and watermelon are some refreshing choices. To keep Pitta in balance, favor the sweet, [bitter and astringent tastes](https://mapi.com/blogs/articles/the-importance-of-bitter-and-astringent-tastes-for-balanced-nutrition) and avoid salty, sour and hot spicy foods. Sweet foods include rice and bread. Milk, butter and ghee are all cooling foods. Fully-ripe sweet juicy fruits like melons, cherries, grapes, pears and mangoes, and vegetables such as cucumber, broccoli, zucchini and asparagus are Pitta-pacifying. Minimize yogurt, sour cream, citrus fruits and spicy foods like cayenne. Also avoid vegetables with heating properties such as tomatoes, hot peppers, radishes, onions, garlic and spinach.
