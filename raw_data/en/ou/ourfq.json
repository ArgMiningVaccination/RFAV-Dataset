Descriptions of Wildlife Action Plan web tools. SDGFP has designed an easy -to-use interactive website that displays information from the Wildlife Action Plan and guides the user through various aspects of South Dakota landscapes, conservation challenges, and wildlife. The website was created during the Wildlife Action Plan Revision process, but the content will be dynamic as new information is created or found. The first web tool is tentatively called South Dakota Lands and Waters. The four main themes are Unique Habitats, Features and Attributes, Drive rs of Change, and Solutions. These themes are further divided into relevant topics that help tell the story of each theme. Points of interest are included with each topic to highlight interesting facts about South Dakota and provide more information about that particular topic. The following screen shots illustrate various components of the South Dakota Wildlife, Land and Water tool, including land ownership, land composition, and a sample feature - grazing practices.

The Species web tool initially displays all animal species in South Dakota by common name. The user can click on the name for more information, which includes a brief species description, distribution, key habitats, and conservation challenges. A search function allows the user to find a particular species by filtering the list accordingly (e.g. Eagle). The screen shot below illustrates current content for the American dipper. South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks Page 443 South Dakota Wildlife Action Plan Appendix M (continued). Descriptions of Wildlife Action Plan web tools . The Ecosite web tool allows the user to select an ecosite to determine the plant communities that could potentially exist within those boundaries . When the user selects a particular ecosite, the tool provides the Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) unit, the Ecosite name, and the Ecosite ID. Also listed are the dominant plant community for that ecosite, fire and grazing regime, and the average annual productivity in pounds per acre. The user can filter the results based on the disturbance state ( i.e. A, B, C, or D) and the growth form ( i.e. Forb/Herbs, Grasses & Grass -likes, and Shrubs). After the user selects an ecosite, the tool displays the common and scientific names of the plant community, minimum/maximum percent composition, and the climate change effect by 2099 (Grasses & Grass -likes only). The screen shot below provides an example of the ecosite web tool. South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks Page 444 South Dakota Wildlife Action Plan Appendix N. Past, Present, and Future Climates for South Dakota - Observed climatic variation from 1895-2010 and projected climate change to 2099. Authors Dr. Mark A. Cochrane and Christopher J. Moran (Executive Summary) . Planet Earth is warming, as shown by rising sea levels, falling levels of glacial and sea ice, and increasing temperatures within the lower atmosphere and s urface waters of the world's oceans. In the last 30 years, global temperatures have risen by roughly 0.6\u00b0C (1.0\u00b0F) concurrently with increases in the atmospheric concentrations of several known greenhouse gases (GHGs). Changes in average weather patterns that are maintained over long periods are what define climate change. Global climate changes do not proceed equally in all regions or at an average rate through time. Local climate changes will play a large role in shaping ecosystems by providing selection pressure for species or geno - and phenotypes that can thrive under a region's new conditions. We present here an analysis based upon observed climate changes since 1895 and a 16 Global Climate Model- ensemble depicting projected climate changes for low and high GHG emission scenarios between now and the end of this century, for each of the 19 Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) in the state of South Dakota. Since the climate normals (1961 -1990) were established for the existing Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs ), average temperatures have increased between 0.1 \u00b0C and 0.5 \u00b0C, and average precipitation has varied from a 0.5% decrease to a 14.9% increase in individual MRLAs for the most recent climate normals (1981 -2010). Downscaled global climate models project a co ntinuation of observed trajectories with increases in both average temperature and precipitation. However, average precipitation is, for the most part, projected to stay within the range of variability observed since 1895, while average temperatures will p ush beyond historical ranges. For individual MRLAs in the 2021 -2050 climatic period, an increase in average temperature of between 1.6 - 1.8\u00b0C and 1.5 - 1.6\u00b0C is expected for the A2 and B1 greenhouse gas emission scenarios, respectively, with disproportion ate warming in the summer (June, July, August) months of up to 2 \u00b0C. Average precipitation will increase from 3.9 - 7.8% and 4.5 - 7.2% for the A2 and B1 greenhouse gas emission scenarios, respectively, with the greatest increases predicted in the spring (M arch, April, May ) months of up to 12.9%. For individual MRLAs in the 2070 -2099 climatic period, an increase in average temperature of between 4.3 - 4.6\u00b0C and 2.7 - 2.9\u00b0C is expected for the A2 and B1 greenhouse gas emission scenarios, respectively, with disproportionate warming in the summer months of up to 5.2 \u00b0C. Average precipitation will increase from 10.3 - 17.7% and 7.5 - 9.3% for the A2 and B1 greenhouse gas emission scenarios, respectively, with the greatest increases predicted in the spring months of up to 31.2%. South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks Page 445 South Dakota Wildlife Action Plan Appendix O. Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment of Aquatic Species of Greatest Conservation Need in South Dakota. Author Dr. Andrew Burgess (Executive Summary). As part of the revision of the South Dakota Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Plan, also known as the South Dakota Wildlife Action Plan, the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks chose to consider the impacts of projected climate change on aquatic species of greatest conservation need. This analysis was contracte d to a former aquatic biologist with the agency. The primary tool used in this analysis was NatureServe's Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI), which measures vulnerability to climate change based on exposure to projected future changes in temperature , precipitation, and moisture across a species' range and the species' sensitivity to potential changes based on certain physiological, genetic, and life history variables. The tool does not consider species status rankings, which should be evaluated in combination with the CCVI tool. Twenty fish species of greatest conservation need were assessed; 14 were found vulnerable to the impacts of future climate change. Eight species were found highly or extremely vulnerable. Six of these species are considered d isjunct species in the state because they depend on restricted habitat conditions in isolated areas (Longnose Sucker, Mountain Sucker, and Lake Chub) or because they are glacial relicts (Northern Redbelly Dace, Northern Pearl Dace, and Finescale Dace). Pallid Sturgeon, Sicklefin Chub, and Sturgeon Chub, are also vulnerable to future climate change. Nine freshwater mussel species were assessed; 4 were found vulnerable to the impacts of future climate change. Two species, Higgins eye and elktoe, were found highly vulnerable. Four aquatic insects that are included on the species of greatest conservation need list were not analyzed due to a lack of necessary specific information. This analysis is considered a starting point for the assessment of climate change impacts on aquatic species of greatest conservation need in South Dakota, representing only one potential limiting factor to aquatic species. The tool's predictive capability is expected to improve with consideration of additional data. Resource managers will also benefit from a better understanding of climate change impacts at a broader habitat sca le, which is beyond the scope of this initial analysis.

Existing federal, state and private programs to assist collaborative efforts and individual landowners in maintaining and restoring ecosystem diversity in South Dakota. FEDERAL PROGRAMS U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) *Funding for some of these programs is provided through the federal Farm Bill and is not guaranteed on a long term basis. Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) - A voluntary program offering landowners the opportunity to protect, restore, and enhance wetlands and protect grasslands and working farms and ranches on their property. The NRCS provides technical and financial assistance to elig ible landowners. Landowners have the opportunity of enrolling eligible lands through permanent or 30-year easements. The program is offered on a continuous sign -up basis and is available Statewide. This program offers landowners an opportunity to establish , at minimal cost, long -term conservation and wildlife habitat enhancement practices and protection. Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and Continuous Conservation Reserve Program (CCRP) - Provides technical and financial assistance to eligible farmers and ranchers to address soil, water, and related natural resource concerns on their lands in an environmentally beneficial and cost-effective manner. The program provides assistance to farmers and ranchers in complying with Federal, State, and tribal environm ental laws, and encourages environmental enhancement. The program is funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). CRP is administered by the Farm Service Agency, with NRCS providing technical land eligibility determinations, conservation planning and practice implementation. The Conservation Reserve Program reduces soil erosion, protects the Nation's ability to produce food and fiber, reduces sedimentation in streams and lakes, improves water quality, establishes wildlife habitat, and enhances for est and wetland resources. It encourages farmers to convert highly erodible cropland or other environmentally sensitive acreage to vegetative cover, such as tame or native grasses, wildlife plantings, trees, filterstrips, or riparian buffers. Farmers receive an annual rental payment for the term of the multi -year contract. Cost sharing is provided to establish the vegetative cover practices. Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) - Provides a voluntary conservation program for farmers and ranchers that promotes agricultural production and environmental quality as compatible goals. EQIP offers financial and technical assistance for eligible farmers and ranchers to install or implement structural and land management practices on eligible agricultural land. Any farmer or rancher who is engaged in livestock or agricultural production on eligible land may participate in the EQIP program. EQIP may provide cost -share for implementing certain conservation practices important to improving and maintaining the health of South Dakota's natural resources. A minimum of 5% of EQIP funds must be expend ed on wildlife habitat. South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks Page 492 South Dakota Wildlife Action Plan Appendix S (continued). Existing federal, state, and private programs to assist collaborative efforts and individual landowners in maintaining and restoring ecosystem diversity in South Dakota. Conservation Security Programs (CSP) - A voluntary program that provides financial and technical assistance to promote the conservation and improvement of soil, water, air, energy, plant and animal life, and other conservation purposes on Tribal and private working lands. Working lands include cropland, grassland, prairie land, improved pasture, and range land, as well as forested land that is an incidental part of an agriculture operation. The program provides equitable access to benefits to all producers, regardless of size of operation, crops produced, or geographic location. U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service North American Wetlands Conservation Act Grants Program - Establ ished to support the long- term protection of wetlands and associated uplands habitats needed by waterfowl and other migratory birds in North America. Projects must support long- term wetlands acquisition, restoration, and/or enhancement. Partners for Fish a nd Wildlife - Supports voluntary habitat conservation on private and Tribal land through public -private partnerships. Projects are typically designed to restore, enhance, or establish grassland and wetland habitats. A common thread through every South Dako ta Partners project is the ability to be flexible and response enough to accommodate the site -specific needs and concerns of landowners. Since 1991, this approach has resulted in over 6,100 South Dakota landowners becoming valued Partners for Fish and Wild life and the number of new landowner requests for assistance continues to accelerate. Private Stewardship Program - Provides grants and other assistance on a competitive basis to individuals and groups for voluntary conservation efforts to benefit federall y listed, proposed, or candidate species, or other at -risk species on private lands . Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund - Includes several programs including Conservation Grants, Recovery Land Acquisition, Habitat Conservation Planning Assist ance, and Habitat Conservation Plan Land Acquisition. All aimed at protecting endangered, threatened, proposed, or candidate species. Landowner Incentive Program (LIP) - funded through the State of South Dakota Habitat Fence Construction - This practice is provided to protect certain high quality and normally high expense habitat practices from livestock damage. Although most practices \u2014even expensive ones \u2014 normally will not require fencing, occasionally practices are designed in such a way that require some type of protection. In those cases, the department may provide cost share to help the participating landowner in providing the needed protection. Native Warm Season Grass Establishment - This project will establish NWSG for wildlife by seeding or inter -seeding to provide high quality roosting and escape cover for birds, especially in months with heavy snow -cover. It will also provide cover for ground nesting birds, provide broodrearing cover for ground -nesting birds, and provide grassland habitat for variou s wildlife species.

Existing federal, state, and private programs to assist collaborative efforts and individual landowners in maintaining and restoring ecosystem diversity in South Dakota. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest S ervice Forest Legacy Program (FLP) - A federal program in partnership with states ; supports state efforts to protect environmentally sensitive forest lands. Designed to encourage the protection of privately owned forest lands, FLP is an entirely voluntary program. To maximize the public benefits it achieves, the program focuses on the acquisition of partial interests in privately owned forest lands. Forest Stewardship Program (FSP ) - Provide technical assistance, through state forestry agencies, to non-indu strial private forest owners to encourage and enable active long -term forest management to provide timber, wildlife habitat, watershed protection, recreational opportunities and many other benefits for landowners and society, both now and in the future. STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA PROGRAMS South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks, Division of Wildlife Wetland and Grassland Habitat Program - This program implement s conservation practices on private land that benefit breeding waterfowl and other wetland or grassland dependent wildlife by assisting landowners with projects on working grasslands. Practices eligible for technical assistance and project cost share include: Wetland Restorations Wetland Creations & Enhancements Water Development Grassland/Grazing Enhancements Riparian Pastures Wildlife Friendly Fences Wildlife Partners Program - Voluntary program for private landowners interested in establishing habitat for wildlife by providing cost -share for habitat projects such as native gras s establishment, woody cover plantings, and food plots. One of the goals of this program is to assist landowners with the establishment of woody habitat to enhance winter cover for game and nongame wildlife. Large woody plantings with appropriate shrubs an d trees help ensure survival in the worst possible winter weather, afford vulnerable wildlife year- round protection from predators and provide important sources of food for a variety of wildlife.

Comments received during Plan review period (May 7 - June 6, 2014) and associated resolution of suggested input . From: Larry E. Lewis [ mailto:lew@nrctv.com ] Sent: Sunday, May 11, 2014 4:14 AM To: GFP Wild Info Cc: info@iwla.org Subject: The South Dakota Wildlife Action Plan Recently I have been watching with dismay as old tree groves, former building sites and wetlands are drained/destroyed.....most if it on private land where GF P and other public rights authorities have minimal authority to act on behalf of the public's interest. However, when the activity reaches the nearest public right -of-way (ROW) typically no one is there to represent the public interest and regulate activities. South Dakota is laced with public road systems and ROW's that are impacted by and often facilitate such destruction by virtue of the authorities involved not exercising their authority and responsibility to regulate activities like wetland drainage , and farming encroachment occurring within our public road ROW's. As a Wildlife Agency SDGFP shares this oversight responsibility with many other agencies, particularly township, county, state and federal highway authorities. Please commit staff and dollars to this very important need. High ag prices have caused habitat losses and aggressive behaviors in farming public ROW's that I witnessed in Minnesota. By the default practice of claiming you have no authority to regulate such activities you as an agency can destroy more habitat in the next few years that you will ever be able to purchase and protect via other means in an equal amount of time. What needs to happen: Rally support from others with an interest such as the Izaak Walton League, Pheasants Forever, Ducks Unlimited, US Fish & Wildlife, etc. Rally support from township, county, state and federal highway authorities charged with enforcing existing policy protecting public ROW's Support and, when necessary, force thos e responsible for public ROW protection to defend, maintain and protect the public's interest in this existing, yet diminishing public recourse. Your inclusion of this in your long term action plan would be appreciated, but more importantly, it deserves im mediate attention and an organized effort to immediately curtail and control ROW habitat destruction. Greed rarely comes with a conscience, so when trees are removed, fencelines are removed, ditches are dug.......some authority needs to be there to proper ly mark and defend ROW boundaries. South Dakota citizens deserve that much from the organization charged with wildlife management within its boundaries! Your consideration of my comments are appreciated; South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks Page 534 South Dakota Wildlife Action Plan Sincerely, Larry Lewis 40751 102nd St. Hecl a, SDGFP response: SDG FP regularly reminds the public and other agencies of mowing date restrictions on rights -of-ways covered by such restrictions. SDGFP has also encouraged the South Dakota Department of Transportation to use seed mixes that are more favorable to wildlife use than smooth brome. An additional bullet point w as added to Conservation Actions Summary to represent this concern. South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks Page 535 South Dakota Wildlife Action Plan Appendix W (continued).

SDGFP response: None necessary South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks Page 536 South Dakota Wildlife Action Plan Appendix W (continued). Comments received during Plan review period (May 7 - June 6, 2014) and associated resolution of suggested input . Date: June 6, 2014 To: Eileen Dowd Stukel, South Dakota Game Fish and Parks (SDGFP) RE: Comments to 2014 South Dakota State Wildlife Action Plan Submitted electronically at: wildinfo@state.sd.us. Dear Eileen and the SDWAP Planning Team: On behalf of its 800 supporters in South Dakota, Defenders of Wildlife submits the following comments on the 2014 South Dakota State Wildlife Action Plan (SDWAP). Founded in 1947 as Defenders of Furbearers, Defenders of Wildlife is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the protection and restoration of wildlife and plants in their natural communities. Defenders' distinguished record of leadership on America's conservation efforts includes supp orting policies and practices that help maintain populations of all of North America's wildlife species. Defenders' 10 -year organizational conservation benchmarks include: 1) Ensuring that more than half of the species currently listed under the Endangere d Species Act are stable or improving; 2) Ensuring that 25 of Defenders -identified vulnerable species are secure in important ecosystems and focal landscapes; and 3) doubling the acreage of high -priority wildlife habitat that is managed for ecological inte grity. We are pleased to see a commonality in goals in the South Dakota SWAP and Defenders' conservation goals. We've reviewed the SWAP primarily from this perspective, and offer some general comments before more detailed comments that follow below. Over all Comments Defenders commends the SDWAP team for assembling a well- organized and well -articulated document overall. The ability to \"jump to\" relevant sections and appendices is very useful. Defenders also appreciates the significant discussion regardin g potential future impacts of climate change, which the organizational approach SDFWP has chosen for this SWAP (landscape/community) is particularly well- suited to analyze. The range maps for aquatic species are more informational overall than those prese nted for terrestrial species. Distribution for terrestrial species would be far more compelling if: 1) they were presented similarly (e.g., some distributions are by county, some are circumscribed perimeters); 2) if some point locations were provided (as for some aquatic species); 3) if some sort of indicia of probability of likelihood of occurrence were presented (as for aquatic species); 4) if they were presented in some other format (e.g. suitable habitat, nesting habitat, etc). This may be a case where Rockies and Plains Office 535 16th Street, Suite 310 | Denver, Colorado 80202 www.defenders.org South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks Page 537 South Dakota Wildlife Action Plan obtaining the level of detail of information needed to develop a map could drive more efficient monitoring. Defenders is pleased to see the SDWAP include S -Ranked S3 Species in its Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) list. What would be useful, either in a table or in the individual species profiles, would be some indication of the severity/trend of the conservation challenges indicated for each species. For example, take the threat given in the example for the American Burying Beetle (p. 53), loss of carcasses: is this accelerating, incremental, or easily mitigated in some way? Are some forms of habitat loss occurring faster than others? Defenders also concurs with the SDWAP's characterization of major historical ecological drivers over much of the South Dakota grasslands, particularly bison, black -tailed prairie dogs, beaver, fire, and floods. However, having identified the important role that these drivers play in maintaining ecosystem and wildlife health, there is virtually no further mention in the SDWAP of how these drivers might be restored over some area of the state. With the SDWAP goal of maintaining a minimum of 10% (by area) representation of historical ecosystems (SDWAP p. 148), a significant effort needs to be undertaken to revitalize these drivers, three of which also happen to be wildlife species. Defenders notes that current South Dakota law severely restricts the ability to restore or maintain prairie dogs, for example, over even a fraction of the landscape that would be meaningfu l in terms of meeting the goals of maintaining 10% representation under historical conditions. Understanding that the political climate has hamstrung this plan from integrating this important driver as part of the SDWAP (SDWAP p.174), it almost goes with out saying that the plan is limited in addressing conservation goals for a host of other of its target species. Others (see e.g. US Fish and Wildlife Service 2013) are asking even far less...the state's share of prairie dog occupancy to meet black - footed fe rret recovery goals, according to the black -footed ferret Recovery Plan, is around 30,000 ac, or about .001% of the state's land base. At present, the state is far short of ensuring that acreage for black -footed ferret recovery. As a reality check, it seem s unlikely the SDWAPs 10% representational goals can be achieved if the state can't deliver on 1/1000th of that amount for one of its most important drivers and ecological communities. Moreover, how it will address conservation threats for several of its S GCN species, such as burrowing owls, ferruginous hawks, and swift fox, without inclusion of a conservation strategy for prairie dogs is somewhat mystifying. In this same light, bison and beaver targets should be made a part of this plan in order to ensure that some level of representation of those drivers are also maintained. Bison occur in several federal and state parks (as well as some private ownership) in the state, but additional effort should be made to expand conservation herds of bison on public l ands or combinations of lands involving private/public partnerships. Similarly, beaver likely occur on some federal lands, but some effort needs to be made to assess the amount of beaver -occupied stream miles and distribution across the state to determine whether this driver is meeting a significant part of its targets. The SDWAP will guide the state's conservation DOW SDWAP Comments 2 South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks Page 538 South Dakota Wildlife Action Plan efforts for the next decade, and it is important that these species receive some additional mention in terms of SDWAP goals. Conservation Actions and Opportunities Defenders appreciates the Conservation Opportunities Analysis. However, again, the SDWAP falls short in tying an implementation strategy to this analysis. There are numerous actions that could be undertaken or suggested as an outcome of this analysis: the state could work with NRCS to target programs to private landowners specifically within the COA -identified areas, protected areas could be proposed, conservation easements purchased, regulatory limitations enacted, and so forth. None of these strategies seems to be suggested, let alone prioritized. As with many very good insights developed in the SDWAP, the \"action\" part of the plan is lacking here. The purpose of this document as a genuine blueprint for moving forward based on the information needs to be made explicit somewher e in the SDWAP. Moreover, the conservation actions summary are simply too general. Taken together, the suggested summary is a list of bullets and not a comprehensive plan. This also makes it difficult to prioritize conservation actions, and no guidance fo r prioritizing conservation actions for SGCN appears to be provided in this document. Some level of guidance for how the SDWAP might prioritize its efforts given conservation actions would be useful, and this would likely involve measuring the extent of th reats for each SGCN in a more systematic way, as some threats are much more dire depending on the species and/or habitat, yet those differences in magnitude are in no way offered in the SDWAP. This is especially important as the ultimate measure of the SDW AP is if the status of the SGCN species is stabilized or improves. SGCN Species The SDWAP lacks a discussion of goals for most of the SGCN. Some of these species have separate conservation plans which (presumably) set out goals, but these are not carried forward into the SDWAP. Goal setting is non -trivial, should be done with public and private partners, and at any rate is an important part of conservation planning that both AFWA (2011, 2012) recommendations and the Open Standards for the Practice of Con servation (CMP 2013) recommend. We recommend that goals should focus on restoration rather than numerical targets, which are notoriously difficult to determine and monitor. It would be useful if these were stated conspicuously in relation to the action ite ms and if there were similar objective goal statements for each of the SGCN species so that the public is aware of where the SDWAP is headed. It is also impossible to determine if the \"results chain\" (AFWA 2011) that is described under the action items ha ve any meaningful relation to achieving some goal. Tracking progress toward the goals is as important a part of implementation as describing activities that may have positive outcomes for the species but are not directed at some measureable outcome. There should be a stated goal in the action matrix so it can be readily seen how the actions intend to meet the goal. DOW SDWAP Comments 3 South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks Page 539 South Dakota Wildlife Action Plan There is also very little discussion of relevant current conservation initiatives related to SGCN, as there are listed for monitoring initiatives. It would be valuable to include this information (if any), in the matrix, or at least reference Appendix P in the species descriptions for each species, as the SDWAP needs to integrate with existing plans and initiatives. Other suggestions include discussion of 'additional resources' under each issue and SCGN, which would help the public find additional information. Funding The plan (and narrative overview) only briefly discusses funding issues. If congressional fund ing is uncertain, where will the dollars come from to implement the plan? Is there some way to at least briefly outline the funding shortfalls/needs? Again, it would be useful if there were some type of prioritization for the 10 -year life of the Plan to tie to funding priorities. The SDWAP should also include a section on policy options. Additional comments Appendix P. An additional initiative, and possible cross -reference with your Conservation Opportunities Analysis is the Northern Plains Conservation N etwork (NPCN), http://www.npcn.net/, and the Ocean of Grass Assessment: http://www.prote ctedareas.info/upload/document/ecoregionplan - northerngreatplainconservationassessmentsummary.pdf, (Forrest et al 2004). Summary and Conclusion Defenders appreciates the opportunity to comment on the SDWAP and further wishes to commend the SDWAP team for pulling together a tremendous amount of information in a highly accessible document. Our primary concern is that the plan , as such, has some additional work to make it useful for planning purposes. If the public is to use this document to get behind or contribute to conservation efforts, then a clearer set of goals and actions need to be articulated so that we are all pullin g in the same direction. To the extent that this can be better defined in this or future revisions the more useful this plan will be. Thanks and Defenders looks forward to continuing to work with SDGFP on future wildlife planning and conservation in South Dakota.

Comments received during Plan review period (May 7 - June 6, 2014) and associated resolution of suggested input . SDGFP response to Defenders of Wildlife letter , listed by subject areas: Range maps: An attempt was made to use a similar approach to represent species ranges for both terrestrial and aquatic species. However, the lack of a similar type of base map for terrestrial species did not allow us to map terrestrial species occurrences in the same way that aquatic species distributions were mapped. Species distribution maps will continue to be improved with additional data sources, and such updates will be included on the SDGFP website. Conservation challenges severity/trends: To the extent that information exists, threat severity and trends are incorporated into the state and global heritage ranks. Particularly for rare species that are not state or federal listed, l imited information exists for threat severity and trends . We will continue to identify and monitor threat severity and trends as information becomes available. Ecological drivers: Biso n/cattle: Bison is not simply a wildlife species, but also a grazer owned by private individuals and a grazer managed by tribes and other government entities. The ecological driver is grazing by a multitude of herbivores, of which bison was the main histor ical ungulate. Managed grazing by livestock can simulate some of bison herds' grazing effects. Prairie dogs : The background information presented in this comment letter implies that South Dakota is not meeting its prairie dog acreage goals related to mult istate prairie dog planning and black -footed ferret recovery. Based on the most recent estimates in 2012, 526,641 acres were mapped in South Dakota, categorized by landownership as tribal (222,173 acres) or nontribal (304,468 acres). South Dakota has met i ts statewide and nontribal acreage goal as outlined in the state prairie dog management plan. As stated in the draft Wildlife Action Plan, existing approved management plans, whether state, tribal or federal, are not superseded by the Plan, which is a volu ntary strategic framework to encourage partners to manage for native ecosystems. We do not believe we possess the necessary background data to set beaver goals, but we support additional investigation into the historical amount of beaver- occupied habitat to help establish a historical frame of reference. In addition, we have worked with and encouraged Black Hills National Forest to allow beaver expansion in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Conservation actions and opportunities: The suggested action that we work with NRCS to target funds or new or existing programs to correspond with conservation opportunity areas is an example we have used extensively in public open houses on this topic, and we will add that example to the text. The additional suggestions that are voluntary practices, such as conservation easements and land acquisition from willing sellers, are consistent with the Plan's voluntary approach. The COA maps can easily serve this function. The other suggestions that are regulatory are inconsist ent with our preferred approach to encourage voluntary partnerships among individuals, tribes, organizations, and agencies to fulfill the goals of the Wildlife Action Plan . South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks Page 542 South Dakota Wildlife Action Plan Conservation actions summary, regarding suggested prioritization by SGCN: We have addressed the lack of information necessary to adequately prioritize threats by SGCN earlier in this response . In addition, the emphasis on habitat restoration to provide for the needs of many species will help address the needs of individual SGCNs. To add ress the point that the summary bullets are too general, we have added several points to this section. SGCN species, regarding lack of identified goals: This comment appears to place greater emphasis on single species monitoring than is intended within th e content of Wildlife Action Plans. The purpose of the coarse filter approach is to promote the importance of providing a diversity of habitats under appropriate disturbance regimes as contrasted with the traditional single -species approach. The single - species management approach is not feasible when trying to plan for the full array of fish, wildlife, and associated habitats, as is the directive for Wildlife Action Plans. Reference to AFWA 2011 results chain: We agree that this system promotes better acc ountability and expect that future State Wildlife Grant projects will more fully incorporate these planning elements. Current conservation initiatives as related to SGCN: We will follow this suggestion to better link these elements by adding existing mana gement and recovery plans to Appendix P . We have not identified additional resources for each issue and each SGCN. We intend to use the SDGFP website as an information tool for potentially sharing such information in the future. Funding issues: We chose not to describe the history of funding related to wildlife diversity or the current efforts to secure stable, long -term funding. We also chose not to include policy options because such information quickly becomes dated, and we believe it is more appropriate for interested members of the public to join the South Dakota Teaming with Wildlife Coalition (http://gfp.sd.gov/wildlife/funding/teaming.aspx ) and to monitor this situation by that means or by monitoring AFWA's Teaming With Wildlife website ( http://teaming.com/ ). We added a reference to the importan ce of securing funding to help meet representation goals to the Conservation Actions Summary. We remind the commenter that the Plan is a strategic framework for South Dakota, rather than an operational plan for SDGFP. For that reason, we chose not to include specific budgets or to estimate the amount of funding needed to fully implement the Plan. Additional comments: We have added the recommended conservation initiative to our list. South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks Page 543 South Dakota Wildlife Action Plan Appendix W (continued).

Box 788 Black Hawk, SD 57718 Nancy Hilding 6300 West Elm Black Hawk, SD 57718 June 6th, 2014 Dear Game Fish and Parks Staff, I attach 2 maps in a set that came from the BLM. Please scroll down to the second map in the set (Vegetation -Landfire 2010) . It shows vegetation in SD. The legend includes \"tree -dominated\" color, which shows tree- dominated areas on the map. Your map (Figure 3 -2) shows similar values (forested ecosystems) but does not acknowledge areas of SD that con tribute to the Pine Ridge Ecosystem of South Dakota, Nebraska and Wyoming. It does not acknowledge tree covered area on the Rosebud Reservation or a tree covered area along the sides of the Missouri in Gregory, Charles Mix and Tripp Counties. We suggest you review this BLM data on trees and we suggest adding this BLM data on vegetation cover to your map on Figure 3 -2 for forested ecosystems. Why do the forests of Custer National Forest rate such designation, but not these areas I mention? We have speci al concern for the Pine Ridge Ecosystem, which exists in three states, but in SD mostly on a Reservation. How much have you networked with Reservations about their ecosystems? Species with short or no review We are concerned that there is no mention of the grey wolf in this document. We did search for wolf and wolves and found nothing. The USFWS has yet to delist the wolf in SD. The delisting is stalled, because wolf experts don't agree on science issues, thus best science has not been used in the delist ing effort. People occassionally report wolf sightings in the Black Hills - rumors of wolves. We are also concerned for the Canadian Lynx, which is only mentioned in a chart on page 494. We are concerned for the viability of the mountain lion given the aggressive hunting in Wyoming Black Hills and South Dakota. The lions have no idea where the boundaries are and the Wyoming seasons are fixed for 3 years. SD can't control what Wyoming does. We hope you have a larger section on mountain lions. South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks Page 547 South Dakota Wildlife Action Plan We did find change for \"bear\" and found no reference. I bear was found in Bearlodge Mtns by Wyoming and removed relocated. Thanks, Nancy Hilding President Prairie Hills Audubon Society, For self and Society ============= Nancy Hilding 6300 West Elm, Black Hawk, SD 57718 or Prairie Hills Audubon Society P.O. response: Regarding Figure 3 -2 and reference to Pine Ridge Woodlands: Thank you for pointing out this area of confusion. This figure does not show the pine savanna vegetation on the Pine Ridge or many other small woodlands in South Dakota, partly because some of them are included in the riparian coverage, but also because this particular figure uses a base map of soils/ecological sites and not of existing vegetation. We have added a vegetation map ( Figure 6 -4 ) derived from the National Land Cover Dataset to show the location of some of the larger of these Ponderosa pine savannas and other wooded uplands and to show the current extent and distribution of other land cover types in South Dakota. Regarding the comme nts related to the absence of mention of the gray wolf, Canada lynx, mountain lion, and bear, we assume these suggestions relate to the Plan's species of greatest conservation need list. Because so much of the Plan materials rely on the SGCN, that list was finalized earlier in the planning process, with specific agency, tribal, and public opportunities to comment. We did not receive these suggested additions during that comment period, and these species were not proposed as SGCN because the Planning Team an d those consulted (species and taxa experts, tribes, agencies , and the public ) did not recommend them as fitting the selection criteria.

Comments received during Plan review period (May 7 - June 6, 2014) and associated resolu tion of suggested input . Nancy Hilding President Prairie Hills Audubon Society P.O. Box 788 Black Hawk, SD 57718 June 6th, 2014 To SD Game, Fish and Parks, Our second comment letter on the Wildlife Action Plan (2014 Draft) We attach Steve Forrest's Def enders of Wildlife's comments on the Wildlife Action Plan and concur and agree with Steve and incorporate by reference. We also ask that SDGFP include Northern Plains Conservation Network (NPCN - http://www.npcn.net/ ) in the list of initiatives addressing conservation interests in South Dakota. Prairie Hills Audubon Society has been a participant in NPCN for over 10 years and as one of the long term participants, we helped plan, review and approve the Ocean of Grass A ssessment: http://www.protectedareas.info/upload/document/ecoregionplan - northerngreatplainconservationassessmentsummary.pdf , (Forrest et al 2004). We take pride in this document and hope you will review and include it. NPCN has various charts and interactive maps on the web site currently - http://www.npcn.net/npcnWeb map/index.html The National Audubon Society has been working on an Important Bird Area Progam for SD, which I think might be finished, or almost finished. I am not sure when the public release will be, but I hope some time soon. Marshall Johnson the staff of Audubon Dakota will know about the release date (< mejohnson@audubon.org >) I believe the National Audubon Society is also working on a model that predicts the effects of climate change on birds in three fut ure climate scenarios. I don't know when that will have a public release, the web site says maybe October, but I hope that will also be helpful to you once released. I assume Marshall will have updates about the release date.

President Prairie Hills Audubon Society South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks Page 550 South Dakota Wildlife Action Plan ============= Nancy Hilding 6300 West Elm, Black Hawk, SD 57718 or Prairie Hills Audubon Society P.O. response: See response to Defenders of Wildlife comment letter earlier in this appendix. The Northern Plains Conservation Network has been added to the list of co nservation initiatives in the Plan. The National Audubon Society's IBA program was already listed as a conservation initiative. Many organizations host climate change information on their sites, and we appreciate hearing about the NAS information. Rather than listing just one source of climate change impact predictions and neglecting to list others, we encourage the public to seek out information from websites , authorities, and organizations they trust.
