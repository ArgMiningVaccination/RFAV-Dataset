Hot water with lemon, honey and menthol crystals. Inspired after my favorite cough drops\u2014sugar free, lemon mint Ricola. With the epidemic of colds and flus this season I wanted to share my \"recipe\" here. Encouraged by girl boss Shannon over at [Champagne at Shannon's](http://champagneatshannons.com/)! Back story on getting these crystals. My boyfriend and I visited Morocco on a JDC trip for a week back in November. How I miss that beautiful country! We extended a week after to see other places like Chefchaouen (aka [The Blue City](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bca42FmBxnw/?taken-by=cherie_renee)) and ride camels in the [Sahara Desert](https://www.instagram.com/p/BcGFaCFhUEH/?taken-by=cherie_renee). Near the end of our trip, we visited a small village of Merzouga. We wandered the markets and came upon a man selling all sorts of spices. [The villager did his dance of look at these, smell these, it's good for this! He showed me a container of pretty crystal shards with a slight menthol odor. He told me to wait, took a small shard and dropped into a cup of hot water and asked me to smell now.](https://i0.wp.com/www.cherierenee.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/spice-villager-crystals.jpg) Unaware I inhaled deeply and was pleasantly surprised. The crystals immediately cleared my nasal passages like Vick's Vaporub! I wasn't even congested. I immediately shared with my boyfriend and he loved it too. We decided to purchase, but not without bargaining first. It's such a thing in Morocco! We got two of the small containers for 20 dirhams which was about $2. What a steal! I've used the crystals on three occasions. Twice when my boyfriend woke up feeling congested and third a couple weeks ago when I was fighting a cold. The first two were prepared the same way as the villager. A small piece of crystal dropped in to hot water then inhaled deeply. Last week I dropped a small shard in hot water then added lemon and honey to drink. The idea came to me as I searched for Ricoloas at work earlier that day. Active ingredient menthol. (Careful as menthol can be toxic at a high dosage.) I wanted to try a natural remedy at home and was quite happy with the outcome. It didn't \"cure\" my cold, but it helped alleviate it. I also took a 20 min Epsom salt bath and three Wellness formula pills am and pm for a few days. Thankfully, I did not catch the worst of what is going around. Thank you, Morocco, for the natural alleviation! What about you? What do you do for "}
