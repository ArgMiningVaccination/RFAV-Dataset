But instead of the colour red, the blood is pinkish-brown? Congratulations, you might be [pregnant](https://pharmeasy.in/blog/how-to-know-if-youre-pregnant/). Women trying to conceive a baby might confuse this happy sign of early pregnancy for period onset but we're here to explain to you why implantation bleeding might look similar but is completely different from menstrual periods. In this blog, we look at understanding what implantation bleeding is, what causes it, the symptoms of implantation bleeding to help you differentiate it from a period and what should you do next. Implantation bleeding - typically defined as light spotting or a small amount of bleeding that occurs about 10 to 14 days after conceiving a baby - is a normal sign of early pregnancy. Implantation bleeding happens after a sperm fertilizes your egg which implants itself into the lining of the uterus to become an embryo, causing a little bleeding. Since this usually happens around the time of your menstrual cycle, you may confuse implantation bleeding for a light period and not realize you're pregnant. Some people may not experience any implantation bleeding, while some may have a light period, like bleeding for 2-3 days; this is usually considered normal, except when it is accompanied by persistent cramping or pain. [Dr. Ashish Bajaj - M.B.B.S, M.D. in Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology] Since women have different kinds of blood flow during their menstrual period, it's hard to point out exact differences between implantation bleeding and a period. However, there are three key differences women can use to differentiate an implantation bleeding from a period: Implantation bleeding is never enough to fill a pad or tampon like a menstrual period. Colour: Menstrual bleeding is typically a bright to dark red and will look like what you typically experience during your monthly period.

Kartheeka - MBBS, MD(Pediatrics)] Some of the other early signs of pregnancy may overlap with implantation bleeding symptoms, so take a [pregnancy test](https://pharmeasy.in/blog/10-natural-ways-to-check-pregnancy-at-home/) or consult a doctor if you notice any of the following signs: Implantation bleeding is one of the important early pregnancy symptoms and tends to happen before the onset of [morning sickness](https://pharmeasy.in/blog/how-to-manage-morning-sickness-in-pregnancy/). Implantation bleeding timing isn't as long as your period and it's lighter inflow. Women who are expecting their first pregnancy are more likely to spot or bleed than women who are used to egg attachment. All in all, implantation bleeding timing lasts for anywhere between a couple of hours to three full days and has a very light blood flow, sometimes even a light discharge. Unlike period blood that's bright or dark red, implantation bleeding colour is something between pink and brown. Women experiencing implantation bleeding may experience other early symptoms of pregnancy like morning sickness, [lower backaches](https://pharmeasy.in/blog/easy-tips-to-reduce-back-pain-during-pregnancy/), mild or no cramps, tender breasts and others. But many of these can also be PMS symptoms or ovulation symptoms and you may not be pregnant. If you're not sure whether you're having implantation bleeding or your period, it's best to take a pregnancy test or talk to your doctor. Pregnancy tests can be taken at home using urine pregnancy test kits or you can book a blood test for pregnancy from the lab. It may be difficult to detect a pregnancy too early after conception, hence chances of false-negative results exist. There can be multiple reasons for irregular, missed periods or spotting.
