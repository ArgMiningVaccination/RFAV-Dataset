Having been a primary care doctor for over 30years, I felt compelled to respond. Robert P . Gerety, m.d . '52, correctly pointed out that thepractice model of primary carebegan its decline as long ago as1968. Clearly, primary care neverfound a comfortable fit withinthe medical hierarchy despitethe continuous public outcry for over 50 years for more gen-eral practitioners. Americanmedicine is research-oriented;because primary care is practice-oriented, it has received second-class status and will remainthere until the focus of Americanmedicine changes. But there are many other reasons why primary care isattracting fewer practitionersthan ever. Over the past fewdecades health insurers haveoverburdened primary care doc-tors with administrative hasslesthat consume an inordinateamount of time. Unfortunately,the doctors are not paid for the extra time they put in onadministrative work. Some stud-ies estimate that administrationconsumes about 20 percent oftheir time. Being underpaid byinsurers forces primary care doc-tors to see large numbers ofpatients in order to survive. Thelarge number and broad spec-trum of patients and diseasesgreatly increases the physicians'risks of making errors and intensifies their exposure tomalpractice suits. Although Gerety believes that house calls disappeared becausepeople stopped asking for them,I think that doctors stopped making them because they wereoverburdened in their offices andbecause the complexity of mod-ern medicine made house calls a how to reach us Yale Medicine welcomes news and commentary.

Clearly, medicine had become too com-plex for the family doctor to \"doit all.\" The answer? A new model of primary care is needed\u2014onethat takes into account the reali-ties of modern medical practice.The scope of the family doctorhas to be redefined. Also, themedical malpractice system needsreforming. It's too adversarial.Finally, health insurers have tobe regulated. Their philosophy ofprofits before patients has com-pletely transformed medicinefrom a profession into a busi-ness; as a result demoralizationamong doctors is widespread. Family doctors can make a comeback, but their return willtake work on many fronts. Edward J. Volpintesta, M.D. Bethel, Conn. Uganda story rekindles memories As I skimmed the article in Yale Medicine [\"On the Wards in Uganda,\" Winter 2008], I feltgoose bumps. I had the mostfortunate opportunity to workin Mulago Hospital for threemonths in 2005. I was at theInfectious Diseases Institute( idi) next door and worked with several colleagues who were atMulago in IT and nursing. I wassent as part of a global healthfellowship with Pfizer to developa sustainable model for facilitymanagement at the idi. I am now the associate director offacilities for the School ofMedicine and find that Yale hasa program in Uganda as well.Many of the issues you speakabout and pictures in the articlebring back vivid memories forme; I truly miss being so closeto the patients who need helpso desperately. I have many life-long friends in Kampala andsuch surrounding communitiesas Nakasera, Mukono brought my wife threedaughters with me\u2014they willnever be the same. Gary Mandelburg Associate Director, YSM FacilitiesYale should set standards for collaborations Being familiar with the inspiring story of the heroic doctors andnurses from Yale who risked theirlives\u2014and in some instancesgave their lives\u201440 years agofighting the Lassa outbreakin the eponymous village Nigeria, was your article titled \"On theWards in Uganda,\" Winter 2008.Despite your disclaimer early onthat the travel of Yale doctors,residents and medical studentsto a hospital in Uganda was notan \"exercise in medical tourism,\"the subsequent narrative leftme feeling that most of the pro-gram's benefit fell to the U.S.participants. Much as I sincerelyapplaud the members of the Yale team for the humanitarianwork they accomplished and forthe considerable medical servicethey rendered, it is a pity thatthe senior physicians did notengage in serious scholarly col-laboration with their Ugandancolleagues\u2014by which I meanresearch and teaching. There isno reason why the United States'partners in international bio-medical collaborations betweenhealth science centers in thiscountry and their hosts at teach-ing hospitals in sub-SaharanAfrica can't keep several balls inthe air at a time: teaching,research, service and humanitar-ian work. A first-line medicalschool such as Yale, which I hap-pen to hold in high regard,should be setting the standardsfor international collaborations. Robert H. Glew, PH.D.

By the following June the university had announced that it would buy the property for a multitude of uses still to bedetermined. One thing, however, was clear. With almost half a million square feet of pris-tine lab space at the site, the School of Medicine would have room to expand and advance its programs in medical and biomedical research. After closing on the property last year, Provost Andrew Hamilton, ph.d ., said that the university wanted to avoid turning the space into an attic or basement that would collectthe stuff no one knew where to store. In his report [\"How the West was won \"] on page 18,Contributing Editor Marc Wortman describes how the deal came about and what is guidingthe thinking of the university's top ofcers as they consider the best uses for the property. On the topic of dusty basement catchalls, a storage room underneath Harkness Dormitory has for decades been home to a treasure trove of whole human brain specimens,X-rays, patient records and photographs that document the career of Harvey Cushing, m.d., the pioneering neurosurgeon. Dennis D. Spencer, m.d., hs '77, chair and the Harvey and Kate Cushing Professor of Neurosurgery, has been working to preserve the collection andmake it accessible to a broader audience. Spencer recently published a book with colleaguesat the medical school based on this collection. An excerpt from the book and some of thestunning photographs in the collection begin on page 26. By happenstance, this issue's Capsule also includes medical images of historical inter- est. When medical missionary Peter Parker, an 1834 graduate of the Divinity School and what was then the Medical Institution of Yale College, opened a hospital in Guangzhou,China, he engaged a local Western-trained artist to paint preoperative portraits of his patientsto document their disorders. Capsule tells the story of Parker and artist Lam Qua and their collaboration. Finally, in our third feature we report on a visit from Hillary Rodham Clinton, j.d. '73, who is seeking the Democratic Party's nomination for president. On the day before the Super Tuesday primaries in February, Clinton made a campaign stop at the Child StudyCenter, where she had championed the rights of children and families as a law student.

Since his graduation from Yale College in 1954, Joel E. Smilow has madedonations to his alma mater that haveendowed a head football coach posi-tion; the renovation and expansion ofthe Lapham Field House, now calledthe Smilow Field Center; and ve othercoaching positions. He also played akey role in the implementation of hisclass' $120 million gift to Yale, thelargest class gift in the university's history. For his fundraising efforts,including stewardship of the university's \"... and for Yale\" capital campaign inthe 1990s, he received the university'shighest honor, the Yale Medal, in 1993. On October 31, before some 200 guests gathered in the East Pavilion ofYale-New Haven Hospital ( ynhh ), Smilow, the former ceo, chair and president of Playtex, was thanked forhis transformational gift supporting a new $467 million cancer hospital,now under construction. When itopens in 2009, the comprehensivepatient care facility will be known asthe Smilow Cancer Hospital. \"We are building one of the nest patient-focused cancer care inthe country,\" said Marna of ynhh . are very grateful for Joel and Joan Smilow's overwhelminglygenerous gift to the cancer hospital,and for sharing our vision of creating a place of hope and compassion forcancer patients.\"The new hospital will integrate all oncology patient services at ynhh and the School of Medicine in one buildingspecically designed to deliver multi-disciplinary cancer care, and will feature specialized facilities for facultyphysicians and community-basedproviders to care for patients. The 14-story facility will add nearly 500,000square feet of new space and 112 inpa-tient beds, along with expanded outpa-tient treatment facilities, operatingrooms and infusion suites; a special-ized women 's cancer center focused onbreast cancer and gynecologic oncol-ogy; and a dedicated floor each fordiagnostic and therapeutic radiology. President Richard C. Levin also expressed gratitude for the Smilows'donation. \"This generous gift will havea lasting impact on the lives of count-less patients who will benet from thestate-of-the-art clinical care,\" he said.\"We are deeply thankful for Joel andJoan 's dedicated support.\" According to Robert J. Alpern, m.d., dean of the School of Medicine andEnsign Professor of Medicine, the newcancer hospital will transform cancercare at Yale for both doctors and patients.\"Medical school faculty members willbe able to offer the latest cutting-edgetherapies, integrating improved care\u2014which will be much more comfortablefor our patients\u2014with clinical research,\"Alpern said. \"Joel and Joan Smilow areassuring the future of a very importantaspect of patient care at Yale.\" \"Great facilities,\" Smilow said, \"help you attract and motivate outstandingpeople and make it easier for them to interrelate with one another. That'swhere the longer-term payoff comes.The immediate benets\u2014providing a better place for healing and helpingtens of thousands of victims of can-cer\u2014are obvious.

Winternitz, m.d., dean of the medical school from 1920 to1935, conceived of the Yale system ofmedical education, a key element was a student-run journal that would servenot only as a place for students to pub-lish their original research, but as alearning tool as well. The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine (yjbm ) made its debut in October 1928. It has been publishedcontinuously ever since and remainsthe longest-running medical journaledited and published by students. Despite its pedigree, the future of the yjbm in recent years was uncertain. Faced with nancial insecurity and thedeparture of its longtime faculty advisorand the editorial coordinator, publicationof the quarterly journal had slowed to a crawl by the summer of 2006. But thanks to the efforts of student editors determined to turn the journalaround, as well as support from fac- ulty, administrators and alumni, the yjbm is back on track and arguably stronger than ever, with a new editorialcoordinator, Karen E. Olson, and a newwebsite. As of last summer, the journalwas available on PubMed Central, theNational Institutes of Health 's digitalarchive of biomedical and life sciencesjournal literature. \"The journal is part of the history of the Yale medical school,\" said Jeffrey R.Bender, m.d., hs'83, the Robert I. Levy Professor of Preventive Cardiology and the journal's faculty advisor. \"It'scarved into the fabric of the school,one of the pieces that makes the Yalemedical school unique.\" Bender credits the two editors who served during the current academicyear, doctoral candidates Janice Friend(molecular, cellular and developmentalbiology) and Kristin Patrick (microbiol-ogy), with putting the journal back ona solid footing. Their immediate prede-cessors, medical student Adam Licurseand graduate student Richard Wing,also led the journal through a difculttransition. Their efforts have includedaggressively soliciting high-qualitypapers and instituting a well-organizedstructure for reviewing manuscriptsand responding to contributors. FormerDeputy Dean for Education Herbert S.Chase, m.d., made the journal's transi- tion to stability one of his nal projectsbefore departing in 2006, and his suc-cessor, Richard Belitsky, m.d. , has con- tinued to provide nancial support. Bender said the yjbm ties in with the school's educational mission. \"It's a chance for students to learnabout peer review, which is a huge part of science, and about editing andscientic writing. It's a superb form of early training.\" Patrick, who took over as co-editor in chief in April 2007, said she and an editorial team of roughly 10 haveworked to broaden the submissionpool and seek out the best work. \"Ourstandards have risen signicantly,\" she said. \"Good quality-controlledexperiments and well-written papersare our long-term goal.\" Friend, who is interested in a career in scientic publishing, said her work with yjbm has been invaluable. \"I've learned a great deal about whatmakes a good or successful article,how to effectively solicit articles, whatdoes and does not work in delegatingtasks, and tactful communication with authors.\" To keep the journal headed in the right direction, board members areexploring ways to promote and advertiseit. They've also started recruiting newmedical and graduate students to staffthe journal. \"The goal is to become self-perpetuating, so we don't face thekind of problems we had before,\"Patrick said. \u2014 Jennifer Kaylin For more information about the yjbm , or for guidelines for authors or articlerequest forms, visit yjbm.yale.edu. 6 chronicle Actress-writer returns to New Haven with a drama about theresilience of the human body About eight years ago, Asghar Rastegar, m.d., deputy chair of internal medicine and professor of internal medicine(nephrology), was deeply influenced bysomeone he credits with making him a better doctor. That person isn 't anolder, more seasoned clinician or a bril-liant, innovative scientist, but an actressand writer\u2014Anna Deavere Smith. \"She nds meaning in the most common response,\" Rastegar said. \"She hears things nobody else could.\"While physicians typically bring the science of medicine to the healingprocess, Rastegar said, Smith 's compas-sionate portrayals shine the light onpatients' humanity. In January, Smith opened her latest work, Let Me Down Easy , at New Haven 's Long Wharf Theatre. It is her secondwork with strong Yale connections. Her rst came about after Rastegar and Ralph I. Horwitz, m.d., fw'77, then chair of the Department of InternalMedicine, saw one of Smith 's perform-ances in 2000. They concluded thatmedical students and residents wouldbecome better doctors if they couldobserve the way she interacts with peo-ple to gather her material. They invitedSmith to the medical school as a visit-ing professor, and after some doggedpersuasion, she agreed. Arriving in thesummer of 2000, Smith interviewedphysicians, nurses, patients and theirfamilies. The result was Rounding It Out, a 90-minute exploration of the ways in which doctors and patients viewand communicate with one another.Her work, which included portrayals of such faculty as Rastegar, Margaret J. Bia, m.d., fw'78, professor of medicine, and Forrester A. Lee, m.d. '79, hs'83, assistant dean of multicultural affairs,was performed twice at the medicalschool to packed houses. Since then, Smith has broadened and expanded Rounding It Out into a full-blown theatrical production with a broader focus on the resilience andfragility of the human body. Thatwork\u2014 Let Me Down Easy \u2014includes material from Rounding It Out and portrayals of survivors of the Rwandangenocide, cancer survivor LanceArmstrong, a supermodel, aids victims in South Africa and a New Orleansphysician who assured her hospitalizedpatients after Hurricane Katrina thatrescuers would come for them even asher own doubts increased. Smith also portrayed one of Rastegar's longtime patients. \"I treatedher for six years,\" Rastegar said dur-ing a discussion after one of Smith 'sperformances. \"What Anna got out yale medicine spring 2008of her in a few hours she had never shared with me.\" \"I usually don 't like being interviewed, but I don 't remember her prompting or asking me anything,\" said Lee, whoalso joined in that discussion. \"That is her special talent. I totally enjoyed theexperience.\" The recipient of a MacArthur Fellow- ship in 1996, Smith is credited withcreating a new form of theater. Shedepicts a range of characters in her one-woman shows, using her subjects' own words and minimal props to offermultiple points of view. Her plays haveexplored such issues as the racial tensions between blacks and Jews in the Brooklyn neighborhood of CrownHeights in 1991 and the Los Angelesriots in the wake of the Rodney Kingpolice brutality trial in 1992. Smith 'sexceptional ability to inhabit the peopleshe is portraying once prompted The New York Times to call her \"the ultimate impressionist: she does people's souls.\" rick sonActress and playwright Anna Deveare Smith opened her most recent work, Let Me Down Easy , at New Haven's Long Wharf Theatre in January. The work includes her portrayals of several members of the medical school faculty. 7 et cetera YALE JOINS IN HPV VACCINE STUDY The School of Public Health and the Connect- icut Department of Public Health are study-ing the effects of a vaccine against theleading cause of cervical cancer\u2014the sexuallytransmitted human papillomavirus ( Although the body's immune system clears most hpv infections, some cause pre- cancerous lesions and cervical cancer. In the United States, 6.2 million new infectionsare diagnosed each year. The vaccine Gardasil, marketed by Merck, is licensed for females 9 to 26 years old andtargets strains of the virus that are thoughtto cause 70 percent of cervical cancers andstrains that cause 90 percent of genitalwarts.

Marjoua, a third-year medicalstudent who was researching maternalhealth in Nigeria, saw how the eld intersected with such issues as poverty,housing, education and women 's empow-erment. \"No one global health challengeis an entity in and of itself,\" she said.\"You can 't talk about these things withoutincluding the whole.\" That epiphany has led Marjoua to focus on a new concept that is gainingcurrency in public health circles: healthdiplomacy\u2014the idea that the networksand cooperation developed around healthpromotion and disease eradication couldbe leveraged to address problems tradi-tionally considered outside the realm of public health, such as preventing orameliorating conflicts and war. Marjoua is one of about a dozen medical and public health students who,under the direction of Kaveh Khoshnood, m.p.h. '89, ph.d assistant profes- epidemiology and public health,have formed the Health DiplomacyInitiative at Yale ( hdi). Its aim is to promote dialogue within and beyondthe Yale community on the value ofhaving health considerations play amore prominent role in internationalrelations and foreign policy. Khosh-nood has received $10,000 from theMacMillan Center for International and Area Studies to host four healthdiplomacy seminars during this academic year. Leading organizations and journals are taking the notion of health diplo-macy seriously. The World HealthOrganization devoted its March 2007bulletin to the subject of health and for-eign policy, and such medical journals as The Lancet and JAMA : The Journal of the American MedicalAssociation have editorialized in support of health diplomacy. The AspenInstitute devoted a session to globalhealth diplomacy in a health forum last year, and the University of California,San Francisco, is planning to includehealth diplomacy in its Global HealthSciences program. The aids epidemic, said Khoshnood, is the landmark event that showed that health threats don 't recognize bor-ders and can destabilize the political,economic and social structures of coun-tries. \" aids shook up segments of the government that would otherwise be uninterested in health issues,\"Khoshnood said. Along with sars and avian flu, the aids epidemic provides an opening for public health professionals to becomesignicant players in internationaldiplomacy. \"We're seen as being in the'caring' profession,\" Khoshnood said.\"We come in with all these positive feel-ings and without any particular politicalagenda. Why can 't we use this standingas a force for good?\" Marjoua sees health diplomacy as a \"novel and great idea.\" She's hoping hdi will explore ways in which health can be used to shape diplomatic deci-sion making for the better. \"I'm inter-ested in how the rise in health policy in foreign policy discussions can trans-form foreign policy.\" Khoshnood shares her enthusiasm. The only downside he foresees is thathealth diplomacy could be co-opted bygovernments to advance political agen-das. \"I hate to think that health wouldbe used that way,\" he said. But so far, hebelieves that the potential benets areworth the risk. \u2014 J.K. otto steininge r yale medicine spring 20088 rounds medicine and health at yale Yale team implants new prosthetic ankle A tailor-made prosthetic joint restores function while reducing sideeffects and amputation risk. The ankle's position in the hierarchy of articial joints corresponds roughlyto its location at the bottom of thehuman body; however, a new Yaleteam\u2014armed with prostheses that better mimic the ankle's structure\u2014aims to raise its stature. The development of a prosthetic hip in the early 1960s set the modern standard for arthroplasty, followed byadvances in other manmade joints.\"We know a ton about the knee. Weknow a ton about the hip,\" said John S.Reach Jr., m.d., assistant professor of orthopaedics and the new director ofthe reconstituted Yale Foot and AnkleService. \"The foot, in medicine, hasn 'tbeen looked at much at all. It justhasn 't gotten enough respect. The handis sexier. A hip is easy to put in; it's aball and socket,\" Reach said. \" An ankle is pretty complex. It's small. It's fussy.\" Prosthetic ankles have \"lagged behind, but not for lack of trying,\"Reach said. They have come a longway from 19th-century efforts to fash-ion a ball and stem from elephanttusks. The rst modern syntheticankle, developed in the 1970s, was \"a basic hinge,\" but doctors learnedquickly that the human body isn 't thatsimple. The latest generation of pros-thetic ankles more closely follows thejoint's anatomy. \"Now they look morelike what God gave you,\" Reach said. The components of the new implant could easily be mistaken for parts that hold a dishwasher together. Theimplant\u2014made of titanium, chromiumand plastic\u2014replaces the top of thetalus and base of the tibia. Because the prosthesis is modular, each part is tailored to the patient. In November,Reach performed Connecticut's firsttotal ankle replacement with the newdevice, called the Inbone, on a 38-year-old man whose life was upended in a bizarre auto accident one Sunday in 1994. The patient, Damian Diaz, who lives in the Fair Haven neighborhoodin New Haven, lost an eye, a shoulderand his lower left leg in the crashwhen the wheel came off the axle andburst through the floorboard. He hadhad 30 surgeries, and though he feltlucky to be alive, the pain in his rightankle limited his walking to no morethan a few steps at a time. \"My bonewas disappearing,\" Diaz said. \"I couldnot live with the hurt every day.\" Diaz was a good candidate for total ankle replacement. Trauma patientsoften develop severe arthritis in theankle, and though it's less commonthan hip or knee arthritis, Reachexpects the incidence of post-traumaticarthritis to rise\u2014partly becauseadvances in medicine and safety enableyounger people to survive these trau-mas. Airbags protect the upper body,but \"people are left with horribly man-gled feet,\" he said. \"When you havepain in the joints, it's bad. It's boneagainst bone.\" The rst lines of treatment for ankle arthritis are painkillers and braces.Another established option is fusingthe ankle bones, but that can leavepatients with a permanent limp. It canalso lead to further arthritis and, per-haps, amputation. A recent review ofthe literature found that 1 percent ofpatients who had a total ankle replace-ment needed an amputation, com-pared to 5 percent of the fusion patients.Reach expects 85 percent of the new prosthetic ankles to last at leasteight years. Diaz said that so far he's happy with the prosthetic ankle. \"I'm waitingto get used to it, but I'm walking,\" he said. \"It doesn 't hurt anymore.\" \u2014 John Dillon joh n rea chYale physicians performed the first total ankle replacement in Connecticut in November, usinga new implant made of titanium, chromium and plastic that is tailored to the patient. 9 et cetera TECHNIQUE PROMOTES NEW BONE A novel technique\u2014removing bone marrow and injecting a hormone\u2014promotes rapidformation of new bone in rats, Yaleresearchers reported in February in the jour-nal Tissue Engineering . \"This could radically change the way patients are currently treated for weakenedor fractured hips, vertebrae and acute which involvessurgery and artificial materials, often leadsto unsatisfactory outcomes.

COLON SCREENING QUESTIONED Colorectal cancer screenings for the severely ill may do more harm than good, accordingto a Yale study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine in November. This finding resulted from a new method of evaluating medical tests that gauges\"payoff time\"\u2014how long it takes for a test'sbenefits to outweigh complications and sideeffects. Researchers led by R. ScottBraithwaite, m.d ., assistant professor of medicine, studied 50-year-old men with hiv and 60-year-old women with severe conges- tive heart failure. The payoff time for the screenings was up to five years for the men and 2.9 years forthe women. But patients with severe conges-tive heart failure were less likely to ben-efit\u2014they have a life expectancy of less than2.9 years. Patients with hiv, however, have a life expectancy of more than five years. \"This issue is becoming increasingly important as pay-for-performance andphysician 'report cards' encourage cliniciansto offer screening ofindividual benefit,\" said Braithwaite. \u2014 John CurtisScientists report link between high levels of a protein andsevere asthma Late last year two Yale researchers reported a link between severe asthmaand a certain protein, ykl-40, which appeared in elevated levels in patientswho used rescue inhalers and oral corti-costeroids most frequently and requiredhospitalization for severe attacks. Now, in ndings published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April, Geoffrey L. Chupp, m.d., associ- ate professor of medicine (pulmonaryand critical care), and Jack A. Elias, m.d., Waldemar Von Zedtwitz Professor and chair of the Department of InternalMedicine, with colleagues at the Univer-sity of Chicago and the University ofWisconsin-Madison, describe a singlenucleotide polymorphism ( snp)\u2014a one- letter change in the genetic code\u2014thatcorrelates with asthma and its severity.The snpis located in the chitinase 3-like the gene that encodes ykl-40. \"The rst study demonstrated that ykl-40 was increased and that levels in the blood correlated with levels in thelungs. ... But it was possible that it wasjust a bystander and not part of theasthmatic pathway,\" said Chupp. \"Thisstudy strongly suggests that ykl-40 signicant role in the develop-ment of asthma.\" ykl-40 belongs to the family of chitinases and chitinase-like proteins.Chitinases bind to, chew up and digestchitin, a tough natural polymer foundin the cell walls of fungi and the bodiesand eggs of parasitic worms. Chitinase-like proteins, however, can 't digestchitin. ykl-40 and its role in asthma came to light several years ago whenElias and his colleagues found thatchitinase and chitinase-like proteinswere overexpressed in the lungs ofmice with asthma-like diseases. Thesurprise discovery supported the idea that asthma is an antiparasiticresponse in a setting where parasitescannot be detected. Unpublished studies suggest that ykl-40 controls inflammation in the asthmatic airway. \"When ykl-40 is there, it keeps inflammatory cells alivelonger, and when it is not, they diequickly,\" said Elias. In the future, ykl-40 could help doc- tors treat asthma by serving as a bio-marker, notifying them of patients whoare likely to have severe asthma.Pharmaceutical companies might alsodevelop a drug that targets ykl-40 and use serum measurements of ykl-40 to help predict who will respond to thesenew therapies. \"Ultimately,\" saidChupp, \"blocking the effects of ykl-40 may prove to be a novel and effectiveway to treat asthma.\" \u2014 Hannah Hoag podcast A podcast of Geoffrey Chupp speaking on this subject can be found on the Yale page on iTunes U.Visit itunes.yale.edu or launch iTunes, then selectYale from the offerings under iTunes U.

Asmall percentage of these children alsohave a visible chromosomal abnormal-ity. In one such patient State thatthe abnormality disrupted the ContactinAssociated Protein-Like 2 ( cntnap 2) gene, which encodes a protein thathelps brain signals pass from one neu-ron to another. Based on prior work by himself and others linking contactinproteins to autism spectrum disorders,mental retardation and seizures, Stategrew suspicious of cntnap2 . With the help of colleagues in clini- cal medicine, neurobiology, biochemis-try and genetics, State has collected abody of evidence that strongly incrimi-nates cntnap2 as one of perhaps many autism accomplices. First, cntnap2 is present at the scene of the crime, includ-ing all layers of the cerebral cortexwithin the temporal lobe and within thelimbic system, a brain circuit involvedin social behavior. Second, cntnap2 is found with its binding partner, contactin2, at synaptic plasma membranes \u2014 the gates of communication betweenyale medicine spring 200810 findings from the bench Building the case against a rogue gene Three labs, including one at Yale, independently target a gene implicated in autism. Researchers know that defects in brain development are to blame for autism,but pinpointing the likely genetic cul-prits has remained an elusive goal. Toput it in mobster terms, there is no sin-gle \"Tony Soprano gene\" corruptingbrain development. Instead, scientistsbelieve that multiple \"small-time thuggenes\" gang up to undermine the devel-oping brain. Because the individualeffects of these crooked genes may besubtle, it has been hard to get the goodson them. To help crack the case, Matthew W. State, m.d. ,ph.d . '01, the Irving B. Harris Associate Professor of ChildPsychiatry in the Child Study Centerand of genetics and director of theProgram on Neurogenetics, sought toflush out autism-associated genes byfocusing on clues from certain affectedindividuals. Children with autism\u2014orany of a spectrum of related disorders\u2014neurons. The third and strongest line of evidence against cntnap2 is that sequencing of the gene from 635 autis-tic patients and 942 controls turned up13 rare, unique changes to the encodedprotein that were found only in autisticindividuals. Eight of these mutationsare predicted to disrupt the proper func-tioning of cntnap2 . One particular mutation was identied in four autisticchildren in three unrelated families, butnot in more than 4,000 chromosomesfrom controls. \"This is strong but notdenitive evidence linking this genewith autism,\" according to State. Unbeknownst to each other and to State, two other medical research laboratories\u2014the labs of Daniel H.Geschwind, m.d. ,ph.d ., at the Univer- sity of homed in on cntnap2 after surveying the genomes of hundreds ofindividuals and identifying a particularchunk of genetic material that appearedto surface in families with autism. Stateand Geschwind, longtime friends whomet as residents at ucla , learned of the other's discovery while catching up dur-ing one of their regular phone conversa-tions. Soon after, Geschwind caughtwind of Chakravarti's work through theresearch grapevine. When the three scientists compared notes, they decidedto co-publish their ndings to build the strongest case possible against cntnap2 . \"There's a reason we're all landing on this gene,\" said State. Allthree papers were published in theJanuary issue of the American Journal of Human Genetics. State thinks that identication of cntnap2 may give him the traction he needs to begin to understand the com-plex biology of autism. \"Our hope isthat our continued work on understand-ing the biology of cntnap2 will lead to real opportunities for novel approachesto treatment,\" said State. \u2014 Kara A. Nyberg11 et cetera In the olfactory bulb, new neural stem cells learn to listenbefore they speak Like a newborn learning from its parents, a neuron born of neural stem cells in the adult brain must take its cues from its elders if it hopes to mature and sur-vive, according to new research headed by Charles A. Greer, ph.d ., professor of neurosurgery and neurobiology. In ndings published in the Sep- tember 12, 2007, issue of The Journal of Neuroscience , Greer and Mary C. Whitman, an m.d./ph.d . candidate in his lab, tracked the development of new neu-rons in a region of the brain called theolfactory bulb, which receives informa-tion about odors from the nose. It is oneof the few regions in the adult brain thatallows new neurons to be generated andintegrated into existing neural circuits. However, such assimilation is not easy. New brain cells destined for theolfactory bulb have to migrate vast dis-tances from their birthplace, and half ofthese newborn neurons die between 15and 45 days after being generated, pre-sumably because they fail to integratewithin the neural circuitry.Greer and Whitman found that although the long, spindly arms of newneurons are present 10 days after beinggenerated, they don 't form the connec-tions that let them talk to other olfactorybulb neurons until three weeks afterbirth. Even then, it takes six to eightweeks for the cells to mature and achievecomplete integration. \"New neurons are essentially taught to listen before they're allowed to talk,\"said Greer. He and Whitman found thatbers extending from older neuronslocated in higher centers of the brainrst connect to short arms projectingfrom the base of new neurons about 10days after generation. Whitman andGreer believe that these early synapsesprovide a conduit through which elderbrain cells control the development, andultimately the survival, of new neuronswithin existing brain circuitry. Thisensures that the new lines of communi-cation don 't garble pre-existing lines. According to Greer, these ndings have important implications for usingadult neural stem cells to replace braincells lost by trauma or neurodegenera-tion, such as in Parkinson 's disease. \"Touse stem cells in a transplant strategy,we're going to have to understand thekinds of synapses new brain cells makeas well as the kinds of synapses theyreceive from existing circuits. Our goalis to prevent these cells from beingpotentially disruptive by getting into thewrong synaptic circuit or by acting in aprecocious way,\" he said. \u2014 K.A.N.BIG ROLE FOR TINY RNA Tiny rna s discovered in \"junk\" dna play an important role in controlling gene function,Yale scientists reported in the journal Nature in October. A team led by Haifan Lin, ph.d ., director of the Yale Stem Cell Center and professor of cell biology, discovered these rna s, called pirna s, in mammalian reproductive cells in 2006. The team's findings suggest thatpi rna s also exist in nonreproductive body cells and help to control stem cell fate andtissue development. The researchers foundthat a particular pi rna forms a complex with a protein called Piwi, which then bindsto a specific region of chromatin (i.e., thegenome) that regulates gene activity. \"This finding revealed a surprisingly important role for pi rna s, as well as junk dna , in stem cell division,\" Lin said. \"It calls upon biologists to look for answersbeyond the 1 percent of the genome withprotein-coding capacity to the vast land of junk dna , which constitutes 99 percent of the genome.\" \u2014John Curtis VIRUS KILLS BRAIN TUMORS Yale researchers have engineered a virus that can find its way through the vascular systemand kill deadly brain tumors, offering a poten-tial new treatment for cancers in the brain. Such malignant brain tumors as glioblas- tomas and metastatic tumors are diagnosedin 22,000 Americans each year. There is nocure for these malignancies. They often killwithin months; current treatments usually failbecause they don't kill all the cancer cells. Anthony N. van den Pol, ph.d. , professor of neurosurgery, and colleagues reported inthe Journal of Neuroscience in February that they had transplanted multiple types ofhuman and mouse tumors into the brains ofmice and then inoculated the mice with alab-created vesicular stomatitis virus knownas vsvrp30a, a distant cousin of the rabies virus. Three days later, the tumors had beeninfected by the virus and \"were dying ordead,\" while transplanted normal cells werespared, van den Pol said. \"This underlines thevirus' potential therapeutic value againstmultiple types of brain cancers.\" \u2014 John Dillon charles gre er an d m ary wh itmanNeurobiologist Charles Greer and his team found that newly born neural cells followed theexample of their \"elders\" in order to survive.This image shows interneurons labeled with agreen fluorescent protein at birth so the scien-tists could follow their migration into the olfac-tory bulb and their subsequent morphologicaldifferentiation and maturation. 12 books &ideas bookshelfyale medicine spring 2008 Bookshelf focuses on books and authors at the School of Medicine.

Early in the 1990s, psychiatrist and law professor Alan A. Stone, m.d. '55, noticed a change in his law and literature class. When he asked which students had read a certain playor novel\u2014Thomas Mann 's Death in Venice , for instance\u2014 not a single hand went up. Then a student would venture: \"I think I saw the movie.\" \"Young people are incredibly well-informed about lm and incredibly ill-informed about literature,\" said Stone.\" And I'm talking about students at Harvard College and atHarvard Law School.\" Stone, the Touroff-Glueck Professor of Law and Psychiatry at Harvard Law School, was trying to use litera-ture to connect students with the large themes of psychol-ogy and justice. Reading fiction, said Stone, provides \"anincredible opportunity to talk about moral issues that areusually approached in law school through such arcane dis-cussions that the moral issues disappear before your eyes.\"But the approach was no longer working: few students had read Sophocles or Dostoyevsky, Austen or Flaubert.Stone needed, as he puts it, a new \"passport to the young.\" He found such a passport when fellow law professor Randall L. Kennedy, j.d. '82, asked Stone to write about white racism for the magazine Reconstruction . Stone used the 1989 lm Glory to address the issue. His analysis\u2014that the movie resorted to racial stereotyping in its depiction ofthe rst all-black regiment to ght for the Union in the CivilWar\u2014generated numerous letters to the magazine. By then, Stone had realized that the shared stories of the new generation were not written in the pages ofbooks but, rather, recorded on film. He created a popularcourse called \"Law, Psychology and Morality: An Explora-tion Through Film.\" \"This allows students to grapple with issues that are the reason they came to law school inthe first place: to identify and correct injustice,\" said Stone. The primary texts for the class include the films Do the Right Thing , Lone Star , Crimes and Misdemeanors , The Battle of Algiers and Character. Unexpectedly, the Glory essay proved to be a passport of sorts for Stone himself: the former president of theAmerican Psychiatric Association and residency director atMcLean Hospital entered new territory as a lm critic. Since 1993, he's written more than 100 reviews for thebimonthly Boston Review . Stone is not drawn to movies for diversion but instead to witness the stories of people thrust into situations that test character, such as Oskar Schindler's insight that he couldsave the lives of Polish Jews forced to work in his factories. mit Press recently published 15 of Stone's reviews in a small volume titled Movies and the Moral Adventure of Life . Films reviewed in the book include American Beauty , The Passion of the Christ ,Pulp Fiction ,Antonia's Line andHenry V . A Los Angeles Times critic called Stone \"a discovery to rejoice at.\" Stone's lm analysis, wrote David Thomson in November, \"is not the breathless rave on this Friday'srelease, but a culmination of the process by which a picturecan be seen a few times, mulled over, seen again and then at last written about\u2014as if lm writing might be as contem-plative, gradual and enriched as any other scholarship.\" At 78, Stone looks forward to writing many more reviews. (He still sees a few psychotherapy patients, too.)The lms he nds worth his attention, he said, are \"lmsthat challenge me and make me reflect on the moral adventure of life.\" To read reviews by Stone, visit http://bostonreview.net/ onlm.html. \u2014 Cathy ShufroAlan Stone, who teaches law and psychiatry at Harvard, uses popu-lar films to engage his students onmoral issues.

Rapidchanges in technology, he said, have made possible fast accessto videos online. \"The Web infrastructure is allowing largeamounts of data to be transferred to personal computers.\" Over the course of a month early this year, Wang made 10 instructional videos that provide in-depth instruction in using the new ovid search interface. Topics range from such basic skills as accessing ovid and choosing a database to such specialized topics as using ovid to conduct compre- hensive literature reviews. Wang limits each segment's run-ning time to about ve minutes. \"People's attention spansare pretty short,\" he said. Sometimes things change so fast that he has to revise an instructional video even beforehe has completed it. Wang keeps up with the latest byattending conferences. Wang believes that if videos allow patrons to use the library's resources more easily, they're worth the effort.

Shenever learns about her familyhistory of heart disease and herdoctor thinks genetics is irrele-vant to clinical practice. Bettygains weight and develops highblood pressure, but side effectskeep her from taking her medi-cation. Ten years later, Betty diesfrom a heart attack.

By Melinda Tuhus16 capsuleyale medicine spring 2008In 1834, within a month of his gradu- ation from the Medical Institution ofYale College and his ordination as aPresbyterian minister, Peter Parkerdeparted for China as a medical mis-sionary. A year after his arrival inGuangzhou he started a hospital totreat eye diseases and began a collabo-ration with portrait artist Lam Quathrough which both men would leavetheir mark on medicine. Parker went to China with the hope that by healing his patients' bodies hewould open the door to their souls.British and American patrons providednancial support for his OphthalmicHospital, over which he hung a signthat read in Chinese, \"Hospital ofUniversal Love,\" and which providedmedical services at no charge. In addi-tion to treating diseases of the eye,Parker also practiced surgery, includ-ing the removal of tumors. Today he isbest known for introducing anes-thesia\u2014sulphuric ether\u2014to China. Down the street from Parker's hos- pital was the studio of Lam Qua, who had learned the Western style ofportraiture from George Chinnery, an English painter who had settled inChina. Qua was the rst Chinese portrait painter to be exhibited in theWest, a master who made his nameand his fortune painting the wealthy\u2014both local and expatriate\u2014of the city of Guangzhou and beyond. Parkerhired him to document the disguringtumors that afflicted many of hispatients. The two men worked togetherfor close to 20 years. Most of Qua's subjects appear in prole or facing forward, draped indark clothing and presenting a serenevisage. Yet the subject matter is likelyto evoke not serenity, but fascinationand perhaps horror. One paintingshows a man with a tumor roughly the size, shape, and positioning on the body of a cello being played, whilemany others depict women withgrotesquely deformed breasts. Quaproduced 114 paintings for Parker, 86 of which are housed in the PeterParker Collection in the Cushing/ Whitney Medical Library, along withthe physician's case notes. When Parker traveled to the United States to promote his mission, hebrought these portraits with him. Ulti-mately, he left them to the Departmentof Pathology at the medical school,which in turn gave them to the MedicalHistorical Library. The paintings\u2014oilon board\u2014are now stored in verticalshelving in the historical library. Preser-vation librarian Sarah A. Burge, m.l.s ., said that pulling the paintings out forviewing is hard on them and makes it impossible to view the collection as a whole. Still, she said, \"Researcherscome from all over the world to look atthem. It's a heavily used collection.\" With support from the Helen Melton Book Preservation Fund, efforts areunder way to conserve not only theoriginal paintings, but also Lam Qua'spreliminary watercolor studies on pith paper. \"It's like rice paper,\" Burgesaid. \"They're extremely fragile, and in their current state they cannot behandled or viewed.\" Photographs of the paintings were recently placed online in order to make them accessible to a wider audi-ence. Does the fact that the works cannow be viewed electronically reducethe number of people coming to viewthem at the library? If anything, Burgesaid, she thinks their existence on the Web has spurred interest. \"Peoplend out that we have the collection,\"she said, \"and then they want to see itin person.\" The collection of oil paintings is available online at http://www.yale.med.edu/library/subjects/digital.html.

DiMaio, m.d., ph.d., vice chair and Waldemar Von Zedtwitz Professor of Genetics, who consulted with Alpern about the former Bayer campus:\"The rate-limiting factor here is space, not ideas or money.\" Room to grow\u2014with ready-made laboratory facilities\u2014 suddenly appeared like a vision on the western horizon. Abouta 15-minute drive from downtown New Haven, the Bayer site's17 buildings include 450,000 square feet of state-of-the-artresearch laboratory space in four modern buildings, much ofit either recently built or renovated and some of it never evenfully occupied. Along with that, the campus comprises nearly 1million additional square feet of modern ofces, ware- houses, and miscellaneous other spaces, including a day-carecenter, a power plant and surface parking for nearly 3,000 carswith easy access to Interstate 95. The site also has a library, a250-seat auditorium, multiple seminar and conference rooms,modern computing and telecommunications facilities and a 200-seat cafeteria and other food service areas. The addition of what would amount to an entirely new third science campus, albeit one outside Yale's hometown ofthree centuries, would, says Levin, offer \"great potential to liftYale science to the very top rank\" among research universities.But he had to keep quiet. Levin may have coveted the property, but Yale could not show its interest. Sitting in his Woodbridge Hall ofce, Levinsays, \"It was important for the region to attract another phar-maceutical firm.\" Not only might a large private corporate On Thursday, November 9, 2006, much of the nation was digesting the news about the dramatic swing in party controlof Congress after the midterm elections two days earlier. Inhis ofce at Woodbridge Hall, however, Yale President RichardC. Levin had some startling local news in mind. BayerHealthCare had announced that morning that it was shuttingdown its vast North American research headquarters strad-dling the border of the neighboring towns of West Haven andOrange. The disappearance of what had been the largestemployer and taxpayer in the two towns immediately west ofNew Haven seemed to spell economic disaster for the region.But when Levin learned the news about the 136-acre sitewhere nearly 3,000 people had once worked, he leaped upfrom his desk. \"What an opportunity!\" he exclaimed. \"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us.\" Levin wanted to purchase the site, potentially changing the face and characterof Yale University forever. But rst he did what he could tond another buyer for the property. For the past decade Yale has been building at a pace that rivals the near-complete campus reconstruction of the1930s, which gave the university most of its present architec-tural face. Much of the recent construction binge has focusedon the sciences, particularly biomedical research. In just the past three years, several major new academic buildingshave opened as part of a billion-dollar plan to bolster scienceresearch and teaching. For instance, the 457,000-square-footAnlyan Center, which opened in 2003, and the 120,000-square-foot Amistad Street building dedicated last Octoberhave increased the medical school's laboratory space by nearlyhalf. When the new 14-story Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale-New Haven Hospital opens in 2009, it will unite all of YaleCancer Center's clinical services under one roof. On the maincampus, numerous new science buildings afliated with themedical school have opened or will open soon, including newchemistry and environmental studies buildings. Plans also call for signicant additional construction, renovation andexpansion of science facilities within the medical center. Despite this building frenzy, Yale still lags well behind its principal competitors in both the size and growth of its sci-ence facilities. That's in part because Yale remains largelylandlocked within its dense New Haven surroundings, leavingscant room for outward expansion. And where there is room,such as at the medical school, construction costs have limitedexpansion. Yale, and in particular its medical school, continues 21 Yale's new West Campus, a former pharmaceutical research and manufacturing facility, covers 136acres and has 1.6 million squarefeet of floor space. Clockwise fromtop left, the Oyster River and asmall forest bisect the property;600,000 square feet of manufac-turing and warehouse space tohold and collections fromthe parcelwith and3,000 parking spaces. yale medicine spring 200822 How the West was won tenant make immediate use of the facilities and rehire laid- off employees, \"It was consistent,\" he says, \"with our long-standing plans for contributing to a region with a strong science-based economy,\" through Yale's own biomedicalresearch and efforts to build biotechnology companies basedon university discoveries. Yale would need to sit on its handsand wait to see what new owner might emerge. A productive corporate campus For more than four decades, a pharmaceutical rm occupied at least part of the West Haven-Orange site. Bayer HealthCare,a division of the German pharmaceutical giant Bayer AG, and its predecessor at the West Haven site, Miles Laboratories,had invested nearly $1 billion there since rst acquiring theformer pig farm in 1965\u2014and then added adjacent propertywhen a multiplex theater complex closed and moved acrossthe street. Eventually the campus grew to be Bayer's largestsite in the United States and the company's North Americanheadquarters. The site had been a productive one for Bayer. Its scien- tists discovered and developed the kinase inhibitor sorafenibthere. Last year the Food and Drug Administration approvedthe drug as a treatment for renal cell carcinoma, a deadly formof advanced kidney cancer, and it is now marketed as Nexavar.In addition to research, Bayer also used the site as a manufac-turing center. Billions of tablets of the popular heartburn treat-ment Alka-Seltzer were once sent out from West Haven to theAmerican market. More recently, crews worked around theclock under tight security churning out Cipro tablets, the tradename of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, in response to the hugedemand for stockpiles of the drug following the 2001 anthraxattacks in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere. When Bayer put the property on the market, Connecti- cut Governor M. Jodi Rell formed a commission to nd abuyer. Levin designated Bruce D. Alexander, Yale's vice presi-dent for New Haven and state affairs and campus develop-ment, to serve on the commission, and Yale threw its weightbehind the effort to attract a large pharmaceutical corporation.But with much of the pharmaceutical industry in the midst of painful restructuring and contraction, \"there was not aglimmer of interest,\" recalls Levin. The only bidders for thesite, says Alexander, were real-estate developers who wouldhave leveled it to make room for retail and commercial com-plexes. \"That would have been a huge loss,\" says Alexander.Levin decided it was time to move. Yale entered the bidding against 14 other potential buyers but walked away with the prize in late June 2007. The nal price, revealed at the closing in September, was astonish-ingly low: $109 million plus payments in lieu of taxes to WestHaven and Orange amounting to $600,000 annually, and amillion-dollar contribution over the next few years for trainingassistance to New Haven-area middle and high school scienceteachers. To put the purchase price in perspective, constructionof The Anlyan Center alone cost about $176 million. At the approximately $700-per-square-foot cost of constructing newbiochemistry laboratory space\u2014plus the other buildings\u2014says Alexander: \"You could easily value the property at six orseven times what we paid for it in terms of its replacementcost,\" far more if it were possible to build that much newspace on the Yale campus in New Haven. And that does notcount the costly equipment Bayer left behind\u2014includingscores of chemistry and biology safety hoods\u2014nor the landitself. According to Levin, the site could accommodate nearlydouble the number of structures at present\u2014\"without touch-ing the environmentally sensitive portions,\" including about20 acres of wetlands. Speaking about the site, which Yale now ofcially calls the West Campus, Levin becomes animated, leaning forwardin his chair, his voice rising with excitement. \"This has trans-formative potential, frankly\u2014only some of which we can envision today,\" he says. \"We've given our successors an oppor-tunity to dream in ways we can 't imagine today.\" DiMaio, who is also the scientic director of Yale Cancer Center, hopes to see a long-envisioned cancer biologyresearch center established there, bringing together an inter-disciplinary oncology team able to perform genetic analyses of tumor cells and then design novel targeted pharmaceuticaltreatments for them. A student at Yale College when the rstwomen entered as undergraduates, DiMaio believes that theacquisition and development of the West Campus has thepotential to be the most signicant event at Yale since coedu-cation. \"If we don 't seize this opportunity and transform Yale,we will have failed.\" Transforming Yale The purchase happened quickly. Only a handful of people even knew it was being considered. Suddenly, an entirely newwestern territory opened up for Yale. University ProvostAndrew Hamilton, ph.d ., says, \"This is a quantum opportu- nity and leap for Yale.\" But what is Yale leaping into? Over the past year, Levin, Alpern and Hamilton have met frequently to explore ideas for the new campus. They havealso held meetings with many faculty leaders, and a retreat formedical school departmental chairs focused on the new site.An emerging theme from their discussions was not simply totransfer existing laboratories, people and administrative struc-tures from the overcrowded New Haven campus to the emptyWest Campus. \"We need to guard against allowing the campusto become a spillover space for existing programs,\" insistsLevin. Rather, he wants the space to be devoted to entirely newprojects. \"This allows us to think about new structures and new forms of science appropriate for the 21st century.\" \"We are not going to rush into decisions,\" Hamilton says; however, a few governing principles have emerged. \"TheWest Campus will raise the visibility and impact of Yale sci-ence. It will not be an extension of existing Yale activities but 23 West Campus has 450,000 square feet of space for biology andchemistry laboratories in severalbuildings at the parcel's easternend. The laboratory buildings also have offices and conferencerooms. The property's purchaseprice included scientific equipmentstored in warehouses. yale medicine spring 200824 How the West was won will represent something distinctly different in organization and the way activities are planned.\" Says Alpern: \"This is anopportunity to grow a lot more, but also an opportunity tofocus on cutting-edge areas.\" According to Alpern, the trio looked at multiple models for campus expansion. The one that best t their thinking was the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research inCambridge, Mass. Its faculty members have teaching aflia-tions with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. White-head's director, David C. Page, m.d., likens the institute to an artist's colony in which established and emerging scientistshave the freedom and resources to pursue high-risk, novel and interdisciplinary research. Page, a renowned genetics sci-entist and MacArthur Foundation \"genius award\" winner,touts the freedom Whitehead scientists have \"to pursue newideas while working in a collaborative environment. Our modest size and strong nancial position allow us to movequickly to exploit scientic opportunities.\" Alpern expects that the West Campus will be organized around a series of new Whitehead-like interdisciplinary insti-tutes, each centered on \"a spectacular faculty member whowill then recruit three to ve other scientists for his or herinstitute.\" Several core facilities will also be established there,drawing on Yale's existing strengths and the laboratory cong-uration left by Bayer. These include a high-throughput geneticscreening facility and a high-throughput chemistry labora-tory\u2014drawing on the Department of Chemistry on the mainYale campus\u2014with drug screening and development capabili-ties not presently available on the medical campus. Yale, Alpern says, has already begun recruiting new fac- ulty members for the rst of the proposed institutes\u2014cellbiology, major psychiatric disorders and cancer biology. \"Thekey,\" he says, \"is to attract exceptional investigators from the start. If they're weak, the value of the real estate goes waydown.\" Levin says that present faculty with innovative ideas fornew interdisciplinary research programs may also move there. Levin, Alpern and Hamilton emphasize that the West Campus' facilities will link up with the entire university.Among those links will be a new $1.4 million high-speed opti-cal ber connection. According to Steven M. Girvin, ph.d ., deputy provost for science and technology, that will enable theuniversity to move all current nonresearch computing func-tions from the Information Technology Services center at 155Whitney Avenue (to be razed to make way for a new School of Management campus) to the existing data center on theWest Campus. The new cables will also allow a big growth inresearch computing capabilities. \"Eventually we will need newcomputing space on the West Campus for high-performancescientic computation, as we are running out of space on themain campus,\" Girvin says. The West Campus' acres of manufacturing and ware- house floor space will be devoted to displaying, conserving andstoring the thousands of artworks and other valuable collec-tions presently warehoused around the region. Stored libraryand archival materials and preservation services may also relo-cate there. Alpern says, \"It would make the campus special ifactivities there include the arts.\" Among the ideas being dis-cussed are creating a contemporary art museum \"like a TateModern,\" he says, comparing it to the popular and massive artgallery housed in a former power station in London. \"Thatwould give the campus a Yale flavor.\" A Yale feel Right now, the 15-minute drive from the Yale campus in New Yale has engaged an architect to draft plans that will introduce theneo-Georgian and Gothic Revivalstyles of the Yale campus and minimize the corporate office parkambiance. Preliminary plans callfor shifting some existing road-ways, demolishing some buildingsand creating more courtyards. 25 Haven to the West Campus transports visitors to a completely different world. The 136 fenced-in acres\u2014equivalent to about athird of Yale's total New Haven campus acreage\u2014run for closeto a mile alongside the roaring cataract of Interstate 95 andnearly half a mile south of the highway to the periodic clatter of trains along the Amtrak and Metro-North railroad tracks thatparallel the Long Island Sound coastline down the NortheastCorridor. The West Campus doesn 't feel or look anything likedowntown New Haven or Yale's august neo-Georgian andGothic Revival campus. The bustling urban and collegiateworld of the medical school and the main campus doesn 't existat all out there. There are no coffeehouses or vendor carts, nohonking horns or scurrying pedestrians. Instead, the site is a vast ghost town, its cooling, heating, electrical, security andtelecommunications systems maintained by a skeleton crew. A Yale banner announces that the university has staked itsclaim to the West Campus. Along with its layout of scattered,undistinguished if pleasant modern glass, brick and concretebuildings set amidst lawns, parking lots, roadways and con-crete walkways, the Bayer property includes the Oyster River,which runs through a deep wooded ravine that bisects theproperty. Wild turkeys, deer and coyotes roam the landscape. Alexander Cooper, a principal in the New York archi- tecture and planning rm of Cooper, Robertson & Partners,says, \"It looks like suburban ofce parks you'd nd in any of the 50 states.\" Yale has engaged Cooper, who completed a new master plan for the New Haven campus, says Levin,\"to think about ways to give the West Campus a Yale feel.\"Some preliminary suggestions Cooper presented to the Yaletrustees in December included demolishing some struc-tures, rerouting some streets, putting towers at the ends ofstreets and clustering buildings around courtyards, as well as adding landscape alterations to make the campus more pedestrian-friendly. \"It can become a great campus,absolutely,\" Cooper says. Just what will make it truly a Yale campus remains uncertain and will likely not be fully resolved for decades.Along with the present spaces dedicated to future biomedicalresearch, arts and library facilities, Levin says possibilitiesexist for new structures for the applied physical sciences and clinical centers. Even residential facilities might be con-structed on the site. \"The possibilities,\" he says, \"are notfully imaginable today.\" Regional plans announced well before Yale's acquisition of the site call for a new Metro-North commuter rail station to be built just outside the southwest corner of the site. Levinmentions that a dedicated shuttle train might operate betweenthe West Campus and downtown New Haven. \"It's impera-tive,\" he says, \"that the West Campus be fully integrated intothe core university. There have to be many faculty going backand forth.\" Getting faculty to take the leap of imagination to see the potential of the new West Campus, admits Alpern, \"will be tough.\" But before last year, the possibility that Yale wouldeven acquire the property was not being considered. Thefuture of the West Campus will take many years, and probablydecades, to unfold. \"When there was gold in the hills,\" Levinsays, \"we populated the West. We'll need a few brave pioneersto populate the wilderness. When they see the possibilities,others will want to join.\" As they do, Yale will grow and changein ways that nobody can fully predict.

Surgical tools and neurological diseases bear his name; among his achievements are improved patient survival rates, the intro- duction of local anesthesia to brain surgery and the use of X-raysto diagnose brain tumors. His attention to detail also led to the creation of the Brain Tumor Registry, a collection of more than 2,200 patient casestudies that includes human whole-brain specimens, tumor speci-mens, microscope slides, notes, journal excerpts and more than15,000 photographic negatives. The materials, which date fromas early as 1887, were organized and classified by Cushing's assistants, Percival Bailey, m.d., and Louise Eisenhardt, m.d . In addition, from 1922 until Cushing's retirement a decade later,Eisenhardt kept a \"little black book\" that included case results,diagnoses and mortality percentages for every type of tumoroperated on at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. Cushing arrived in Boston in 1912 from Johns Hopkins Hospital, where he had completed his surgical residency. Thetrustees of the new Brigham Hospital had offered him not only apost as surgeon in chief but also the opportunity to help designthe building, set policies and establish a section of neurologicalsurgery. In addition, Cushing had a position as a professor of sur-gery at Harvard. Within three years he had achieved a surgicalmortality rate of 8.4 percent, while other leading neurosurgeonswere reporting rates of 38 to 50 percent. He attributed his suc-cess to his insistence on sterile procedures that reduced infec-tions, a leading cause of mortality in brain operations. Cushingalso laid the groundwork for the basic classification of braintumors and was responsible for the first applications of electric-ity to neurosurgery by using a newly developed electric scalpel. On Cushing's retirement from Harvard in 1932, he returned to Yale, where he had received his bachelor's degree in 1891, asthe Sterling Professor of Medicine in Neurology. His tumor reg-istry followed him. Its first home at Yale was the Brady Museum,where anyone interested in brain tumors was invited to use thecollection for study. Over time the collection fell into disuse andended up in a room in the basement of the Harkness dormitory.Christopher J. Wahl, m.d. '96, rediscovered the collection as a medical student and wrote his degree thesis on it.above A negative of this por- trait of Harvey Cushing recentlysurfaced as curators went throughthe photo archive that is believedto hold as many as 15,000 images.This picture was probably taken inBoston around 1930. opposite Among the many treasures in Cushing's Brain TumorRegistry are the photographs hetook of his patients, before andafter surgery.

Spencer, m.d. ,hs'77, chair and the Harvey and Kate Cushing Professor of Neurosurgery, and Aaron A.Cohen-Gadol, m.d. , published The Legacy of Harvey Cushing: Profiles of Patient Care .An excerpt from the introduction, written by Wahl, Spencer, Cohen-Gadol and Terry Dagradi,curator of the photography collection, follows. In 1902, a golf ball-sized piece of brain tissue, or more to the point, the conspicuous absence of a golf ball-sized piece of tis-sue, was the catalyst that led to the conception of the CushingBrain Tumor Registry. Cushing's opportunities for intracranialtumor surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital were few and farbetween and successes were rare. Still, he regularly examinedall tissues removed during surgical cases, a habit he learnedfrom his mentors, William S. Halsted, m.d., chief of surgery at Hopkins, and Emil Theodore Kocher, m.d., a Swiss surgeon who won the 1909 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine forhis work on the physiology, pathology and surgery of the thy-roid gland. Following the removal of a \"pituitary cyst\" from a female patient, the Johns Hopkins Pathology Department\"misplaced\" Cushing's tissue specimen. The young surgeon,prone to ts of anger\u2014which occasionally drew admonitionfrom chief of medicine William Osler, m.d.\u2014failed to contain his fury. He insisted that from that day on, he would beallowed to personally retain all specimens removed during his operative cases or autopsy. [Cushing moved to Harvard and the Brigham Hospital in 1912, where he continued his practice of keeping meticu-lous records on each and every patient. Upon reachingHarvard's mandatory retirement age of 63 in 1932, heaccepted a position at Yale and opened his collection to themedical community. Cushing died in New Haven in 1939.] For two decades, Yale's Brain Tumor Registry, with Eisenhardt at the helm, remained a site of pilgrimage foryoung neurosurgeons and neuropathologists to study intra-cranial pathologies. Elias E. Manuelidis, m.d., became Eisenhardt's successor in the section of neuropathology andcurator of the enormous archive. Throughout the 1940s and '50s, many young scholars, particularly neurosurgeonsand neuropathologists studying for their certication boards,came to New Haven to utilize the collection. Over time,however, the gross specimens and photographic negativescame to be little used for research purposes. By 1968, theyear after Eisenhardt's death, Manuelidis faced a tremendousproblem; the section of neuropathology at Yale prepared to secede from pathology. With the organizational split, labo-ratory space would be scarce; and vast bookshelves, stackedfloor to ceiling with gallon receptacles containing brain spec-imens and stacks of photographic negatives, would play aminor role in the changing atmosphere of scientic research. The 40-year-old specimens had fallen into a chrono- logical void\u2014too old to be of scientic value but ironically,too young to be of historical interest. The unwieldy archivealso reeked of formaldehyde. The Edward S. HarknessMedical School Dormitory at Yale, built in 1955, retainedrooms in the sub-basement for storage adjacent to a falloutshelter. Many of the storage cages contained provisions for a nuclear emergency, including large barrel tins of meal,drinking water and sanitary supplies; others were used forcold storage of building supplies, le cabinets and discardedmedical equipment. Manuelidis acquired permission to stow the entire Cushing collection\u2014photographic negatives,gross specimens, laboratory materials and dyes, even an old gurney\u2014in a locked room near the shelter. He employedthe help of faculty and students, and moved everything save the microscopic slides (which are still in use today) intothe space below the dormitory. The collection remains inthis sub-basement. Patient photographs and records Unexpectedly, the most revealing source of information related to Cushing's work lay in the Brain Tumor Registry's15,000 photographic negatives. Cushing's negatives portraypatients pre- and postoperatively, gross specimens, tumorspecimens, photomicrographs, journal excerpts, letters andany other number of images relating to the early years ofbrain tumor surgery. The photographs often portray obsoletesurgical practices as well as tumors that have grown to pro-portions rarely seen today outside the Third World. Theyalso allude to the symptomatology, signs and diagnostic tech-niques that led Cushing, Eisenhardt and Bailey to lay thefoundations of modern neurosurgery and neuropathology.Approximately 80 percent of the negatives are etched intothe emulsion of 5-by-7-inch glass plates; the remaining celluloid lm. Owing to the negatives' largeformat, the prints are striking for their clarity and detail. Because the negatives are in chronological order cor- related with the hospital records, Cushing preserved for 28 A neurosurgeon's photographic legacy 29 history a remarkable photographic diary. In the photographic negatives, one can follow Cushing's observations of the clini-cal presentation of disease. One sees the sudden emergenceof new surgical approaches, documented in the records andcomplemented by novel intraoperative drawings and photo-graphs of patients with craniotomy scars indicative of achanging technique. In these images, radiographs provideevidence of the emergence of the silver hemostatic clip; por-traits exhibit similarities in and histological photo-micrographs highlight the utilization of staining techniquesthat Bailey brought to the Brigham. The microlmed hospital records that accompany the photographs indicate that Cushing cultivated in his residentsthe same meticulous attention to factual detail for which heis known. Past medical histories, family histories, complaints,progress notes, laboratory and perimetry results, neurologi-cal and physical examinations, operative notes, postmortemreports, telegrams, correspondence, and Cushing's ubiqui-tous operative sketches make the records so comprehensivethat scientic studies of the cases, including the applicationsof premorbidity scales, are possible. The photographic nega-tives and patient records tell the historian much aboutCushing, indeed much about the state of clinical medicineand surgery at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in the earlypart of the 20th century. Cushing's photographic legacy To further understand the possible contributing factors behind Cushing's interest in photographing his patients, oneneeds to review a brief history of photography itself. In 1839Louis-Jacques-Mand\u00e9 Daguerre presented to the world histechnique for developing a photographic process based on mercury vapor and silver iodide xed by hot commonsalt. Although fragile, the daguerreotype was extremely popu-lar in America between 1839 and 1860, about 3 millionbeing produced each year at a peak in the early 1850s.Medical journals began to photograph patients before andafter surgery, primarily for head and neck cancers and plastic procedures. Following the daguerreotype, a wet plate process that used collodion, a mixture of guncotton in alcohol and ether,was introduced to make the rst photographs on glass. Theambrotype perfected the collodion process in 1854 but was In 1911, while he was at Johns Hopkins University, neurosurgeonHarvey Cushing operated on this patient, who suffered fromacromegaly. yale medicine spring 200830 A neurosurgeon's photographic legacy Cushing's collection of photo- graphs shows patients of all agesand in different stages of treat-ment. The patient on the left, forexample, has a dressing for aperipheral nerve repair. No caserecord was available for thepatient in the middle photograph.The asymmetry of the face of the girl on the right is the resultof a left porecephalic cyst in her left hemisphere. 31 Case records for the woman on the left and the girl on the right havenot yet been matched to the photo-graphs. The girl in the middle hadcraniopharyngioma, a slow-growingtumor that afflicts children betweenthe ages of 5 and 10. The photo-graph shows the right temporaldecompression that was done torelieve pressure. yale medicine spring 200832 A neurosurgeon's photographic legacy such pituitary tumors as acromegaly, a rare disorder that results in increased growth of bone and soft tissue, could beidentied in pictures and documented for publication, andthe photographs could be repeated to look for progression or remission after surgery. However, Cushing did not photo-graph only those patients with obvious phenotypic expres-sion of their disorders; he photographed essentially everypatient in his care. Although it is not clear how most of theseimages contributed to patient care, education, or research atthe time, the possible unintended consequences for art andhistory are incredibly powerful. These patients' photographs are most likely the rst, as well as the most complete, catalog of neurological diseaseat the beginning of the 20th century. What makes them even more powerful is Cushing's compulsive cross-referenceprocess that ties each picture to the available hospital recordon microlm. Cushing also captured in the patients' faceswhat we do not image today\u2014loneliness, fear, pain, trust,despair, and often just stoicism. By any measure, Cushing's written and photographic diary of neurosurgery in the early part of the 20th centurysteps beyond semantic issues. The technique and large for-mat of the photographic negatives capture a raw emotionalenergy and oftentimes macabre subject matter that bring the viewer into empathetic participation with Cushing'spatients. This relationship becomes much more sublimewhen one stops to consider the age of the photographs andrecognizes that while neurosurgery has changed so muchover this past century, the experience of being a patienthas not. In 1969, the year Cushing would have been a centenarian, the neurosurgeon and author Wilder Penfield, m.d., qualified him as \"an artist, a Leonardo da Vinci devoting his talent to surgery.\" The passing of time and there-evaluation of the materials belonging to the HarveyCushing Brain Tumor Registry conrm the accuracy ofPeneld's statement. YMsoon replaced by the tintype, invented by Hamilton L. Smith in Ohio in 1856. In 1880, a bank clerk named George Eastmanobtained a patent in the United States for a photographic dry plate developed in England in 1878. He followed his dryplates with the invention of photographic lm in roll form in 1883. By 1900, cheap cellulose lm and cameras wereavailable to the public. Cushing or the unknown photogra-pher at the Brigham, however, chose to continue using thedry glass plate technique from the earliest photo available in1903 to the latest one in 1930. Several later photos weretaken with the newer cellulose lm; they have not withstoodthe aging process. On the other hand, the glass plates areperfectly preserved and are of remarkably high quality. Cushing's early 20th-century portraits were grounded in the late 19th-century tradition of scientic facial photogra-phy. Although X-ray imaging was to emerge as the nextextension of human sight, peeling off one more layer of tis-sue between the viewer and the living brain, Cushing usedphotographs as an extension of his diagnostic powers and acatalog of his historical sense. In the Cushing Brain Tumor Registry for 75 years had lain the portraits of every patient Cushing touched, almostalways photographed before and after an operation, butmany times serially during the hospital stay, particularly ifthe patient were deteriorating. When there was nothingmore Cushing could do as a surgeon, he documented theunrelenting course of the illness and the patient's death.And, for the majority of his patients who survived, he oftenchronicled their clinic visits, sending the patient down for a \"routine photo,\" as we would repeat an mri scan today. Unfortunately, we have no clue as to who took these pic-tures, whether it was the same person or a series of photog-raphers. The quality, however, speaks for a professional who understood how these diseases were to be representedfor Cushing and who knew that the quality and perma-nence of the glass plate method were superior to the moreacceptable and common practice of using cellulose lm. Cushing never wrote about his patient portraits or their faces as an emotional response to their diseases.Instead, he described brain disease, often for the rst time,through the camera's lens. Cushing's groundbreaking workin identifying and classifying tumors of pituitary and parapi-tuitary origin may have stimulated the rst photographs of patients with these tumors.

But Cushing'sprodigious talents found expres-sion in yet another form: he wasalso a gifted medical illustrator. A lecture last fall titled \"Harvey Cushing: The Artist,\" of the Cushing legacy. \"HarveyCushing was many to manypeople: a master neurosurgeon,the father of endocrinology, buthe was also a first-rate medicalillustrator,\" said Robert Udelsman, m.d. ,m.b.a. , chair and the William H. Carmalt Professor of Surgery. Cushing displayed artistic abil- ity at an early age. A picture of alion he drew at age 16 reveals thework of a precocious talent, farfrom the doodles of a typicalteenage boy. Cushing's sharp eyeis also evident in sketches of hisbrother, Ned, and in pictures ofthe Cuban countryside he drewwhile on vacation in 1894. But Cushing didn't draw pic- tures just to entertain himself; hisdrawings served as a detailedrecord of what he observed. Thisartistic purpose became increas-ingly important to him when heenrolled in the Harvard MedicalSchool and later, when he becamea house pupil, as interns werethen called, at the MassachusettsGeneral Hospital. Cushing \"drew as a method of conveying what he saw on theclinical wards,\" Udelsman said.One pen-and-ink drawing found inCushing's man with Cheyne-Stokesrespiration. Another drawing de- picts a man with a massive goiterthat resembles a sack of potatoes. Cushing's artistic mentor was Max Br\u00f6del, known as the fatherof modern medical illustration.The two met at Johns HopkinsUniversity, where Br\u00f6del hadestablished the Department ofArt as Applied to Medicine.Br\u00f6del taught Cushing his tech-niques, which included the use ofchiaroscuro \u2014contrasts between dark and light to achieve a senseof volume in depicting three-dimensional objects. Cushing,always a quick student, adoptedthis method and used it effec-tively to convey such images as a neurosurgeon's-eye view of the human brain. As Cushing's medical career pro- gressed and his skills as an artistgrew, he started making illustra-tions of the medical procedures heplanned to use. One Cushing illus-tration shows a patient with a cleftpalate; in the next drawing, onecan see Cushing carefully workingout his plans to perform the correc-tive operation. Cushing was photographed often during his illustrious career;a familiar picture shows him in his dressing room after surgery,head bent over his pad. He's stillwearing surgical gloves as hesketches his operative findings.Today, doctors tape-record theirclinical observations, but forCushing, words and photographsfell short of what could be con-veyed by a skilled illustrator\u2014sohe made sure he became one. \u2014Jennifer Kaylin Harvey Cushing made drawings, including landscapes during aCuban vacation, in order to keep a detailed record of what heobserved.

From each woman 's story Clinton plucked details that illustrated such themes of her campaign as her proposal foruniversal health coverage. \"Universal health care is not justthe moral thing to do, it's the economically smart thing todo,\" she said.

Following a tradition dating back to 1949, the Class of 2010 presented The Unaccreditables , its second-year show, in February. As their predecessors havedone for almost six decades, the stu-dents mocked deans, faculty and oneanother in a multimedia show thatincluded live singing and dancing onstage as well as videos\u2014including onein which Dean Robert J. Alpern, m.d., Ensign Professor of Medicine, playedhimself as an embezzling gangsta. That was one subplot in a grander scheme that portrayed a faculty boardmeeting as a sit-down of mob capos,with the school as a criminal enter-prise. The capos' current problem isgetting the school Committee on Medical Educa-tion ( lcme ). Unfortunately, there's no way the school will pass muster. Thecommittee has doubts about the school's\"hands-off approach to medical educa-tion,\" aka the Yale system.

Lisa Sanders , m.d. '97, hs'01, loves a good story and has built her careeraround her narrative skills, beginningwith her early days in television andcontinuing through her subsequentdecade in medicine. The form her taleshave taken, however, has changed over the years. A few years ago, when an editor friend asked Sanders what she thoughtdoctors could write about, her answerwas that they write one thing and theywrite it every day: the history and physi-cal. Her belief in the storytelling powerof the H-and-P led to \"Diagnosis,\" a monthly column in The New York Times Sunday Magazine , about cases that stump doctors and how they areultimately resolved. In Sanders' hands, the column 's H-and-P format is aneffective way of weaving tales aboutsuch cases as an emaciated 9-year-oldgirl who suffered months of vomitingand diarrhea before being diagnosedwith Addison disease, or a young manwhose Hodgkin disease was diagnosedafter frightening episodes of memoryloss. The column 's success inspired the TV series House , about a curmudg- eonly physician who is a brilliant diagnostician. \"Until House came about, diagnosis [in TV medical dramas] was the one-liner between symptomsand the terrible response to treatment. House takes that moment and looks at it, which is what my column did,\"said Sanders. Sanders started her working life not in medicine but in journalism. Aftergraduating from the College of Williamand Mary in 1979, she worked as a pro-ducer at cbsNews, where she earned an Emmy Award. By the early 1990s, shewas looking for something else to dowith her life. She had covered medicineand it had captured her attention. \"Ithought, 'This is something interesting.'If I can do it, it will be fun,\" she said.\" And it turns out it has been fun.\" In 1992, after two years at Columbia University's Post-Baccalaureate Pre-medical Program, Sanders entered theSchool of Medicine. At age 36 she wasthe oldest member of the Class of 1996.She completed her internal medicineresidency at Yale and became chief resi-dent in 2000. Since then, Sanders has combined her talent for storytelling with her pas-sion for medicine. She is an assistantclinical professor of medicine at theSchool of Medicine and teaches in theYale Primary Care Residency Programat Waterbury Hospital. Sanders believesthat when talking with the same patient,different doctors get both the same story and a different story, depending on how comfortable the patient feelsand what questions the doctors ask.Eliciting a history is an important skill,she believes, and one she spends a lot of time helping residents develop. Shealso uses the physical exam to teach resi-dents how to think about and approachproblems. Although she occasionallylectures, Sanders feels that medicineisn 't learned that way. \"The trick inmedicine is not facts,\" she said. \"Thetrick is guring out how to apply whatyou know to the case at hand. That actu-ally turns out to be a very difcult skill.\" Alumna Lisa Sanders had a career in journalism before turning to medicine. Now she combinesboth pursuits in a column in The New York Times Sunday Magazine. joh n cu rtis41 A gastroenterologist moves around the country and into atop job at ucsd An academic journey that began at Yale's Ezra Stiles College in 1971 has led David A.

After an internal medicine resi- dency Haven Hospital\u2014\"I escaped after 11 years,\" he chuck-led\u2014a fascination with basic researchbrought him to the National Instituteof Arthritis, Diabetes, and Digestiveand Kidney Diseases. In 1985 he wentto ucsd for a gastroenterology fellow- ship, later joining the faculty. Next hejoined the University of North Carolinaat Chapel Hill as chief of the Divisionof Digestive Diseases and Nutrition,and in 2003 he became chair of medi-cine at Columbia University's Collegeof Physicians and Surgeons, where hisdaughter Laura is currently a medicalstudent. (His son, Nathan, is a recentgraduate of the University of Georgia.)San Diego, though, has lured him back.In February he became vice chancellorfor health sciences and dean of theschool of medicine after his predeces-sor, Edward W. Holmes, m.d., accepted two research positions in Singapore.Brenner is head of the schools of medi-cine and pharmacy as well as of the hospital and its faculty, and his dutiesbring him into close contact with stu-dents, bench researchers, patients anddecision makers for the university as a whole. Brenner's interest in research began early. At Yale College he majored inbiology. In medical school, he began working with researchers in the YaleLiver Study Unit. \"I was always inter-ested in biochemistry and genetic diseases, and I picked this because itlooked interesting, not because Ithought there was something intrinsi-cally interesting about the regulation of metabolism by the liver,\" Brennersaid. \"Gerald Klatskin, one of the mostfamous hepatologists ever, was directorof the liver study unit, so I just stayed,and got interested in liver disease.\"With his mentor, Joseph R. Bloomer, m.d. ,fw'72, a student of Klatskin 's and now director of the Liver Center at the University of Alabama atBirmingham, Brenner published sev-eral papers in the late 1970s on thegroup of diseases known as the por-phyrias, enzyme disorders that causeskin problems or neurological compli-cations. He and Bloomer remain continued to makeimportant contributions to knowledgeabout protoporphyria; intracellular signaling and regulation of tran-scription in the liver; and the processof hepatic brosis. From 2001 to 2006 he served as editor in chief ofthe eld's most prestigious journal, Gastroenterology . His current research explores why so many types of liver disease lead to the same ends\u2014cirrhosis or perma-nent brotic change. \"The liver's notthat smart; like brain.There's a limited repertoire of responsesto insult, it doesn 't matter what the ini-tial insult is; the nal common path-way is very similar,\" he said. \"The onlyeffective drugs now for brosis aredirected at the treatment for the under-lying condition. But the goal is toSanders listens to each person 's story, never spending fewer than 20minutes with a patient. She specializes in obesity and has plans to set up anoutpatient obesity clinic at WaterburyHospital. Several years ago, whileresearching low-carbohydrate diets,Sanders realized that adhering to a wayof eating, rather than a specic diet, is the key to losing weight. This led toher 2004 book, The Perfect Fit Diet: How to Lose Weight, Keep It Off, and StillEat the Foods You Love (St. Martin 's Grifn), which offers guidelines on howto devise a sensible eating plan based on personal food preferences. Sanders lives in New Haven with her husband, writer Jack Hitt, and their two daughters. She ts teaching, con-sulting, writing and treating patientsinto her schedule by getting up at 4 a.m.to write for three hours before begin-ning the rest of her day. In addition toher column, she is working on her sec-ond book, The Tools of the Trade: The Art and Science of Medical Mysteries . Scheduled for publication next spring,the book seeks to put the reader into the doctors' shoes as they negotiate theuncertainty between symptoms anddiagnosis. She loves writing because itrequires her to step back from theimmediacy of treating patients, butmedicine is the driving force behindeverything she undertakes. As for what her future holds, the ending tothat story hasn 't been written yet. \"Iused to have ve-year plans,\" she said,\"but nothing I've has been on them.\" \u2014Jill MaxDavid Brenner \"escaped\" from Yale after 11 years as a medical student and resident beforehis academic journey led to the University of California, San Diego, where he is vice chan-cellor for health sciences and the dean of the medical school.lourdes fe lix yale medicine spring 200842 alumni faces A public health alumna brings social justice to the campaignfor healthy food Michele Simon , m.p.h . '90, incensed \"on marketing to getpeople to [consume] the wrong things.\"She's convinced that advertisements foralcohol, tobacco and junk foods pro-mote chronic illnesses. And that's whythe author of Appetite for Prot: How the Food Industry Undermines Our Healthand How to Fight Back (Nation Books, 2006) crusades against \"diseases causedby marketing.\" As part of her food campaign, Simon established the website www.informedeating.org to build awareness of the politics of food, and to encourage activepublic responses to the food industry.Simon gives frequent speeches in whichshe urges, \"Look at what the food indus-try has done to alter our choices, thengo after agricultural policy in a social-justice way. For example, poor commu-nities suffer because of the availabilityof inexpensive alcohol and the lack ofhealthy food.\" Simon is also the researchand policy director for the Marin Insti-tute, an alcohol industry watchdoggroup in California. Likening her crusade to antismoking campaigns, Simon asked, \"How can wechange the laws so that eating healthy is not the exception? Agricultural poli-cies are heavily influenced by industry.We're subsidizing the wrong kinds offoods\u2014we don 't even produce enoughfruits and vegetables to meet daily rec-ommended servings.\" Simon 's passion germinated during her years as a biology major atCarnegie Mellon University and herdevelop specic therapies that are directed at brosis itself, and not theunderlying agent.

The whole eld is keyed onthis one single disease [colon cancer]and one single procedure.\" Indeed,recent advances in imaging technologymay force gastroenterologists, ready or not, to alter their practice pattern.\"This interest in CT virtual colono-graphs [a less invasive means ofscreening for colon cancer]\u2014what if itbecomes the major way of screening?Then all these millions of patients willnot need an endoscopist. ... In 10 moreyears, diagnostic endoscopy might nolonger be done. I wish the eld wouldbe more general, more entrepreneurialabout issues of nutrition, obesity andGI diseases.\" European gastroenter-ologists have been more inquisitive inthis sense than their American col-leagues. \"When a new technologybecomes available, they bring it intotheir practice, whether it's ultrasoundor CT.\" In the United States, cardiacultrasound is done by cardiologists,but abdominal ultrasound is still theprovince of radiologists.

Dollard Professor Emeritus of Law, Medicineand Psychiatry at the Yale Law School.[See; \" A Campaign Makes a Stop at YaleUniversity,\" p. 34] Simon became Katz'sresearch assistant and was influencedby his pioneering work in bioethics and informed consent. \"He certainlyhad an impact on me in combininghealth and law.\" At that time Yale offered neither a health policy concentration nor jointdegrees in law and public health, butSimon was permitted to design her ownprogram, which included courses inlaw, medicine and business. \"I'm grate-ful I was able to do something thatreally suited me, and always felt I gotsupport from the faculty,\" she said. During her rst job, at California's Department of Health Services-Genetic Disease Branch, Simon decidedto enhance her health policy credibil-ity and earned her j.d. at University of California Hastings College of theLaw in 1995. Then, inspired by hernew vegetarian diet and convinced thatnutrition curricula at colleges and universities often reflect industry-influenced \"science,\" Simon taughtherself about nutrition and quicklyidentied key political issues. \"With so much scientic evidence pointing to a plant-based diet beingsuperior, why does the government tell us to eat meat and dairy every day? Whyare school lunch programs so heavy onanimal products?\" she wondered. Usingher legal training, Simon targeted nutri-tion policy, which was traditionally con-cerned with remedial programs like foodstamps. \"I was interested in quality, notjust access\u2014how to help people behealthier rather than just not hungry.\" She soon discovered a prominent nutritionist, Marion Nestle, ph.d ., the Paulette Goddard Professor of Nutritionat New York University's Nutrition, FoodStudies and Public Health Departmentand author of Food Politics and What to Eat, who was uncovering how politics influences America's food choices. \"I'ma disciple of hers, a great admirer, follow-ing in the trail she blazed, popularizingthe notion of politics attached to what weeat,\" Simon said. Working with colleagues at Yale's Rudd Center for Food Policy andObesity, Simon analyzed industry influ-ences on state food-related laws; herreport, which argued that despite recentlegislation to improve school food, moreneeds to be done, was published in the Food and Drug Law Journal in 2007. In late 2006, she spoke at both Rudd andthe School of Public Health. \"It was a lotof fun to go back as an alum. Talkingabout how I combine public health withlaw was a great opportunity to encouragegraduates of the m.p.h . program to pur- sue policy and law, a growing eld.Some major funders are seeing the needfor more lawyers to work on nutrition.\" Nestle calls Simon \"an unusually clear thinker about food issues, as sheproves in Appetite for Prot , a terric book. I use it to teach students how tointerpret what food corporations reallymean when they mutter platitudes about wanting to improve health, and to understand why the goals of foodcompanies and public health can neverreally overlap. She's so on top of theissues that I'm always learning newthings from her.\" Now in its second printing, Simon 's well-reviewed book provides practicaltools for \"going up against the foodindustry. It's a voice for people whohave been working on this issue, frus-trated by the obstacles.\" (She has chapters on \"Exposing GovernmentComplicity\" and \"Battling Big Food inSchools.\") And, challenging a centralargument of the food industry\u2014thatnutrition is a personal lifestyle choice,not a matter of public policy\u2014she said,\"This isn 't just a matter of personalchoice\u2014it's a societal responsibility.\" \u2014Carol MilanoWhile earning her public health degree at Yale, Michele Simon designed her own educationalprogram, which included courses in law, medi-cine and business.

Public health alumna's water project reaches its first milestone in Niger Just over a year ago Ariane Kirtley, m.p.h . '04, described in words and photographs her work in the Azawak, a remote region inthe western African country of Niger [See \"Water is Life,\" Winter2007]. Prolonged drought, she found, was threatening the exist-ence of the region's inhabitants, many of whom are nomadicpastoralists. \"These people are literally dying of thirst becausethey do not have access to water,\" Kirtley said. \"This is one of thepoorest regions in one of the poorest countries in the world.There are no roads, few schools, little health care and almost nohumanitarian assistance.\" In this remote area of 80,000 square miles, where it can take two days on the back of a donkey to reach a clinic or school,reliable sources of potable water are essential to survival, Kirtleysaid. During a visit to New Haven in October, she reported thefirst success of the organization she founded, Amman Imman,which is dedicated to building boreholes that will draw waterfrom between 600 and 3,000 feet below the surface. \"We have built the first borehole,\" she said, adding that it is located in the village of Tangarwashane, with a popula-tion that fluctuates between 300 and 500. \"It serves not onlythe village but all the communities surrounding the villageand all the nomads that come through.\" The borehole provideswater for 5,000 people who live in seven communities withina 10-mile radius. During the dry season as many as 25,000people and animals will take water from the borehole. Construction began in January 2007 and was com- pleted in July of that year. The borehole has four animaltroughs, a tower that holds up to 5,300 gallons of water, awater fountain with six faucets near the water tower andanother fountain with two faucets in the village. Kirtley's nonprofit organization also created a local com- mittee that will ensure maintenance and financial, environ-mental and social management of the borehole. And, sheadded, providing clean water has brought other changes. \"Theyhave built a school,\" she said. \"They have started growing subsistence crops.

Fifteenyears later she was ready to return to an orchestra. \"Many of uswere very dedicated musicians at another time in our lives,\" shesaid, \"but there usually aren't any opportunities at the medicalschool to do this.\" Duffy sees the orchestra, which receives financial support from the School of Medicine and Yale-New Haven Hospital, as a way to build bridges among people in the schools and depart-ments of the medical campus. \"It's a real opportunity to create a community amidst the community,\" he said. \u2014 Jennifer Kaylinend note About 90 students and faculty members from the medical school gathered in December to play music by Vivaldi, Beethoven and othercomposers in the first rehearsal of what ishoped will become the Yale Medical SymphonyOrchestra.
