Unsafe abortion is a common problem and much time and resources are taken with the care of women suffering haemorrhage, infection and pain after self-induced abortion in both Thai and Burmese-led health facilities. The thesis examines the characteristics of 43 Burmese women admitted to health facilities with post-abortion complications and their chosen methods of self-induced abortion. There is no commonly agreed definition of abortion between formal, informal health workers or women. Most people considered it morally proscribed and in some cases knew it was illegal, but stil l felt it was necessary. Some aspects of post-abortion care are performed better by in formally than formally trained health workers. Post-abortion family planni ng was poorly performed by Thai health workers. Lay midwives play a central ro le in fertility management and some are abortionists. Burmese women's partners are not well informed about fertility management and frequently decline vasectom y. Within a relm of limited traditional and modern reproductive choices, women ma nage their fertility outcomes. The Burmese women in this study are genera lly married with children. Considered illegal migrants, they are employed and work in Thailand without work permits. Many women have a history of escaping hum an rights abuses and entrenched poverty in Burma. At least a third of women admitted into care with post-abortion complications have induced their abortion wi th oral herbal prep arations, pummelling manipulations or stick abortions. Most of the abortion servic es are provided by Burmese lay midwives. Reasons for term inating the pregnancy include: poverty, gender-based violence and the local illnes s of 'weakness'. In addition, incomplete sexual health knowledge, and difficult access to reproductive health services play a part in mistimed pregnancy. I argue that a lack of rights increases women's ri sk of unsafe abortion. The rights to work and earn a fair wage and to move without fear influence reproductive health iiichoices and access to health services. A la ck of sexual health information for men and women and the ability to safely control fertility causes unwanted pregnancies. Furthermore, violence perpetrated at the individual and state le vel contributes to unsafe abortion. Burmese women's mortality and morbidity associated with unsafe abortion in Thailand is largely unrecord ed and unknown to the Burmese military government. Unwanted and mistimed pregnancy can be avoided through reproductive technologies, education programmes, and access to modern contraceptives. To safely terminate unwanted pregnancies and to trea t the complications of pregnancy loss is a woman's right. Burma and Thailand are signatories to Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Descrimination Against Women, yet Burmese women continue to suffer, become sterile, socially vilified, unemployed or repatriated to Burma due to their reproductive status. Their sickness and deaths ar e secondary to the economic imperatives of Burma and Thailand. ivDeclaration This is to certify that: i) the thesis comprises only my original work towards the PhD, ii) due acknowledgement has been made in the test to all other material used, ii) the thesis is less that 100,000 words in length, exclusive of tables, maps, bibliographies and appendices. ______________ Suzanne Belton vAcknowledgements While the journey to gain a scholastic qualification is at times an exquisitely lonely experience for the academic neophyte, it is never achieved alone. The thesis is the sum result of a multitude of people not onl y my own. This research was made possible by the dedicated staff at the Mae Ta o Clinic who gave their time and insights for which I am grateful. The Mae Tao Clin ic is home, school, temple, church, welfare agency, public relations department and a uni que model of refugee-led primary health care that treats thousands of Burmese migr ant workers and refugees every year. The Mae Tao staff in Reproductive In-patient a nd Out-patient Departments helped design the interviews, participated in the interviews and then recruited their female patients as they approached recovery and discharge. They collected the 'abortion sticks' from their patient's wombs and shared their sorr ows over the many tragedies witnessed. The staff of the Medical Records Depart ment diligently recalled the hundreds of patients' medical records despite their own h eavy workloads. The research assistants were not only skilled tran slators of language and cultu re but also compassionate, patient people who could speak with women and men about some of the most intimate moments of their lives. Naw Rose was pa rticularly important during the research process. I am indebted to many others in the community who assisted in a multitude of ways. Naw Dah and Ko Latt were also very helpful. Dr Cynthia Maung's quiet ways of achieving justice and bringing hea lth services to those people from Burma who are desperately in need, despite enormous adversity, is truly impressive. She is an example of Christian faith that inspir es others who do not follow the dogma. I am perhaps most grateful to the women a nd men who talked about their intimate problems and thoughts. I would also like to give cred it and thanks to the medical and nursing staff at the Mae Sot General Hospital who are also very c oncerned by the amount of sickness due to induced abortion in the Burmese communit y. Dr Lek Nopdonrattakoon, Chief of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology gave careful advice and supervised the research in his department. Th ai staff also spend valuable time and resources healing Burmese women after botched abortions. viThe Key Centre for Women's Health in Soci ety and the University of Melbourne is acknowledged for financial and intellectual support. Professor Lenore Manderson's approach to women in health is simu ltaneously gendered, historicised and motivational. Her support for my research and belief in my ability was important to me. In particular Dr Andrea Whittaker , my supervisor has provided her time, experience and guidance. I have appreci ated Andrea's expert knowledge which she has graciously and patiently allowed me to tap. Andrea's calm and respectful attitude and her wise mentorship provided the base from which I have achieved more than I thought possible. Thanks also to Dr Shelly Mallet who st epped in to cover Andrea's maternity leave. Meeting Dr Perti Pelto in the first year of my candidature was insightful and he gave me some anthropologi cal tools with which to begin. He called me a 'tiger' which I took as a complement. My fellow students at the Key Centre - Narelle, Poy, Natalie, Atika, Holly, Lakshmi, Liz, Sari, Sarthy, Katie, Bella, Li Ping, Rosa, Elizabeth, Sokrin, Anoh have provi ded much encouragement, advice and comfort. Several non-government organisations in Thailand provided information such as statistics, interviews and reports which have helped in the production of this thesis. I thank Brenda Belak, Inge Sterk, Dr Tara Sullivan, Dr Dan Dwyer for their helpful insights to the initial drafts. Inge also gave permi ssion to reprint some photographs from her own collection. My trusty proof readers Clare, Rachel, Natalie, Jo and Michael helped enormously. Ma Nwi Ne Htun assisted with Burman language translation. I accept that any mistakes or misunderstanding are my own. The cold winter in Oxford at the Refugee Studies Centre in Queen Elizabeth House provided the warmth of friendships and discussion with like-minded fellows. My partner Daniel Henderson pr ovided me with encouragem ent from which I drew strength, and Mum and Dad have always a ssumed that I could do it but would have preferred that I was closer to home while I was doing so. viiTable of Contents Abstract .......................................................................................................................ii Declaration .................................................................................................................iv Acknowledgements ......................................................................................................v Table of Contents .......................................................................................................vii List of Tables .............................................................................................................xii List of Plates ............................................................................................................ xiii List of Figures ...........................................................................................................xiv List of Boxes .............................................................................................................xiv List of Appendices ......................................................................................................xv List of Acronyms .......................................................................................................xvi Glossary ................................................................................................................ xviii Beginnings & endings .................................................................................................xx Chapter 1 Refugees, rights and reproductive health.............................................................................. 1 Study objectives ...........................................................................................................3 What is reproductive health? ............................................................................................ 6 All the dead women -

The tsunami disaster has just devast ated vast coastal areas in Asia. Thailand, India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia are reporting massive loss of life and infrastructure. Typically the military government in Burma is virtually silent and has reported less than 100 dead or missing people, a number questioned by the BBC World service news and other journalists as being im possibly small (Anonym ous, 2005; McElroy, 2005). The Bangkok Post reports that at least 800 Burmese migrant workers in Thailand from Ranong, Phuket, Phangna, Trang, Satun and Krabi are missing, according to Surapong Kongchanthuek, deputy chairman of the Law Society of Thailand's Committee on Human Rights fo r Stateless and Displaced People (Anonymous, 2004a). A Burmese dissi dent in exile writes in the Asian Tribune that some Burmese interpret the earthquake that caused the tsunami as an omen of bad luck evidenced by the collapse of the Ma w-Tin-Soun Pagoda in Bassein, and a sign that Senior General Than Shwe's milit ary government will end (Myint Thein, 2005). Despite the implosion of some of the junt a's leading figures dur ing 2002 to 2004, the Burmese regime appears to be extremely r obust (Lintner, 2003). Firstly, the demise of the highly influential General Ne Win in 2002 who supposedly was coordinating a counter coup, ended with his daughter under house arrest a nd three grandson's imprisoned and sentenced to death. General Ne Win died an elderly man in December 2002. Secondly, the surprise 'reti rement' of Lt General Khin Nyunt (a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Ne Win) in 2004, who was the former head of the Directorate of Defence Services Intelligence and short-lived Prime Minister, was accused of corruption and he and his family are probably in a detention centre. Analysts suggest he was too moderate and conciliatory toward the National League for Democracy (NLD) and in promoting the roadmap to democracy (Alternative As ean Network on Burma, 2004; Irrawaddy Publishing Group, 2004). The plan to grad ually introduce democracy and re-write Burma's suspended constitution is still underway at the National Convention which will reconvene in February 2005. The na mes of participants in the National Convention are not in the public domain and the National League for Democracy has decided not to participate, fundamenta lly undermining the credibility of the xxiConvention as the NLD won a landslide el ection in 1989. The most obvious omission is Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Secretary Ge neral of the NLD and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate. She has just r eceived an honorary Doctorate in Politics, Philosophy and Economics from Rangsit University in Tha iland and as she remains under house arrest in Rangoon for the third time in her life, sh e did not collect it in person (Rangsit University, 2005). She is lucky to have survived the attempted assignation in Depayin, northern Burma in May 2003, as many of her colleagues and supporters did not. In Bangkok during 2004, I watched the unedited video taken by her colleagues that had been smuggled out of Burma and was overwhelmed by the huge crowds who were so clearly delighted to see her. Da w Suu was released from nineteen months house arrest in early May 2003 and began a t our of northern Burma. She was warmly received by vast crowds of people in each village and town as she rallied support for her political party. Ominously the video finished abruptly as her cavalcade drove into the dark toward Depayin. Amnesty International (Amn esty International, 2004) reports a minimum four dead people and scor es were arrested as they were attacked with iron rods and bamboo staves. The Un ited Nations General Assembly called for an open enquiry and an investigation into the military government's involvement into the Depayin incident but this has not happened (Commission on Human Rights, 2004). Although there have been re ports of thousands of Burmese criminals and a few political prisoners being released from pr ison over the past months, Daw Suu remains confined to her home with minimal secu rity and maximum surveillance (National Coalition Government of Union of Burma, 2004). The most famous political prisoner to be released so far is student leader Min Ko Naing, who spent sixteen years mostly in solidarity confinement in Sittwe Prison after the 1988 uprising. In a moment of rare public intervention, ASEAN members called for the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in July 2004 (Amnes ty International, 2004). The UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy visited Burma twice duri ng 2004 in attempts to renew dialogue between the National League for Democracy and the military government (SPDC). He discovered a covert listen ing device while he was interviewing prisoners in March and decided to end his visit prematurely (Amnesty Intern ational, 2004). There are current reports of members of the National League for Demo cracy still being arrested and imprisoned (Nakashima, 2004). xxiiEconomically the situation remains very poor, the banking sy stem collapsed in February 2004 and partial sanctions by th e United States of American and the European Union remain in place. One pos itive news story involves the long-running court case against the American multinati onal company Unocal and the Yandana Gas Pipeline Project. Unocal in association with the Burmese military was accused of relocating villages, forced labour, rape and torture in the implem entation of its energy project. The American court concluded they were responsible in colluding in these human rights abuses for its own profit a nd must compensate the people (Campbell, 2004). Despite some ceasefire agreements, fighting continues with ethnic minority groups in Karen, Shan and Mon States and the Kare n Women's Organisation broke decades of silence and published a report outlining rape of civilian women and children by the Burmese military (Karen Women's Organisation, 2004). The situation for migrant workers in Tha iland remains troubled but they too have gained a small victory. In August 2004, a court in Tak Province ordered the Nut Knitwear Factory in Mae Sot to give eight een Burmese workers their back-pay and compensate them for abusive treatment. Workers complained they worked exceptionally long shifts for le ss than half of the legal da ily wage. The factory owner fired the workers when they complained about their working conditions and some workers were deported back to Burma. This is the first time that Burmese workers have ever won a case against an employe r in a Thai court (Shah Paung, 2004). But for female Burmese workers, the situati on remains exceptionally poor. Workers who wish to work legally must register with Thai authorities and undergo health checks; those who are found to be pregnant are to be deported to Burma. A recent article in the Bangkok Post reports Vice Minister Pira Ma nathas from the Department of Labour stating they will be sent home to gi ve birth in order to reduce the problem of stateless children in Thailand (Penchan Ch aroensuthipan, 2004). Sanitsuda Ekachai, Ekachai, 2004) Assistant Editor to the Bangkok Post , gets straight to the point in her commentary. She believes th at impoverished women from Burma will chose unsafe abortion methods so they may st ay and work in Thailand, a country that offers meagre opportunities to those who are forced to cross borders in order to survive. After completing my own research in this study I agree with he r that this xxiiishort-sighted policy will only increase the costs incurred by the health system in Thailand as many women will require medical treatment after botched abortions. It will also pressure more women to work in the illegal sector where there is less scrutiny of their reproductive status. Th is will leave Burmese women even more exposed to employers who ma y wish to exploit them. The Mae Tao Clinic, the refugee-led primar y health care service where this study originated, remains intact and functioning de spite some threats by the Thai authorities of refoulement to Burma duri ng the later part of 2003. This never eventuated. The Mae Tao Clinic's role in serving the info rmal refugee and migrant worker community is too valuable to dismantle. In Dece mber 2004, Dr Cynthia Maung, the Coordinator of the Mae Tao Clinic, sent me a statemen t she wanted to incl ude in our report Working Our Way Back Home: Fertility and pregnancy loss at the border of Thailand which has just been published in Burman. I reproduce part of it here so you may hear her voice: In Thailand, government policies discourage pregnant migrant women from working. Employer regulations mean that the children of migrant workers cannot be accommodated. Workers often have to live at the workplace and many employers will not allow the children to stay with th eir parents. Most employers do not allow parents to bring their children to work. Bringing a child into this environment is a difficult decision for people to make. When a pregnancy occurs and the child is unplanned, there are more difficult decisions to make which in some cases end in induced abortion. There are powerful social stigmas attach ed to abortion and family planning, especially for unmarried women and younger women. These attitudes are barriers to women coming forward to receive contraception or post abortion care. If they do come forward they face discrimination by health workers who can hold negative opinions of the women. It is imperative that appropriate technical, social and cultural support is provided to women. Improvements must be made in client/ health provider communications to ensure the continuity of services. Effective reproductive health programmes require collaboration among a ll health services including the Thai hospitals and non-governmental organisations. It is also imperative that community organisations be recognised and empowered to represent the communities they work for... The most pressing policy issues at both in ternational and national levels concern protection of the human rights of the most vulnerable groups, especially for women and girls. It is imperative that migr ant women can have their reproductive rights recognised and be empowered to organi se themselves to improve their working conditions, not only for their own benef it but also for their families and the community. xxivIn 2004 many of the senior health workers at the Mae Tao Clinic accepted asylum in the United States, leaving a human resource shortage which is difficult to fill. The ill and the displaced will still come to the Ma e Tao Clinic in Mae Sot, a town on the Thai-Burma border. The working poor, the ab used and the violated Burmese will still come to Thailand seeking security. My hope is that this study will contribute to their well-being. Burmese forced migrants in the Mae Sot Immigrat ion Centre waiting to be repatriated to Burma - Painted by Maung Maung Tin xxv 1Chapter 1 Refugees, rights and reproductive health The right to health does not mean the right to be healthy, nor does it mean that poor governments must put in place expensive health services for which they have no resources. But is does require governmen t and public authorities to put in place polices and action plans which will lead to available and accessible health care for all in the shortest possible ti me. To ensure that this happe ns is the challenge facing both the human rights community and public health professionals. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson (World Health Organization, 2002:9) This thesis describes unsafe abortion and fert ility management in th e context of forced migration at the Thai-Burma border in Ta k province, Thailand (See maps 1 & 2). I explore the provision and quality of reproduc tive health services for Burmese women who are forced to migrate across a nationa l border, either to escape human rights abuses or to find employment. During migration women manage their fertility, privileging production over reproduction. In this area many Burmese women experience mistimed and unwanted pregnancie s. Laws enabling the termination of pregnancy are highly restrictiv e in Thailand and very few Burmese women are able to access a safe elective abortion through the Th ai legal and health system. But women enter Thailand with a culture of abortion already intact and Burmese women regulate their fertility by methods outside of biomed icine, including indu ced abortion. Very few fertile women use modern methods of contraception. Poverty, conflict, displacement, social unde r-development, and political and religious oppression contribute to poor reproductive health outco mes in Burma as motivating migration to Thailand. 2 Figure 1 Map of Burma and Thailand Figure 2 Detail of Mae Sot and border 3Study objectives The objectives of the thesis are: \u0083 to describe the issue of fertility, un wanted pregnancy and pregnancy loss for Burmese women living in Thailand outsi de of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees system of camps; \u0083 to quantify the number of admissions and women presenting to Burmese and Thai public health services for post abortion problems; \u0083 to identify demographic, bio-medical a nd socially relevant information in women with any type of pregnancy loss; \u0083 to document the methods which Burmese women use to regulate fertility; \u0083 to analyse the causes and preventi on of unsafe abortion practices; \u0083 to analyse fertility outcomes in relati on to the socio-political situation in Thailand and between Burma and Thailand a nd particularly forced migrations; \u0083 to consider the link between fertility outcomes and reproductive health rights. This chapter presents a review of the pertin ent literature and in the following chapter, I describe the political and social geogra phy of Tak province. The quantitative and qualitative methods used to research the t opic are discussed in chapter 3. Chapter 4 outlines the status of Burmese women's re productive health and services around Mae Sot town, such as the Mae Sot General Hospit al and the Mae Tao C linic. It includes a discussion of some research findings on Burmese women's reproductive health in Thailand. In chapter 5, I examine the biom edical and social characteristics of Burmese women who present with post-abort ion complications to Thai and Burmese- led health facilities. Local definitions of abor tion, the ethno-understandings of menstruation and foetal development are delineated in chapter 6. In chapter 7, I describe the methods of inducing an a bortion which include a combination of traditional and modern approaches. The methods of abortion are unsafe but not ineffective. Herbal mixtures, pummelli ng manoeuvres and the insertion of objects into the genital organs , often have the desired effect of terminating a pregnancy. In chapter 8, I discuss the role of lay midwives (traditional birth attendants) who provide reproductive health care to Burmese women in Thailand, including local methods of family planning, massages, delivery attendanc e and post-natal care. Some also offer abortion services but limited post-abortion care. The reasons for termination of 4pregnancy are given in chapter 9 which include; poverty, gender-b ased violence and the local illness of 'weakness', as well as low levels of sexual health knowledge and access to modern contraceptive technology. As men's role in abortion is frequently absent from research, I include male part ners' viewpoints and statements, and focus on men's role in fertility management in chapter 10. Informally trained refugee Burmese health workers' views and practic es on the care of women experiencing unwanted pregnancy and abortion are contrasted with those of formally trained Thai health workers. I argue that the socio-political context in which women must make reproductive choices increases women's risk of unsafe a bortion. Burmese forced migrants live in daily fear and situations of insecurity and violence while in Thailand. Their human rights are exploited with impunity. The la ck of rights to work, fair working conditions, low levels of health informati on and education, restricted movement, and the ability to safely control fertility a ll contribute to unsafe abortion decisions and practices. At the state le vel, economic advancement supersedes international obligations to the United Nations. Furthe rmore, I argue that informally trained refugee health workers often provide better quality care than formally trained health workers. Given that globally there are va st numbers of refug ees and marginalised populations in chronic situations of disp lacement who have limited access to health resources, the training and support of local health initiatives is an approach that requires more attention. Most authors writing about Burma generally explain their stance on the name of the country. My preference is 'Burma' over the 'Union of Myanmar' simply because my exiled informants all referred to their c ountry of birth as Burma when we spoke English together. I only use the name Un ion of Myanmar when quoting other authors or official sources such as the United Nations. 1 1 Hazel Lang's explanation for her choice notes the history of name changes. In 1989 SLORC renamed Burma the Union of Myanmar (Myanmar Naing-Ngan), a transliteration from Burman. This has been interpreted as a political gesture and one that is generally not accepted by the Burmese who resist the military regime. She states that the name Burma is more widely recognised and used in Australia and the United States (Lang, 2002). 5The Mae Tao Clinic is just five kilometres inside Thailand and serves some of the health and welfare needs of the forced migr ants who do not reside in refugee camps. In 2002 I witnessed a rudimentary dilati on and curette (D&C) performed by the Burmese health workers who live in exile at the Mae Tao Clinic. A D&C is a life- saving essential component of post-abortion care for women. This is an excerpt from my field notes: Tissue and blood are scooped out of Ma Aye San's (pseudonym) womb quickly and efficiently by the health worker Mu Moe. Ma Aye San is a twenty-eight year old Burmese woman and migrant worker in Tak province, Thailand. She has an incomplete abortion. Ma Aye San's initial story is that she fell over and started bleeding a few days ago. The health workers probe her story. She sews garments for a bout 3,000 Baht (US $70) per month. She has three children, including twins, and they are in Burma with her family. Her husband of ten years is with he r in the factory in Thailand. 'Were you using family planning?' 'No.' 'Did you visit the l\u00e8 the ?' (lay midwife) 'No.' The health workers don't believe her story. She concedes visiting the lay midwife who massaged her abdomen. She is fifteen weeks (almost four months) pregnant and lies in the procedure room at the Mae Tao Clinic having a D&C. Six young female health workers gather closely around Mu Moe and the woman's vagina as she teaches them what to look for and how to hold the instruments dripping with brown iodine solution. The woman's green sarong is hi gh above her thighs. I drift up to the woman's head to try a nd balance the numbers but also to offer some aural analgesia. I may be a re searcher now but I will always be a midwife first. Ma Aye San looks into my eyes; her brown eyes wide, small pearls of sweat over her face. 'Nah!' she tells me in Burmese. I believe her. It must be painful to have a D&C with only paracetamol for pain relief. I offer my hand to hold as some substitute and she gratefully squeezes until there is no feeling left in my finger tips and they are as pale as her face. 6Mu Moe is a good teacher and she hands over her position to Paw Paw, an experienced health worker and mother herself who usually works in the jungles of Burma but has been called back to the clinic to learn more. She was shelled and chased out of her clinic, th e villagers had to hide her from the Burmese army soldiers several times last year. Paw Paw copies Mu Moe and I watch as she concentrates. She has onl y done this once before, she tells me, and not quite like this. The other health workers study her closely. The blood and tissue pieces fall neatly into the pl astic bag, the sharp curette scraping and cleaning. 'Why don't you use stronger pain relief?' I ask Mu Moe. 'Because it makes the patient very dizzy and they vomit. Sometimes Dr Cynthia uses Pentozocine.' 'Why are there so many women with abortions here?' I continue. 'They have low education, Su zanne'. Shrill Burmese popular music from the Union of Myanmar plays l oudly outside the building on someone's radio (Field notes June 2002). Pregnancy loss is rarely simple and can be life-threatening. Access to safe fertility regulation is not available to many women, especially those who live in areas of conflict and flux. What is reproductive health? Reproductive health encompasses the wellb eing and function of human reproduction, both for men and women. The most commo nly used definition came out of the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994 and is endorsed by the World Health Organization: Reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes. Reproductive health therefore implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and th e freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. (Palmer, Lush, & Zwi, 1999:1691) The focus of reproductive health is not onl y the process of reproduction, but rather human sexuality in its broadest sense. Bi ology is only one part of reproductive health, as notions of happiness and freedom are also included. Reproductive health is a sensitive and sometimes taboo t opic, interpreted widely ac ross cultures and societies 7in different ways and at varying historical moments. This widely accepted definition describes a bio-psycho-social holistic model of health and alludes to the emotional aspects of sexuality. Pleas ure and contentment are combined with elements of prevention and safety. The positive right of freedom to decide the number of children is also enshrined in this pa rticular definition. While this definition is internationally endorsed, it does not mean that the right to this type of re productive health is uncontested; in many cases it is completely flouted (Petchesky, 2003). Clearly there is a long way to go before this definition is operationalised in a meaningful way. Some of the largest numbers of deaths currently occurring gl obally, such as the 600,000 women who die each year from various types of maternal mortality, and thousands of AIDS-related deaths, bear terr ible witness to the lack of reproductive health. In particular, I explore the diffi culties in providing reproductive health services to populations forced to migrate. The area in the definition that I will focus on in this thesis includes aspects of safety and the freedom to decide the number of desired children. My specific focus is acc ess to reproductive health information, education and services, as well as the issu e of unwanted pregnancies and abortion. All the dead women - maternal mortality Maternal mortality ratios, counted by the number of deaths of women to 100,000 live births, vary across countries and regions , between rural and urban communities and privileged and marginalised women. The differences are stagge ring. Afghanistan, a country decimated through decades of conflic t, is a telling example. In 2003, Afghan women had the highest recorded rates of maternal mortality in the world: between 400 (in Kabul) to 6,500 (in Ragh) per 100,000 live births (Bartlett et al., 2002) and a lifetime risk of dying in pregnancy of 1 in 7 (United Nati ons Population Fund, Sioncke, & Donnay, 2000). When the lifetime risk of dying in pregnancy ratio is compared across countries vast inequali ties are apparent - Thailand 1:180, Burma Malaysia 1:270, Pola nd 1:2,200, 1:10. Bartlett and colleagues identify who are at risk: The large proportion of deaths due to ma ternal causes among women of reproductive age indicates that pregnancy is a consider able risk for Afghan refugee women. In addition, the effect of these women's deat hs on their families was exacerbated by the loss in most cases of the infant either thr ough stillbirth or death in early infancy. 8Most women who died of maternal causes fa ced multiple barriers to health care and their deaths were preventable (Bartlett et al., 2002:647). According to the authors, the major contri butors to the high incidence of maternal mortality were that these were often ve ry young refugee women, with low literacy, limited mobility and a lack of basic health and sanitation needs. Thus reproductive health is not a simple biol ogical or medical knowledge e quation, but one where social and political variables ha ve significance. Young a nd uneducated women with marginal status who live in poorly reso urced areas die frequently (Rauyajin & Yoddumnern-Attig, 1993). 'Ninety-nine pe rcent of maternal mortality worldwide takes place in the developing world - nearly half a million women die each year as a result of pregnancy (Sai and Nassim 1989)'(Eschen & Whittaker, 1993:105). These women die mainly in the regions of Afri ca and Asia in areas of profound poverty. These are also areas where th e largest proportion of refugees and internally displaced people are found. The major killers of pregnant women ar e haemorrhage (25%), infection (15%), complications from abortion (13%), eclam psia (12%) and obstructed labour (8%), which are all manageable with relatively simple and timely interventions (Marge Berer, 2000; United Nations Population Fund et al., 2000). The presence of a trained health worker with a woman who is giving bi rth is an effective health intervention and the low rates of maternal mortality that now exist in the resource-rich countries are due to extensive networks of primary reproductive hea lth care services and well developed referral systems (United Nations Population Fund et al., 2000). Women from highly industrialised countries like Britain, Germany, Australia, Sweden, United States of America or a middle income country such as Thailand, who have access to basic and emergency midwifery and obstetric care, rarely bleed to death for the lack of blood transfusion services or become sep tic after birth or s pontaneous abortion for lack of antibiotics. The basic obstetri c interventions are considered to be the administration of antibiotics, oxytocics and anticonvulsants, manual removal of placentae or retained products of conception, and assistance at the time of a vaginal delivery. More complex interventions include the ability to perform a caesarean section and transfuse blood. These eight f unctions will save most women's lives and will assist in the birth of a live and healthy infant. Not all of these interventions need 9be performed in a hospital or by midwives or doctors, though training in some form is usually necessary (World Health Organiza tion & Department of Reproductive Health and Research, 2000).2 The poor distribution and quality of health services, the lack of basic rights of women to access services and th e lack of complete citizenship, as well as some fundamentalist belief systems, contribute to the lack of reproductive health that leads to suffering, illness and deat h (Marg Berer udd, 1998; Power, Proctor, & Ingwesen, 2003). Safe womanhood or women's sexu al and reproductive health? In 1987, eight international organisations3 created the Safe Motherhood Initiative in order to reduce maternal mortality that occurred in resource-poor countries. They identified four priorities for action: 1) the improvement of socio-economic and political status of women, 2) appropriate family planning, 3) quality antenatal and delivery care and 4) skilled obstetric emer gency care. This was to be implemented from a rights perspective (World Health Organization, 2001). The goal was to reduce the 1990 level of maternal mortality by half in 2015 (Marg Berer & Ravindran, 1999). The focus of this initiative was women as mothers. International conventions which articulated and elaborated women's rights to life, liberty and security, the right to begin a family, the right to benefit from scie ntific discovery, and the right to live free from discrimination already existed (World Health Organizati on, 2002; World Health Organization, 2003a). In 1996, a Charter on Sexual an d Reproductive Rights was produced (International Planned Parenthood Federation, 2003). The problem was the operationalisation of these rights into hea lth care when states needed to make commitments and follow through with progra mmes, policies and resources (Petchesky, 2003). 2 The United Nations Process Indicators are a useful tool in providing minimum reproductive health standards and enabling women to gain referrals to emergency obstetric services (Dakkak & Lobis, 2003). 3 The current Safe Motherhood Initiative group now consists of the United Nations Children's Fund, United Nations Population Fund, World Health Organization, World Bank, International Planned Parenthood Federation, The Population Council, International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, International Confederation of Midwives, Safe Motherhood Network of Nepal, Regional Prevention of Maternal Mortality Programme (Africa ) and Family Care International. See website http://www.safemotherhood.org/index.html [accessed January 2005] 10This initiative prompted various organi sations to actively engage in improving fertility and pregnancy related health, w ith mixed results (Marg Berer & Motherhood Initiativ e is particularly ineffective where women are persecuted by the very state which is supposed to provide a commitment to Safe Motherhood objectives. Safe Motherhood is elusive for internally displaced women, women outside their country, or women who are stateless (Women's Commissi on for Refugee Women and Children, 2000a). Some parliaments and community leaders do not prio ritise or necessarily value the right of women to survive and thrive in pregnanc y, especially if they choose not to be pregnant (Sen & Snow, 1994). And the mo st perplexing component, if women do not want to be mothers, how do they fi t in the Safe Motherhood Initiative? Rance (1999) articulates the contradicti ons and dilemmas embedded in the Safe Motherhood Initiative especially regardi ng contraception and abortion. She argues: Women do not need the credential of matern ity to deserve and demand safety in their sexual and reproductive lives. Neither s hould women have to accept the punishment of unsafe abortion if they opt at some mome nt - in a particular pregnancy and a given situation, determined by them individually - not to become mothers (1999:81). She suggests the use of terms such as 'wom en's health' instead of maternal health, 'women's health' instead of Safe mortality' rather than maternal mortality and 'fertile age' not reproductive age. I have sympathy with this argument, as the conflati on of women's health and maternal health obscures the core issues. Not all wome n are mothers but all have a right to reproductive health care. Ran ce is cognisant of political imperatives which ensure the most conservative terminology is used in order to achieve outcomes for women, but some 15 years after the Safe Motherhood Initia tive began, a reassessment is indicated. The semantics of 'post-abortion care' are si milar in that everything but elective safe abortion is discussed. Currently the trend is to offer post-abortion care training and counselling, with improved technical mana gement, to health workers and managers (World Health Organization & Department of Reproductive Health and Research, 2000). The promotional/ educational package titled Reproductive Healthcare in Refugee Settings produced by Marie Stopes In ternational on behalf of the 11Reproductive Health for Refugees Consortium4 (circa 2002) is worth examining. The glossy product consists of seven topic shee ts containing facts, phot os, further readings and case studies; it is polished and obviously aims for wide acceptability. There is no sheet titled 'Abortion' and the sheet coveri ng the topic 'Family planning in refugee settings' does not mention abortion as a me thod of family planning. The sheet 'Safe Motherhood in refugee settings' does not s uggest that 'Safe Abor tion' is an option instead of Safe Motherhood.5 There is one paragraph on the topic of uns afe abortion mentioned on the sheet titled 'Emergency obstetrics in refugee settings'. The positioning of post-abortion care as a basic emergency obstetric treatment, as if it were separate and different fr om abortion, is revealing. Th e distancing is not simply semantics but political caution. In countries where elective abortion is not possible, or legally highly restricted, women must induce their own abortion, usually at considerable risk, wait until it is inevitable that the pregnancy will not continue, and then present to their health care provider for 'post-abortion care'. Post-abortion care Post-abortion care (PAC) refers to the clini cal management of early pregnancy loss, both for spontaneous and induced abortions. It has been defined as an approach to reduce morbidity and mortality from any type of abortion and has the goal to improve women's sexual and reproductive health (Bra mbila, 2004). It is considered emergency care which can save lives, increase the us e of family planning and prevent repeat abortions (Brambila, 2004). Greenslade's comprehensive model of quality post- abortion care includes abortion complication treatment, post-abortion family planning and links to reproductive health care (P opulation Council, 1998). Post-abortion care includes the diagnosis of pr egnancy, the treatment of excessive blood loss, the stabilisation of the patient so as to mi nimise clinical shock, the prevention or treatment of infection, the removal of the contents of the uterus, and treatment of concomitant problems. Pain management and fertility information are core aspects of 4 This Consortium is influential in forming a reproductive health agenda and discourse in the humanitarian and medical relief sector. The Consortium consists of CARE, the International Committee of the Red Cross, John Snow Research and Training, Marie Stopes International and The Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children. See website: http://www.rhrc.org/ 5 The authors do mention post coital contraception on request. 12 Post-abortion family planning Treatment of post-abortion complications Links to reproductive health care Information and counselling Equipment, supplies, and medications Appropriate technologies for the treatment of Technical performance Interactions between women and providers Women's access to servicespost-abortion care but are often the least attended to; both are important to women who wish to space or limit their children as well as those who desperately want the next child soon (Stubblefield, 1989; World Health Organization, 2000). More recent models include men in post-abortion care for women (Huntington & Piet-Pelon, 1999; Population Council, 1998) and social a nd community factors (IPAS, 2002). Figure 3 Greenslade's model of quality post-a bortion care Source: Adapted from Advances and Challenges in Postabortion Care Operations Research (Population Council, 1998:4) As well as encompassing a discrete set of medical actions in re lation to a biological event, post-abortion care has come to signify a term which can enable the discussion of the reproductive health needs of wome n and could function as a tool to begin discussions that are inclusive of abortion. The right to electiv e abortion or quality care during any type of pregnancy loss is rarely demanded in in ternational health discourse (Bhimiprabhas, 2001; Lehmann, 2002 ); when it is, it remains controversial and contested (Schreck, 2000). Schreck reports an example of this during discussions concerning pregnancy loss requiring medical care in internationa l emergency health situations. Dr Daniel Pierot ti, a senior advisor to the United Nations Population Fund, 13felt the need to challenge some prevaili ng assumptions that women did not deserve medical attention if they were experien cing a pregnancy loss: 'We speak of the complications of abortion as an emergency in medical practice. When a woman is bleeding to death or is infected, you can not say you have had an abortion and therefore we will not treat you. It's an em ergency and you treat' (Schreck, 2000:165). Failure to treat severely ill women displa ys an underlying callousness and disregard towards them, as well as the assumption that women who present with 'self-inflicted' illness do not deserve treatment. Self-induced abortion, attempted suicide, chronic pain conditions, drug addiction, HIV and some mental illnesses come into this murky category for health workers and policy makers. The patient is held responsible for their ill-health or is perceived to not want to get we ll, or framed as non-compliant and therefore blamed and stigmatised. Care may be withdrawn or be inadequate (Kleinman, 1995). The right to health care a nd treatment is not universally accepted. Unwanted pregnancy and abortion The right to abortion is one of the most sensitive and controversial aspects of reproductive health. Motherhood is not always desired an d women often resort to solving the problem by themselves despite cultural taboos, religious imperatives and legal sanctions. Unsafe, illegal and unhygienic abortions are major killers of large numbers of women. The bi omedical knowledge to perform clean and effective abortions has existed for decades but access to elective, safe abortion is unavailable to many women (Kabir, 1989; Look & Cottingham , 2002). In the following section, I examine some of the research on unwanted pregnancy and abortion. The scale of abortion A number of authors have attempted to quantify how many abortions occur globally and to describe the emerging trends (B ankole, Singh, & Haas, 1999; Henshaw, Singh, & Haas, 1999 a, 1999 b; Zilder et al., 2003). Given the magnitude and the nature of the issue, this work is worth recordi ng despite the methodological difficulties of obtaining reliable data. After collecting formal and informal data from 67 countries, Henshaw and colleagues (Henshaw et al., 1999 a) estimated there were a total of 46 million abortions in 1995, of which 20 millio n were illegal. The average global abortion rate was 35 per 1,000 adult women. Ea stern Europe had the highest rate (90 14per 1,000) and Western Europe the lowest rate (11 per 1,000). Neither Burma nor Thailand are recorded countries in these studies.6 Abortion rates are not lower where the law is restricted and most countries have moderate rates of abortion. Both devel oping and developed countries can have low abortion rates. For example, Tunisia ha s a good family planning programme and legalised abortion while having low levels of abortion: Where abortions are clandestine and unsaf e, the consequences for women's health and survival are damaging, especially for poor, rural, less-educated and young women, and the impact on countries' health care systems also cannot be ignored. In many countries of Latin America, Sub- Saharan Africa and Asia, current trends toward small family preferences and rising premarital sexual activity may continue to increase women's and couples' need for ab ortion, as they seek to avoid unwanted births but continue to face barriers to e ffective contraceptive use (Henshaw et al., 1999 a:S36). Illegal abortion has ramifications for indi vidual women and also for health care systems. In countries with underdevelope d health sectors, the influx of abortion related morbidity into acute gynaecolo gical and obstetric services can be overwhelming (Coeytaux, Leonard, & Bloomer, 1993). The global trends include a desire for sm aller families, increasing use of modern methods of contraception, more liberal a bortion laws and in some countries, an increase in the rates of abortion (Feyiset an & Casterline, 2000; Westoff & Bankole, 2000; al., 2003). Rahman, Katz ive and Henshaw (1998:56) reviewed laws related to abortion in 152 countries during 1985 to 1997, and found that, '61% of the world's people live in countries where indu ced abortion is permitted either for a wide range of reasons or without re striction as to reason; in co ntrast, 25% resided in nations where abortion is generally prohibited. ' Since 1985, nineteen countries had liberalised abortion laws. Henshaw et al . (1999 b) also note a trend of increasing abortion rates prior to func tional family planning programmes, but the incidence of abortion drops once these are established. 6 The countries with the lowest ra tes (7 per 1,000 women) were Belgium and Netherlands, the highest (83 per 1,000 women) was Vietnam. 15In some countries illegal abortion may be very safe. In India, for example, where the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act 1972 is very specific concerning who may perform an abortion procedure and the licensi ng of 2002). Ramachandar (2003) notes that many qualified medical practitioners fail to register their clinics according to Indian law, but provide high quality services with few complications. Conversely while a law may be liberal, women may not have easy access to abortion services. Caveats concerning mandatory counselling, waiting periods, third-party au thorisations, excessive fees, lack of acceptable facilities or poor policy formul ation and implementation can effectively block access to abortion (Kabir, 1989; Ladipo, 1989). Illegal and unsafe abortion Abortion numbers are always estimates, esp ecially as many are performed by illegal means or by private practitioners who do not appreciate scru tiny (Ahman & Shah, 2002). There are approximately 19 million unsafe abortions annually, some 2,700,000 taking place in SE Asia (Ahman & Shah, 2002). An estimated 60,000 to 70,000 women die annually from complicated abortions and hundr eds of thousands suffer chronic morbidity such as reduced fert ility, infertility and pelvic pain after poor quality care (Look & Cottingham, 2002). The following table shows the risk of dying after unsafe abortion and the percentage of deaths due to unsafe abortions by region. Table 1 Unsafe abortion - regional estimates of maternal mortality Unsafe Abortion : Regional estimates of maternal mortality Risk of dying after unsafe abortion % of maternal deaths due to unsafe abortion Africa 1 in 150 13% Asia 1 in 250 12% Latin America 1 in 900 21% Europe 1 in 17% Source: restri ctive laws or inaccessible abortion services, highlight the morbidity as sociated with unsafe abortions and the frequent cases of septic incomplete abor tions (Singh, Wulf, & J ones, 1997). Ladipo (Ladipo, 1989) outlines the common picture of haemorrhage, injuries to the genital organs, toxicity from abortifacients, shock, liver-renal failure and coma that deplete poor hospitals of scarce resources in the process of treating them. Kabir (1989) suggests improving family planning servi ces, providing safe abortion services, appointing women to positions of power, allocating resources and mobilising women to advocate for their reproductive health ne eds may all improve the situation of Asian women. Abortion in Asia There is a wide diversity across the Asian re gion which makes the categorisation of an 'Asian approach' to abortion impossible. A bortion is legalised in various ways across the region, the most liberal countries being Vietnam and Singapore, and this is reflected in the lower maternal morta lity ratio in Vietnam of 105 per 100,000, in contrast to the regional av erage of 330 per 100,000 (See figure 4). The law is most restrictive in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Burm a and Laos, and it is thought that these countries experience the most unsafe abortio ns (Singh et al., 1997). Religion does not offer a category by which we can standardise people's approach to abortion. While most of the major religions in the region including Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Confucianism express core values concer ning the sanctity of life, abortion is interpreted in different ways. Some countri es are more secular or have a variety of forms of democracy which do not elevate religious dogma into law. Despite both having a majority of Muslims, Bangladesh an d Malaysia take diffe rent approaches to the issue of abortion: Bangladesh has an early abortion policy centred on 'menstrual regulation' and a vigorous family pl anning programme; Malaysia has highly restrictive abortion laws. India, a de mocratic, secular and largely Hindu nation, legalised abortion in the 1970s; whereas Ne pal only stopped putting women in prison on abortion-related crime in 2002 (de Bruyn, 2002; AK Tamang, Shrestha, & Sharma, 1999). Thailand and Burma exemplify these paradoxes. Figure 4 Status of reproductive health policy in SE Asia Sources: (CIA 2003 a b; Henshaw, 1999 a; Henshaw, 1999 b; Singh, 1997) Abortion in Burma and Thailand There are several studies of abortion in Burmese women and I will discuss them in detail in chapter 4. My aim here is to describe the situ ations in Burma and Thailand as background information for my later analysis of the situation for Burmese women living in a specific lo cation in Thailand. There is a vast difference between the quant ity and quality of data available for the two countries. Burma has been a closed so ciety for decades and is now experiencing severe censorship (Fink, 2001). In ad dition, Burma's social and economic development has remained static if not reta rded, and this is most evident by the lack of academic, artistic or journalistic expressi on that filters out of the country in any language. Most of the reliable literature on reproductive health in Burma is produced with the cooperation of the Union of My anmar Government and international bodies such as UNFPA, UNDP and UNICEF. Very few non-government or ganisations have been able to negotiate entry into Burma. 7 There is debate in development and governance literature regarding the effectiv eness of NGOs under the military regime's authoritarian control (Burma Center Netherlands and Transnational Institute, 1999; Rotberg, 1998; Steinberg, 1999). It is disa ppointing, but telling, to search web-based and library-based literature to notice that time and time again there is no record for either Burma or Myanmar. 8 Thailand, by contrast, has robust and critical journalism, functioning tertiary level hospitals and academ ics with tenure that have the freedom to express their opinions. Thailand and Burma - (dis)similar neighbours Thailand is a constitutional monarchy which was never colonised. The last military regime ended in 1992 and since then the country has been generally peaceful and 7 NGOs include various religious groups and organisations such as Medicins Sans Frontiere (Holland), Medicins du Monde, World Vision, World Concern, Marie Stopes, Population Services International, International Committee of the Red Cross, CARE (Australia), Adventist Development and Relief Agency - see www.burmafund.org [June 2003] 8 There are several accounts of personal resistance to the authoritarian, and at times brutal suppression of political, religious or ethnic expression, where people could only record their experiences when safely in exile (Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma), 2001; Aye Saung, 1989; Elliot, 1999; Pascal Khoo Thwe, 2002). Universities in Burma are an anomaly, perceived by authorities as sites of unrest and dissent, rarely open, and usually only see students at examination times (Fink, 2001). Not surprisingly they produ ce little that is available for scrutiny by academics. 19politically stable (Wyatt, 2004).9 The vast majority of the 61 million Thai people are ethnically Thai, some identify as ethnically Chinese or Malay, and there are many different types of hilltribe people. The ma jority of Thai are Buddhist with a small minority practising Islam, Christianity and Animism. Thailand has experienced sustained growth and economic developm ent and is classified as a newly industrialised nation, 10 ranked 76 on the Human Devel opment Indicator by the UNDP (Alonso, 2003). Thailand earns income mainly from industry and services sectors. Burma was colonised by the British and gained independence in January 1948. Burma is ruled by a military regime that de clined to accept the outcome of a vote for the democratically elected and very popular National League for Democracy led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in 1988. There has b een conflict and rebellion within the country for decades (Smith, 1999). The majo rity of 48 million Burmese are ethnically Burman (68%) and there are over one hundred different minority ethnic groups, the two largest being Shan (9%) and Karen (7%). Most Burmese people follow Buddhism with minority followings of Islam, Christianity and Animism. Burma was given least developed nation status in 1987 and remains in the bottom percentile of developing nations. A quart er of all Burmese people liv e in poverty with Burmese earning on average US$258 (GDP per capita per annum) compared to the Thai US$2,440. Burma relies heavily on the agri cultural sector. Table number 2 of demographic and social and political i ndicators collated from various sources summarises some of the differen ces between the two neighbours. There are significant differences in years of longevity and population growth rates. The under-five death rate in Burma is a strong indicator of an inadequate health sector and conditions of poverty. The total fertility rate of Burma is almost double that of Thailand and 78% of women in Burma are literate compared to 92% of Thai women. Burmese women are more likely to birth at home with a lay midwife and have an increased risk of death or their baby dying than Thai women (Table 3). The figures 9 There is a history of tension along the southern bo rder with Malaysia and r ecent accounts of the death by suffocation of 78 young Muslim men in Narathiwat Province after clashes with the military in October 2004 (Anonymous, 2004b). 10 The economic crisis that affected most of SE As ia during 1997 increased poverty and resulted in a drop in health indicators in Thailand in the following years (Viroj Tangcharoensathien, Piya Harnvoravongchai, Pitayarangsarit, & Kasemsup, 2000). 20become very sketchy for internally di splaced women or women living in the peripheral states of Burma. For displ aced Burmese women or those who live in remote areas, the estimated maternal mo rtality increases to 580/ 100,000 (Lanjouw, 2001) which reflects in part their lack of access to health services and their marginality in relation to the Myanmar state.

Complicated abortion is one of the ten health risks identified by the Union of Myanmar Department of Health (Chandler, 1998). Table 3 shows that 28 per cent of fertile-age women in Burma use a modern method of contraception, in cont rast to Thailand, where 72 percent of potentially fertile women use modern me thods of contraception. The Myanmar Department of Health ranks abortion in its top ten health problems for the country and the third main cause of illness. Thein Thein Htay and colleagues (2003) estimate maternal mortality in the region of 255/ 100,000 and Ba Thike (1997) some years earlier suggested that at least half of th e pregnancy related deat hs were related to abortion. In addition, Ba Thike record ed the complications from abortion as comprising twenty percent of all hospital admi ssions. In Burma it is only possible to obtain a legal abortion if the woman's life is in danger (Ba-Thike, 1997); it is slightly less restrictive in Thailand, where induced abortion is sanctioned to save a woman's life or in cases of proven rape or incest (Whittaker, 2002c). While Thailand has superior health outcomes and the public health system spreads widely over the country, there are inequities in health resources across Thailand and a higher utilisation of health services by wealthier Thai (Ministry of Public Health, Bureau of Policy and Strategy, & Suwit Wi bulpolprasert, 2002). The authors of the Thailand Health Profile 1999-2000 report (Ministry of P ublic Health, 2002) note a widening in the urban/ rural in fant mortality rate by almost two in rural areas. In addition, health inefficiencies exist and th ere is an over-reliance on modern medicines rather than preventative health m easures. In 2002, the Thaksin government introduced a popular universal health insura nce scheme which has the potential to reduce health inequalities. The Ministry of Public Health believes that this scheme, the '30 Baht insurance' policy will provide 'an invaluable chance to develop efficient and fair health financing by stressing on th e universal health in surance coverage.' (Ministry of Public Health et al., 2002:351). 22Table 3 Women's health indicators Indicator Burma Internally Displaced Population surveyed Thailand Research site in Thailand Estimated population 200,000 Maternal mortality ratio (per 100,000 live births) 100 -170 1,300 44 211 Infant mortality (per 1,000 live births) 92 148 25 Unknown Birth rate (per 1,000 population) 26 Unknown 20 26 Abortion ratio (per 1,000 live births 49 Unknown 125 310 Modern contraceptive prevalence rate% 28 Unknown 72 Unknown Women receiving antenatal care % 76 Unknown 83 55% Women delivering with skilled birth helper (%) 47 87 with a tba 85 65 with a tba Access to clean drinking water (%) 44 -50 Unknown 93 Unknown Source: (Ba-Thike, 1997; Backpack Health Worker Surveys 2001 & 2002; Mae Sot General Hospital 2001 & 2002; Maung, 2001, 2002a; UNFPA, 2003) Muecke (1984) outlines the changing nature of status indicators for Thai women. She notes that traditionally motherhood was one way to raise personal status but this has changed and women desire education, employm ent, to be able to contribute through leadership to society. Modern methods of contraception and smaller families have been positively embraced in Thailand; women's autonomy and not only socio- economic development is the major contribu tor to rapid change in birth control practices and desired family size over a relatively shor t period of & Nibhon Debavalya, 1987). Human rights and global processes There has been an evolution from basic n eeds to rights in repr oductive health. The language and assumptions of human righ ts are contested by many and actively disputed by others (Cook, 1994; Petches ky & Judd, 1998) and are embedded in the social matrix and moments of history. Th e original notion of human rights was not 23inclusive of the experience of women. Ev en if we ignore the dated sexist language11 found in the Universal Declar ation of Human Rights (1948) and look to substantive content, there exists a bias toward the rational, individual man operating in the public sphere; women's lives are invisible (C harlesworth, 1999; R. J. Cook, 1994). Similarly the Refugee Convention (1951) is a product of its time. It arose out of the devastation of Europe after World War II, and was written during the Cold War, at a time which privileged men from regimes who were resistant to communism, often intellectual or political di ssidents seeking asylum (Chimni, 1998; Loescher, 1993). Thailand joined the League of Nations/U nited Nations in 1946 and Burma in 1948. The subsequent protocols and additional documents have broadened definitions and substance, but some lawyers and academics s till point to the lack of legal protection for women and suggest complicity in the abuse of women (R. J. Cook, 1994; Knight, 2003; Macklin, 1995). Reproductive health rights have emerged in recent decades as the conventions and treaties that embody human rights continued to evolve. In th e context of this study on Burmese women who are forced to migrat e to Thailand to find work, and who experience the dilemma of an unwanted pregnancy, the following International Conventions and consensus documents are re levant (R. J. Cook & Fathalla, 1996; de Bruyn, 2002) and the following table summarises each country's relationship with the most important international conventions. Table 4 International conventions ratified by Thailand and Burma International Convention Accession Thailand Accession Burma Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1951) X X Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1976) ; 1999 X Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1976) ; 1997 X Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (1981) ; 1985 ; 1997 Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) ; 1992 ; 1991 Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (1965) ; 2003 X Convention of the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Member s of their Families (2003) X X 11 Article 1: 'All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood .' (My italics) (United Nations, 1948) [Electronic version] 24 Source: (United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 2004) Some of these conventions were further refined and endorsed at the Programme of Action of the International C onference of Population and Development in Cairo (1995) and the Declaration and Platform for Ac tion of the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing (1996).12 Each of these international instruments ar ticulates a growing legal system of the inalienable, indivisible right s of human beings in all s pheres of human activity. They include women, specifically their reproduc tive and productive capacities. They include the right to life and su rvival (of children and adults), the right to liberty and security, the right to the hi ghest standard of health, th e right to the benefits of scientific progress, the ri ght to receive and impart information, and the right to education (World Health Organization, 2002). Other social rights include the right to marry and found a family, the right to deci de the number and spacing of children, the right to a family life, non- discrimination on the grounds of sex, and age and the right to be free from inhuman and degradi ng treatment. Once a state has ratified a convention it is then legally obliged to respect th e rights explicated in the convention, protect those rights by taking appropriate action, and fulfil the obligations in a real way by providing resources. Additionally count ries are required to report progress to committees situated within the United Nati ons. However, human rights law is rarely invoked in matters of reproductive health care. Cook and Fathalla (R. J. Cook & Fathalla, 1996) make the point that governme nts are rarely held responsible for the lack of care given to women. The human itarian legal regime is based on the assumption that the threat of legal action or an ela borate public shaming would prompt better care of women. In states which are not signatori es to humanitarian instruments, any action is se verely limited and the reach of customary international law, often called 'soft law', is as impotent as it sounds. 12 Even the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement , (United Nations & OCHA, no date) endorsed by the late Sergio Vieira de Mello, calls for sp ecial attention to the needs of women and their reproductive health care - Principle 19, Subsection 2. 25Burma and Thailand are signatories to very few international humanitarian treaties. Neither are signatories to the Refugee C onvention (1951) or the Convention of the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Wo rkers and Members of the Families (2003). Both signed the Geneva Convention, Thaila nd in 1954 and the Union of Myanmar in 1992, and both countries have signed and ra tified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Wo men (1979) (hereafter CEDAW). Thailand signed in 1985 and the Union of Myanmar in 1997. CEDAW makes references to the removal of discrimination against women in governance, education, employment and social life, and explicitly refers to family planning, maternity car e (Article 12) and the ability to decide the number of childre n a woman will bear (Article 16). (See Appendix A) Country reports to the United Nations The Union of Myanmar offered its first CEDAW report to the committee in the United Nations in 1999. The report stated th at men and women had pure equality and freedoms in education, employment, law and politics despite ethnic ity and location. The Union of Myanmar reported: ...there exists no legal and social barriers which may operate to prevent or discourage women from making full use of available health care services. Myanmar women have access to health care services equal to that of men. Health care is provided to all citizens in Myanmar without any discrimination (Union of Myanmar, 1999:17). But on the next page on the matter of maternal mortality the report stated: The causes of maternal mortality according to a 18 hospital study in Myanmar in 1989/90 are abortion, sepsis, haemorrhage, hypertensive diseases of pregnancy and obstetric trauma (obstructe d labour and uterine rupture). Hospital studies have shown that abortion is a major cause of mate rnal death. The abortion delivery ratio is at 1:3 in the major teaching hospitals (Union of Myanmar, 1999: 18). While it is not possible to directly comp are men's and women's reproductive health outcomes, and the Union of Myanmar offere d no numbers of how many women in the country were incapacitated with post-aborti on complications, the admission that one third of pregnancy outcomes in hospital are due to a complex pregnancy loss is indicative of low reproductive h ealth and well-being for women. 26The official Union of Myanmar CEDAW report is contested by a shadow report (Women's Organizations from Burma & NCGUB, 2000). The picture of Burmese health education, information and services contradicts the official statement and rebuffs the national regime's claims of equality for women (Belak, 2002). Health professionals and researchers who collect da ta inside Burma interpret Burma's health system as inadequate and under-funded, with hi gh levels of maternal mortality, infant death, malnutrition, and HIV transmission: women and girls are systematically 2002, 2003). Clearly some gi rls and women do not have their basic needs met in the current health system or their rights in law respected. This raises the question of the usefulness of human rights conventions: are they really relevant in cultures that do not aspire to Western in dividualism? Petchesky's (Petchesky & Judd, 1998) internat ional research group found th at in some cases, there was no direct translation of certain words or agreement on concepts, but the group did agree that women actively negotiated their ent itlement as they perceived it. Petchesky and Judd (1998:13) define entitleme nt in the following way: Sense of entitlement goes beyond the concep t of 'needs' insofar as it entails a conviction of the moral rightness of one's claim, without perhaps the formal public or legal acknowledgement that 'rights' imply. It thus denotes the space in between a felt sense of need and an articulation of right. 'Entitlement' in this understanding is meant to signify those actions of speech, metaphor, or even unspoken behaviour that represent both 1) an aspiration to change one's own or one's children's situation, a hope for a better life; and 2) a sense of authority to effect these changes through one's own words or actions. As Petchesky and Judd readily admit, wome n often have very little access to human rights discourse but are able to articulate a sense of natural justice. The populace of Thailand and Burma have embraced democratic ideals based on Western assumptions and models of power relations in different ways. The Thai outlawed slavery in Siam during the rei gn of Chulalongkorn (R ama V 1868-1910). In 1932 absolute monarchy was dismantled. People rebelled against thei r military rulers during the 1970s and 1980s, the last time being 1992. They have incrementally moved toward the democratic constitutio nal monarchy now known as the Royal Thai Kingdom (Wyatt, 2004). The Thai people enjo y freedoms and equality that could be 27seen to be 'Western' in style. While not as successful, the Burmese people voted overwhelmingly for a change in their rulers on the 27th May 1990. Eighty percent of the population voted for the National League for Democracy led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and while many may not have had a sophisticated understanding of the mechanisms of democracy or lofty aspirations to human rights, they participated in a democratic process (Aung San Suu Kyi, 1991, 1997). Human rights and democracy are not dreams, as Daw Suu eloquently explains: There is nothing new in Third World governments seeking to justify and perpetuate authoritarian rule by denouncing liberal democratic principles as alien. By implication they claim for themselves the offi cial and sole right to decide what does or does not conform to indigenous cultural norms...As soon as the movement for democracy spread out across Burma there wa s a surge of intense interest in the meaning of the word 'democracy', in its hi story and its practical implications. More than a quarter-century of narrow authorita rianism under which they had been fed a pabulum of shallow, negative dogma had not blunted the perceptiveness of political alertness of the Burmese (Aung San Suu Kyi, 1991: 167-8). She goes on to clarify that the concepts of the will of the people and the social contract of citizenship are contained w ithin the Indic concept of kingship in Mahasammata and Buddhist theology: they are not entirely alien concepts solely conceived by Western ideologues. 13 Refugees and other displaced people The United Nations High Commissioner fo r Refugees (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 2002) records a figure of 20 milli on people under their mandate; the largest proportion of refugees are in Asia (6 million). From 1997 to 2001 the refugee population fell by 24%. Th e less developed countries carry the burden of refugee protection as they are both a major source and destination of refugees and seven out of ten refugees ar e hosted by low-income countries. Women constitute half of the tota l population of concern to UNHCR and half the population is aged between 18 and 59 years. Only 40% of the population of concern live in camps and half of this particular population is female. 13 Moreover, the customary rules of law with regard to the human rights of non-combatants and combatants were written in the Art of War by Sun Tzu, an ancient Chinese philosopher and strategist who wrote that the aim of war was to capture armies ra ther than kill them and take countries rather than destroy them. These were, Sun Tzu suggested, the pr actical and humanitarian aims of the craft of warfare (Phillips & Lane, 1943). 28The legal definition of a refugee from th e Refugee Convention 1951 (Article 1A [2]) is a person who, 'owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a partic ular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such a fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country' (United Nations, 1951). Other definitions exist however and Shac knove (1985) presents a broad concept of refugee which is both moral and empirical and argues that notions of persecution and alienation are not enough. His pragmatic c oncept of refugeehood is rather different: 'in essence, persons whose basic needs are unprotected by their country of origin, who have no remaining recourse other than to seek international restitution of their needs, and who are so situated that internat ional assistance is possible' (Shacknove, 1985:277). Displaced people are categorised and counted according to location and the cause of movement. Internally displaced people are one group who are particularly vulnerable. Those who remain within the nation-state borders are the fastest growing group and are often out of reach of international law and humanitarian programmes due to issues of sovereignty (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 2004). An estimated 25 million people worldwide are internally displaced for a variety of reasons (Internally Displaced People Projec t, 2003). Harris, Jones and Quick (1998) record that two million people currently liv e as refugees outside of Burma; the minority live inside refugee camps. Harris and colleagues have included other forced migrants, and not just those admitted to camps, such as those who migrate to find work due to the meagre economic conditions within Burma. Castles (Castles, 2003) suggests categories such as re fugee and migrant worker are useful bureaucratic tools but do not reflect the mixed nature of flight from conflict and failed states, and (Toole, 2001) agrees that definitions for refugees ar e outdated, a point I elaborate in the next chapter. Reproductive Health for Refugees Only in very recent history have the re productive health need s of people who are forced to migrate been considered or seen as valid (K. Burns, Male, & Pierotti, 2000; Girard & Waldman, 2000; McGinn, 2000; Palm er et al., 1999) and many international relief organisations still find it problematic to offer reproductive health services to 29refugees even when the refugee group speci fically requests these types of services, although this situation is improving (G uy, 1999; United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 2004). Emergency relief aid ha s offered food, secur ity, and shelter and focused on sanitation and commun icable diseases as health priorities. These are all vital services, proven to be effective (Spiegel, Sheik, Gotway-Crawford, & Salama, 2002). However, reproductive health is also a basic need, a preventative health strategy and a right. The United Nations declared 1976 to 1985 a decade for women and in 1989 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refuge es appointed a coordinator for refugee women. A year later in 1990 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees adopted a 'Policy for Refugee Women' (Sch reck 2000). It is Sc hreck's contention that in the early 1990s, the wars in Yugos lavia and Rwanda led to an increased awareness of women's issues during times of conflict. For example, Bosnian women were accustomed to using contraceptives and e xpected that health se rvice to continue. Furthermore, public awareness of the horri fic scale of the rape camp atrocities prompted a humanitarian reproductive health response and later a call for rape to be included within the definitions of war crimes. In 1994, the 'Refugee Women and Reproductive Health Care: Reassessing Priorities' report (Schreck, 2000) was published and the core components of reproductive health were defined as safe motherhood; family planning; STDs, including HIV and AIDS; sexual and gender-based violence; and abortio n services. In the same year at the International Conference on Populati on and Development, UNFPA, UNHCR and WHO pledged to work together on reproduc tive health issues and the Reproductive Health for Refugees Consortium was form ed. Also in 1994 at the International Conference on Population and Development, there was a shift aw ay from population issues to a more general reproductive health agenda and this occurr ed in parallel with the recognition of women's needs in situa tions of conflict (Palmer et al., 1999). Busza and Lush's (1999) 'conceptual fram ework' assists with the planning of reproductive health services for refugees (See figure 5). Th eir model works on a 'before' and 'after' approach to conflict. The type of conflict th ey describe closely 30resembles the nature of violence in the peripheries of Burma and along the Thai- Burma border. Current geopolitical realities often present c onflict environments characterised by low intensity warfare, which is particularly c onducive to displacement due to its emphasis on violence directed at the civilian populations (Macrae et al., 1995). According to Zwi and Cabral (1991), the majority of contemporary developing world conflicts result in the diversion of financial and hum an resources to military activity, economic disruption, psychological stress and change to the social fabric. The factors which affect reproductive health are therefore influenced in turn by the nature of political violence (Busza & Lush, 1999:159). (Original italics) They suggest the need to assess pre-conflic t conditions and to ask about the available services and attitudes before the displacemen t. Obviously populations may have very different attitudes about contraception and fa mily size and this will influence the acceptance or not of reproductive health se rvices (Morrison, 2000) . Some areas of reproductive health are easier an d more acceptable than othe rs. For example, Safe Motherhood and HIV may find more legitim acy than contraceptive delivery and violence against women services (Palmer et al., 1999). Figure 5 Reproductive health needs in conflict, a conceptual framework Source: Reproduced from (Busza & Lush, 1999:158) 32Busza and Lush (1999) suggest that the loss of the traditional community and individual identity can cause demographic shifts as well as losses in services and infrastructure. Frequently the very ol d and the very young die during conflict. Within conflict zones, rape and sexual a ssault become prevalent due to the social disruption and the tactics of terror. As (Busza & Lush 1999:159) state, 'there is no shortage of accounts of how sexual assault is not only an external consequence of conflict but also a conscious strategy desi gned to humiliate and degrade ethnic and cultural groups within low intensity warfare' . Recent wars are defined by their long- term intra-national rather than international featur es, involving ethnic or tribal clashes, often targeting civilians and using 'low inte nsity' methods such as generalised chaos and terror tactics. Nordstrom (1998:105) desc ribes the characteristics of the war in Mozambique, which lasted for sixteen years and brutally affected half of the population: '[t]error warfare thus focuse s less on killing the physical body than on terrifying the population as a whole into, the military strategists hope, cowed acquiescence. Strategic murder, torture, community destruction, sexual abuse, and starvation become the prime weapons in the ar senal of terror warfare.' She presents case studies in resistance to this targeted terror and mentions the rape of women and girls so traumatised that they lose the abil ity to speak. Shanks , Ford, Schull and de Jong (2001) recall the 5,000 babies called enfants mauvais souvenir (children of bad memories) born to the raped Rwandan wo men who survived the 1994 genocide, some of whom were killed at birth or abandoned. In a further article documenting the health impact of violence against 150 women during war in Uganda, the authors (Isis- WICCE Research Group, 2001) note the hi gh rates of stillbirth, miscarriage (spontaneous abortion), sexually transmitted di sease, infertility, chronic pelvic pain, painful sexual intercours e and unwanted pregnancy. 14 Many wars could be described as nation-st ate projects and there has been little research into the effects on reproductive h ealth issues during or after conflict. Abuduhou draws inspiration from Yuval-Davi s and Anthias (1989) notions of women 'signifying the nation' especially in child rearing for nation building. She notes that 14 In this overly medicalised approach to war trauma, women were diagnosed with agoraphobia or an abnormal fear of public spa ces after experiencing systemic war re lated torture - this could also be interpreted as a normal and 'hea lthy' response to a real fear. 33despite women's involvement with the Pale stinian struggle in a multitude of ways, women are framed in their traditional role of reproduction, which is only privileged if they give birth to sons who are able to take up the fight. She recognises that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is often define d as one of demography and the Palestinian slogan: 'The Israelis beat us at the borders but not th e bedroom', endorses women to be patriotically hyper-fertile despite risks to their own health (Abuduhou, 2003:86).15 In times of conflict women are expected to provide soldiers and to enlarge the population in order to overwhelm other popu lations (see also Temkin in (Levy & Sidel, 1997). In Burma there is similar propaganda. 'Che rish the Motherland' (seen on a billboard in Burma 2003) posits the natio n-state of the Union of Myan mar as female and fecund. Similarly Vazquez (1997) researched 70 women's experiences of supporting the conflict in El Salvador with lasted fr om 1981 to 1992, and found that despite women providing 60 percent of the logistical suppor t services as well as being 30 percent of the combatants, their status as subordinated citizen was retained. Even as armed soldiers, women experienced rape and sexual harassment from their fellow male combatants and traditional sexual double st andards remained unchallenged despite the rhetoric of liberation. Women expe rienced war differently to men. The war situation also substantially al tered the women's sexual and childbearing experiences in ways that contradicted, in large measure, the teachings of their childhood. They grew up expecting to follo w the rule that they should have sexual relations with one partner onl y, and be faithful to each other. This expectation was severely undermined during the war, particularly among the women combatants. The inevitability of getting pregnant time and ag ain, and the continuum between sexuality and childbearing, were brought into serious question by the requirements of the armed struggle and the reality of living in a political and military underground. The continuity between bearing children and th en caring for them was also broken, and this was terribly painful for these women-mothers (Vazquez, 1997:141). Vazquez does not mention abortion and I am left wondering how many women chose not to continue with a pregnancy produced w ith a transient partner in the chaos of war, where the alternative of l eaving the child with another woman outside the combat zone was the only alternative. 15 The recorded fertility rate for Palestinian women was 7.05 (1980s) and 6.06 (1990s) (Abuduhou, 2003). 34Plate 1 Love and cherish the Motherland - propaga nda slogans in Karen State 'Love and cherish the mother land' (2002) Plate 2 Burmese woman holds her baby - notice th e leprosy in her hands. Mae Tao Clinic (2001) 35The interaction with relief agencies may also influence the reproductive health status of the refugee population. Ma ny international relief or ganisations ha ve religious ideology that precludes open discussion of sexual health issues (Busza & Lush, 1999). The workers may be indifferent or not feel adequately trained to implement reproductive health services. Moreover, l ack of cultural unde rstanding may cause barriers in accessing health services or the population (Dudley, 1999). The introduction of 'modern' bio-medical interven tions can save lives but is not without problems. 'Modern' is not always better than 'traditi onal' and the importation of bottle feeding, episiotomy, lithotomy and th e isolation and Jordan, 1983; Manderson, 1984). Gender roles al so change due to the pressures and new opportunities available to women (Vaz quez, 1997). Women may use sex to gain resources for their families and the loss of family and community can heighten risk-taking through a lack of concern for self. Busza and Lush (1999:160) note that conflict often results in a change in desired family size. 'Nationalistic fervour ma y find new support if identity politics characterise the conflict, pr ovoking a desire to rebuild and repopulate the community.' They cite the example of the refugee camps for Cambodians in Thailand and their initial sub-fertility due to malnutrition and separation of the men and women. Refugees then called for limiting or pos tponing their family size until normal conditions returned. Busza & Lush (1999:166 citing Potts 1980) caution interpretation of the enthusiastic embrace of family pl anning by Cambodian refugees, 'since there have been reports of reproductive rights a buse and the Thai government was wary of rising numbers of Cambodians within its borders'. They also record the use of illicit abortions by Cambodian women in refugee camps and the need for safe abortion services (Busza & Lush, 1999; Morrison, 2000) . McGinn (2000:179) concludes that: [the] available data suggest that refugees' status with respect to fertility, family planning and safe motherhood is largely determined by factors similar to those in settled populations. Social and demographic factors, such as age, socioeconomic status, education and urban or rural residence, as well as access to services, rather than refugee or displaced status in itself, appear to influence fertility desires and health behavior with respect to these reproductive health concerns. 36McGinn (2000) also notes that most of th e research conducted into reproductive health needs occurs with refugee populations in camps, and there is a need to work with the 'unofficial' refug ee population (Morrison, 2000). While Busza & Lush's 'conceptual framework' is useful, in some forms of conflict it may not be applicable. The Karen people fr om Burma have been fighting for over 50 years and it is difficult to imagine what the baseline health status and demographic indicators might be (Lintner, 1999, 2003). It is only possible to ask women about the conditions in their home villages and towns in Burma and how they see the differences in Thailand. In the Burmese case, there is an absence of reliable data. Another point emerging from the literature concerns the superior health of post emergency phase refugee populations in comp arison with host populations. This can cause tensions between humanitarian orga nisations, refugee representatives, host populations and their governments (Posner et al., 2002). Orach (2003) found that the health services provided to refugees in Ug anda ensured that their reproductive health outcomes were superior to the host populat ion. He found that the MMR was 2.5 times higher in the host population and the refugees received the obstetrical interventions that were lifesaving. He concludes by suggest ing that health and social services in refugee settings should promote equitable ac cess for both groups. Health indicators such as the presence of communicable diseas es, rates of infant mortality, maternal mortality and fertility are responsive to investment in basic health, education and welfare projects in establis hed refugee populations. In sum, there is an enormous number of people classified a s r e f u g e e s o r d i s p l a c e d people. There is increasing concern about the people who do not fit into such categories, who are unreachable due to nationa l borders or sovereignty issues and who would be better classified as forced migrants . Most forced migrants do not reside in refugee camps but attempt to blend into th e host population; those in camps often stay for long periods of time. Humanitari an medical assistance has focussed on communicable diseases, sani tation, food and shelter in camps but has not seen reproductive health services, apart from birthi ng as a basic need. Issues such as HIV transmission and rape are now beginning to be addressed (Carba llo & Nerukar, 2002) but abortion rarely so (Un ited Nations High Commissi oner for Refugees, 2004). 37International human rights instruments an d particularly CEDAW explicitly outline women's rights to education, employment , equality and reproductive well-being, but are often challenged by notions of romantic ised tradition and funda mental religious or nationalistic beliefs. Abortion is widely practiced around the world for a multitude of reasons in spite of legal or social sanctions . The death and disabi lity associated with substandard fertility control methods, both bi o-medical and traditional, is tragic. Reproductive desires change during migrati on, displacement and conflict but there are few theories which adequately explain how or why. When suffi cient resources and basic infrastructure are supplied, paradoxica lly refugee health can be of a higher standard than impoverished host communities. 38 Chapter 2 Borderlands - Tak Province and the people Borders are 'political membranes' encompa ssing symbolic, military, legal, cultural, and economic phenomena, and they function vari ously as places of separation and regulation, of interaction, passage, and opport unity. The opportunity provided by the Thai borderland as a sanctuary for refug ees cannot be understood separately from the various components that infuse and have an impact upon it. (Lang, 2002:125) Borderlines The Thai-Burma border stretches from north to south some 1,800 km cutting through ten Thai provinces and fifteen Burmese townships. It is home to large and diverse groups of people who only in recent times have found themselves divided by a national border. My research was conducte d in Tak Province, Thailand and the study population are the Burmese on the Thai side of the border who reside in or near Mae Sot. Mae Sot is a vibrant town, situ ated roughly midway between Bangkok, Rangoon and Chiangmai, which all have road and air connections. Mae Sot town is central in terms of border relationships and geography. The site is charac terised by flow and change, official and shifting demarcations of the unofficial, and bristling capitalism and conflict. People and commodities flow through the border area even when the checkpoints close. Burmese women come to this area by different routes for different purposes. Many need to manage their fertility in order to achieve their productive goals. 39Nation states and historical geopolitics Thailand was not always a nation state with a delineated border. Until the British and French arrived at the extremities of the Siamese influence in the 19th Century, the notion of a defined linear border did not exist. Thongchai Winichakul (1994) elegantly charts the evoluti on of the mapping of Siam. He navigates us through the conceptual clash that occurred in the mid 19th Century between a Buddhist cosmological explanation of space and power and western concepts of cartography and geography. The concept of a border was something entirely different. Thongchai narrates the scene where an Englishman Frederick Neale encountered the 'map' presented to him by the Siamese regent (N eale published this account in 1852). The map showed no evidence of mountains, towns, geographical markers or representations of a country. Rather, it colourfully depicted a heavenly deity surrounded by little demons with some thick black lines. The Englishman was amused and bemused by this particular depicti on of the celestial domain of Siam: In the little patch of green, a small Indian-i nk figure, consisting of a little dot for the head, a large dot for the body, and four scrat ches of the pen to represent the legs and arms, was intended for the wretched Thar awaddy, the then King of Burmah. A legion of little imps, in very many diffe rent attitudes, were dancing about his dominions, and these hieroglyphics were to show to the uninitiated in what a troubled and disturbed state the Burmese empire was, and what an insignificant personate, in his own dominions, was the Burman King. Betwixt the green and the red, there was a broad black stripe, an indisputable boundary line; and on the red side of the black stripe, a little curved thin line drawn with ink, to indicate the territory laid claim to by the Birmans(sic) but disputed by the Siamese... (Thongchai Winichakul, 1994:34). Maps of the time pictorially represented th e Siamese court's disdain for and conflict with the Burmese. Modern geography arrived in Siam when mi ssionaries brought world maps into the country in 1833 in the reign of Rama IV -King Mongkut, who was very interested in astronomy and geography. Prior to this the Siamese were disinterested in the fixed notion of a border and defined their influe nce spatially through the people who paid tribute to the Siamese court. 16 A system of patronage and protection extended from 16 Hazel Lang (2002) also discusses the frontier la nds and notes King Chulal ongkorn's implementation of European-style administration over Siam. She presents Edmund Leach's comments on the annexation of Burma by the British: 'Burma as represented on a modern political map is not a natural geographical or historical entity; it is a creation of the armed diplomacy and administrative 40multiple points of power. Traditionally, tribut es of silver and gold trees were offered by communities to near and distant overlords. In the existing system of provincial control, which was based on the hierarchical network of lordship among local rulers under the nobles in Bangkok, a small town could request a change of dependence on one lo rd to another, mostly after a dispute. The new lord might be the ruler of a town which was not adjacent to it. The domain of a regional lord could even be discontinuous (Thongchai 1994:120). Tributes were given to the most powerful rulers who could offer protection; many communities offered tributes to multiple overlords if they could afford it. At this time the concept of the border was perceived as a corridor rath er than a line, not always continuous. Due to increased pressure from the colonial imperialistic powers of Britain and France, who felt that boundaries or borders between Burma, Lao and Cambodia were important particularly for tr ade, many years were spent attempting to persuade the Siamese court to delineate its territory. Bodies also became markers of territory and borders; whereby subjects were tattooed to denote territorial claims: After the final Anglo-Burmese war was over in 1885, the frontier between Lanna and Upper Burma became a problem as the region was within the spheres of several powers. Two major areas in question were the Kayah state along the Salween river and the chiefdoms of the Shan and the Lu people between Kengtung and Lanna. As for the frontier along the Salween, small v illages with the Siamese white elephant flags and posts with stockades and garri sons were established along the border. Some Kayah were tattooed to substantiate Siam's claim for five Kayah towns. In 1875, however, the Burmese king at Ava had put forward a claim to the British government in India that the Kayah chiefs had sent \"virgins to the Burman king as tokens of subjection\" and this customary present had been given to Burma \"since the beginning of the world\" (Tongchai 1994:107). When Thongchai takes a gende red view of mapping or borde r disputes, he notes the practice of offering women as tokens of subjugation had been practiced for some time. Thus the new concept of mapping gained precedence and instead of gathering tributes, it became a valuable tool to the Thai. It enabled the Thai to represent convenience of late nineteenth-century British Imperialism. (From 'The Political Future of Burma' Futuribles, vol 1, Geneva Droz, 1963:125). 41themselves and argue their right to contro l certain geographical/s patial areas and to claim women's bodies. This historical and spatial hegemony plays out today in Mae Sot where the border is porous and frontier-like, and state and non-state actors, su ch as wealthy landlords, employers or insurgent leaders exert power over the less powerful. The English language newspapers regularly report border incursions, shells over national borders, movements of people and commodities, trafficking women and the unilateral closure of the border (Cheewin Sattha, 2001; Post reporters, 2002). Today, Burmese women's bodies are inscribed with the burdens of lack of opportunities and exploitation; Burmese women wear work permits around their ne cks on cords, like impermanent tattoos which offer protection from Thai authorities. Why is a geopolitical artefact such as a border important to women's health? The most obvious answer is the wo man's citizenship and theref ore her relatio nship to the state is dependant on her location. Citizensh ip generally includes an entitlement to state resources and certain civic responsibilities. A Burmese citizen who illegally crosses into Thailand has no claim of entitlement to Thai state resources, especially health care. Her relationship with the Thai state, which may be as a refugee or a documented or undocumented worker, limits her entitlement. Thus, it is not only why she comes to the border area but how she crosses into Thailand that has an important affect on her health. Is she a traumatised a nd ill displaced person? Did she travel with a trafficker? Is she a jade or a monosodium glutamate trader? Is she a na\u00efve teenager easily sold into a brothel? As Porter ( 1997) argues representati ons are subjective and changeable, more often fulfilling the goals of governments and agencies 'that are instrumentally concerned to delimit, define, and stabilize the people who were \"identified\" and were \"creators\" of the even ts being researched.' There are also more pragmatic ideas that link with many migrant' s experience of arrivi ng in a new country of initial disorientation and a certain vulnerability which can be exploited if language and cultural norms are different. 42Tak Province Tak province in Thailand abuts Karen State in Burma. The Moei Ri ver is a na tural but not impenetrable boundary. Tak province cove rs an area of 16,406 square kilometers, mostly mountains rising to altitudes of 2,000 metres. Ba ngkok is about 450 km to the south and Rangoon only 400 km away. The provin cial town of Tak is situated 90 km from the border. The province has nine dist ricts and the study is situated in two of them, one urban and one rural. Tak town is the provincial capital but Mae Sot is the economic driving force. The Asia Highway cuts through the province providing accessibility and a trading route. Agriculture , mining, forestry, tourism and trade with Burma are the main economic generators. The province contains large numbers of indigenous hilltribe people, mostly Karen or Hmong but also Lahu, Aka, Yao and Lisu who live in remote areas and who have mobile lifestyles. Since many people are undocumented in Tak province it is difficult to know th e real number of the population. The United Nations Economic an d Social Commission for Asia and Pacific recorded the popul ation at 486,000 in 2000, a quarter of which live in the municipal areas (United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 2000). A large a nd visible Burmese population fo rm a mixed migration flow of people escaping human rights abuses, co nflict, 'development' projects, poverty, forced labour, forced cons cription and bleak futures in Burma. Many Burmese are deported out of Tak province only to retu rn again shortly after (Human Rights Documentation Unit & Burmese Wome n's Union, 2000; Pim Koetsawang, 2001). The border area is a stable, low intensity conf lict zone where insurgent armies operate within the jungles of Burma just over the border (Rand, 2001). Their ta rget is the Burmese military ( tatmadaw - B) and its allies. There are problems with unexploded ordinance and landmines injuries comm only occur (Michiyo Kato, Saw Ler Wah, Kramer, Islam, & Moser-Puangsuwan, 2002). Roadblocks and police checkpoints attempt to control movement of people, drugs, weapons and goods across the border and out of Tak province. Mae Sot - the town Thai, Burmese and farang (T - foreign westerners) reside in Mae Sot. Each group is diverse. Thai may be ethnic Thai, Chinese or Karen and mixed marriages occur. The 43Burmese comprise Muslims, Burman dissi dents and ex-political prisoners, Karen National Liberation Army soldiers, Karen hi ghlanders and delta folk. Some Burmese have been residents in Thailand since the 1970s and carry the appropriate identity card, while newer arrivals without work permits attempt to blend into the mixed crowd. Many Burmese travel over the border with day passes to shop and trade in Mae Sot. Some visit the doctor or buy medicine at the pharmacies. Farang include mercenaries, missionaries, aid workers and a few backpacking travellers who need a new visa in their passport. Thai soldiers, recruited from all over Thailand, are another transient group who live in ba rracks on the outskirts of the town. Religious diversity is tolerated and there are several mosques, Baptist and Anglican churches and many Buddhist temples, some housing Burmese monks. Pickup trucks with 'Freedom Fighter', 'Mujahedeen' and 'Christian Wa rrior' stencilled on the windscreen drive around town. It is a place of open secrets, corruption, black-market deals, trafficking, prostitution and exploitative work practices . There are regular 'crackdowns' which generally include a warning to all undocumented Burmese to leave, followed by mass arrests and deportation (Aung Su Shin, 2003b; Manning, 2003; Yindee Lertcharoenchok, 2000). It is possible to make a lot of money in Mae Sot. Consumer goods such as motorbikes, refrigerators, televisions, vi deo and CD players are all available for purchase, although there is more choice in Chiangmai and Bangkok. There is one department store with Thai women in makeup and miniskirts similar to those seen in Bangkok. There are warehouses, transport comp anies, brothels, cyber-cafes, mobile- phone and teakwood businesses. On the edges of town and in the backstreets, there are also hundreds of factories full of young workers from Burma, sewing garments such as jeans for regional and international markets. Snapshots from Mae Sot The diversity of the town can perhaps be st be conveyed through brief descriptions from my field-notes. I lived in Mae Sot for ten months and frequently visited the busy food and gem markets, both of which have a large visible Burmese presence. 44Plate 3 The gem market attracts cust omer from Bangkok and Burma (2002) Plate 4 Mae Sot General Hospital is a modern health facility (2002) 45The town is characterised by trade opport unities and the dispo ssessed who live on the margins. The bridge to Burma I ride down the road to the bridge to Burma on my bicy cle. There is a lot of activity around the bridge and the river. On the Burmese side of the river, women wash their laundry and lay it out on the banks to dry in the sun. On the Thai side, trinket markets sell jade ri ngs, pearl earings, dried plums, plastic guns, soap, teak artefacts a nd poor quality silk. On the bridge the official business happens but underneath is where the unofficial trade occurs. Trucks zoom back and forth past the immigrati on officials. I can see people queuing on the Burmese side to get their day passes into Mae Sot. But the most interesting business is under the bridge. Kyats can be exchanged for black market prices. Sometimes groups of Burmese sit on their haunches and wait to be picked up and taken further into Thailand by their trafficker. Burmese hawkers offer 'imported' whiskey w ith international brand names and cigarettes at very cheap prices. Sm all boats go back and forth between the banks stacked high with teak furniture and antique relics from temples in Burma. Beautiful lacque r-ware and golden painted nats (nature spirits or mythical figures) fill the boats comi ng to Thailand. Cracked Buddha images are placed on top of the piles. Burma is for sale! In the middle of the river in the dry s eason, several sand banks appear. I wade through the knee deep water. On the sandy soil Burmese people have set up a camp, some of which are small shops. I sit down in one and order kun: ja for one Baht and start chewing. As always , my red spit pulls a crowd and soon a slim young man is telling me why he liv es on a sand bank which forms the border of Burma and Thailand. 'There is no work, so I came here with my friends and the Thai come and get us each day for work. We load lorries that are going to China or move things in the market. I want to work in the factory.' Is this Burma or Thailand ? I ask, picking up th e grains of sand. Nobody knows (Field-notes January 2003). 46The gem trade On a rainy Sunday afternoon, the main st reet of Mae Sot is doing a high trade in gems. There are several gem dealership s clustered together in open trading. Glass cases reveal cut and polished quality jade, rubies, sapphires and other brilliantly glistening stones. Pink and cream coloured pearls can also be bought. The traders are dressed in a smart casual style of trousers and shirt; a few men wear neatly pressed longji . They clump together in huddles constantly handling and rubbing the stones that appear like magic out of their pockets. They smoke hsei: leis and imported cigarettes. They smile at each other. A few men have small tables set up on the pavement and they inspect and appraise the pieces. Handheld to rches and magnifying glasses sweep over the surface and probe into the depths of the treasures. Sometimes the news is favourable and the men look at each othe r with a deep pleasure. The most common language here is Burmese followed by Thai. Some of the Burmese speak Thai with a heavy accent. The customers today are mainly overweight Thai ladies with tight perms. They are elegantly overdressed for this border town and their manicured fingers sport wonderful rings. They drive up from Bangkok in search of a good bargain to sell again in Bangkok'(Field-notes July 2002). Street life Street children with dirty faces and feet , their clothes falling off them, beg for money and scavenge for rubbish scraps to sell. At night as I walk home to my house, they sleep in the shop fronts. Many of them are Muslim-Burmese but have been taken into one of the local Ch ristian churches to learn some English, eat a decent meal and perhaps consider another God. The tiny curving lanes contain houses crammed together with only basic amenities and crazy dogs. Slim young Burmese women holding hands sway past in their tight ma tching tops and sarongs, tha nakha swirls carefully applied, under umbrellas to keep their skin pale. Cheeky Burmese boys, three to a bicycle ride past and shout 'Fuck you!' whilst smiling and waving in a 47very friendly manner. The internet caf\u00e9s are full of overweight Thai pre-teen lads blasting their cyber enemies on screen (Field-notes August 2002). Traders I visit Samina, a vivacious Muslim woma n who owns a shop near the hospital. Samina is married with children and she doe s not wear a veil like most of the other Muslim women. She introduces me to th e Muslim community in Mae Sot as she supervises her female shop assistants who make the fragrant betel nut parcels. Each woman has a small wooden table in front of her with all the ingredients to make kun: ja . The fresh leaves are spread with a white peppermint paste, honey water, rose power, a piece of carda mom, flakes of silver, and chewing tobacco as well as the most important i ngredient red betel nut. All over Mae Sot there are splotches of scarlet sa liva on the ground. Chewing is popular with Burmese of all ages and with so me elderly Thais. Women chew less frequently, perhaps out of vanity as it stains the teeth. Samina's shop assistants are quick and skilled. They fold all the ingredients into little leaf parcels. It is a moist and sticky process. 'I can sell one buck et of betel nut per day. We make the kun: ja into little chewing parcels and put ten into a plastic bag. I sell the bags for one baht each. My recipe is popular.' Samina is well established in the local co mmunity and does not yearn to go home to Burma. Her accounts of religions persecuti on also appear in wr itten documentation (Karen Group, 2002; Maung Mau ng Oo, 2001). Samina explains the reasons many Burmese Muslims move to Thailand: Most the people in the Muslim commun ity come from Burma and they are involved in trading, business, jade, and motorbikes. We own this shop. There are other Muslims who are very poor. Th ey have no house here or in Burma. The military have forced them off their land and they come to Thailand. They have problems when they live in Thailand. My mother really set things up for us. These people have no connections or networks to help them. They can't get into the refugee camp. Some people live alongside Karens so when they 48become displaced they flow with the Ka ren refugees and can enter the camps. Others have no Karen connections. Thes e 'low' people are very poor and they live in crowded conditions. They go th rough the rubbish bins here in Mae Sot and sell the rubbish. Some young women become sex workers. Some sell ya- baa (T- amphetamines) to make money. Some children beg on the streets. These 'low' people don't trust others. So, for example, if I need a new employee they won't work for me. They can't find jobs but they also have a bad attitude so it is hard to employ them. They do the 'carry' (slang -trafficker) jobs. They only think about money. The main reason for all this is that it is not possible to go to school in Burma. People are very poor. They have these big propaganda signs in Burma that say 'Education for all children', but when you are in the sc hool they make you worship Buddha. The Christian and Muslim children don't want to do that. We call ourselves Burmese but we are illiterate in Burman . In the Muslim school here in Mae Sot, we have children fro m other religions and ethni cities. We don't have a problem with the Thai people. The situ ation in Burma is bad. Even when our children finish ten years of school after we have bribed the teachers not to make them worship, they cannot enter unive rsity in Burma. They are stuck at this level. The Burmese government refuses citizenship to Muslim people (Field-notes August 2002). 49Plate 5 Mae Sot often floods in rainy season (2002) Plate 6 Burmese children sleep on the stre ets of town at night -Mae Sot (2003) 50The NGOs Mae Sot has several Burmese non-government organisations which exist illegally. Many are rooted in welfare, education, health or religion but others are more overtly political. The Thaksin government has become less sympathetic to these activities in Thailand and most operate cove rtly (Sanitsuda Ekachai, 2003b).17 By chance, one day I found the Assistance Association for Po litical Prisoners (AAPP) tucked away in Mae Sot which provides support to those w ho are able to escape into Thailand (Assistance Association for Politi cal Prisoners (Burma), 2001).18 Inside the building a chilling display is held in a small room. A wall covered in passport-size photos shows some of th e faces of the 1,300 political prisoners still inside Burma's prisons. Ko Sa w Win has been in the AAPP compound for the past nine months. He spent seven years in Insein jail for publishing political documents on democracy. 'Not many' he tells me, 'and if I had known I would get caught, I would have done a lot more!' He shows me the display about the student activist hero Min Ko Naing19 and I notice that Daw Aung San Sui Kyi has received 66 intern ational awards and honours. Her 56th award came from the University of Mel bourne and she was bestowed with an Honorary Doctorate of Law in 1998. Ot her people are honoured too; Bo Kyi from Amnesty International, Daw Thida Htway and U Ye Thint. Ko Saw Win is still a young man, and very intense. He smells of hsei: lei tobacco and I have the feeling that he vibrates when he talks. But maybe his nerves are worn. 'I disagreed with the Conventi on, so they locked me away for seven years. They lock the mo nks away too.' There ar e numerous pictures of young 17 Sanitsuda Ekachai is a journalist who works for the Bangkok Post. In this article she mentions that the Mae Tao Clinic's staff are considered illegal migr ant workers and they face deportation to Burma. She questions why after more than a decade of treating patients, th e Clinic should now be targeted especially considering the valuab le work they accomplish. She rh etorically poses the question how Thaksin's government could find a balance between politics, business and compassion. She speaks of Burmese NGOs raided so often they are forced to close. She names Mae Sot as a centre of modern slavery. 18 See website http://www.aappb.net/ [access date 30 January 2005] fo r more information about this NGO. 19 Min Ko Naing was released in November 2004 from Sittewe jail after being sentenced for his part in organizing students during the 1988 uprising. 51men in robes with shaved heads. There is a women's section in Insein - room enough for fifty political women prisoners. He shows me a wall with loud coloured bags, gloves, prayer beads and hats made of plastic and wool. These are the kind of handicrafts one might see at a bad country fair. 'These were made by political prisoners' he tells me with urgency. Suddenly the gaudy green, yellow and brown macram\u00e9 shopping bags mean something. This is what you do to stop yourself from going mad. 'Political prisoners are not allowed to read, write or speak about politics. Some of the political prisoners sp end months or longer in solitary confinement. Families find it difficult to visit because the prisoner is often put in a jail far away from their hometown in an effort to isolate him or her further.' There is a sack on the floor. 'T his is how we sleep.' There is a dirty cream coloured shirt on the wall. 'This is what we wear. It's not enough in the cold season.' There are aerial photos of the prisons and labour camps, and models of some notorious jails. There are iron shackles. He demonstrates the prison poses demanded by the guards that either hurt or are meant to degrade the prisoner. There are international awards from countries recognising the bravery and spirit of the men and wo men who are still locked away today (Field-notes November 2002). The rural area The other location of this study is a rural dist rict of Tak province, forty kilometres out of Mae Sot. Measured in kilometres this distance does not sound far but it is agricultural and isolated, a nd while the condition of many roads is very good, the main barrier to movement is the fear of a rrest. Freedom of movement in Tak province is dependent on citizenship and status. Thai people may travel freely but Burmese people must carry papers stating their condit ions of work. Freedom of movement is limited to the immediate surrounds if a worke r's papers are irregul ar or non-existent. Many Burmese workers never travel into town during their time in Thailand and for women needing routine or emergency obs tetric care, this is a problem. 52The rich sticky red earth in th e valley is very fertile and supports a variety of produce. A great variety of crops grow in the luxuriant soil and temperate climate including corn, cabbages, tobacco, oranges, tomatoes , beans, roses, lettuce, cucumbers and potatoes. There is 200,000 rai20 of farming land in this valley and 3,000 rai produces roses. Thirty-nine million roses were sold in the couple of weeks proceeding the day of lovers -Valentines Day - for two milli on Baht in 2003 (Supamart Kasem, 2003). This is big agribusiness. Many Burmese women work in this area and the average pay is 2,500 Baht (US $58) per month usua lly with basic accommodation (Federation of Trade Unions-Burma, 2002). The air is thick with chemical pesticides and fertilisers and many workers can be seen sp raying crops without adequate respiratory or skin protection. Agricultural workers w ear straw hats, a clot h wrapped around their heads, long sleeved shirts and trousers. Industrial ma sks or gloves are rare. Vegetable and flower processi ng areas and markets are set up by the side of the road. The produce is cleaned and packed ready fo r markets in Thailand and Burma. A good road infrastructure ensures produce can be delivered quickly to consumers. The journey through the valley is astoundingly b eautiful. The landscape is hilly and in some places, dense forest caps high hills and mountaintops disappear in the mist. The road is new and reasonably straight, the only obstacle being the ubiquitous checkpoints that form a fairly impenetrable barrier to people who do not have identity cards, travel papers or work permits. Th e main road through th e valley has many checkpoints which are clearly marked with various traffic slowing devices. The Thai officers and soldiers wear uniforms and hol d guns and they randomly check vehicles. They put most of their attention into the public transport - songtow - which for a price will carry people and produce in the back of the pickup truck. Children perch on top of sacks of onions in the middle of th e truck while women trade fresh vegetables with each other, speaking Burmese. Most of the passengers are Burmese workers, clearly identifiable by thei r cheap, worn, cotton sarongs, Burmese-style gold earings and tha nakha makeup . They press the bell and jump off before the checkpoints to avoid arrest and deportation. Extortion is common at the checkpoint and workers, if caught, are frisked for money or 'fines' by th e soldiers. 20 One Thai rai is the equivalent of 1600 square metre of one acre equals 2.5 rai. 53Migrant workers live on the farms and orchards in va rious types of housing and conditions. One of my key informants, a community health worker, Ko Zoe Latt, lived rent-free on an orange orchard in th e most beautiful verdant surroundings. He was responsible for caring for the land and occasionally picked the fruit and delivered it to the Thai owner. His wooden house was very simple. It had an iron roof that dropped condensed water on us in the earl y morning as we lay on the floorboards under blankets and mosquito nets. There wa s neither glass nor mosquito screens in the window-frames. There was no toilet or washing area in the house but an outhouse, five metres away, with rice sacks to mainta in privacy around the ceramic squat toilet. The shower consisted of a large earthenwa re pot and plastic scoop. The kitchen, a large room with a couple of large plasti c bowls for washing up, doubled as a birthing room. Ko Zo Latt had built a high bed where wo men came to deliver their babies in the 'traditional' wester n style of lithotomy. 21 He had strung cotton bedspreads around the table to give it some seclusion from th e main cooking activitie s. The kitchen was completely open to the hill on one side. There was a charcoal oven and large water containers that collected the water from the roof as there is no piped water. During the evening he took me for a walk through the orange groves and we picked sweet fragrant jasmine blooms for his wife. Later we cut a chicken's throat in the kitchen and then dunked its corpse into boiling water, and sat and plucked it while chatting and drinking beer. The living conditions for other workers are not so pleasant. Migrant workers live in overcrowded shanty type conditions in small hovels with the bare minimum of sanitation. Dotted through this agribusine ss landscape are relocated Hmong villages, now home to the new Burmese arrivals. In one ex-Hmong povert y stricken village about thirty-five kilometres from the tow n, hundreds of Burmese migrant workers go about their evening business and my heart fa lls when I see them. Firstly, the grinding poverty and desolate living condi tions are appalling. It fe els as though we stepped out 21 Lithotomy is one of the 'normal' positions for bi rth according to Beischer & Mackay (1986), who concede that it is for the convenience of the acco ucheur who has full access to and visibility of the woman's vulva during the delivery of the baby's head and body (see page 370). The woman is supine on a bed with legs wide apart in the air supported by an attendant or stirrups. Most diagrams of 'normal' birth in classic medical text books are usually depicted in lithotomy. 54of Thailand and into an Indian slum. Families are living in one-room shacks made of bamboo, biscuit tins and plastic sheets barely raised off the muddy ground. It is all very transient. Rubbish floats about in th e mud. There appear to be three toilets for hundreds of people. The toilets are filthy and blocked with maggots squirming in the faeces. I walk through the shanty township and people are washing themselves and their laundry in the stream, repairing their houses a nd going about their evening business. I meet an overweight Thai-Karen man on a big shiny motorbike, he feels threatening and I ask his permission to walk through. I feel he is in charge here. Later I am told he owns th e shops and karaoke businesses. The shanty town is so large that it takes more than forty-five minutes to walk through. There is a mosque, many shops and lots of young Burmese migr ant workers. Some of the women are pregnant and I stop and ask where they will have their baby. It's very much like a refugee camp, but dirtier and more haphazard. Another feature of the rural area is the numerous karaoke bars. During the day, they are empty and quiet but at night, the pretty fairy lights and music attract many of the Thai soldiers and Burmese workers to drink beer and whiskey. Young Burmese women sell alcohol and their bodi es. There is live singing and dancing as well as the ubiquitous karaoke machine with Thai and Burmese songs. The bars serve noodles, Coca Cola and unsafe sex. There has been some HIV/STI education conducted by Karen community health workers in this ar ea but they do not always have supplies of condoms to give away to th eir contacts in the trade. This whole valley has an imported populati on and there are often strange male to female ratios in particular areas. Fo r example, one village Ban Kyat Sanda (pseudonym) has 600 male migrant workers and 300 female migrant workers, while Jay Ya Klae (pseudonym) has 275 males a nd 735 female migrant workers. These discrepancies occur due to th e type of work required - wo men are hired to care for roses and to plant seedlings and men to sp ray pesticide or turn soil. The Burmese community health workers deliver HIV edu cation and peer-to-pe er training to over 5000 factory workers, 10,000 agricultural workers and 28 sex workers in this rural region. This is not the tota l number of migrant workers, only the target population of their particular community health project. 55The Karen The Karen people deserve special mention as they form the bulk of the health personnel who provide care to the forced migr ants in my fieldsite. Karen State in Burma lies directly opposite Tak Province and the Karen pe ople straddle both sides of the border, a frontier divided by geopolitical history. The Karen are a large ethnic minority group, comprising seven percent of the total population of Burma and similar in numbers to the Shan minority group (C entral Intelligence Agency, 2003a). As no reliable census has been undertaken sin ce colonial times and population figures are politicised, the actual numbers of any group of people are questionable. The Karen have been fighting a war with the Burm ese military junta si nce 1949, and clearly articulate their desire for political and cultura l autonomy in some form of a federal democratic system within Burma. Mae Sot and surrounds is a key centre for the Karen National Union resistance against th e SPDC. The Karen National Union (and its army the KNLA) is a separatist resistan ce movement originat ing from missionary and colonial influences and dominated by Christian Sgwa Karen (Rajah, 1990). General Bo Mya, a Karen soldier and leader, lives just outside of town in a large house with a high fence (Democra tic Voice of Burma, 2003). There are several origin stories, but generally it is assumed that the Karen fled into the mountains to escape the domination of the Burmans. The British missionaries and colonial rulers were perceive d as liberating at the time and a 'salvation' in relieving the Karen from the tyranny of the Burman. Th is plays a large part in the forming of Karen national identity (Rajah, 2002). But th e British failed to help the Karen prior to independence in 1946, when a Karen mission re quested the colonial government for assistance to establish an autonomous home territory; it recommende d they join with the Burmans. 22 Much of the written work by th e Karen is produced by the educated Christian elite and this gives the impression of a particular type of 'Karenness' based in Baptist, Seventh Day Adventist and m ilitary discourse (Karen National Union, 2000b; Saw Bo Mya, 2002). The imagery involves honest, hardy, hospitable and slightly na\u00efve Karen who are fierce fighters wh en attacked and the victims of fate and tragedy. 22 See also for more Karen history http://www.karen.org/ [access date 2 Jan 2004] 56 During the New Year celebrations in 2003 in one of the refugee camps in Tak province, the Karen Refugee Committee chairman said: For us, being Karens, we have our own way of living, our own culture and traditions, which we need to observe and preserve. As aforesaid (sic), the year 2741 Karen Era has passed by and we are entering our New Year 2742 Karen Era.23 When we look at the present, and then at th e past, we learn that we Kare ns have gone through many cycles of repressions, suffering malicious deeds by others, becoming victims of deprivations and destructions...Fellow refug ees, friends, our greatest hope is for us to be able to go back to our homes, one da y. Being refugees doesn't mean losing hope. We need not waste time and effort. We need endeavour to achieve knowledge and skill, to better ourselves for our own future benefit. Our hopes can be fulfilled, only if we can achieve harmony and unity. We can dispel differences in understanding and forgiveness (Fieldnotes January 2003). 23 The Karen count time according to their story of or igin and so the Christia n year of 2003 is the equivalent of 2742 in the Karen Era. 57 Plate 7 Romanticised Karen imagery of a group of young people playing instruments Plate 8 Karen soldier gather to hear sp eeches on Revolution Day in Burma (2002) 58 In his speech the chairman alluded to the loss of Kawthoolei ( Land of Lilies ) the real and imagined heartland of the Karen, the tr agedy in the injustices suffered at the hands of the Burmese, Japanese, the British and the Thai, as well as the fragmentation of the Karen people into two warring fac tions; the Christian KNLA, and the Buddhist DKBA. The seemingly endless Karen Revolut ion has the following precepts; to never surrender, to never give up arms, to determ ine political destiny, ant that the Karen State must be recognised. A fragile ceasef ire is being negotiated between the KNU and SPDC but may fail like the last one ten years ago (Democratic Voice of Burma, 2003; South, 2004). Health and the Karen Karen health behaviour reflec ts pluralistic understandings and practices. Jonathan Falla spent several months living in a rebel Karen base 'Riverside' just inside the Burmese border. He recorded health pr actices which include d protective tattoos, imported medicines, jungle cure s, spirit appeasement, divinati on and animal sacrifice: The Riverside Christians would not have been seen dead with strings round their wrists, but in other villages the practice con tinued. For the Karen, religious loyalties are a flexible matter. A change in economic status, or a move to a new community may easily bring about a change in faith - which may be complete or only partial. Equally, Karen attitudes to health and me dicine are very syncretic, and the same person might look in many directi ons for help (Falla, 1991:94) Traditional herbs, spirit worship and astrol ogy remain important aspects of health seeking behaviour prior to admission to the Mae Tao Clinic for treatment with antibiotics, vaccines or an ti-malarials (Neumann, 2003). 24 The syncretism in local health care is echoed in other kinds of s yncretism. Karen drive pick-up trucks, sing John Denver songs and text each other on th e latest and smallest mobile phones in Thailand. Some Karen soldiers use m odern weapons of warfare (Rand, 2001). The Karen groups active on this part of the border provide much of the meagre health resources and infrastructure available to those forced to migrate into Thailand as well as for the internally displaced in Burma. The Karen National Union's Health and 24 One hundred years ago Ferrars (19 01) recorded the importance of spiritual matters in health and welfare issues, as well as problems with al coholism, poor hygiene and 'superstition'. 59Welfare System policy states that its basis is in a primary care health system that 'grows out of villages' and the philosophy of he alth for all, that health is a right for everyone regardless of sex, skin colour a nd race, that there is an aim to empower through education and to focus on the preventi on and cure of disease (Karen National Union, 2000a). The policy document also includes the care of domestic animals as most people referred to are subsistence farmers and in close contact with their animals. The document acknowledges one of the core health problems of the Karen, the difficulty in giving assistance to the displaced and dispossessed. In the past, the Karen National Union was not supportive in the provision of family planning information or supplies to the Karen diaspora, and limiting the number of children a couple may have is not viewed as traditional by many Karen leaders ( Pers. Comm. Sterk 2002). Christian religious fundament alism prohibits influencing such 'gifts from God' as pregna ncy. The Karen leader ships' pro-natalism is influenced by the protracted conflict, the scarcity of medicine and health workers, and the low priority of women's health. Tradition is often invoked for many reasons, some being identity, homesickness an d nationalist causes (Rajah, 1990). Categories and definitions A diverse number of categories are used to describe the Burmese people who live in Tak province. Researchers, government officials and aid workers with vested interests, use various labels which often serve to obscure the life-story of the person (Caouette & Pack, 2002; Grundy-Warr, 2002). Porter (1997) not on ly elaborates on the shifting 'risk groups', 'behaviours' and 'situations' often identified in HIV prevention strategies, but also the ways in which well intentioned interventions disempower the people they are supposed to assist. As Thailand is not a signatory to the Refugee Convention (1951) or the 1967 Protocol, the Thai government uses the term 'temporarily displaced person' rather than refugee, whatever the length of stay in camp (Caouette, Kritaya Archanvanitkul, & Hnin Hnin Pyne, 2000; Lang, 2002). Burmese found outside of camps are often ca lled migrant workers but would be better classified as forced migrants. Furthermore, Thailand has a rather complex citizenship system where people hold different coloured identity cards with various entitlements 60and it is possible to have double ethnicity in Thailand, for example Sino-Thai, Thai- Yai or Thai-Karen, and for those with no identity, it is possible to purchase Thai- Karen identity cards. In the following s ection, I will explain the taxonomy of various population groups in the borderl ands. Externally and inte rnally displaced Burmese people are classified into categories by sp atial and political reasons; they have different access to health services. Migrant workers - docume nted and undocumented The forced Burmese migrants who come to find work in Thailand are termed 'irregular', or 'undocumented' , 'unregistered' or 'illegal ' migrant workers if they do not hold immigration papers. There is an estimated one to one-and-a-half million migrant workers in Thailand, the vast majority from Burma (Asian Migrant Centre & Migrant Forum in Asia, 2002; Royal Thai Government, 2001). However, the figures are probably an underestimate (Wong Ta i-Chee & Singh, 1999). The number of work permits issued by the Employment Department never concurs with NGO estimates of the numbers of migrant work ers in Thailand (F ederation of Trade Unions-Burma, 2002). Burmese leave Burma to work mainly in Thailand but also Bangladesh, India, Malaysia and Singapore and there are an estimated 1.37 million Burmese working in other countries. The majority are not docum ented to leave the country. This is a burden for many Burmese workers who leav e their country illegally and enter Thailand illegally as they f ace a seven year jail term if caught by Burmese authorities (Asian Migrant Centre & Migrant Forum in Asia, 2003). The journey places them at risk as well as making repatriation and remittance complicated and open to corruption (Federation of Trade Unions-Burma, 2002). Remittances into Burma assist the Burmese economy and are not recorded as workers carry their savings home as gold ingots and jewellery (G raham & Poku, 2000). There are great differences in many econom ic indicators of i ndividual wealth and national economic development between Thailand and Burma that induce large numbers of Burmese to seek a better opport unity in Thailand. There is no recorded Burmese household income or percentage of Burmese women in the Union of 61Myanmar workforce recorded by the Asia Migrant Centre. Inflation was recorded as 18 percent in 1999 and there are numerous references to the limping economy and lack of overseas investors in Burma (Asian Migrant Centre & Migrant Forum in Asia, 2002; Gutter, 2001; Lintner, 2003; The Ec onomist Intelligen ce Unit, 2001, 2002). The Asian Development Bank estimated in 2001 that nearly twelve million people were unable to sustain themselves out of a population of 48 million (Asian Development Bank, 2001). Significant intern ational economic sanc tions are in place against trade as well as other diplomatic issues (United States Department of State, 2003b). The Organization for Economic C ooperation and Development put Burma on the money laundering blacklist and Burma is believed to be maintaining its economy through illicit drug production and sales (Gutter, 2001). Table 5 summarises the difference between the Burmese and Thai ec onomy which may or may not be reliable figures. 25 Table 5 Selected ASEAN economic indicators 2000 Country Rate of GDP growth % GDP per capita US$ Average inflation rate Trade Balance in million US$ Interest rates 3 month time deposit % per annum Exchange rates average to the US$ Cambodia 4.50 289 -0.79 -245 6.6 3,641 Laos 5.74 315 23.16 -87 13.5 7,875 Myanmar 6.23 155 3.40 -797 9.3 340 Thailand 4.31 1,986 1.56 5,519 3.0 40 Singapore 9.89 25,864 1.35 11,400 1.7 1.7 Source: adapted from ASEAN Annual Report 20 00-2001, (Association of Southeast Asian Nations, 2002:8) Working in Thailand Thailand has an immigration system wher eby Burmese people can enter legally for work and study, but most come through the informal but well organised underground networks. The Royal Thai Government's policies toward migrant workers have changed over the years according to economic and political agendas. For example, the Asian financial crisis in 1997, as well as the seizure of the Burmese embassy in Bangkok by Burmese dissidents in 1999, led to the forced deportation of thousands of 25 The United States ASEAN Council's website covering Myanmar is severely deficient of basic economic indicators http://www.us-asea n.org/myanmar.asp [May 2003]. 62unregistered workers. However, the Thai Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Thai Industry called for a more accommod ating approach to the issue of foreign workers (Caouette et al., 2000). The business elite are keen to have them in Thailand as migrant workers are cheap, docile and eager to work; they accept the type of jobs, working conditions and pay that most Thai are unwill ing to accept (Chuthatip Maneepong, 2003; Federation of Trade Un ions-Burma, 2002). According to a University of New South Wales doctoral thesis on the Dynamics of Industrial Development in Border Towns: Case Studies in Thailand , Due to the shortage of industrial and sk illed labour in border provinces, as in other Thai provinces, the demand for migrant labour is high. In particular, in Mae Sot, bordering Myanmar, several labour-inten sive industries, especially garment industries, employ migrant workers. Furthermore, Thai workers prefer less physically hard work and can choose alternative empl oyment in border trade, border tourism and other countries. The daily wage of My anmar labour is only half that of local Thai workers. It seems that according to th e international division of labour theory and the comparative advantage theory, th e differential cost of production, and especially the wage factor explain the exodus of Myanmar migrant workers and the agglomeration of labour intensive indu stries in Mae Sot (Chuthatip Maneepong, 2003:231). The migrant workers labour as domestic help , sales assistants, construction workers, weavers, sewers, seafood sorters, fisher people, farm labourers, petrol pump attendants, rubbish collector s, abattoir workers, salt miners, plantation labourers, factory and sex workers (Awataya Pana Do Union, 2000; Images Asia, 1997; Pim Koetsawang, 2001; Sunday Perspective Reporters, 2001).26 Table 6 shows the type of work available to Burmese workers and their average wages. 26 For the non-Thai reader the purchasing power of the Baht is important to understand. Informants said they budgeted between 1500 Baht to 2000 Baht to feed a husband, wife and three children. Household economy in 2001 in Mae Sot involved these types of costs: rent for a small house 1500 Baht, or one room 900 Baht per month, an electric fan 350 B. Food items were: a bunch bananas 20 B, good quality rice 240 B/ tin, bowl of noodles 10B or one serve rice and meat at a shop 15 B to 20 B, 10 eggs x 2 B = 20 Baht, litre of cooking oil 26 B, fish/ kg 40 B/kg cat fish, pork/kg 65 B /kg (all meat no bone or fat), chicken 27-32 B/kg (two kinds of chicken), chilli 55-65 B/kg, potatoes 15B/kg, other vegetables 5 B/kg, bottle of beer Chang 35 B.

Maneepong was able to get this information from Thai employers and factory owners but did not speak to any Burmese labourers in her 64study. In 1999, Thai labour policy regulated 100,000 migrant workers to work in 37 provinces in 18 types of business (which wa s a decrease prior to the Asian financial crisis). Documented workers are require d to undertake health examinations and Burmese were required to pay 1,700 Baht (US $39) for a medical examination and health insurance as a precondition of the work permit. The Ministry of Public Health (Royal Thai Government, 2001) estimated th at it costs only 250 Baht (US $6) on average to provide health services to a migrant worker per year. The 30 Baht universal health insurance scheme for Thai introduced by the Thaksin government, adds confusion for migrant workers with rega rds to their eligibility for it. They are eligible if they are a registered worker and have paid their registration fees but family member's who are not registered workers are not. Migrating to Thailand People walk, trek, ride and swim into Thaila nd from Burma. It is dangerous and some arrive quite unwell. There are many traditional walki ng tracks that people know and follow. If they are caught by the border patrols, provincial police or the military, they are deported back to Burma. They often re turn. In one three da y campaign to arrest construction workers in Chiangmai in Apri l 2002, the immigration police arrested 164 illegal Burmese workers. The Asian Mi grant Yearbook 2001 (Asi an Migrant Centre & Migrant Forum in Asia, 2002) records the forced expulsion of thousands of undocumented workers from Thailand and often during the arrests human rights violations occur (Human Rights Docume ntation Unit & Burmese Women's Union, 2000; Pim Koetsawang, 2001). Some people use traffickers to assist their travels and othe rs do not. This too can be dangerous. For example, in January 2002, seventeen Burmese men and women (two of whom were pregnant), were murdered an d their bodies thrown into the Moei river in Tak. They were thought to be undocumented workers being smuggled into Thailand (Supradit Kanwanich, 2002). In May 2003, another six Burmese male migrant workers were murdered and the Thai police and a trafficking network implicated. Forum-Asia (Somchai Homlao r & Sunai Phasuk, 2003) in a press release stated: 65The charred bodies of six men found in Hu ay Kalok village, thambon Mae Pa of Mae Sot district on 23 May were Burmese construction workers. The victims had been shot and their bodies burned on a pyre of rubber tires. They were identified as Aye Min, 22, Min Hein, 28, Thein Naing, 33, Ah Nge Lay, 19, Maung Maung, 24, and Ah Nyar, 22. On 20 May relatives of the six Burmese work ers filed a formal complaint to the National Human Rights Commission and the Law Society of Thailand about the disappearance and death of the men. In a fo rmal written complaint, the relatives said the six men went missing on 14 May. The eye witness accounts said that they were last seen in the custody of uniformed Thai officials, believed to be local police, who also administered the beating of the six me n. Thai officials in khaki and camouflage uniforms then seen (sic) took the six men, handcuffed and covered with blood, away in a pickup truck. Based on the eye witness accounts, the six men were brutally killed because they challenged henchmen from a prominent human trafficking and extortion gang in Mae Sot district. Members of this gang were allegedly associated with local officials. The murders were intended to be a lesson for other migrant workers. This account was also reported in the Bangkok Post (Supamart Kasem, 2003 27 May) and shortly after there was another mass arre st of 500 migrant workers and some Thai who were probably traffickers. Healthy work? More than 50,000 Burmese migrants work in the five agricultura l districts in Tak province. As already indicated, th e undocumented Burmese migrants do the demeaning, dirty, dangerous and difficult work, and an estimated 28 percent of migrant workers are women who work as household servants, sex workers, construction, factory and farm labourers (F ederation of Trade Unions-Burma, 2002). Chemicals used in agriculture threaten th e health of Burmese migrant workers who rarely use protective clothing or equipment. Migrant workers' blood was tested for chemicals and workers were reporting symptoms of ill health. Thai officials recorded worrying levels of carcinogenic chemicals in fruit, vegetables and flowers from the region (Aung Su Shin, 2003a). A study of Bu rmese domestic workers in Thailand documented verbal abuse, assault, rape a nd difficulty in accessing health information or services (Awataya Panam et al., 2004). Refugees - externally displaced Burmese On the border in Thailand, there are offici ally recognised camps for people leaving Burma under duress. In 2001, there were 17 camps, resettlement sites or holding 66centres. The camps are found in Mae Hong Son, Tak, Kanchanburi and Ratchaburi provinces. The camps are coordinated by th e Committee for Coordination of Services to Displaced Persons in Thailand (CCSDP T) which is made up of international humanitarian NGOs, church groups, foreign em bassies and the relevant ministries of the Royal Thai Government, such as the Mini stry of Public Health, Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Interior and the National S ecurity Council.27 The members of CCSDPT and the UNHCR also monitor relocation sites inside Burma such as Halochanee, Bee Ree and Tavoy. They often supply basic need s to the internally displaced people of Burma when they are within walking distan ce of the Thai border and before they cross it. In 1999 there was a camp populat ion of just under 100,000 and this figure has steadily increased over the years (Caouette et al., 2000). In January 2003, the CCSDPT recorded a total of 145,316 people re siding in about ten consolidated camps in Thailand (Committee for Coordination of Services to Displaced Persons in Thailand, 2003). Fifty-one percent of th e refugees are male and 49 percent are female. The largest refugee group is the Ka ren (65%), then the Karenni (18%), then people from Tenasserim Division (10%), M ons and small Rakhine, Rangoon, Kachin, Sagaing areas (Comm ittee for Coordination of Services to Displaced Persons in Thailand, 2003). However, most Burmese in Thailand are not recognised as fl eeing oppression and persecution. This is not a total figure of people forced to flee Burma and who reside in camps. The Shan people, for example, who flee from conflict in northern Burma, have no camps in northern Thailand in which to find sanctuary (Grundy-Warr & Yin, 2002; Shan Human Rights Foundation, 1998). During a two year period in the late 1990s some 80,000 Shans fled to Thailand in search of shelter. The Shan Human Rights Foundation said: Regrettably, the Thai government continues to deny refuge for those persons fleeing human rights abuses in Shan State. Shan refugees fleeing to Thailand have been repeatedly pushed back ac ross the border by Thai authorities, and unlike refugees 27 Some NGOs and donors include Medecins Sans Frontiers-France, Burmese Border Consortium, American Refugee Committee, Handica p International, International Rescue Committee, Aide Medical Internationale, Malteser-Hilfsdienst Auslandsdi enst, Jesuit Refugee Service (Asia-Pacific), DIAKONIA, Thailand Baptist Missionary Fellowship, Catholic Relief Service and many others (Committee for Coordination of Services to Displaced Persons in Thailand, 2003). 67from several other ethnic minority groups in Burma, Shan refugees receive no assistance from international aid groups. The result of the Thai policy has meant that until the present, any Shan refugees fleeing to Thailand have been forced to try and survive as illegal migrants. The risks and difficulties this involves have compounded their suffering (Shan Human Rights Foundation, 1998:44). In Tak province, three camps hold between 60,000 to 70,000 men, women and children (See UNHCR Refugee Population Map 2004). The largest camp Mae La, has housed 42,032 people held in limbo for mo re than a decade. It has a basic hospital, several clinics, many Christian c hurches of various denominations, temples, video halls, market places, kindergartens, high schools and teashops. Karen culture is nurtured and nationalistic fervour for the Karen Nation fostered (Rajah, 2002). The United Nations High Commissioner for Refu gees was invited to Thailand in 1998 after the camps were attacked by the SPDC (and allies such as DKBA) and security issues became a worry, well over a decade afte r the majority of the refugees arrived (Lang, 2002). The Thai Royal Government has a long and ge nerous history of accepting large volumes of displaced people from Indo-China over the years despite not signing the UN Refugee Conve ntion or Protocol. This is diplomatically expedient in that while not acknowledging the reasons why Burmese flee into Thailand, they can continue a business relationship with the generals of the Union of Myanmar (Rajah, 1990). This was recently further endorsed by signing the Joint Statement Stressing the Strengthening of the Economic Cooperati on among the four Countries in Bagan in November 2003 (Ministry of Foreign Affairs & Union of Myanmar, 2003). Internally disp laced Burmese Prior to moving across national borders people spend varying amounts of time displaced within their own country. Th erefore the terminology internally and externally displaced refers to the location and movement of the people in relation to a national border. This is the case in Burma. The Global IDP Database (Global IDP Database, 2001) records the re asons for displacement, patt erns of dispersal, human rights abuses, approximate numbers and th e needs of the people concerned. Their compiled sources originate from Amnest y International, va rious human rights organisations, parliamentary statements, th e International Labour Organisation, the Burmese government in exile (NCGUB) and statements from the United Nations. 68 Figure 6 UNHCR Refugee Population Map 2004 69 Information regarding the predicament of intern al refugees is clearl y difficult to verify. The Norwegian Refugee Council (Global IDP Database, 2001) estimates that some 600,000 to a million people are hounded and homeless within their own country and a steady number form the groups that flow in Thailand. 28 The Shan, Karen, Karenni, Mon and Rakhine peoples are most affecte d. Skidmore (2003) has also noted the displacement of Burmans for 'development' purposes in Rangoon. The Burmese military junta's internal polic ies force large segments of the population to move out of urban and rural areas, so m e o f w h o m e n t e r T h a i l a n d . B u r m e s e become internally displaced due to the pressure applied by the SPDC and the use of military force against ethnic minority groups or minority religious groups (particularly Christians and Muslims) in the name of national unity (B amforth, Lanjouw, & Mortimer, 2000; Karen Huma n Rights Group, 2002; Lang, 2002; Shan Human Rights Foundation, 1998; United States Department of State, 2001). The military might of the SPDC has grown exponentially despite 17 ceasefire agreements between previously armed groups since 1989 (Selt h, 1996). There are an estimated 400,000 SPDC troops in a country that is not thre atened by any neighbour. Only the Karen (Karen National Liberation Army), the Shan (Shan State Army) and the Mon (Hongsawatoi Restoration Party) remain arme d and rebellious. Ci vilians are often the focus of military brutality by the SPDC who aim to cut of f any support that civilians may offer to insurgents as well as to send a strong message of terror (Apple, 1998; Shan Human Rights Foundation & Shan Wome n's Action Network, 2002). The Four Cuts is a well documented policy used by the SPDC since 1999 to undermine resistant groups; cut the supply of food, funds; recrui ts and intelligence information (Lang, 2002). This is done brutally and systema tically whereby civili ans are robbed, raped, beaten, tortured and murdered. There are horrific accounts of hum an rights abuses (Amnesty International, 2002; Peterse n, Lykke, Hougen, Skehan, 2000; UNICEF, 2002). Forced labour and forced relocation are methods of dispersing populations (Global IDP Database, 2001). 28 Other sources in the Global IDP Database report two million internally displaced people while the UNHCR Statistical Yearbook 20 01did not record an y refugees, asylum seekers or internally displaced people from Burma/ Myanmar - only 283 returned refugees (Global IDP Database, 2001); (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 2002:58). 70Villagers typically move away from approaching soldiers and hide in the jungle. Without access to basic human needs such as clean water, a supply of food, housing, health care and security, people suffer a range of health problems. Often they do not survive. In sum, the borderlands of Tak province in Thailand are home to a diverse and unknown number of people. The bo rder, an invention of col onial geo-politics, divides the Karen people who are found on both sides. The Burmese Karen have formed an armed resistance against the SPDC, and they provide much of the infrastructure in health and welfare to the for ced migrants from Burma. In the opening quote of this chapter, Hazel Lang points out the permeability of the border and the opportunities it offers, but with opportunities are also f ound risk. Many thousands of Burmese leave Burma for a variety of reasons and cross th e border by road-bridge, boat or track. The majority arrive assisted by Thai and Burmese traffickers undocumented and considered 'illegal'. The living location de termines the label given, so if a Burmese person goes into a refugee camp they are te rmed temporarily displaced by the Thai and refugees by the international communit y, while other Burmese who work in the factories and farms are called migrant workers. Mae Sot town and rural area is a vibrant economic hub on the bo rder and relies on the migr ant workers' labour. Migrant workers are cheaper than Thai work ers, they are an unlimited supply, they are often docile and fearful after living under a military regime and their rights in Thailand are often abused with impunity. The health of migrant workers is put at risk by the unregulated work practices that are common and their movement is restricted. Even documented migrant workers are ' bonded' to their Thai employer in the province. Citizenship is marg inal and protection from harass ment or violence is often not available and corruption by authorities common. 71Chapter 3 Method My argument is that scientific work re quires passion. Particularly in the social science we must examine what we are passionate about, and how our passions influence our work (Leslie 1990:912 from Nichter & Lock, 2002). Theoretical and methodological approach A global meeting coordinated by the Popula tion Council in 1998 called for qualitative research on women's perceptions of in complete abortion and unwanted pregnancy and the interrelationship of contraception a nd abortion, as well as the involvement of men in the process (Population Council, 1998). Huntington's (1999) publication demonstrated the variety of research met hods utilised by researchers working in operations research to improve post-abortio n care. Traditional midwives were also included as research subjects who provided post-abortion services to women (Billings et al., 1999). As indicated elsewhere, little is known about Burmese women's experience of unwanted pregnancy a nd abortion and trad itional 2002; Caouette et al., 2000). This study describes and explains some of these phenomena on the Thai- Burma border by using a combination of public health research methods and anthropological approaches. The study desi gn is grounded in clin ical bio-medicine, midwifery, feminism and critical anthropology. Medical anthropological approaches to the st udy of illness, disease and well-being are relatively new. Only four decades old, it focussed initially on the study of ethno- understandings of diseases and medical systems and has over time moved into the 72field of health risks, prevention and harm reduction (Manderson, 2001; Nichter & Lock, 2002). Medical anthropology contextualises and deepens understandings of well-being, illness and disease. While bio-me dicine offers proven cures or treatments, in many cases, the human aspect of the implementation of the 'cure' can fail. 29 The three major theoretical approaches in medical anthropology include medical ecological theory, cultural interpretive theo ry and critical theory (Baer, Singer, & Susser, 1997). Ecological theory is a way of unde rstanding human biology and behaviour as a set of adaptations to the environment. It is apolitical and sees disease as part of nature and not imbued with cultura l qualities. 'Medical systems are seen as utilitarian social response s to intrusive natural condi tions' (Baer et al., 1997:22). Cultural interpretive theory centres on meaning and s uggests that 'disease is knowable, by both sufferers and healers alike, only thr ough a set of interpretive activities. These activities involve an interac tion of biology, social practices, and culturally constituted frames of meaning... and result in the constr uction of 'clinical realities' (Baer et al., 1997:25). Again systems of power are not seen as important. Critical medical anthropology, a term used by Baer a nd Singer in 1982, focuse s on the political economy and attempts to analyse disease a nd treatment within the context of the global capitalist system. It draws upon Marxist theory, the Frankfurt School, C Wright Mills and Foucault, to argue for the significance of powers within institutions, nations and globalisation pro cesses. So it becomes impor tant to ask how power is expressed in the social relations of vari ous groups and individuals and to question what influence the political economy has on health and wellbeing. In building on the approach, Scheper-Hughes ca lls for a path between simply applying Marxist economic theory to medical systems a nd the individualisi ng, meaning-centred discourse of Scheper- Hughes' 'mindful body' delineates the link between the political economy and the physical body (Scheper-Hughes & Lock, 1987). Similarly Kleinman (1995) provides an example of the connections between pow er and ill-health in the forms of post- traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain or body dysfunction as an expression of 29 See Manderson's (Manderson, Almedom, Gitte lsohn, Helitzer-Allen, & Pelto, 1996) page 3 argument concerning the control of the HIV pandemic where bio-medicine offers no cure or even chronic management in the developing world and where prevention and behavioural interventions are the only methods of limiting the impact of the virus. 73resistance to power, which is then medi calised, pacified a nd treated by health professionals. Rylko-Bauer (1996) notes the situated mo rality and understandings of abortion that women develop in relation to their particular lived experi ences. While pregnancy is not a disease, maternal morbidity and mo rtality from unsafe abortions should be studied in this holistic and inclusive wa y. Feminist research for women by women and the emergence of critical anthro pology (Reinharz, 1992; Scheper-Hughes, 1992) goes some way to the production of inclusive s ituated political research. In this study, I sought women's perspectives, meanings an d understandings; gi ving them priority over other competing voices such as male co mmunity leaders or Christian or Buddhist theology (Clare & Hamilton, 2003; Maynard & Purvis, 1994). Local health resources, cultural assumptions and the socio-political situation th at impact on reproductive health and specifically unwanted pregnancy are important to consider. Furthermore, notions of citizenship and hu man rights are important to any analysis that intends to be applied, critical and women-centred (Coliver, 1995; Gruskin, 2000; World Health Organization, 2001). Public health or population based hea lth focuses on the community and the environment, and the promotion of well-b eing to prevent illness. McMichael & Beaglehole (2000:495) consider pu blic health to be the 'art and science of preventing disease, promoting health and extending life through the organised efforts of society'. It also encompasses the underlying social and behavioural determinants of health inequalities and takes into account the natural environmen t. Political, social and material aspects of society are considered important in shaping health. Allotey and colleagues (2003) and Carballo & Ner ukar (2002) make a strong point that globalisation processes have c ontributed to forced migratio n, and the health of forced migrants is directly affected by their disp lacement experience. It is, therefore, not enough to research illness at the endpoint of hospitalisa tion. The methods suggested for capturing the complexity required in this type of research include interviews, focus groups, questionnaires/surveys, ca se histories and life historie s. Numerical (etic) data from medical records can complement the emic data gained from interviews. Triangulating data can provide checks on validity as well as 'illuminate', 'corroborate', and 'elabo rate' the phenomena under & Bandyopadhyay, 2001). Several au thors situate reproductive health and abortion in the arena of public health as a place where it can be better understood and where a community or population focus can impr ove the health of many (Marge Berer, 2000; K. Burns et al., 2000; Goodyear & McGinn, 1998; Program for Appropriate Technology in Health & PATH, 1999 ; Waldman & Martone, 1999). Study design I spent three months from November 2001 to January 2002 on initial consultations and medical record reviews. After returning to Melbourne I analysed the data and travelled to Thailand in June 2002 to begin the intervie ws. I left Thailand in January 2003 after spending a total of 10 months coll ecting data. I returned in July 2004 to review the findings and recommendations with the Burmese and Thai health workers and hand them a final report. The study de sign combines quantit ative and qualitative methods of data collection a nd analysis, and sought to co operate with the research goals of the Mae Tao Clinic. During 2001, a large scale intervention in maternal mortality prevention and improved reproductive health services was commenced at the Mae Tao Clinic, funded and assisted by the Women's Comm ission for Refugee Women and Children. The Women's Commis sion project planned to improve the physical facilities, monitor and evaluate quality of care and introduce technical improvements in post-abortion care after findi ng that there were many deficiencies in the ability to provide emergency obstetr ic care and especia lly post-abortion care (Reproductive Health in Conflic t Consortium, 2004). I wanted to cooperate with this project but offer a unique pe rspective: that of the woman, her partner, and the traditional providers of reproductive health services. I wanted to not only do hospital- based work but go outside the facility to where the women lived and where most of the abortions were occurring. The result transcends the boundaries of nati onality and health systems, as data were collected from Thai and Burmese controlle d organisations which generally do not share information with each other except on th e most superficial le vel. Nor is there usually inclusion of the perspect ives of patients or lay hea lth workers. I felt that it was very important that the Burmese co mmunity be involved in the process of 75research partly because I knew that the findings and recommendations would be more likely to be transformed into action and policy, but it was also a political idea of demystifying research. In Making Our Research Useful (Rylko-Bauer, Van Willigen, & MeElroy, 1989) the authors s uggest strategies to ensure that the research findings are applied, such as feed-back to the co mmunity, presenting findings in the language of the user, identifying decision makers an d lobbying for the res earch findings to be implemented. I consciously built this de sign into the research study, and produced two preliminary unpublished reports for the di rectors of both health facilities in non- academic English that were distributed to selected community leaders after each phase of the research. I also initiated and part icipated in feedback sessions for women's groups, political organisations and health workers (Burmese and Thai) and wrote several articles for community health workers and activists which were published in locally available material (Belton, 2002, 2003; Belton & [as Ma Suu San], 2002). I also contributed to the Women's Report Card (Alternative Asean Network on Burma, 2003). In 2004, Dr Cynthia Maung and I wrote the report Working Our Way Back Home: Fertility and pregnancy loss on the border of Thailand (Maung & Belton, 2004) in English and obtain ed funds to have it tr anslated into Burmese. 30 We also published in Forced Migration Review (Belton & Maung, 2004). During the field work I discussed my thoughts with the sta ff involved with this programme; this was not a one-way process as the preliminary fi ndings often raised questions for further exploration or directed the ne xt phase of the research. The following table gives an overview of the types of data collected, the participants, recruitment techniques used and the research methods. 30 We were asked not to mention the word 'Burma' in the report by our Thai colleagues as they feared a poor reaction from Thai readers and asked us to use the formal Union of Myanmar. We conceded by changing the title and not mentioning either name for the land between Thailand, India and China. Most of these publications can be viewed online at http://www.burmalibrary.org/ 76Table 7 Overview of data collection Participants and data Recruitment technique Quantity Research Method Community leaders, women's groups, Burmese & Thai organisations and key informants in Thailand Word of mouth (sticky rice) Professional contact via letters, conferences and introductions Reading literature 12 Informal discussions and semi-structured interview Observation and participation Women with a pregnancy loss or who are patients at the Mae Tao Clinic or Mae Sot General hospital Word of mouth (sticky rice) Introductions by key informants Secondary data from NGOs Medical records 196 Mae Tao Clinic 36 Mae Sot General hospital Interviews 26 Mae Tao Clinic 17 Mae Sot General hospital 17 other NGO Free lists 70+ Observation Free lists & pile sorts Retrospective and current medical records review Semi-structured interview Informal discussion Male partner's of women admitted to the Clinic Permission given by female partner Introduction by key informants 10 Observations Review of wife's medical record Informal discussion Lay community health workers Introduction by key informants Word of mouth (sticky rice) 20 Observation Semi-structured interview and group discussions Bio-medical trained health workers Word of mouth (sticky rice) Introductions by key informants Purposive sampling 20 50 (survey) Observation Semi-structure interview Informal discussion Survey Community life Ten months of field research on site as well as previous work experience Observation and participation in daily life Multiple secondary data such as photographs, annual reports, health education pamphlets, posters, market m edicines, abortion sticks etc Observation and participation in daily life 77Entry to the community and researcher identity The anthropologist's ri te of passage 'entry into field' was largely a non-event. From 1998 to 1999 I worked with an indige nous Burmese women's non-government organisation on a health project and alr eady knew the border area and the Mae Tao Clinic staff well. During this time I lived in Chiangmai and trav elled every month to the Mae Tao Clinic to assist them to provi de education and training for health workers and develop health education resources. My partner, a physiotherap ist, volunteered at the Mae Tao Clinic working with landmine casualties during this time. This was my original entry into the community. I return ed to Thailand on a short-term consultancy to review some of the projects funded by an Australian non-government organisation in 2000, and this expanded my already subs tantial networks. With well established links and local knowledge, I had a smooth transition into this part of the border to begin the research in 2002. When I expl ained to Dr Cynthia Maung via email and telephone that I wanted to return to work w ith her, she welcomed me and sent a letter of support. When I got to the research site, I was warm ly greeted and Dr Cynthia held my hand as we walked around the clinic compound together chatting as if I had never been away. Many of the health workers remembered me and friendships were re-established. I was initially offered the job to coordinate the traditional birth attendants' programme. I declined and explained the purpose of the PhD and offered to study an area that they felt was a priority in women's health. I began by asking permission to look through the medical records and sit and observe the Reproductive Health Out-Patient Department. My previous job had never rea lly allowed time to just sit and watch as I always had busy deadlines. The transition fr om aid worker to researcher was not too difficult. The level of participant observation, I woul d argue is qualitatively different for the bio-medically qualified researcher. Nurs ing and midwifery training promotes a particular clinical gaze and valuable insi der knowledge. Patient's presentations or complaints could be clinical ly interpreted or verified. Women who looked pale or jaundiced or infected could be detected th rough my own clinical judgements, as well as by confirmation with Burmese health workers or the medical casenotes. 78 Plate 9 Naw Htoo, senior health worker (left) and Dr Cynthia Maung, coordinator of Mae Tao Clinic (2003) Plate 10 Medical records building with a poster of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi -Mae Tao Clinic (2003) 79I felt reasonably comfortable to consider my own diagnosis or interpretation and at times challenged the label given by another he alth worker. For example, I asked one female Burmese health worker who was removing foetal tissue with sponge forceps from a haemorrhaging woman's uterus w ithout analgesia, if her patients ever experienced shock (in the medical sense of an increasing pulse rate and respirations, drop in blood pressure, conf usion) during these perfuncto ry D&Cs. She replied she never had this problem. The patient was cl early not only in pain but also clinical shock, indicated by her pale, sweating face, cold extremities and fast respirations. I offered to take her blood pressure for the health worker while she continued and when we both noted the falling pressure, she aske d me to increase the saline drip. We did not need to discuss it further. In another case, during a D&C where I was the torch holder, the health worker brushed her sponge forceps into the pa tient's bowel motions and was about to reintroduce the sponge forcep s into the uterus, an easy mistake to make where there is no overhead light-sour ce, nor lithotomy couch to position the patient for this special procedure. I interv ened and helped her ge t fresh clean ones to continue but I wonder if non-medically trai ned researchers would have noticed this detail? Some may argue that I was t oo interventionist but these were also ethical dilemmas - how could I have not intervened, and simply observed a patient sinking into preventable shock or experiencing a painfu l pelvic infection that could potentially damage her future fertility? I also found it useful to be able to offer some competent contraceptive advice to women who agreed to be interviewed, and who through the course of the interview, demonstrated their lack of knowledge of modern contraceptives and a desire to limit their fe rtility. But medicine's hegemonic ontology can be a block and must not obstruct the anthropological imagin ation. I am both midwife and researcher and my research re flects both of these passions. To straddle both disciplines and work at the marg in can be insightful, as Kleinman (1995:3) reflects: I occupy the margin not out of a refusal to choose sides, but because I am bound to both, and at the point of their engagement, in order to discover what they are (or are not) and I am, or am not. Hence, the margins I seek are unfinished, even already overstepped, and become something altogeth er different out of interaction. 80Research Methods Perti and Gretel Pelto (1996) suggest that many of the methods used by medical anthropologists are theory-free, used much like a set of tools by different types of social scientists. They say that possi bly the most identif ying feature of an anthropologist is the wide-ranging na ture of the information collected: Compared to most other disciplines, th e hallmark of anthropology, medical anthropology included, is the so-called holis tic approach. This takes many forms, but in most research there is the assumption that for any particular outcome or phenomenon to be explained, there are a gr eat many interrelated factors at work. In practice, this means that medical anthropologi sts are likely to collect a great deal of data about economic features, social rela tionships, cultural belief systems, political processes, and other aspects of a community, even if the research intention is focused on a specific health question. This holistic perspective often leads anthropologist to be highly critical of other disciplines when they appear to adopt single-factor explanations or seemingly simple explan ations for illness conditions, health are responses, and other issues (P. J. Pelto & Pelto, 1996:301). My aim was to not only to collect bio-medi cal data but also cultu ral, political, social, economic, religious and historic informati on, as well as information from women, men and their health workers. I did this using the following tools. Retrospective medical record review After observing several reproductive health outpatient clinics (O PD) and watching the recording process I conducted a retrospect ive review of all wo men who attended the OPD during 2001. One hundred and ninety-six records from Mae Tao Clinic (OPD) and 36 records of women referred to the M ae Sot General Hospital were examined. Each consultation in OPD is recorded in a medical record document and a daily log book. Each woman receives a unique number and her medical record is stored for future reference at the Mae Tao Clinic. I reviewed the daily log books with the unique identifying number and recalled the me dical records of wo men with any type of abortion diagnosis such as vaginal/ ut erine bleeding, suspected induced abortion, spontaneous abortion, threatened, incomplete , missed, or septic abortion, perforated uterus or other abdominal or pelvic injury. All referrals to the Mae Sot Hospital due to complications from abortion are also recorded and these women's records were recalled from the hospital system after discussion with Thai staff. This method supplied vast amounts of demographic and bi o-medical data but as researchers found 81in Ghana, records are not always traceable, intact or accurate (Allotey & Reidpath, 2000). The biomedical data collected from each medical record included; the identifying code number, her age, the general area she li ved such as Mae Sot town, a rural area or Burma, her pregnancy and birth outcomes, the death of any ch ildren, the diagnosis given by the staff, the method of induced a bortion, gestation of the current pregnancy, marital status and ethnic background. I also recorded subsequent visits recorded for the one diagnosis, medical interventions su ch as blood tests, medicines given, dilatation and curette, and referrals. Most written information was in medical English in both the Burmese and Thai medical records. I asked staff, and later research assistants, to translate Burmese or Thai words. The vast majority of medi cal records were available and provided a quantitative account of women presenting with a pregnancy loss to the Mae Tao Clinic as well as those women who were so unwell as to need further treatment at the local Mae Sot General Hospital in 2001. Naw Rose and Saw Blessing - research assistants Initially I worked for three months without research assistants as I was able to interview many people in English language. Naw Rose joined me first and Saw Blessing much later. Meeting Rose and havi ng her as the main research assistant for six months, enabled me to enter further in to the community and to demystify some aspects of community life that I would never have been able to understand without her. I met Rose in the rebel base inside Burm a on Karen Revolution Day where she looked me directly in the eye and told me that fore igners 'sucked' and th ey were only here to get what they wanted and not help the Kare n people. She also went on to talk about men's dreadful attitude towards women. Rose is naturally analytical and critical in her thinking and not typical of many women. She is not shy and is able to discuss difficult issues frankly. She is also a warm and co mpassionate young woman. I was lucky that she wanted to work as a research assistant on this st udy. Rose had grown up in Burma and her family were involved in the Karen struggle for autonomy. Her mother is Christian and her father Muslim and she identifies herself as Christian 82Karen. After her father's death her family escaped to Thailand where she lived in one of the refugee camps along the border. She only completed her e ducation to year ten of high school as further education in th e camps is not possibl e. Like many young Karen women she left the camp to work illegally in Thailand. She spent some time in Bangkok working as a maid but returned to the border to work for her people and marry her husband. Rose undertook her week -long training in my house which built on her natural abilities and some previous work experience in co llecting interviews. After her training, some months later, we recruited Saw Blessing, a Karen male health worker, and Rose took on the responsibility of training him. Sa w Blessing, a married man in his thirties, enabled us to collect interviews from men and had worked in a factory in Mae Sot before he became a skilled and sensitive health worker. Free listing, pile sorting and ranking Free listing, pile sortin g and ranking are common re search techniques used by anthropologists and public he alth researchers to gain large amounts of information generated from local indigenous knowledge w ithout the predetermi ned assumptions of the researcher (Bencha 2001; Trotter, 1991). I used this method early in the research process to learn local terms a nd to generate data and topics for further investigation. This technique can be used with women who have low education le vels (Ross et al., 1998) and we often 'played word games' with women who were illiterate. Women who attended the Mae Tao Clin ic (OPD) were invited to 'play word games' while they waited for their appointments or to stay and play after they had been seen by the local staff. As this provided some inte resting 'entertainment ' while waiting, the women were often keen to play. Ten pre gnant women who attended for antenatal care were asked to list, 'What do pregnant women do to look after their h ealth?' and a further 13 women who attended for other reasons were asked, 'How can a woman control her fertility?' Information such as the number of children, religion, house location and whether the woman was currentl y married were collected, consent was gained from a verbal explanation and no name s were recorded. We specifically told women that no answer was 'wrong' and we were happy to hear their opinions. 83Additionally 50 traditional midwife trai ners from Karen State in Burma who participated in a skills workshop were also asked to list methods of fertility control. Burmese lay midwives from urban and rural ar eas in Thailand also generated free-lists, and as they were often i lliterate or had no common written language, pictures were used rather than words. Semi-structured Interviews After observing and interacti ng in the field site for se veral months, reviewing the medical records and employing a research as sistant, interviewing began. Women in- patients, their male partners', health workers and community members were interviewed either by semi-structured inte rviews or informal conversations. I developed the interview schedules for the women and the health workers and later the men (See Appendices C, D ,E). Topics were developed fr om the literature, medical record findings and with suggestions from the staff of Mae Tao Clinic. Rose ensured the questions could be asked in Karen and Burman languages as well as checking that they flowed from topic to to pic. We invited the staff at the Mae Tao Clinic to review our interview drafts and received feedback from them which we incorporated into the schedules. After purposively recruiting the informants and interviewing them privately, taking notes by hand, Rose and I would return to my house and sit on the veranda with fried bananas and peanuts to transcribe the words. Most interviews la sted one hour and it would take Rose and I another one to two hours per interview to translate and transcribe into the laptop computer. Rose would read her Burman or Karen notes back to me translated into English apart from the words she did not know. Together we would turn it into 'beautiful English' with the help of a Burmese-English medical dictionary. The interview transcripts were returned to the health workers and some other literate individuals for corrections, but this was not done with the patients or their partners. 84In the Mae Sot General Hospital Together with the Thai nurses and obstetrician, we agreed on how to recruit the women. Rose and I visited the Mae Sot Ge neral Hospital for several months before discharge time at 11am. The nurses would inform us who was due to go home that day and their diagnosis. All forms of pr egnancy loss prior to 24 weeks were of interest, except threatened abortion and therefore spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, incomplete, septic, 'criminal' abortions, perfor ations and other complications of abortion were consider ed (See figure 9). The recruitment was purposive and not random. The nurse or Ro se would give the woman the statement about the nature of the research (See Appendix B) written in Burman, Sgwa-Karen and English and the women were left alone for ten minutes to read and think. A few women who could not read asked their fema le neighbour in the next bed what the paper said and once they understood it, agre ed, and if they fitte d the criteria, we accepted them to be interviewed. If the woman agreed to the interview, we walked with her to the private interview room. Ro se would then explain further to gain an informed consent. In the Mae Tao Clinic Working in the Mae Tao Clinic was easier and the staff knew us well. We visited the Mae Tao Clinic every morning except S unday after we had gone to the Mae Sot General Hospital and asked the senior heal th worker if any woman was due to go home or was well enough to be interviewe d. The Burmese-Karen staff would talk with the woman and explain our research a nd if the woman agreed to be interviewed she came with us to a private room. The criteria was any woman who had experienced a pregnancy loss prior to se ven months (28 weeks); missed abortion, spontaneous abortion, incomplete, septic and induced abortions were accepted. Women with threatened aborti on were not to be included. In all interviews with women in both the hospital and clinic, demographic information was collected and the women were asked a se ries of questions. The topics included their migration process, work conditions , living arrangements , health history, experiences' as a patient, reasons why th ey came to the health service, their understandings of what was happening to their body, fertility -related issues, relationship issues and feeli ngs of fear and insecurity. 85Figure 7 Types of abortion - flow chart Figure 8 Types of abortion - schematic diagram 86Informed consent was collected verbally for every interview for several reasons. The majority of people interviewed were undoc umented and could be deported by Thai authorities at whim. In this insecure envir onment, I felt it was unf air to expect people to put their names on paper as a permanent record. Another reason was that many people can not read or write a nd it seemed a rather intimid ating process. Consent was collected verbally prior to interviews in the appropriate language. Seven women in total declined to talk with us when they were in-patients in the hospital or clinic setting. The interviews were completed by Rose, w ho took notes, while I sat in the room and observed the woman's reactions and body language. At the end of each interview, Rose gave me a summary and I had time to re ad the medical records. If there was a discrepancy between what the woman said and the medical record, we would probe with furthering questioning. Confusing poi nts were clarified and statements of interest were followed-up at this point. Women sometimes asked us to mediate between the Burmese staff and themselves, espe cially in relationship to contraception. During some interviews we found that wo men were not happy with the contraceptive method suggested by the health worker a nd women would ask us to speak on their behalf to change their contraception. As we found that many women disclosed domestic violence, we also gave informa tion and asked permission from the women to inform the staff. Once Saw Blessing starte d working with us, we asked permission to interview the husband. Male partners Men are frequently not included in reproductiv e health research and this is a serious limitation (Huntington & Piet-Pelon, 1999). Researchers are beginning to seek the views of men on topics such as attitudes to all types of contraception, choice and use of methods, desired family size and potenti al use of reproductive health services (Akinrinola Bankole & Susheel a Singh, 1998; Biddlecome, Cast erline, & Perez, 1997; Petro-Nustas, 1999), and there is trend for h ealth policy makers and health workers to want the inclusion of men in relation to family planning, to 'take responsibility' (Thompson, 2000). Thompson outlines the c ounter argument put forward by Mexican women: 87Given that men are the ones who have control over most areas of life external to the home it is not surprising to find that, for women, keeping men out of domains where they have some control is a way of ensuring that they maintain it. Women do not want men to undermine the often limited power they have in the family sphere (Thompson, 2000:237). Inviting men to be more responsible in their sexual lives, while leaving women the control of reproductive decisi ons, without the interference of men, is a fine balance. This gendered negotiation of power in se xual relations and its connection between who controls family planning is linked with unwanted pregnancy and abortion. We found it difficult to recruit male partners for several reasons. As all the women reported being 'married' (being single and pregnant is shameful), the men were referred to as 'husbands' never 'boyfriends' by the women, staff and by myself. Certainly most of the women interviewed were in long-term relationships either de facto or de jure . We only trained Saw Blessing, our male research assistant, late in the research timeline and so our ability to recruit men was limited. It was not possible to recruit men at the Mae Sot General Hospital as the visiting times were strictly enforced and the ward did not welcome relatives. The Mae Tao Clinic was the opposite. Mothers, sisters, friends, chil dren and husbands accompanied women and cared for them during hospitalisation bu t not all women want ed their husband involved in the research process. We in terviewed the woman alone first and at the end of the interview asked if another re searcher, who would not have any knowledge of her story, could interview her husband. Me n sometimes declined to be interviewed even when their wife invited them to participate. We interviewed ten male partners on issues such as life and work in Thaila nd, general health, desired family size, thoughts about contraception and abortion, and their relationship with their wife. Out of our sample of ten men, half of their wives had experienced a pregnancy loss and the other five wives had given birth. Health workers and 'sticky rice' Burmese lay health workers and Burmese, Thai and foreign bi o-medically trained health workers were interviewed. We were only interested in health workers experienced with reproductive h ealth. Male and female work ers, junior and senior, as well as lay community health workers were interviewed. We approached health workers in the reproductive OPD and IPD sections of the Mae Tao Clinic. Key 88informants such as local women or Burmese health workers provided us with contacts to lay midwives, who then introduced us to abortionists in both th e town and the rural area. This non-random purposive sampling was glossed the 'sticky rice method' and is very similar to snowball sampling. This term developed when I was teaching Rose our research methods and snowba lls seemed very inappropriate in the tropical climate. Sticky rice is a delicious type of glutinous rice that takes several hours of preparation by soaking the rice overnight and then stea ming it in banana leaves - as the name suggests the grains of hot rice stick well together and are roll ed into little balls before eating. This was how we recruited wo men in the community, most of the lay midwives and eventually the abortionist s, through long patient conversations and visits, meeting each woman who in turn took us to the next. We recruited in town as well as thirty to forty kilometres out of town. Focus groups Focus groups are another tool in the kitbag of social sciences which have the benefit of being able to speak with larger number s of people, observing the interactions and dialogues between participants (Bencha Yoddumnern-Attig et al., 1993; Trotter, 1991). While focus group participants are generally required to be relatively homogenous (See Chapter 20 in Bencha Yoddumnern-Attig & Attig and colleagues), I asked male and female, young and mature lay midwives to meet together. I wanted to better understand gender differences and the historical changes for lay midwives. Sticky rice recruiting was used to bring 15 la y midwives together for directed group discussions on topics of thei r local knowledge, family, desi red family size, midwifery craft, modern and traditional family planning methods and abortion. The focus groups were also useful in identifying pa rticular midwives who were knowledgeable on certain subjects or who were confident a nd willing to speak. We often invited these particularly knowledgeable and articulate mi dwives to further individual interviews. In summary, 43 women with a pregnancy loss, 10 husbands, 20 Burmese bio-medicine trained health workers, 15 lay midwives, and 12 other community members agreed to be interviewed. A local NGO that had interviewed sex-workers donated 89their findings to this study to be include d in the results, adding another seventeen transcripts of women talking about abortion and family planning themes.31 Language issues As I lived in Thailand from 1997 to 1999, I speak and understand basic Thai. I feel confident dealing with daily activities such as shopping, making pleasant small talk with neighbours, finding directions and some interaction with Thai health workers. This was of little use with the Burmese co mmunity in exile, as few learn Thai even after years of living in Thailand. The north ern Burmese language of the Shan is the most similar to northern Thai, but the pe ople I was working with originated mostly from Karen State, Mon State and the Rangoon delta region of Burma. The Burmese community with which I worked spoke English, Burmese, several Karen languages (the most common being Sgaw) and in some cases Mon. The male and female Karen research assistants both s poke English, Sgaw Karen and Burmese and they relied on me to communicate in Thai. Certainly not being fluent in either Burmese or Karen limited my interaction with some people. There is always a frustration when communication is not spontaneous and natura l for both interviewer and interviewee. It slows down the two-way dialogue into a three-way exchange. Probably the only advantage of the three-way approach to communication is that it allows time for considered responses and focussed discussi on. My role during interviews developed over time. I wanted a 'natur al' conversation style during the interviews with women and their husbands, so the research assistants followed the interview questions as they deemed appropriate, and my role became to listen to the interaction, checking and noting the pauses, body movements and expres sions of emotions. By learning key words I was able to follow the topic under discussion but not the detailed content. Only after the research assistant summarised the findings of the interview did we enter the three-way dialogue approach. Data were collected in English, Thai, Burmese, and two Karen dialects. Language and translati on issues changed according to the type of data being collected. 31 A local NGO had conducted interviews with sex-wo rkers in the previous y ear. The transcripts of interviews were very short, not detailed and from the interviewers names I could tell that men had interviewed the women. As I was not a party to the se lection of staff, research training, recruitment of sex-workers, or the interview process I have used this data sparingly. 90Participant observation and anthropology Perti and Gretel Pelto suggest that the three main reasons for initial ethnographic research are to provide locally relevant in formation, to provide baseline data and to identify locally relevant cultural taxonomi es and explanatory models (Pelto & Pelto, 1996). This is where I believe anthropology is unique and at its most valuable in analysing health issues. This type of ethnographic research relies on taking part in and 'living' the research, it is the e ssence of anthropology and so participant observation over extended periods of time is usually necessary.32 I intended from the start to remain for long periods in the field and to join in the daily activities. My aim was not simply to count and classify at arms length but to tr y and understand the pattern of life on the Thai-Burma border that left many women de sperate to end their pregnancies. There is a fundamental question on how the researcher should be involved. Many of the 'key in formants' are my work colleagues, and some I count as friends. This raises questions of objectivity and reflexivity. While I find notions of objectivity in science invalid and positivis t assumptions of a pure rational truth discountable, I do think a healthy self-awareness is essentia l. Reflexivity in presence and research design is important. I am awar e that I am intrinsically a part of the research process; I generated the questions, sought clarifications during the interview, chose the quotes from subjects and interpre ted the meaning. But how does a social scientist step outside of 'sel f'? Scheper-Hughes (1994:28) says: We cannot rid ourselves of the cultural self we bring with us into the field, any more than we can disown the eyes and ears and skin through which we take our intuitive perceptions about the new and the strange worl d we have entered. We struggle to do the best we can with the limited resources we have to hand - our ability to listen and observe carefully, with empathy and compassion. 32 Both the Peltos (P. J. Pelto & Pelto, 1996) and Manderson and associates (Manderson et al., 1996) discuss rapid ethnographic data collection techniques and the inclusion of these type of data collection in other study designs. 91Plate 11Purchasing abortifacients and cont raceptives at the Ma e Sot market (2002) Plate 12 Mae Tao Clinic health worker te aches family planning to a couple (2003) 92She goes on to say we must record what we see and give voice to the voiceless.33 This is not to say that another researcher with similar assumptions would not find the same results. By the use of data and method triangulati on, checking back with the original people who requested the research, and checking with other informed readers, I believe my representation to be accurate. Field notes, informal inte rviews and conversations The anthropologist approaches every conve rsation and daily activity, as a potential source of data. It is a v oyeuristic method of research. There were times during the research when I was introduced to some one who was clearly knowledgeable in a certain area relevant to the research and this was not always apparent before the conversation began. In these cases I had conversations where I asked questions and learned important new information in a conversation style rather than formal interview. Depending on the situation, I would either write the conversation down after leaving the person or take out my notebook and record point s in front of the person. As I lived in simple surroundings with very limited night-time attractions, I had plenty of time to go over my notes and record them on my lap-top computer. My field-notes often consisted of a daily record of work, future work plans, new ideas, fragments of conversations with people, wr itten sketches of cer tain locations and accounts of special occasions. I would have conversations with the market vendors about their medicinal products and I would purchase samp les. Often Rose and I would find a street stall or teashop in the shade and then recall the events and fragments of conversations and write them in our notebooks. An example was meeting key community peopl e such as the union organiser. He was well known in the community and often followed and harassed by the Thai police, due to his high profile in representing the Bu rmese workers (Aung Su Shin, 2003b; Kyaw Zwa Moe, 2003, 2004; Network Me dia Group, 2004). I did not want to meet him in a very public place as this would have put Rose and me in danger. We met him at the tea shop inside the com pound at the Mae Tao Clinic with notebooks in hand, and 33 See also Pathologies of Power: Health, human rights and the new war on the poor (Farmer, 2003) a medical doctor and anthropologist who writes about TB and other illness in Haiti, Peru and Russia from a social justice perspective. 93openly interviewed him. The tea shop is a public space but is not frequented by members of the Thai community. I introduced myself to most people as a nurse who was doing research for Doctor Cynthia, so very few people would have b een 'deceived', although I am not sure that people realised that every invitation to eat , go to wedding, see a da nce, participate in temple rituals, or 'help' at the clinic was being analysed for fragments of new information. Difficulties and complexities It would be a rare study that went according to plan, and the challenges Thailand and the border area provided were numerous. The most salient to this study are the nature of the topic of illegal abortion which is highly sensitive, the instab ility and insecurity of the Burmese community, and the heighten ed tension between Burma and Thailand at the time of the research which altered timelines and access to informants. Other issues such as the multiple languages, confid entiality in the field, requests for help and the potential for danger are not unco mmon to other researchers (Abuduhou, 2003; Nichter, 2002; Scheper-Hughes, 1992). Secret and illegal The topic of abortion is highly personal and sensitive, and it is unlikely to spontaneously appear in natural conversat ions between relative strangers without some trigger. Moreover, where abortion is not legal, it is further shrouded. The question for the researcher is how to elicit information about a generally secret and illegal issue while at the same time remaining professional and ethical. Perhaps my nursing background helped my faith that this could be studied. Nurses spend much of their training overcoming 'normal' barriers to socially accepted interactions on very private topics. Clinical training involve s desensitising and re-socialising the novice nurse to feel comfortable with what is normally perceived as uncomfortable. I am sure this helped. During my career I have discussed the most intimate health and well-being issues with patients in the privac y of consultations, such as the disclosure of sexuality problems, rape, child abuse, addiction, unwanted pregnancy and domestic 94violence. I was also trained to ask probi ng questions in non-threatening ways. From this perspective, the study of unwanted pregnancy and a bortion, legal or not, did not appear daunting. A further encouragement against apprehension was my familiarity with other researchers' work in cross-cultural situati ons (Chalida Gespradit, 2002; Whittaker, 2002b). Authors share their experiences and insights into collecting this type of information. Huntington and associates (Huntington, Me nsch, & Toubia, 1993) in research in Africa suggest that direct que stioning about abortion is un likely to work and value- free statements are preferred. This was the approach taken in the interview situation. We talked around the topic with questi ons like: Did you understand what was happening to your body; How did your pre gnancy end; How did you feel when the pregnancy ended? These questi ons can be answered in a rang e of levels of disclosure. Chalida Gesradit (2002) discusses a mi xed-method approach, especially when abortion is illegal, and notes that hospitals can be a reliable source of data and surveys are unlikely to elicit a full response. Bl eek (1987:314) candidly says of researchers, 'Interviewers who ask personal questions a bout delicate topics, sometimes with more sense of duty than common sense, force polite informants into lying ones.' He also suggests an indirect approach and feels that longer term relations build trust between the researcher and researched. Yet these cautions do not al ways hold. Thai researcher s collected da ta on abortion from nearly 4,600 women and 787 hosp itals (Nongluck Boonthai & Warakamin Suwanna, 2000). Despite being authorised by the Department of Public Health, they faced obstruction from some private and public hospitals and acknowledge the difficulty in obtaining this type of data in Thailand. An example of a mixed-method approach is Whittaker's work on induced abortion in the northeast of Thailand (Whittaker, 2002b). She combined a randomis ed interview survey with in-depth qualitative data as well as a rich anthr opological knowledge of the local Isaan people over several years. She believes it is possibl e to gain reliable data on abortion while also maintaining the privacy of informants. 95Privacy, confidentiality and anonymity Privacy and anonymity were of utmost importa nce due to the sensitive nature of the topic of fertility and pregnancy loss, a nd because many of the participants were undocumented workers or involv ed in the resistance moveme nt against the SPDC. In public places like hospitals, it is difficult but not impossible to ensure privacy. I also visited people's villages a nd houses and as a Caucasian wo man with red hair, I do not blend into the background. Life on the borde r is lived at very close quarters, often with several families or adults sharing cramped spaces. People and neighbours were always curious and often came to look and listen. Often just waiting patiently, eating the food offered and having small-talk w ould satisfy curiosity, and they would gradually drift away to care for childre n, cook their meals or tend animals. Sometimes we would all sit together and discuss daily life, politics and women's health so even interruptions were informa tive. After twenty minutes or so I would politely ask if I could speak to the informant alone and frequently the neighbours and relatives would leave us in reasonable privacy. In my notebooks I recorded real names but more often a pseudonym in order to protect the privacy of the pe rson. I only ever recorded medical record numbers for patients in the Mae Sot General hospital or the Mae Tao Clinic. Most health workers picked their own pseudonyms. The only name kept in its original is Dr Cynthia Maung with her permission. 34 As she is very well known, it is difficult for me as a researcher to hide her identity, and while sh e is not completely safe in Thailand, there is a very limited risk to her by me mentioning her name or her clinic as it is already widely known in the local and international media. Some of the names of the leaders of the community have not been chan ged as they are also well known. Security and stability The security of the people is always of concern when working with a displaced undocumented group. This means that inform ants can not always travel freely and live in fear of arrest. The Burmese populat ion is often harassed by Thai authorities 34 Dr Cynthia is an international figure who has won several human rights awards and has appeared in television documentaries. She is the subject of several endorsed websites close atte ntion to privacy and security issu es for informants. Staff at the Mae Tao Clinic are at risk of sudden de portation and threats are regularly made (Sanitsuda Ekachai, 2003b) alt hough the Clinic has remained in one location with a relatively stable staff since 1989. I was aware th at the research could stop at any stage. Closed borders During the course of the year, the rela tionship between Thailand and Burma deteriorated which influenced the way the study was conducted There was a border incident in the north where a rebel group was repelling the SPDC and some shells landed inside Thailand (Supamart Kasem 2002). The Thai army fire d back with smoke bombs but later live mortar to indicate their disple asure at the breach of their national sovereignty. This quickly escalated into a national and inter-country incident. The Myanmar junta responded strongly and unilaterally closed th e entire border for eight months. This meant I had to take care where I travelled. During the majority of the fieldwork tensions were high between Burma and Thailand. There was an increase in military activity ne ar the border and shells landed in the rural areas that I had wanted to explore (Supamart Kasem, 2002a, 2002b). I would like to have made contact with rural based hea lth workers and communities sooner but left my recruitment of rural participants to the later stages when tensions were easing. Also, due to the border closure, Mae Sot was noticeably less crowded and the markets were quiet. As at least ten percent of the caseload of th e Mae Tao Clinic and perhaps a similar percentage for the local Mae Sot General Hospital come directly from Burma, this meant less access to informan ts. It is difficult to know how many informants we 'missed' because the borde r was closed. However, we have one reliable account of a Burmese woman who liv ed in Mae Sot who travelled to Burma for her unsafe abortion. Several days late r she returned to Thailand, all while the border was officially closed. 97Dangerous fieldwork This part of Thailand is relatively danger ous due to the low level conflict between insurgent groups, the high military presen ce and cross-border corruption. The Australian Department of Foreign Affa irs travel advice bulletin recommended Australians to be 'cautious,' due to the va rious armed groups operating in the border area.35 I had worked in this area before so felt reasonably confid ent I could maintain my personal safety. Strategies used includ ed careful reading of the national English language newspapers to keep abreast of current local and international news, as well as advice from various informants. This part of the border is very porous and considerable smuggling and i llegal trade in gems, ammun ition, drugs, teak and 2001; Yuwa dee Tunyasiri, 2001). Organised crime, corruption and the associated violent cr ime are prevalent (A ung Su Shin, 2004). Moreover, the Karen National Union is an armed military presence that continues to challenge the Burmese military and aligne d groups in a guerrilla style conflict; consequently the town is a focal point for political dissidents, soldiers, mercenaries, espionage and a Thai military presence. Ha ving said this, violence is most often directed toward the Karen refugees, undocumented workers and trafficked women. 36 Probably the greatest impact on my own expe rience was the high leve ls of paranoia in the town. Newcomers find it difficult to make contacts or find information, and are regarded with suspicion in case they are either a journalist or spy. As I was relatively well known and connected with the Mae Ta o Clinic, this was not an issue. Requests for information, help and reciprocity Rose and I were often struck by women's lack of knowledge about their bodies and, in particular, contraception. At the end of the interview, we often gave women pamphlets (in the appropriate language) on different contraceptive methods, HIV/AIDS and other health information. We spent time with them helping them to understand the Thai health system and shar e information with them on where they could get further assistance with their sp ecific problems. Domestic violence is common and we supported women to make c ontact with the meagre Burmese network of organisations for their pr otection. We were asked for supplies from community 35 Australian Government website http://www.dfat.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/Advice/Thailand [March 2003] 36 During field work one Am erican man, a long term resident of Tak was murdered and one French man 'disappeared' after travelling into Burma. 98health workers who had no soap, gloves or me dicine. We were asked to help with transport to the Mae Tao Clinic, to transl ate for patients in the Mae Sot General hospital when Thai staff could not speak Bu rmese or Karen, to help desperate people apply for asylum to the UNHCR, and to run workshops. We did some of these things but the needs were often overwhelming a nd beyond our capacity to respond to all requests. One ethical dilemma was being asked to pr ocure abortions for wo men. These secret conversations with desperate women also ec ho in the thesis. As the research became known in the community, several women asked my advice on how to end their pregnancy. I knew that Dr Cynthia did not support elec tive abortion and would not like me to promote it in her community. In addition, Thai law is restrictive, and access to Thai networks where abortion could be gained was not open to Burmese women who had limited money and who could not travel. I generally entered into a counselling situation exploring their persona l situation and options. I sent a few women to the Thai obstetrician, but he appeared to follow what he already told me in the interview situation, wh ich was that he did not perform elective abortion. Data management and analysis Field notes were recorded in note books and my laptop co mputer. As already stated, interviews were hand-recorded and then tran slated and transcribed into my computer. I used Atlas ti software (ATLAS.ti Scientif ic Software Development GmbH, 2002) to assist with the management and analysis of all interviews. I read the interviews as hermeneutic units, bundled according to info rmant; woman, man, traditional health worker, bio-medically trained health worker or sex-worker. The interviews and field notes were scanned for themes which were then coded. For example, I read the women's interviews looking for themes and placed all references to 'paid work' or 'abortion method' into sub-units which I th en read across the he rmeneutic units. I used SPSS software (SPSS Inc., 2001) to calcu late numerical data gained from the medical records review and create statisti cal analyses. Charts and graphs were generated from SPSS or Excel software (M icrosoft Corporation, 2000). 99Limitations The major limitation of this study is that most of the women and men who contributed to knowledge about pregnancy loss and induced abortion were recru ited in a hospital setting. The Mae Tao Clinic staff and Thai health workers had a biased view of abortion as they only saw the complicated cases and the women who could reach them through the travel barrier s. In general th ey see the worst outcomes. Probably many women in this area manage their mi scarriage/abortion at home or do not experience severe blood loss, infection or pain at levels that warrant a visit to a health worker. Hospital cases only represent thos e who come to hospital not those who may have stayed at home or visited alternative health services (Pelto & Pelto, 1996). Lay health workers and abortionist s gave some insight into how they manage abortion, but even they may not know if a patient goes to hos pital. It is difficult to imagine how a researcher could make contact with women in this area who had successfully aborted, without complications and who would be willing to discuss it. There is no census, no telephone book, factory dormitories do not allo w researchers to enter, and knocking on people's doors would alar m undocumented residents. The external validity of the study is threaten ed by the selection process in that women were not randomly selected. As there is no definitive test of whether a pregnancy has ended spontaneously or by intention, the e nd product is that women will only tell the 'truth' if they want to a nd this cannot be randomised, except by inte rviewing all women with any type of miscarriage/aborti on. Another limitation with this research are the small numbers which constrain genera lisability, the possibility of compliance and deference to the researcher during formal and informal conversations, the negative effect of group dynamics in focus gr oups and the ability of the interviewer to influence people's responses (Bencha Y oddumnern-Attig et al ., 1993; Judd, Smith, & Kidder, 1991; Robson, 2002). These are al l legitimate criticisms of qualitative research. 100Chapter 4 Borderline Reproductive Health Many more pregnancies are begun that ever co me to fruition. Abortion is as natural, and possibly more prevalent, than birth (Greer, 1984:160). The journey to the border areas and Tha iland is long and dangerous for forced migrants. As the refugees arrive in the camps or at the border areas, humanitarian aid workers record testimonies of human rights ab uses, reports of the deaths of relatives and friends, accounts of landmine injury, rape and high rates of sickness and trauma (Petersen et al., 1998). Checchi, Elder, Shaefer, Drouhin, & Legros (2003) interviewed 244 families from Dooplaya Distri ct, Karen State. Most took two weeks to reach Thailand and a few people up to one month. During the journey women gave birth, some infants and adults died. Thr ee women died but no cause was recorded. In this chapter I focus on the reproductiv e health of Burmese women in the border area and specifically spontaneous and induced abortion. There is a small but specific quantity of literature produced by Thai universities, Thai government departments and NGOs on women's reproductive health along the Thai-Burma border concerned with: high fertility levels; STI/HIV/AIDS; gende r-based violence (GBV); low of sexual health knowledge; lack of appropria te services; unwanted pregnancy and abortion; and rarely female sexual pleas ure. The emphasis is on contaminating diseases and enlarging populations, which are the main concerns of the host population the literature is spatially fixated and uses locational categories to In reality how ever, there is not always a clear distin ction between inside and outside the camp, between ref ugee and migrant worker as people move between camps, work outside of the camps a nd travel to Burma. The distinctions are of limited value. Inside camp In the literature which speci fically deals with women's re productive health, there is no study of abortion inside the camp system ex cept for one master's thesis from Mahidol University titled Miscarriage among displaced people: A case study of Karen women in Tak Province , Thailand (Suksinchai Saowasphak, 1999). She and her female assistants surveyed 900 married women who had lived in the camp for nine years on average. Although Suksinchai Saowasphak did ask about all pregnancy outcomes, she concludes that the women 'hesitate' to respond fully. I met Kuhn Suksinchai as I began my ow n study and she believed induced abortion was too sensitive an issue to get a survey response. Suksinchai found half of the women had never attended school, half we re Christian, 233 reported working outside of camp although this is not allowed, 40% of women had given birth to four or more children and about half smoked tobacco. Her results showed that there were significant amounts of miscarri age, probably due to smoking habits, but also conceded the confounding variables of poverty, prol onged under-nourishment, poor sanitation and inadequate health care may well ha ve influenced pregnancy outcomes. Significantly, she found higher levels of 'm iscarriage' in women who were working outside of camp but did not consider the connection with the women's need to find paid work and the disruption to income -earning potential a birth can bring. In another camp-based survey of 500 men and women, Wassana Im-Em (Wassana Im-Em et al.) found the majority of pe ople living in these camps were Karenni followed by Karen and Shan. About 40% of the people were animists, except in one camp where a large number of people were Karen and were Baptists. Only 33% of the respondents had attended school. Mo st respondents were married with two children on average; half reported wanting f our children. Between 8 to 29% of fertile age women were current users of a fa mily planning method (Guest, Kritaya 102Archanvanitkul, Im-Em et al., 2000). HIV/AIDS in camps has remained low and is perceived to be low ri sk (Guest et al., 2000). Over a period of ten years the Wome n's Commission for Refugee Women and Children has invested in several major fi eld assessments, literature reviews and projects along the Thai-Burma border (Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, 1994, 2000a, 2000b). Wulf wrot e in 1994, 'The ref ugee situation on Thailand's western border is complex and at times confusing' (Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, 1994:57) and wh ile that is still th e case, access to reproductive health services and info rmation in the camps has improved, acknowledgement of gender-based violence in camps has been very slow. Vann's (Vann, 2002) report, Gender-Based Violence: Emerging Issues in Programs Serving Displaced Populations , mainly discusses the situat ions inside camps, although she acknowledges Burmese women living outside the camp system in Thailand, and notes the lack of protection provided to women and girls. She states that the international relief organisations and the UNHCR offer ve ry little in the wa y of a programmatic response to GBV and noted that women, 'g enerally perceive adjudication of GBV cases by the [camp] committee as causing more emotional and social harm than benefit to the survivor'(Vann 2002:118). Sh e urged humanitarian actors to increase their knowledge and awareness on gender di scrimination and GBV among their own staff. While one does not expect traditional male elders and conservative indigenous communities to have great insight into women' s well-being, there is an expectation of a higher commitment from UNHCR and intern ational staff who cannot claim they lack access to this type of informa tion in their human rights organisations. Outside camp There is an even more limited quantity of research on women's reproductive health outside of the camps, I assume due to the di fficulty in access to this population. In 1997, researchers conducted a study with Burmese Tavoyan and Mon female migrants living in Ranong focussing on reproductive he alth (Shakti, Supang Chantavanich, & Naing, 1997). They used survey and participant observation methods to gain the information and noted that women discusse d family planning but often had unclear 103information. Unwanted pregnancy was common and the traditional methods of abortion used were of concern. The average age at marriage was twenty years, but 16% married before eighteen years of age. Most women gave birth at home and half of them had no antenatal care. The women had low levels of education and average family income was 3,425 Baht (US $80) pe r month. The women cited expense and communication problems with Thai staff as the reason for not going to hospital. study in Kanchaburi province found that Burm ese migrant's fertility rate was 3.19 compared to Thai 1.65 (Ngamlamai Peailueang, 2002). The largest and most comprehensive research produced on the reproductive health issues and specifically abortion in migrant workers is Sexuality, Reproductive Health and Violence: Experiences of Migrants from Burma in Thailand conducted by Caouette, Kritaya Archanvanitkul and Hnin Hn in Pyne (2000). Us ing questionnaires, focus groups and observations, they record ed the responses of 513 women and 461 men who lived in Chiangmai, Mahachai and Ranong on topics such as migration routes, work conditions, violence, sexual health and mobility. They questioned Burmese who were Shan, Mon and Tavoyan. Th e general picture is of a mixed flow of migrants, who live and work in extremel y difficult circumstances with very limited access to health care in Thailand. The lack of access to health care and education for displaced Burmese in either Burma or Thai land leads to 'high maternal mortality and morbidity rates, unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions and sexually transmitted diseases (includi ng HIV/ AIDS)' (Caouette 2000:28). The authors found that 17% (n=587) of the people they interviewed reported attempting to obtain an abortion and 45% su cceeded in ending th e pregnancy. Just over half of the abortions were performed in Burma and the rest were performed in Thailand or the border areas. Traditional birt h attendants were the main suppliers of this service (44%) as well as other health personnel (18%), with 38% of respondents stating that they acted alone or with th e help of friends or husbands. While the authors are specific about the methods used, the cost, the fears and stigma connected with induced abortions, they do not inform us specifically about this group of people. The migrant workers reported using herbal medicines, injections, massages and the insertion of objects into the genitals to produce an abortion. They also reported serious complications that were expensive to treat. We are not to ld if there is any 104difference between the group who did not di sclose an unplanned pregnancy/ abortion and those who did. We are left wondering if they are any different from the main group of migrant workers who are described as multi-ethnic, between 15 to 50 years, Buddhist (97%), generally poor ly educated, often living wi th a partner, with about half having living children. Moreover, the re searchers do not inform us of the gender of their informants but from the select ed quotes, both men a nd women gave their opinions and experiences with a bortion (Caouette et al., 2000). Further results indicate the reasons given for the abortions were: being unmarried; too many children; not living in secure conditi ons; and a lack of access to reliable contraception. Caouette and colleagues' (2000) research s hows that people are prepared to speak about act s which they understand are il legal, dangerous and not sanctioned in their community. It also raises the question of the role of the 'traditional birth attendant' as not just a woman who assists with births but is much more a medicine woman with a diverse practice. Additiona lly the authors found, many migrant workers education is low and access to sexual health information or contraceptive supplies is uncommon in Burma. The migrants bring this level of sexual health and practices to Thailand. Many respondents reported their knowledge increased after they entered Thailand. Violence, both at the level of the local community and inflicted by state actors, is common and despite their oner ous living conditions, the Burmese planned to remain and work in Thailand. Health knowledge and information was very low and 'the type of health care chosen by pregnant wome n migrants in Ranong was influenced by access, or lack thereof, to services in a formal health care system, convenience or travel, ability, or lack thereof, to speak Thai, cost, and reliance on employer (Caouette et al., 2000:148). Motherhood and reproductiv e health needs do not cease during periods of instability or migration and indeed become even more pressing. Accounts of Burmese women's sexuality and sexual pleasure rarely appear in the literature; sex is unmentionable and double standards discriminate against women (Skidmore, 1997; Umemoto, 1998). Caouette and colleagues (2000:138) mentions an intriguing case of lustiness reported by a female Shan construction worker: 105I met one woman who married when she was 14 years old. Because she married too young they say her 'sexual pot burst' and sh e could not stay without having sex. How disgusting to see a woman whose 'sexual pot burst'. In general, I observed conservative attit udes in public towards female sexuality and pleasure but women friends did talk about it amongst themselves. Markets and Midwives Burmese women visit local markets seeking Burmese, Chinese and Western medicines for their health care. There are many pharmacies in Mae Sot and most medicines are available without prescrip tion. 37 Condoms, oral contraceptives, injectable hormones, oxytocin, anti-malar ials, antibiotics, hypodermic syringes, and infusion equipment are all readily availa ble and are sold i ndividually over-the- counter. There are also private clinics wh ich advertise their business bilingually and these are run by nurses and doctors who supp lement their state salary in private practice. In addition there are traditional healers, midwives and skilled herbalists (Neumann, 2003). Traditional birth attendant or TBA, is a termed coined by the World Health Organization but has been cr itiqued for its generality and hegemony (Pigg, 1995). I prefer to use lay midwife or the Burmese word l\u00e8 the and define it as a birth helper who has had some informal training, often from her relatives or elders and is recognised by other local women. (The Kare n have some male lay midwives whose role is to apply pressure to the cont racting uterus (Falla, 1991) TBAs have simultaneously been seen to be the bac kbone of a women's health programmes, as well as dangerous and deficient (Camey et al., 1996; Hoban, 2002; Hoff, 1997; Miller, Jami-Imam, Timouri, & Wijnker, 1995). In Thailand, TBAs are not encourag ed to deliver women at home though they still practise some postpartum care and r ituals in Isaan (Whittaker, 2002a). As possibly half of women in Burma give birt h at home, lay midwives or ('auxiliary midwives' with only six months of trai ning and who are unpaid ) are a valuable village-level health resource, strongly utilised by women from Burma (Belak, 2002; 37 Misoprostol (Cytotec) can induce an abortion (Arilha & Barbosa, 1993) but was unavailable through informal Burmese networks in Mae Sot in 2002. 106United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) & Department of Health Union of Myanmar, 1999). Burmese women also comm only use the lay midwives while they are in Thailand (Caouette et al., 2000). The Mae Tao Clinic staff trains l\u00e8 the and provides supplies to enable them to deliver maternity services to Burmese women in Thailand and across the border. Some Burmese women continue to have preferences for the services supplied by traditional birth attendants even when other services are available. This is the case in other countries such as Cambodia and Mexico (Camey et al., 1996; Hoban, 2002; Jordan, 1983). A study of birth preferences conducte d in refugee camps near Mae Sot of 89 women, showed that although most had atte nded antenatal services provided by international health agencies, 70% preferred to give birth in th eir own home in the camp (Naoko Ishikawa, 2000). The supply of modern midwives may not be the only answer. Illegal abortion clinics Abortion services can be purchased in Th ailand. My non-Burmese informants talked of 'clinics' in Bangkok, Chiangmai and Chiangr ai where abortion is possible for fees between 3,000 to 7,500 Baht (US $70 to $17 4). The clinics are staffed by Thai doctors and nurses and are sometimes linke d to public hospitals. The process of having an abortion entails show ing an identity card or pass port, and listening to an informal lecture on the negative karmic re percussions of choosing an abortion. Names and identity card details are entered in to a register and then after an ultrasound to determine the gestation of eight weeks or less, a suction curette. This one-visit menstrual regulation service, with little time to reflect, ask ques tions, discuss future contraception or receive follow-up care is confirmed by Whittaker's documentation of abortion practices (Whittaker, 2004). Burmese women rarely access these clinics due to the necessity to travel, show offici al documentation and the prohibitive cost. Thai Public Health System The Thai public health syst em is well developed and th ere is a network of public health centres at the village level, district hospitals, regional hospitals and major 107teaching hospitals that are relatively eas ily accessed by Thai citizens for minimal costs. The introduction of a universal health insuranc e scheme, whereby all Thai citizens may use public health services fo r a token fee of 30 Baht per visit has improved accessibility. In Tak province in 1999, there were 26 village level health centres ( anamai ), one public general hospital (310 beds) and one private hospital (120 beds) and there were also three designated malaria clinics. In this study, women were recruited from the Mae Sot General Hospital with the consent of the head obstetrician. The Mae Tao Clinic refers emergency obstetric cases (as well as others) to this hospital and some Burm ese women choose to attend for antenatal care and delivery services. The hospital had been extended and the obstetric/gynaecology and administrative bu ildings are very modern. The hospital has: out-patient and in-patient of community and social medicine; a medical library; and department of education and public relations - a sophisticated hospital. Over 700 staff work there in preventative, curative and rehabilitative medicine. In 1999, the outpatient department saw 167,292 patients (an average of 585 each day) and 10% of those were Burmese. In the same year 17,504 patients were admitted into beds and 25% of those were Burmese. The leading causes for admission to the hospital are complications of pregnancy, nor mal deliveries, malaria, intestinal and respiratory infections. The leading causes of death at this time were malaria, AIDS, infectious diseases and pneumonia. Reproductive health services at the Mae Sot General Hospital The percentage of women who give birth in a hospital in Thailand is 77% while for Tak Province it is only 34.6%. Many Burm ese women deliver at home so the numbers recorded by the hospital do not reflect the actual number of bi rths in the area. This means that much of the official data produced by the public health system is not representative and can only be used as a guide. The following table shows the figures of births, stillbirths, abor tions and maternal mortality recorded by the Mae Sot 108General Hospital. The numbers of wome n attending the hospital for abortion complications fluctuates, while the number of births has remained static. Table 8 Births, abortions, an d maternal mortality in th e Mae Sot General Hospital One of the major causes of hospitalisation and death for women during pregnancy and stillbirth in infants is malaria. All wome n are vulnerable, but especially the Burmese women due to their living conditions, poorer st ate of health than Thai women and the barriers to receiving health care. A large number of women come to the hospital to deliver with no record of any antenatal care. The cost of an uncomplicated delivery is between 1500 to 1800 Baht (US $35 to $42 ). The Public Health Statistics 1998 (Ministry of Public Health, 2000) collect ed data from 1995 to 1996, and recorded infant mortality at 4.7/1,000 live births and maternal mortality ratio at 7.6/100,000 live births in Tak province. The post-abortion ward The following excerpt from my field-notes describes the post-abortion ward in the Mae Sot General Hospital in 2002. The ward contained about 40 beds for post-natal women and their babies and women with post-abortion complic ations and other gynaecological problems. The obstetric and gynaecological ward is on the fourth floor, reached by swift lift or a sticky climb up the stairs. The ward is divided by nationality, at one end of the ward, Thai women, at the other end women from Burma. The nurse's office acts as a border in the mi ddle. In the ward the babies lay face up, swaddled in clean soft cloth, lying next to thei r sleeping mothers on the hospital beds. The ward is bright and clean with large op en windows. Even though we are on the fourth floor the windows are open to catch the wind and a light downpour of rain falls steadily. Year Births Stillbirths Abor tions Maternal Mortality 1997 2,242 33 265 5 1998 2,170 30 403 2 1999 2,191 39 277 1 2001 2,216 37 360 10 2002 2,322 42 442 4 109 The ward is about half fu ll today. There is no pa rticular smell. Soothing music oozes out of the speaker system and many of the new mothers and babies are snoozing. The walls are painted pale grey, matching the lino tiles on the floor. There are twel ve beds to one large room , twenty-four at one end of the obstetric ward and another twenty -four at the other. The beds are an iron tubular construction w ith peeling cream paint a nd a hard mattress. The women lie on clean white linen and blue plastic mats to catch the blood. The blood is clearly visi ble on their faded green hosp ital issue sarongs. Beside each bed is a laminex cupboard and a wooden stool. Drinking water is available for each woman in old cream coloured enamel teapots. One baby boy lies with a cotton patch over both his eyes 'sunbathing' nude under the therapeutic lamp to reduce his neonatal jaundice. There are plenty of drip stands. There are rails for curtains but the Burmese end of the ward has none and the Thai end has baby-blue fake satin curtains, which makes the ward look oddly plush. There are overhead fans a nd lots of neon ligh ting. The corridor contains two Buddhist shrines. One is at the main entrance to the ward and the other is high up in the middle of the co rridor with plastic jasmine offerings. The King's picture is also visible high on the wall Kuhn Sarawin is one of the most seni or nurses on the ward and she speaks some Burmese. She is a mature-age wo man and sits near the upright fan as she sorts through her patient's files. 'I'm hot' she says. 'It's menopause', I joke with her. 'Maybe you're right. Let's have some coffee.' As I drink coffee I ask Kuhn Sarawin why so ma ny Burmese women have complicated abortions. 'They have a low social ec onomy level Suzanne,' she tells me as she carefully wraps a naked sleepy new born Burmese baby in soft cloths and snuggles it to her ample bosom. She w ears a crisp white sh irt with silver buttons and white pants. On her head is a starched white cap with one thick blue stripe. She wears th e badge of her nursing qualif ication on her lapel. She has bright lipstick and white ankle length socks and slip-on plastic shoes. She spends most of her time in the nurse's office sorting and checking the patients' notes written in medical English and Thai . The nurse's office is tidy and the workbenches hold spare stationary, me dications, telephones and freshly taken 110Guthrie blood blots38 which dry like pieces of toast in a rack. There are little plastic drawers identified by the names of medication; 'Buscopan', 'Plasil', 'Konakion', 'Genta' and 'Paracetemol'. The rubbish bins under the desk are labelled for different kinds of medical waste. Through the nurses' office windows, there is a clear view of both bays, slightly overful l with old hospital beds. The toilets and s howers are clean and each has a door for privacy. There are four hand-sinks, two showers and six squat toilets for 24 patients. There is an old emergency generator n ear the nurses station called the 'Sunny Automatic Emergency Light' with two big gauges like eyes - one called 'Ammeter' and the other 'Voltmeter' that also watch over the patients. The other end of the ward is a mirror imag e except there is a private examination room with a lithotomy couch. The picture is of calm, clean and orderliness. Mae Tao Clinic is not quite as sophisti cated or dirt-free but is more famous (Field-notes July 2002). Mae Tao Clinic Dr Cynthia Maung, a Karen forc ed migrant, was trained in bio-medicine in Rangoon and models the Mae Tao Clinic on this para digm. She is quiet and exudes fortitude but often giggles and sees the funny si de of life despite being surrounded by restrictions and human suffe ring. She is a married Christian and does not offer elective abortion to her patients, but happ ily provides contraceptive information and supplies. She is also stat eless and living in tenuous ex ile (Sanitsuda Ekachai, 2003b). The Mae Tao staff identified the problem of unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion as the topic for this thesis. There is no ot her Burmese clinic in Thailand that is as famous and well developed as this one. History- rebellion and dirt floors The Mae Tao Clinic was founded in Tak province, Thailand and staffed by a few university students shortly after the 1988 faile d democracy uprising in Burma. It was 38 The Guthrie test is performed in the first week s of life and can detect congenital abnormalities of metabolism such as hypothyroidism, phenylketonuria and cystic fibrosis. If detected early enough and treated with dietary or hormonal measures the child has a greater chance of developing normally (Beischer & Mackay, 1986). 111supported and funded by the Kare n already in the area. In an interview with the Bangkok Post (Sanitsuda Ekachai, 2003a) Cynthia Maung talked about her introduction to the political aspects of health care in the lead-up to 1988: 'I saw problems,' she said. 'When I worked in hospitals, I saw the problems of not having enough beds or medicines. The hos pitals are under-resourced and the people don't have access to health care. They have to help themselves by using herbs and there are a lot of fake medicines. When I worked in a Karen village, I also saw how people's health was inter-related to other issu es. I saw the use of forced labour, forced porters. I saw these problems and came to realise we cannot solve them by continuing treating the villagers. We had to change the system.' Protests against the military junta by the pro-democracy movement were at their height then, and Dr Cynthia readily joined in, fully optimistic for change. Her leadership was already evident. 'Many families were afraid, so I decided to join the protests because I wanted to help,' she recalled. 'I didn't really know how, but because of my position in the village as a doctor they gave me respect. If I joined, they would feel confident to do the same.' (No page number) Following the 1988 democracy protests she ha d to leave Burma for her own safety with thousands of others after the demonstrations. The Mae Tao Clinic is characterised by its rapid expansion and unique delivery of health care. It was originally a rather humble dirt-floor wooden building which has developed into a multi-sectoral health and we lfare provider. Initially no records were kept but the first records show that in 1989, 1,760 cases of illness were treated. This caseload has exploded over the years. The numbers from the Annual Reports over the years speak for post-a bortion care in Mae Tao Clinic (2003) Plate 14 The orginal wooden building of the Mae Ta o Clinic which in 2001 was used as in-patent area 113Table 9 Total caseload at the Mae Tao Clinic 1989 to 2001 The patient demands often outstrip the facilities and capacity of the cl inic and it is not uncommon to see patients sleeping in classr ooms, kitchens or meeting halls during the wet season. In the past, the lack of sa nitation and running water made working and living there not only unpleasant at times, but also unhealthy. 39 The Mae Tao Clinic is rather chao tic and many visitors comment on the disorganisation and poor plan ning. I think there are seve ral explanations for this criticism. Firstly, given the caseload, wh ich expands over fifty percent in short periods of time it is difficult to plan stra tegically with minimal resources. Secondly, the staff are forced migrants who never envisaged a life in long exile. Many would like to return to Burma if the conditions we re safe. Thirdly, they live in Thailand due to local circumstances, a mixt ure of goodwill and expediency. They are a useful asset to Tak province as they relieve a large bur den of health provision and provide public health approaches to promoting welln ess in the Burmese population (Maung & Purdin, 2000). Staff rarely leave the com pound and most do not sp eak Thai. One of many unique aspects of the Mae Tao Clinic is that people of all nationalities and ethnicities, Buddhists and Christ ians, work, live, eat togeth er and go about their daily business in the compound and are able to work construc tively. Many are politically engaged in Karen resistance or support democratic change in Burma. As such the Mae Tao Clinic is not like any hospital or public health station in either Thailand or, probably, Burma. 39 This has improved considerably with the new build ings and toilet and bathroom facilities in 2002. Year Total caseload 1989 1,760 1991 2,339 1993 6,004 1995 7,992 1997 15,272 1999 26,845 2001 30,090 114The Mae Tao Clinic offers a comprehensive he alth service, if people can reach it. The local Mae Sot police stand outside the clinic and harass and arrest patients, but they rarely enter the compound. Th e Mae Tao Clinic provides cu lturally appropriate, free health care to the externally and intern ally displaced Burmese population, supported by the local Thai Public Health system. The clinic is base d four kilometres from the official border crossing and is accessible to local and rural Burmese living in Thailand, as well as Burmese still inside Bu rma. Thai motorbike taxi drivers who wear lurid pink vests have built a shelte r where they play with dogs, cook food and sleep while they wait for fares. Overloaded songtows regularly go past the clinic on the highway that leads directly to the bridge to Burma. The Mae Tao Clinic Annual Report 2003 , records contact with over 34,000 pa tients during 2002, which fluctuates due to the massive morbidity associated with malaria, de ngue and respiratory infections in the wet season. Services include: outpatient care and inpatient care; a tuberculosis programme; a child health programme; blood donation storage system; laboratory; eye clinic; and a trauma and prosthetics clinic. Health workers can attend: training and skill upgrade courses in mental health; reproductive h ealth; health rights; information systems; sanitation; landmine awareness and so forth. The clinic also offers a referral source, ongoing training and supplies to lay midwives. Five medical doctors, 80 core health care workers, 40 tr ainees and 40 support st aff are associated with the clinic but the numb ers often swell in times of crackdown by Thai authorities as the clinic is perceived to be a place of sanctuary. The clinic staff attempt to reach rural a nd isolated communities in Thailand when the political and security situa tion allows, as well as visit factories where thousand of migrant workers live and work. They es timate they serve a target population of 150,000 (Michiyo Kato et al., 2002). The clinic also coordinates a home for orphans, supports informal schools, boarding houses , women's organisations and health education in the refugee camps. The Back Pack Health Worker Team coordinates closely with the clinic and provides primary health care inside Karen State to an estimated target population of 130,000 disp laced people with teams of community health workers and midwives. This is a highly dangerous project for the workers as they are perceived as insurgents by the SPDC, whether they work inside Thailand or Burma. The whole operation to provide primary health care services to a marginalised, displaced and 'illegal' population is conducted by hundreds of local 115staff and many volunteers who are of ten foreigners; supported by multiple international donors and charities. Women and children's wellbeing The health of women and children is a pers onal interest of Dr Cynthia Maung and in 2002 she spoke passionately on health and secur ity issues of people forcibly displaced from their country (Maung, 2002b). The main topics she discussed were: the lack of birth registration and citizenship for Burmes e infants born in Thailand; either in or outside the refugee camps; family separati on and community disintegration; lack of access to health services; and organised cr ime. She stated that children without identity papers were easily recruited to be child soldiers and her fear was that when people were allowed to repatriate, thei r citizenship in Burma may be denied.40 An estimated 40,000 children in Thailand born to Burmese parents are effectively stateless, neither Thai nor Burmese, w ho cannot enter Thai schools and who have limited employment opportunities in the futu re (Nyo Nyo, 2001). Parents do consider their children's futures and this may contri bute to the unwanted pr egnancy experience for Burmese families. Each year, babies are left at the clinic when new parents find they cannot care for another child. The health workers feed and play with the babies until someone offers to informally adopt. Sometimes a couple will take a fancy to a little one; other times local Thai couples will come and adopt a Burmese baby even though the babies have no birth certificates and are therefore non-citizens. In 2002, negotiations were taking place with the ampur (local government) officials to register these children. Some babies just stay a nd are communal children, especially if they are HIV positive. One small Burmese non-government organisa tion called Social Action for Women (SAW) has taken on the role of caring for 'o rphans' some of whom still have living parents. When I visited in December 2002, they were caring for thirteen children; nine were girls. The children are Karen, Mon, Muslim and rarely Burman. One ten day old Karen boy was relinquished to SAW after his mother died of a postpartum 40 This is not an unfounded worr y as the Rohynga people from We stern Burma faced a very unclear repatriation process and the SPDC used lack of identity papers to discriminate against groups (Ugalde & Cardenas, 1997) 116haemorrhage. They provide the childre n with food, shelter and education. The children come to SAW via different routes , sometimes referred from Mae Tao Clinic or the Mae Sot Hospital and sometimes by th e parents. A care worker explained: One boy is 16 and was working on a constr uction site and injured his arm badly and now cannot work. Sometimes the father di es and the mother cannot support the child anymore or she has too many other children to look after. Some parents have heard about us inside Burma and they come and bring us their children. Other times motorcycle taxi drivers know of abandone d or unwanted children and bring them to us. One couple were arrested for drug dea ling so they needed someone to look after their children while they serve their prison sentence (Fieldnotes 2002). Organised crime is another issue that impact s on Burmese mental a nd physical health. The trafficking of women and girls for the purpose of prostitution, and the use of systematic rape as a weapon of war against ethnic minority women are common (Alternative Asean Network on Burma, 2000; Beyrer, 2001; Images Asia, 1997; Kritaya Archavanitikul et al., 2000; Port er, 1997; Shan Human Rights Foundation & Shan Women's Action Network, 2002). The M ae Tao Clinic releases no report on the numbers of women who attend the clinic reporting sexual assault, but from my own experience of working at th e clinic women did ask for assistance and support after being raped. Communicable and Sexually Transmitted Diseases The Burmese migrant population is one of th e most difficult to treat and monitor due to their often illegal status and mobility. Malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis have been identified as priority diseases by th e World Health Organization's Border Health Program (Melgaard, 2002). Dengue haemorrhagic fever, measles, cholera, typhoid and rabies are also present in this area. Drug resistance to malaria and TB is a problem, as is the coordination, treatmen t and containment programme across the various populations and international heal th agencies and across borders (Lanjouw, 2001). The treatment of malaria is furthe r complicated by the abuse of amphetamines (Newton et al., 2003). Some of these diseases, particul arly malaria and HIV have serious reproductive health sequelae fo r women and their babies. Sexually transmitted diseases can cause sub-fertilit y, infertility, miscarriage in women and prematurity, disability and death in infants. 117The Mae Tao Clinic has very basic diagnostic services and it is ab le to test blood for HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis. All other STDs and RTIs are diagnosed by clinical symptoms. In 2000, it reported three hundred cas es of STDs but this information was not disaggregated for specific disease types or sex of the patient. The antenatal clinic reports rates of HIV 0.8%, hepatitis B 3.7% and syphilis 1% in pregna nt women. In 2002, a coordinated programme between Th ai public health staff and the Mae Tao Clinic to supply pregnant women and their infants with prophylactic anti-retroviral medication for vertical transmission of HIV positive women began. Around twenty women joined the programme in the first year. There is no other antiretroviral treatment for adults or children with HI V/AIDS, other than symptomatic care and traditional medicine. Myths and false info rmation concerning HIV/AIDS and stigma and fear are also present (Caouette et al., 2000; Wassa na Im-Em et al., 2000). Burmese men and women hear of condoms af ter arrival in Thaila nd but are unclear how and when they should be used. Mullany (2003) surveyed over 700 hundred Burmese factory workers in Mae Sot and found that men had better knowledge of prevention and transmission of HIV than women. Less than half of the women understood that contraceptive pills provide d no protection agains t HIV; only 15% of them reported ever seeing a condom and fewer than 2% had used one. The authors state that this part icular population lacks the most basic information about the HIV epidemic. This also has implications for women trying to protect themselves from an unwanted pregnancy. Thein Thein Htay and colleagues (2000) report that the quality of data from Burma is poor and HIV sentinel surveillance data show increasing levels of HIV infections. In 1997, th e rate of infection in sex wo rkers was report ed at 26%. At an International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific in 2001, the submitted abstracts for Burma noted rates of 6% in STI male patients and 5% in pregnant women. The Burmese military governme nt has just begun a countrywide HIV surveillance in 2001 (ICAAP Abstract book 2001) and appears to have acknowledged the presence of this pandemic. Repr oductive health issues such as unwanted pregnancy, abortion, maternal mortality, STDs/RTIs and HI V/AIDS are intersecting sets that relate directly to women as citizen and their human rights to access education, safe employment, security and health services. 118Post-abortion care and other reproductive health services The development of services and capacity of the Mae Tao Clinic has increased over time. In 1990, the staff began a delivery and referral service that expanded in 1991 to mobile teams for the internal ly displaced. In 1992, a thre e month maternal and child health training course for health workers, antenatal and family clinic was implemented. The following year the matern al and child health course expanded to four months training, although data collect ion and funding for maternal health was very limited. During the 1990s, several small outlying clinics which provided maternal and child health care in the jungl es in Karen State we re burned down by the SPDC (Kortshagen 2001). In 1997, a blood tran sfusion and storage system, vital for emergency obstetrics was established and better coordination with the Thai public health system began. By 1998, the Back Pack Health Workers were accessing people in Karen, Mon and Karenni areas and a small grant was awarded for maternity care from the Women's Commission for Refug ee Women and Children. During 1999, the training of traditional birth attendants in migrant worker and IDP areas began and a reproductive health workshop was organised every six months to review cases and refresh knowledge (Maung & Purdin, 2000). A separate emergency obstetric referral system was developed in 2000 and the training of lay midw ives continued. By 2001, 300 lay midwives had some form of traini ng in bio-medical ob stetrics, including hygiene, nutrition, abnormal bi rth presentations, referral, fa mily planning and aspects of infant health. In 2001, adolescent health issues began to be addressed by a needs survey and a Monitoring and Evaluation Quality Improvement Project funded by the Women's Commission. During 2002, the Averting Maternal Death and Disability Proj ect (Sullivan, Maung, & Naw Sophia, 2004) began, and I started to re view all emergency obstetric referrals and consider the problem of unwanted pre gnancies and unsafe abortions. Over this period funding increased dramatically. Th e funding for women's health was only US $20,000 in 1999, but had grown to US $210,000 by 2002. The Emergency Obstetric Care: Critical Need Among Displaced Populatio ns report identified deficiencies in the provision of PAC at the Mae Tao Clinic (Reproductive Health in Conflict Consortium, 2004). An assessment and proposed plan on adverting maternal mortality and morbidity proposed to upgrade facilities, pr ovide training and equipment, standardise protocols, improve access to emergency obstetric referrals, and advocate for 119reproductive health. The outcomes did improve PAC at the Mae Tao Clinic. What was missed and could be included in follow- up are training for Thai health workers and outreach reproductive health services. Dr Cynthia highlights the c onstraints in providing maternity care to internally displaced pregnant women by lay midwives w ho lack not only basi c supplies, such as soap, but also any emergency obstetric re ferral system. Eighty-seven percent of women in Karen State in the areas covered by the Back Pack teams give birth at home, and only 4% of the women had access to emergency health care. Inside Karen State maternal mortality ratio is very high, estimated at 1300 per 100,000 live births with an infant mortality of 148 per 1000 live births. The deaths of young children under five years is also very hi gh at 317 per 1000 live births. Modern methods of family planning are not available for the in ternally displaced, other than traditional abstinence, withdraw al, herbs, charms and abortion. When I asked some Karen informants about the KNU policy on family planning, one male Karen Youth leader said, 'I don't think the KNU think so much about family planning and population. The KNU cannot provide enoug h guns to the soldiers so now the way to win is by politics. The army is really just to protect the vi llagers; it is not an offensive army.' One Karen community health nurse elaborated: Thra Sunny told me that KNU leaders refuse to do family planning for the IDPs in 2001. Now I heard that they have starte d to give pills, condoms and some Depo in those areas, so gradually it is changing . During 1995 to 1997 the KNU forbade family planning. During this time Dr Cynthia sent family planning supplies to the health worker Mu Moe inside Burma. Mu Moe stood up and spoke for family planning. The German midwife Inge also helped during this time. I think the KNU were worried, they wanted more people, mo re soldiers. The Thai people offered us family planning and General Bo Mya stopped it, he forbade us to go and get sterilisations. The Christian Karen leadership have had a troubled relationship with the idea of family planning for Karen people. The high rates of child mortality probably influence the leadership as well as the continuing deadly conflict against the Karen. Many of the patients at the Mae Tao Clinic are not Karen, and many of the health workers think family planning is a sensible idea for married people, but they are not leading a revolution th at needs soldiers. 120 The Mae Tao Clinic has been dealing with the consequences of miscarriages and induced abortions for some time. The figure below shows the rapidly increasing numbers of women coming for assistance with childbirth, and a stable number of women seeking post-abortion care . The figure indicates that for a long time the clinic was doing more post-abortion care than delivering babies as birth occurred mainly in women's homes. It suggests an unmet need for family planning. 274457 467 219213260352 277559 503563 414 1791561441107635137831227 269291 0200400600800100012001400 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 YearNumber of patientsPAC IPD PAC total Births Figure 9 Number of births and post-abortio n care 2001 to 2003 at Mae Tao Clinic Source: Mae Tao Clinic Annual Reports - Note post-abortion care was not recorded before 1998 Large numbers of women with post-abortion complications are admitted to the in-patient department or seen on an out-patie nt basis each year. The facilities were rudimentary even in 2001. When I first be gan the study the four beds designated for septic abortions were under the oldest wooden building. It was dank, dark and malodorous. Thin green curtains hung at chicken wire windows, offering minimal privacy for women who were in pain and bleed ing. The beds were very close together and relatives, children and husbands slept on the hard wooden beds with the woman 121or on a wooden bench beside her. Some be ds were pressed hard up against the wall so it was impossible to walk around the bed to take blood-pressure or examine the woman. Prior to the post-abo rtion training the health work ers received in 2002 from the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, the method of D&C was sharp curette without anaesthetic. The delivery room was not much better, the water often did not run and the lights failed; it was so ti ny that health workers could not move about. Women with septic abortio ns were curetted in the delivery room. Everyone understood why septic cases should not be mixed with clean deliveries, but with the lack of space to work, it was almost impossible to separate the ill from the healthy. During 2002, clean, bright new i npatient and outpatient departments were built with funds from the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children. They were larger, more functional, and th e level of hygiene and happiness improved. While there is not a direct correlation betw een the availability of contraception and planned pregnancy, the presence of a service is still important. The staff are aware of the high levels of unwant ed pregnancy and unsafe abortions and have offered contraceptive information and supplies to wo men since 1996. There is an increasing demand and a diversity of contraceptive methods offered to men and women ( Pers. Comm. Sterk 2002; Kortshagen, 2001). The 2002 Annual Report documents 3,965 patients in the family planning clinic and by 2003 this number had jumped to 6,469 (Maung, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002b, 2003). Table 10 shows the quantity of supplies and method mix available to Burmese patients at the Mae Tao Clinic. During my fieldwork in 2001, 18% of wome n were under 20 years of age and felt comfortable enough to visit the clinic to talk about cont raception; 13% of women had five or more children. Oral contraceptive pills and long-term injections were popular methods. Condoms were accepted by 14% of new clients but numbers of patients returning for more supplies fe ll by half. Intrauterine contraceptive devices were not commonly supplied and long term implants such as Implanon were rarely available (Sterk 2002). 122Table 10 Contraceptive method mix and volume of supplies prescri bed in 2001 at the Mae Tao Clinic Client Total Percent Age <20 717 Old 378 10% Depo injection New 462 12% Old 562 14% IUCD New 3 <0.05% Condom New 550 14% Old 6% Sterilisation 6% Given 1,024 Source: Adapted from Annual Report (Maung 2002) Sterilisation was very much a female method, only seven men accepted a vasectomy in 2001, despite it costing nothing to the pati ent. Women were c ounselled at the Mae Tao Clinic and then referred to the Mae Sot General Hospital for the procedure. Mae Tao Clinic paid for Burmese patients' sterilisations performed in the Thai public health system. I will discuss men's attitude s towards sterilisation in chapter 10. In sum, women's access to reproductive hea lth care services and knowledge in Tak is limited, and this is a significant factor in reproductive health outcomes. Women in camps have access to indigenous healers and midwives as well as the international humanitarian organisations, while Burmese wo men outside of camps must risk arrest or harassment by Thai authorities when trav elling if they do not hold a valid working permit. The market is a popular source of information and medicine. The hospital statistics show that the Thai public health services are also used by the Burmese and since 1989 the Mae Tao Clinic has seen an increasing number of patients. Numbers 123from hospital and clinic reports only reflect those who could get to the health services. The total number of Burmese in Tak is unknown, just as the number of women who are pregnant or aborting is unknown, and ma kes the statistics dubious. The Burmese health workers are neither doctors nor nurses, but have some skills in both. They are informally trained and the senior health workers learn according to opportunity and experience. The Mae Tao Clinic has an tenatal, delivery and postpartum care for women as well as a reproductive health outpatient department. Women with complicated births or who are seriously ill are referred to the Mae Sot General hospital and their bill is paid for by the Mae Tao Clinic funds. Post-abortion care has been offered to women in considerable quantities over the years but no elective abortion services. The clinic facilities and capacity has expanded over the years as training and support have been invested by Thai and foreign contributions. 124Chapter 5 Working wives - migration and security Quote from Second and Third Periodic Repo rts of State Partie s Thailand to the CEDAW committee... 42. Undocumented workers are known to be particularly vulnerable to abuse in the form of unfair wages, well below Thailand' s legal minimum wage. Excessively long working hours, dangerous working conditions and restrictions of freedom of movement outside working hours are also k nown to be not uncommon problems, but these remain difficult to addr ess while the legal status of the workers is unclear. (Royal Thai Government, 1997:22) In this chapter I outline the characteristics of women who attend health services for post-abortion care (PAC); particularly th e numbers, occupation, residence, marital status, religion, migration and their experiences of living in Tak province. I asked in the community about the women who e xperienced abortion, there were many opinions. Most people believed only wo men outside their particular group experienced abortion, especially induced a bortion. Christian Karens told me only Burman Muslims experienced abortion and Bu rman Buddhists denied it occurred to them. The Thai obstetrician explained to me that unmarried wome n were particularly at risk of induced abortion as opposed to older married women. But all agreed it was a common problem. While many authors concur that induced aborti on is a relatively frequent event around the world, the particular presentation ch anges according to location (Ankomah, 1997; Bankole et al ., 1999). This chapter combines data gained from the retrospective medical records review in Mae Sot General Hospital and the Mae Tae Clinic, and statistical mate rial produced by both institutions. This material offers reasonably good evidence of the magnitude of pregnancy loss treated in these two institutions but it leaves many questions unans wered. The 43 interviews 125with women recovering from early pr egnancy loss and 10 men, add the social information missing from the medical reco rds. The women and men talked about their ethnic identity, time spent in school, their religious beliefs, why they came to Thailand and their experien ces of working and living in a foreign country. This information speaks of the nature of forced migration, insecurity and poverty. Some people talked about persecution by the military regime of Burma. I contrast and compare the characteristics of Burmese wo men with Thai women who receive PAC. While at the individual level a profile of women who attend PAC services can be constructed, the social context is also an important feature. The vast majority of respondents were not documented as leav ing Burma, entering Thailand or having permission to work. They are in all respects marginal to the Thai state. Their post-abortion experiences are not c ounted by Thai health official s at the national level, and as most women do not hold formal documenta tion they are treated as though they do not exist. How many women? A quantitative picture is an important element of analysis. Figure 6 presents an overview of patient flows during 2001. It shows the collated numbers from Thai and Burmese health services from hospital r ecords, annual reports and a retrospective medical record review. Unfortunately numbe rs rarely tell the whole story and any attempt to be precise is flawed for severa l reasons. The size a nd sex of the population of Burmese living in Tak is unknown due to their irregular immigration movements and therefore the precise numb er of fertile-aged women is unknown. Not all visits to the public hospital are disaggregated by na tionality. Institutions define abortion differently and at times misdiagnose a nd a Thai data collection year does not correspond with a Burmese da ta collection year. Spontan eous and induced abortions are not disaggregated in official records. Furthermore, recording systems are not perfect and some records are lost or counted incorrectly. I collected data from only two institutions but there are private practit ioners and one private hospital, though few Burmese could afford to pay for private ca re. Not all Burmese women in Tak attend health services for antenatal care, delivery or abortion in Thailand and so the numbers do not represent the incidence in the gene ral population (Caouette et al., 2000; Paul, 126Supang Chantavanich, & Naing, 1997). So me women visit lay midwives for PAC and not just for the abortion.41 Despite these convoluted caveats and until recording systems improve, this is an informed estimate. _____________________________________________________________________ Mae Tao Clinic Mae Sot Hospital Figure 10 Overview of recorded reprodu ctive health outcomes during 2001 41 This article notes that lay midwives procure a bortions and discusses the training of all health personnel but does not acknowledge that probably some lay midwives already perform aspects of PAC - see (Thein Thein Htay, Josephine Sauvarin, & Saba Khan, 2003). Babies born to Burmese women 782 Babies born to Thai & hill tribe women 1,434 Burmese and Thai women who received PAC 360 Maternal deaths 10Antenatal care visits to clinic 5417Births in deliver y room 563 Inpatient admissions for PAC 274Outpatient visits for PAC 193 32 referrals for PAC care Estimated number of Burmese fertile age women in th e community 80,000 +180 referrals for obstetric care 127There is an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 Burmese in Tak Province of which 80,000 are thought to be women in their reproduc tive years; some of whom experience spontaneous or induced abortions. An unknown proportion of these women reach either the Mae Tao Clinic or the Thai Mae Sot General Hospital where they are recorded as a 'medical event'. The M ae Tao Clinic IPD records 231 women admitted for post-abortion care in 2001. I counted 185 women who attended Mae Tao Clinic for outpatient PAC and a further 34 who were referred to hospital. 42 The Mae Sot General Hospital records 360 Thai and Bu rmese women receiving PAC during 2001. Burmese women visit the Mae Sot General Hospital or Mae Tao Clinic directly from Burma or while living in Tak. Alternatively they can be referred to the Mae Sot General Hospital by a Thai anamai (health station) or be referred from Mae Tao Clinic. During 2001, 10 women died whilst pregnant and in 2002 a further 4 women died. As maternal mortality is a small figure, I will present the deaths for 2001 and 2002 together and discuss maternal mo rtality later in this chapter. Characteristics of women who attend for post-abortion care Little is known of the ch aracteristics of Burmese wo men who choose abortion. Paul, Supang Chantavanich and associates (1997) only recruited married women into their study of reproductive health in Ra nong, effectively excluding young or single women's experiences. While sexuality and reproductive health are not openly discussed by Burmese men and women, th e authors establis hed that unwanted pregnancies and abortions were relatively common (Caouett e et al., 2000; Paul et al., 1997). Stereotypes abound that unmarried women, prostitutes, irreligious and non- patriotic Burmese women abort (Belak, 2002), a nd this is similar to assumptions held by the general public in Thailand about Th ai women who choose abortion (Whittaker, 2004). 42 This is a different figure to the Annual Report but I use my own count which I verified. The Mae Tao Clinic does not process all women through OPD be fore admission into IPD, as is usual in most hospitals, and the smaller OPD figure can seem confusing. 128Age, marital status, type of abortion and living children In this section, I present the findings from the medical record review in the reproductive health outpatient departments of the Mae Tao Clinic and overview of the women referred to the Mae Sot General Hospital. There were 196 recorded visits to the Mae Tao Clinic for abortion complications to the Reproductive Health Ou tpatient Department in 2001 and 11 (6%) records were unable to be processed or recalled due to a mistake in the recording systems. Fifteen women visit Reproductive Health OPD each month on average, and this does not change according to season. 43 The following table shows some of the characteristics of the 185 women who attended RH OPD fo r complications with a pregnancy loss. Table 11 Patient profile from the RH OP D Mae Tao Clinic medical record review Mae Tao Clinic Reproductive Health Out-patients (n=185) Age 15 to 19 18 20 to 24 58 25 to 29 41 30 to 34 40 35 + 28 Marital status (n=74) 100% women recorded as married Type of abortion Induced 27% Pregnancies (n=143) 1 2 to 4 5 or more 19% 54% 27% Living children None 27% (n=143) 3 or less 41% 4 or more 10% No record 22% Previous abortion (n=143) 43% 43 Morbidity increases dram atically during wet season due to in creases in malaria, dengue and acute respiratory infections. As malaria and fevers can precipitate spontaneous abortion (miscarriage), I expected a concomitant increase in women seeking PAC during wet season. 129The Mae Tao Clinic health workers diagnos e a quarter of all women with induced abortion. Fewer than 10% percent of women are young women below the age of twenty and 15% are over 35 years of ag e; the youngest girl was 15 years and the oldest woman 45 years. Seventy-four wome n are recorded as married in the medical records but there is no entry for the ot her 111 women. Twenty -eight percent of women have five or more pregnancies. Twenty-seven percent of women have no living children, and 10% have four or more living children but many records were incomplete. Nearly half of the women had experienced a pregnancy loss before. In the same year, 260 women were admitted to in-patient level ca re at the Mae Tao Clinic. Haemoglobin levels are recorded fo r 132 women and 60% recorded a level of 10.7 g/dl or less.44 Ten percent of women come dire ctly from Burma for treatment. The Burmese health workers generally did not record information like ethnicity, education, employment, religion, domestic viol ence, sex-work or rape in the medical records of women pres enting with abortion. Length of pregnancy in relation to pregnancy loss According to the medical records most pregna ncies ended in the first three months of pregnancy. Natural abortions ar e more likely to occur in the fourth, eighth, twelfth and sixteenth weeks of pregnanc y, and this is reflected in the medical records. The majority of women came at these times in their pregnancies with abortions/ miscarriages. In the 185 recorded pregnanc ies that threatened abortion or ended, 118 (64%) women aborted in the first three m onths of pregnancy, 46 (25%) in the middle three months and one woman's pregnancy ended in the 25 th week (seventh month). In 21 cases it was not recorded or the wo man did not know how long she had been pregnant. Number of visits to OPD Many abortions can be managed safely on an outpatient basis and there were 320 visits recorded for this group of 185 women. Forty-five percent made one visit, 35% two visits and 20% of women came three or more times for the same case of abortion. The health workers often requested the women to return to the Mae Tao Clinic but no 44 A normal haemoglobin level for a woman is between 11.5 to 16 g/dl. At the Mae Tao Clinic, haemoglobin is measured using a hand-held spectrometer in daylight and expressed in grams per decilitre rather than grams per litre. The low haemoglobin levels could indicate haemorrhage or chronic anaemia. 130further visit was recorded. This means that women often were not provided with follow-up care or educational information such as family planning counselling. Women with a diagnosed induced abortion Fifty women were diagnosed with an i nduced abortion, seven were under 20 years and eight were 35 years or older. Thir teen women (27%) had no living children and twenty-two (45%) women had between 1 to 3 children and four women had 4 or more children. (In ten cases there was no record of living childr en.) One woman had seven living children. Twenty-three (46%) women sa id they had never had an abortion of any kind before and 18 (36%) had had one or more previous abortions. (In nine cases there was no record.) Just over half of this group ma de more than one visit for the same case of abortion. Health workers reco rded the use of international and Burmese medicines, massages, visits to traditional midwives ( l\u00e8 the ), sticks and accident type stories to end the pregnancy. In half of the case notes there was no record of the relationship with a man. In 60% of cas es, there was no information regarding the provision of post-abortion contraception. Th is group of women di d not appear to differ from the other women who presented. I will discuss the met hods of abortion in chapter 7 and the abortionists in chapter 8, and elaborate on women's motivations to end their pregnancy in chapter 9. Burmese women referred to ho spital level care for the treatment of complica tions of abortion As Mae Tao Clinic does not function at a specialist-hospital level, women who are very unwell or who require surgery need to be referred to specialised gynaecology and obstetric care. Thirty-nine women were referred to the Mae Sot General Hospital from mid-March to December 2001. Five medical records were excluded from review as they were ectopic pregnancies or other complications of early pregnancy that present like abortion such as a molar pr egnancy or pelvic inflammatory disease. 131 Table 12 Patient profile of women referred to the Mae Sot General Hosp ital for post-abortion care Mae Sot General Hospital Referred patients to In-patient care (n=34) Age 15 to 19 1 20 to 24 6 25 to 29 14 30 to 34 5 35 + 8 Yes 6 Blood Transfusion No 28 Yes 30 Dilatation & curette No 4 Pregnancies 1 2 to 4 5 or more 3 16 9 Incomplete history 6 Malaria positive Yes 0 No 23 Not checked 11 Total hospital bill 104,205 Baht (US $2423) Eight women were over 35 years of age a nd three were 20 years or under. One woman had been pregnant 14 times and give n birth nine times. Nine women had experienced 5 or more pregnancies. One woman had two dilation and curette procedures and six required blood transfusio ns. None appear to have had malaria. One woman died from her abortion complica tion due to an overwhelming infection, blood clotting changes (disseminate d intravascular coagulation-DIC)45 and congested lungs (pulmonary oedema). [See case C] The total cost of hospital care for 34 women with abortion complications wa s 104,205 Baht (US $2423) or 3,065 Baht (US 45 Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a clinical syndrome seen in the critically ill. There is an imbalance of the antagonist system of coagulation and anti-coagulation. It is caused by gram negative bacteria, malaria, and obstetric complications such as haemorrhagic shock, abortion, retained dead foetus syndrome, abruptio placentae and amniotic fluid embolism. It can be treated with blood products but the underlying cause must simultaneous ly be treated. There is an associated high mortality. [http://www.postgradme d.com/issues/2002/03_02/messmor e.htm [access date June 2004] 132$71) on average per case of abortion or pelvic infection, which ranged from 550 Baht to 18,695 Baht (US $13 to $435). If a woman is referred to the Mae Sot General Hospital by the Mae Tao Clinic, the Mae Tao Clinic pays the hospital bill, but if a woman refers herself, she must pay the bill. If she holds a valid work permit she is entitled to the 30 Baht he alth insurance scheme. To summarise the OPD record review, th ere were large amounts of information missing with some case-notes missing enti rely or basic information such as incomplete obstetric histories. Generall y bio-medical information was recorded but psycho-social information was absent. A qua rter of the women were diagnosed with self-induced abortion and referr al to hospital level care wa s required for over thirty women. A minority of women were adolesce nts, half of the women were already mothers and 10% were grand multiparas (a woman who has experienced five or more pregnancies). The women who were identified as having an induced abortion did not appear to differ from other women receivi ng PAC and over half of this group did not receive a modern method of contraception. While some women made multiple visits to the clinic, health workers frequently recorded requesting a follow-up visit that never occurred. The hospital bill incurred by the women or the Mae Tao Clinic is not insignificant and in some records women had absconded from the Mae Sot General Hospital without payment. Characteristics of women inter viewed in IPD admitted for PAC Forty-three women agreed to give an interv iew while they were in-patients recovering from abortion in the Mae Tao Clinic or the Mae Sot General Hospital. Seven women declined to be interviewed or were not able to understand consent issues. There is no census data of the Burmese community out side of camps and so it is unknown how representative this sample is; however wh en is it compared with the 185 Out-patient Department PAC medical records, it is si milar. The following table presents some characteristics of these 43 women. 133Table 13 In-patient profile of 43 women interviewed with post-abortion complications Interviews with women with post-abortion complications (n=43) Age 15 to 19 3 20 to 24 6 25 to 29 12 30 to 34 11 35 or older 12 Marital status Married 40 Separated 2 Widow 1 Type of abortion Induced 18 Pregnancies 1 2 to 4 5 or more 6 21 16 Living children None 8 3 or less 28 4 or more 7 Of those women who agreed to be interviewed as they r ecovered from their pregnancy loss, the youngest was 18 and the oldest 41 years. The average age at marriage was 21 years and most women were in a married or long-term relations hip. More than a third of the women had induced their aborti on on their own or with the help of an abortionist. A quarter of the women had experienced five or more pregnancies- this is a health risk in itself. The majority of women had children alre ady and only 8 had no living children. The characteristics of the women interviewed are very similar to the profiles contained in the medical records held by the Outpatient Depart ment. A point of difference is that more women disclose d inducing abortion during the interview process than is reported in th e case histories taken by health workers in the Outpatient Department. This could be due to a real increase in the numbers of induced abortion cared for by the In-patient Department, as the more complicated the case the more likely an admission. But it could also be th at women disclose their history more readily in an IPD environmen t with longer term contact. 134Other social characteristics - et hnicity, religion, education and employment While the medical records did not record social information, during interviews women were asked about their ethnic iden tity, religion, education, work and the nature of the relationship with the father of the baby. The following table presents this information. Table 14 Social characteristics of inte rviewed women admitted for post-abortion care Social characteristics of women admitted for post-abortion care (n=43) Ethnicity Karen 15 Burman 14 Mon 6 Muslim 6 Rakine 1 Mixed 1 Religion Buddhist 36 Islamic 5 Christian 1 Animist 1 Education Unable to read 8 1 to 4 years 21 5 to 10 years 12 Higher 1 No comment 1 Employment Factory 12 Farmer 9 House duties 8 Sales 6 Servant 3 Construction 2 Other 3 Domestic violence 6 Women defined their own ethnic identity, some stating they had parents from different Burmese ethnic groups. Ethnicity therefore is not necessarily a discrete category. Burmese was the most comm on language spoken and understood, followed by Sgaw Karen. About a quarter of the women interviewed c ould not read basic 135Burmese or Karen languages and the rest onl y had three to four years of school. The vast majority of women interviewed were Buddhists but most religious beliefs were represented. Most of the women were in paid employment and contributed to the family income. Only nine out of thirty -five women in paid employment had valid work permits. Six women disclosed do mestic violence in their relationship. Time and location in Thailand The Burmese living outside the camps in Th ailand are generally regarded as migrant workers, transient in nature, who quickly re turn to Burma (Caouette et al., 2000; Paul et al., 1997). Figure 11 shows the length of time spent in Thailand. The majority of the women were long-term residents with three years or more in Thailand. Eight women were recent arrivals under one year. Most of the women lived in the local town or on a farm in the rural area and two women came directly from Burma for their post-abortion care.

The level of education and literac y, the relative stabil ity, location and the languages spoken by the community assists with targeting health se rvices. Most of th e women were working wives in factories and farms. But not all Burmese migrant communities are similar.46 The characteristics of Thai and Burmese women requiring PAC are different. In 1999, the Ministry of Public Health conducte d a large study of abortion in Thailand (Nongluck Boonthai & Warakamin Suwanna, 2000) . It surveyed 787 public hospitals in 76 provinces in Thailand over a period of one year, and include d all women with a spontaneous or induced abortion, categorised as legal or illegal before 28 weeks (7 months). Monthly reports fr om hospitals were collected and women were interviewed. There were just under 46,000 abortions admitted into the research hospitals that year. The monthly reports may have contained data on other nationa lities but the 4,588 women interviewed were all Thai. The au thors found that 28.5% of abortions were classified as induced by monthly report but this figure increased to 40.4% when women were interviewed. This is similar to my findings that the records underestimate the number of induced abortions . But in contrast to Burmese women, Thai women with an induced abortion were more often single (61%), teenagers (30%), not in paid work (42%) and just under ha lf were experiencing their first pregnancy (48%); a quarter of the Thai women interv iewed were still comp leting school. During this year, five Thai women died of aborti on complications in the whole country. This is a very different pattern of abortion to the figures for Burmes e women's experience of abortion. Burmese women experiencing a bortion tend to be working wives, with low levels of education and life security. Only 10% of Burmese women were aged 20 or younger at the time of the abortion a nd three quarters of the women had living children; they were mothers already. 46 The study undertaken in Ranong showed localised di fferences in that in this community they stayed for shorter periods of time, and women were unpaid housewives (81%) who often did not participate in the fishing industry, although average incomes were al so very low (Paul et al., 1997). This could be due to real differences in local experiences or sa mpling issues in the research. All populations and local communities differ in their social and demographic characteristics and the women who would benefit from reproductive health interventions are a diverse group. 138Fertility management by trial and error During interviews in both heal th facilities, women spoke of their attempts to control their fertility which often culminated in induced abortion. Desired family size, knowledge and experience with traditional a nd modern methods of contraception and interactions with their husb and were discussed. Most women responded to questions about which types of contraception they knew and used, who they talked with and some of the problems they had encountered. This level of detail was far richer than could have been gained by survey met hods where a ticked box may convey that the woman is confident and conve rsant with the method. The most startling finding was the differen ce in contraception supplied to women on leaving the health facility. The Mae Sot Ge neral Hospital requires women to return to the outpatient family planning clinic 6 week s after discharge from hospital where she may receive a modern temporary method of contraception. To prevent a further pregnancy, contraception needs to be comm enced within two weeks of a pregnancy loss (World Health Organization & Divi sion of Reproductive Health [Technical Support], 1997). The Thai obstetrician was neve r able to tell me wh at percentage of women with any type of post-abortion comp lication returned to the family planning clinic. The following table summarises the method of contraception offered to women at the time of discharge from both health facilities. Table 15 Post-abortion contra ception offered to Burmese wo men by place of discharge Method of contraception Mae Sot General (17 women) Mae Tao Clinic (26 women) Nothing offered 13 0 Tubal ligation 3 9 Condom 0 7 Depo injection 0 7 Woman declines 1 2 Not needed 0 1 139 They offered tubal ligations to 3 out of 17 women who accepted on an inpatient basis. It is unclear how they managed to gain in formed consent due to the language barrier in these cases. One woman spoke of her expe rience of deciding to be sterilised in the Mae Sot General Hospital: The staff didn't tell me anything about sterili sation they just said, 'Better if you have sterilisation and you don't need to pay becau se you have the 30 Baht card.' So I decided to do it. People talk about it in th e community so that's how I knew about it. Really I've had enough of pills and childr en. I understand that you cannot reverse it. My husband doesn't know yet about my decision but I sent a message to him though my son and daughter. The procedure was not explai ned to her. She was unabl e to contact her husband and went ahead with the procedure assuming he would agree with her decision. Women with complicated induced abortions left the Mae Sot General Hospital with no better understanding of fa mily planning than when they were admitted and were given no supplies to take home. Women sa id they were given no information or education about family planning methods while on the ward. The only information they received was from talking with ot her female patients and sharing their experiences: I don't know about family planning but th e other patients talked about the three months pills. The nurses did not talk to me or give me anything to read about family planning. I have no friends to talk with so I don't find out this information. The hospital didn't tell me about family pl anning or show me anything either. In contrast, the Mae Tao Clinic offe red women information, education and counselling about modern methods of contra ception. Twenty-three women out of 26 women accepted, tubal ligations, condoms, or depot-injections. Two women declined any family planning method. One woman wa s newly widowed and we classified her as not needing contrace ption immediately. The vast difference in acceptance of a m odern method cannot be explained by length of stay. The records show that three quart ers of women admitted for PAC in the Mae Sot General Hospital stay for at least 3 days and it was slightly longer, 4 to 5 days at the Mae Tao Clinic. Language is an obvious difference and very few Thai nurses or 140doctors could speak a Burmese language. Health workers who have multiple languages with sophisticated skills are useful health promoters (Whelan, Johnson, Noble, & Matthews, 2000). The major issues that emerged during the interviews were women's lack of knowledge and information about fertility management. Many had never heard about the concept of planning a family or spacing babies, some had heard of it but had never seen contraceptives, and others had partic ular difficulties with the methods they had tried. Those women who had lived in Thaila nd for several years were better informed about modern methods of contraception. A few hear about where to purchase supplies from friends or relatives and attemp t to find them in Thailand. The level of information they receive is minimal and they learn by trial and error. For example, one woman who had oral contraception in the past became pregnant while breastfeeding as she assumed she could not conceive whilst her baby was still suckling. Many women frankly admitted not knowing about the notion of planning the number of children; they said they only understood that the babies came every year. Here a woman describes her growing understanding of modern methods of contraception: I never knew anything about family planning. My friends told me to take the tablets that have the hands pointing and arrows on the packets. I never saw that before. My husband heard about it from his friends and he told me to go and get the injections. I don't know if it is good or bad. I never used it. I asked one of the nurses if I could get the injections here and she told me that I could. I said to them, well give me that injection! Access to reliable methods of contracep tion was difficult for women, both finding supplies but also the cost. Women talk ed about their difficulties purchasing contraception in Burma and Thailand. A Mon woman with a history of five pregnancies and three births said: So now I think I would like to use the on ce-a-month pill but I don't know where to get it in Mae Sot. They don't give it at the Mae Tao Clinic. I heard from my friends that it is available in Thailand but the prices are different - sometimes 20 Baht or even 60 Baht per tablet. I don't know why the price changes... All the women on the ward talk about sterilisation because it is easy to do here and very difficult in Burma. Only rich people can afford it in Burma b ecause it costs 12,000 Kyats (1,200 Baht). I 141come from a small village, nobody there can afford sterilisation so we have too many babies or we do abortions. 47 A 28-year-old Karen woman w ith a history of five pre gnancies and four births discussed the police activity which made it difficult for her to travel: I came for antenatal care and they told me about family planning. I do understand about family planning and we used condoms. But the police were always arresting people so it was difficult to pick up supplies here at the clinic. I did try to buy oral pills from the market. I took oral pills but I got pregnant at the same time. In some interviews, women talked about deciding whether to buy food for the family or contraception. One Muslim woman, with a history of seven pregnancies who induced her abortion by inserting a ba mboo shard into her vagina, said: After the last miscarriage I took htou: zei for nine months. Then I went back to Burma for two months and I got pregnant because the htou: zei ran out. I couldn't afford 1,700 Kyats for the ampoule. Women complained of body aches, stiff neck, erratic bleeding, weight loss, headaches, vomiting, dizziness and genera lly feeling unwell whilst taking hormonal contraceptives. This woman describes th e prolonged side-effects of injectable hormones: I used the once a month pill and I liked it. It didn't cause me any problem. I tried to use the everyday pills for just one month when I was in Thailand but I felt sick and my hair started to fall out. So I stopped and took htou: zei . I had it twice and then I bled for a year and a half afterwards. I would bleed for twenty days of every month, quite heavy like a period. Some women forgot to take pills everyday, and others said they were scared of needles. While the uptake of modern methods of contraception was very good from the Mae Tao Clinic, Rose and I encountered problems with the style of pos t-abortion fertility 47 If the woman is referred from the Mae Tao Clinic to the Mae Sot General Hospital the cost of a tubal ligation is between 600 to 1200 Baht to cover the cost s of materials, but otherwise the normal cost is 3,000 Baht. Vasectomy now costs 100 Baht in the Mae Sot General Hospital and 200 Baht at the Mae Tao Clinic to cover the cost of materials. During 2001 and 2002 it was free. The cost of an IUCD insertion is 50 Baht. 142counselling, which was often directed by the health workers rather than being woman- centred. A 28 year old Mon woman who ende d her first pregnancy with a stick from the l\u00e8 the : The nurses told me about condoms, pills and htou: zei . They said, 'You will forget to take pills and if we give you htou: zei it will take a long time to get pregnant and you will have a problem. Condoms are best for you.' They haven't given me any supplies yet. I don't know what they will give me. I think I can remember how to take a pill every morning but I didn't say that to the nurse. I don't know when my fertility will return, the nurse didn't say but I would like to try for another baby in seven months or so. My husband has never used condoms before...I think he will use them [she looks away]. I have lost a lot of blood a nd the nurses didn't tell me how to look after myself. And another woman: I never heard about family planning but lear nt about it in Thailand. I don't know the names of the tablets. Mao Tao Clinic gave me some education about all this. They said the condom was the best method for me. The nurse said, 'Take a rest for six months or two years before trying again.' These rather typical encounters of didact ic 'counselling', without asking what the woman herself thought, were not unusual, and often Rose and I would mediate between health workers and patient as it became clear that the method the woman was about to receive was entirely the health worker's decision. Occasionally, although the staff had explained the method, the woman remained confused and not confident. This is due in-part to the skil l level of the staff but also that they were often dealing with illiterate women with very low education who had never seen modern contraceptives. Maternal morbidity a nd mortality mystery Most women survive the abortion experien ce but in some cases hospital level treatment and life-saving interventions are needed (Reproductive Health in Conflict Consortium, 2004). Maternal mortality is higher in Burmese women than in Thai women although this is difficult to establish from the national figures. Nationally, the deaths of Thai women are recorded; in 1998, 68 Thai women were recorded as 143maternal deaths (7.6/100,000), 10 of whom di ed due to abortion related complications (Ministry of Public Health, 2000). Whittaker (2004) records the deaths from abortion as 28 (1992) and 14 (1994) nati onally. The trend is a falling one. Data from the Ministry of Health show that in Tak provi nce maternal mortality is low. In 2001, three women died, in 2000, one woman died, in 1999 no women died, in 1998, one woman died and 1997, two women are recorded as dead (Ministry of Public Health, 2003). I record fourteen women (two were Hmong) dying in one hospital alone over a two year period and it appears that Burm ese women's maternal mortality is not recorded at the national level. In di scussion with Kuhn Nongluk Boonthai from the Ministry of Health, she confirms that onl y women holding a Thai identity card are processed in the public health statis tics for Thailand (Nongluck Boonthai & Warakamin Suwanna, 2000). I also approach ed the managers of the international humanitarian health organisations who are responsible for providing medical services and none responded to assist with the unde rstanding of maternal mortality. There remain many mysteries. The death of a pregnant woman is a highly sensitive issue for hospital staff and I was not always able to have full and frank di scussions as I would have wished. There were no autopsies or coroners enquiries into the deaths of these women, and when I tried to do an informal verbal autopsy to ascertain the cause of death, the obstetrician was hesitant to discuss cases . His expressed fe ar was that I would go to the media with the story. The following three cases taken from the hospita l medical records in the year 2001 demonstrate the morbidity and mo rtality associated with abortion in this area. Case A from the Mae Sot General Hospital record review A 20-year-old Burmese woman, with he r second pregnancy and one previous birth, is five months pregnant and is se nt to hospital due to the complications associated with self-indu ced abortion. She arrives at hospital with lung and urinary tract infections as well as sep ticaemia. Her haemoglobin is 6g/dl and she needs an operation to assess her pelv ic cavity (laparotomy). She is given misoprostol (Cytotec) tablets and a cu rette of the uterus to remove the products of the pregnancy. She stays in hospital for twenty-seven days and the 144hospital bill is 18,700 Baht (US $435). Th is sum is equivalent to about eleven month's income for a Burmese wo man. She is discharged home. Case B from the Mae Sot General Hospital record review A 28-year-old Burmese woman, with her si xth pregnancy and a history of five previous births, is admitted to hospital with an abscess in her pelvic cavity after having an induced abortion. She has an opera tion to drain the abscess and to check her internal organs. The abortion has not perforated her uterus. She spends eleven days in hospital and it costs 12,164 Baht (US $283). This sum is equivalent to about six month's income for a Burmese woman. She is discharged home. Case C from the Mae Sot General Hospital record review A 23-year-old Burmese woman, with her first pregnancy in the fifth month, comes to the Mae Tao Clinic with a high fever, low blood pressure, vaginal bleeding and pain. She is dehydrated and weak and the health workers can feel a mass in her abdomen. She labours and the baby is delivered dead. She is referred to hospital where she receives four units of bloo d transfused after recording a haemoglobin level of 5g/dl . She is septic, her blood system collapses, she has pulmonary oedema and she dies with a car diac arrest. The Mae Sot General Hospital staff commen ce resuscitation but are unsuccessful. She spends three days in hospital before her death and her hospital bill is 9,700 Baht (US $225). Mae Tao Clinic has limited funds to pay the Thai public health system for any type of referral to hospital, including emergency obste tric care. Various a nnual reports note that 67% of referrals to the Mae Sot General Hospital are due to obstetric or gynaecological reasons and the clinic can onl y afford to pay for two-thirds of the cases they currently refer (Maung, 2002a, 2003). I reviewed the records of women who di ed whilst pregnant during 2001 and 2002. The cause of death was not al ways clearly stated and the records were not complete. In a case of 'indirect' maternal de ath a Hmong woman who was HIV positive suicided by drinking pestic ide. Another 33-y ear-old Burmese woman who died in July 2002, was diagnosed with a perforated uterus due to induced abortion. She was 145grossly septic with blood-clotting changes (DIC), was also HIV positive and had malaria - to attribute this woman's death to one simple cause is impossible. One Burmese woman, 27 years old with her s econd pregnancy, was referred from Nu Po refugee camp with a perforated uterus and sepsis as well as leprosy. There was no referral letter in the case notes and the Thai doctor could not recall the details. She died on the 30th July 2002. The figure below shows my analysis of the cause of death after reading the medical records an d discussions with the obstetrician. Infection 1 womanHaemorrhage 2 womenMalaria 3 womenAnaemia/Heart failure 1 womanSuicide 1HIV 1 Obstructed Labour 2 womenUnsafe abortion 3 women Figure 12 Causes of 14 cases of maternal mort ality in the Mae Sot General Hospital during 2001 to 2002 Malaria and unsafe abortion are the major kille rs of pregnant women in Tak province, closely followed by obstructed labour and h aemorrhage. Many of these deaths are preventable and the fact that no Thai wo men died is significan t. Billings and colleagues (Huntington & Piet-Pelon, 1999:142) note the barriers to surviving an obstetric emergency: Whether women receive prompt care for complications due to unsafe abortion depends upon a variety of individual, social, economic, and political factor, including women's economic and educational status, gendered-power relations, perceptions of illness, distance between women's homes and the closest facility with providers trained and equipped to provide emergency car e, availability of transport, cost of services, and availability and quality of care. According to the 'three delays' model, developed by Thaddeus and Maine (1990) th ese factors influence three key moments in the process of seeking and providing care, when delays may occur in making the decision to seek care reaching a health car e facility with providers trained and equipped to offer services; and receiving adequate treatment upon arrival to the facility. 146My impression from the medical notes is th at the Mae Sot General Hospital staff give all possible medical treatment to these women. Multiple medications, intensive observations, oxygen, operations, blood transfusions and so forth were all charted and resuscitation attempts documented. Most wo men died very shortly after admission into the hospital and were seriously ill, if not moribund on admission. In essence, they came too late and were already beyond th e ability of bio-medicine to save their lives. The question arises: why the delay in coming to hospital when the infrastructure of Thailand is very good? Some internal research conducted through the Monitoring and Evaluation Project funded by the Women' s Commission for Refugee Women and Children demonstrated that women who attended the Mae Tao Clinic often did not know the warning signs of the complications of pregnancy such as oedema, headaches, upper gastric pain, cl ear or bloody vaginal loss, reduced foetal movements and so on. Possibly women do not know the complication signs of an early pregnancy loss either, but observationa l research of how women live and move through the area, as well as their concerns expressed during interviews, uncover a loss of the basic human right to freed om of movement and security. 48 In Tak province Burmese men also are restricted by the re gular road and house checks by Thai police and soldiers. In Tak province, where pol ice and other law enforcement agencies monitor movement of undocumented people, educational posters and radio shows are not enough to ensure women do not delay vi siting a skilled health worker. Migration, security and working conditions Three major issues relating to the lived c ontext emerged from the interview data. I have aggregated the responses of women interviewed in the hospital and Mae Tao Clinic setting, as well as their husbands and the Burmese health workers. They were dominant themes for all people. Migrati on, security and working conditions were repeatedly mentioned and influenced wo men's access to health information and services. 48 Article 15, point 4 of CEDAW states, that women should have freedom to move in the same way as men; drawing on the earlier Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) Article 13 point 1. 147All of the Burmese respondents I interviewed were born in Burma and had traveled to Thailand. The reasons for leaving Burma i nvolved a mixture of poor social-economic conditions, lack of life opportunities and po litical crisis. Some people talked of human rights abuses and c onflict. On balance, people said that the dreadful conditions in Burma rather than any desire to travel in Burma motiv ated them to move. People reported that life in Thailand was difficult but they endured it for many reasons and most planned to return to Bu rma. Some wanted to escape human rights abuses or wait for democracy to emerge; others needed to feed themselves and their families and found it was impossible to do so in Burma even if they had a job. They had not intended to migrate for life - in es sence they felt compelled or forced to migrate. People described hardships, political oppres sion, and conflict in Burma; not being able to make ends meet despite working hard, having jobs or even their own small businesses. This Karen woman lives in a rural area close to th e border after running from Karen State. She and her husband were able to find work for accommodation: I have lived in (name of village Tak prov ince) for six months. I came here because I had to run away from the SPDC and the DKB A. I don't know how long I will be here. My husband and I live on a corn farm. I don't know how much they will pay me. The pay will come at the end of the year. They give us somewhere to live and food. Maybe they won't pay us. Although they are refugees according the Refugee Convention definition they do not receive UNHCR protection, but instead work without payment on a farm. Refugees who live in camps have access to a minimum standard of health services but those classified as migrant workers, especia lly if undocumented, find it difficult to access services (Caouette, 2000; Pim Koetsa wang, 2001). Not all people who have experienced extreme fear classify as c onvention refugees and while the following story is dramatic, this woman would probabl y not be accepted as a refugee as she has not personally experienced a f ear of persecution. She is a 25-year-old Karen woman has lived in the town for seven years, a nd in the following extract, talks about the events of 1988 and the murder of her father. My father died during the democracy upris ing in Rangoon in 1988. We were so poor, many people started to loot the shops. My mother tried to stop him from going. But he said we need a roof so I am going to get some iron for us. The 22nd Battalion 148came to that area during the uprising and my father was on top of the roof and the soldiers called him to come down. He came down and they told him he could go. He turned around to leave and they shot him in the back of the head. The back of his head opened and his eyes came out. He fell to the ground shaking. The soldier walked over to him and kicked him in the chest and then he was dead. I was only 11 at the time but at that moment I was selling food in the central train station in Rangoon. I heard the gunshots and I started cryi ng. I knew my father was at this shop and I called him to come. He didn't listen and he didn't come. I stayed selling my food and suddenly I heard a very loud gun shot . I think this is when they shot him. My father's friends ran to my mother to get her and she saw him. Our neighbours told me what had happened. I cried a lot. Not every Burmese has a story of oppre ssion or persecution, for many, extreme poverty forces migration. A recently widowed woman was a small business entrepreneur in Burma but gave it up to liv e in Thailand. She says that she had to come to Thailand to be with her husband as she could not live on the income from her shop. She reports that people could not a fford to buy vegetables. A Karen woman who lives in a rural area describes her efforts to feed her family: When I lived in Burma I didn't have enough food for my family. I couldn't make enough money. I sold snacks that I had made myself and in one day I would make 40 or 50 Kyats. On a good day I could make 100 Kyats. Then I would buy food for the family but there was never enough. I ne ver had my own house. We never had enough in our family. In Thailand I have enough money for food for one day. I don't have a real house I live in a hut. I never wa nt to go back to Burma but sometimes I do visit my parents for a couple of weeks. I don't want to stay there. I worked here growing rice and my husband paints othe r people's houses. He can make 150 Baht per day. I can make 75 Baht per day and to gether that is enough money for food. I cannot work in the field all the time because the demand for my labour is not there all the time. A Muslim woman who induced her own aborti on and is an itinerant farmer with four living children, laments that her husband 'drinks everyda y' and earns only 60 Baht (US $1.40) per day. But in Burma it was worse, they could not balance their household budget even though she sold chillies, cooking oil and salt from village to village. Finally, this Burman woman fr om Rangoon talks about living in the capital city of Burma and trying to pr ovide for her four children: We had so many problems that is why we came to Thailand. We need to earn more money. The rice is so expensive in Rangoon. I have children to feed. Nothing is enough for living. When I was in Rangoon I sold small quantities of vegetables and earned 400-500 Kyat per day. My husband can do any kind of job such as building or farming and he made some money. We deci ded to come here. I have been here only ten days and some of that was in hospital. I only worked for two days on the farm and I got 70 Baht and my husband got 80 Baht. 149 The deteriorating economic conditions in rura l and urban areas in Burma are cited by men and women as strong reasons to leav e the country. Burma's failing economy and food scarcity are well documented and c ontribute to poor health, malnutrition and people accepting smuggling practices to enter Thailand for paid work (Asian Migrant Centre & Migrant Forum in Asia, 2003; Fe deration of Trade Unions-Burma, 2002; World Bank, 1995 to 2002).49 Going home People had lived in Thailand for varying am ounts of time as already stated but most dream of going home to Burma often with their economic goals met or when the socio-political situation in Burma improves. Very few people seem concerned with any immigration regulations that Thailand may devise and only comment that the work permit, while expensive is worthwhile to have for the pe rceived security and safety if offers. Very few people say they do not want to go back and in the majority of cases the migration is perceived as temporary. These two men are running from their past. This father of three with eight years of schooling recounts his situation: Then the 1988 uprising happened and most of the Burmese agreed with having a democratic country. We voted to get a democr atic system and a party into power. As I was a soldier I voted. If you go to school you understand the meaning of democracy so I voted for democracy. At the moment I cannot go back to Burma because everyone knows I was a soldier. Deserters get shot. This husband with ten years of schooling who now works in a factory with his wife who has had two induced abortions lamented: This situation is bad in Burma and we were poor so that is why we came here. After we were married we didn't have any mone y and our parents couldn't afford to look after us so we came to Thailand to get work . When I lived in Burma I sold things but 49 Human smuggling or trafficking is common and most people need the assistance of an employment broker to cross the border and lo cate a job. Thai and Burmese work as traffickers and Thai police are frequently implicated in organising illegal employm ent. The fee to engage a human smuggler is between 2,500 Baht to 6,000 Baht (Caouette et al., 2000; Federation of Trade Unions-Burma, 2002) 150money was tight. My parents did support us to sell things. I spent a lot of money and I didn't save any. I cannot go back to Burma. But one does not have to be a deserter, de mocracy supporter, or in debt to find it difficult to return home. Burmese can be imprisoned according to a 1947 law for seven years if they are found to have le ft the country without permission (Asian Migrant Centre & Migrant Forum in Asia, 2003). For ced migration has serious implications for health and specificall y reproductive health (Leiter, 2004). Security Security issues are mentioned frequently by participants. Notions of citizenship and safety often focus on the ownership of a wo rk permit. Although this does not always appear to confer secu rity in reality, people feel safer if they had one. The respondents mention scrutiny by Thai police officers and express fear of them and deportation to Burma. People often compare safety at hom e in Burma with that in Thailand, and depending on where the person is from, this perception changes. The majority feel that while Thailand is not safe for them, it is on the whole safer and more secure than Burma. I use the word secu rity in the holistic sense of knowing where the next meal will come from, the ability to find work, a sense of community, hope for the future and feeling of control over life. But secu rity also invokes the threat of police harassment, fines and forced deportation. People use security in both of these ways, to include personal safety and the ability to go about life in a normal way, such as working, visiting friends and the temple and social freedom. Women express worry and fear while in Th ailand. Women speak of feeling scared while living in Thailand. They are worried about not having work permits and being arrested by the police. Wome n who hold work permits feel safer but not entirely. One Karen woman says she feel s safe when she is with her family in Burma but that she knows that they could be forced to pay 'taxes' or to porter. Many people talk about the types of taxation th at operate in Burma and they blame taxation or forced labour as the reason to leave as they can not survive. Once in Thailand they are 'fined' by Thai police who often take bribes if they discover the Burmese person has no papers. A woman from Mon State with an intra-uterine death at six months whispered: 151 Sometimes we have to be careful in Thaila nd. It is safe but we don't always have freedom to move around here. We can move around in Burma but there is no work. In Burma I go to the temple during the full moon but I don't here because I worry about my security. The rights to association or movement ar e fundamental but many forced migrants didn't feel they had any rights in Tha iland. One husband complained, 'Even though I have a work permit here I cannot say that I have freedom in Thailand. We are not free.' Men spoke of a feeling of insecurity and vulnerability in Thailand; they felt they had no protection under Thai law. The perceived and real restriction of m ovement causes many problems, especially when trying to access health care. This was made apparent to me one day when I met Hassinah, a 27-year-old Muslim woman w hose relationship with her immature and irresponsible husband had deteriorated to the point of separation. She induced her own abortion and sat for two days at hom e in a puddle of blood, feverish and very unwell. I saw her in her house and asked her to come with me to the Mae Tao Clinic for a health check. She initially refused but with the help of ne ighbours we eventually persuaded her to move. After her treatm ent and when she was well, she explained that she had no means to travel to the Clinic, no money to pay either ticket or a 'fine' if she was detected. Fathers of new babies commented that th eir families would starve in Burma even though they had work skills and could get jobs . They said they could not earn the same amount of money as they could in Thailand and there was not any security in Burma. The women concurred. 'I feel safe r in Thailand. In Thailand only one person has to work to support the family but in Burma even if the whole family works you won't have enough food. If I need health care I can go to the Mae Tao Clinic for free.' Men and women said that it was possi ble to feed a family in Thailand but even if they had work in Burma it was not possible. Some women linked notions of security and plans for children in the fu ture. Women spoke of having enough money before getting pregnant. 152There are places where some Burmese feel safe. One woman with an induced abortion after living five months in Thailand said: I am not worried about being in Thailand. You don't see the police on the farms. My boss is good to us. If I want to stay here my boss would build a little hut with me but really I want to go back to Burma. It is possible for some employers to offer protection from the police. Working and living conditions The working and living conditions in Thailand were poor and the average incomes less than the Thai standard. The conditions of labour for Thai workers and registered migrant workers are regulated by the Labour Protection Act 1998 and the Thai Constitution 1997. In theory there is an eight hour day, mandated holidays, stipulated rest periods, a minimum wage and no ge nder discrimination in wages (Darunee Paisanpanichkul, 2001), but in practice this is not so (Aung Su Shin, 2003b; Caouette, 2000; Pim Koetsawang, 2001). The minimum da for Chiangmai Province is 144 Baht [3,456 Baht per month - US $80] (Caouette et al., 2000) and for Tak Province is 133 Baht [3,192 Baht per mont h - US $74] (Aung Su Shin, 2003b). The wages received by the women I interviewed were below this level and corresponded with those reported by the Federation of Tr ade Unions (Federation of Trade Unions- Burma, 2002). When workers attempt to organi se to defend their ri ghts retribution is harsh (Kyaw Zwa Moe, 2003, 2004; Manning, 2003) . Despite this many people said they had enough money for food and rent and even some left to save and remit to Burma. Women's wages were nearly always less than men's even for similar work. Nearly all the women interviewed said they we re in paid employment or wanted to be in order to earn an income. Women co mmonly find employment in factory work in the garment industry, as farm labourers, construction workers, vendors, or house servants. Women had clear understandings of the financial situation of their family and knew their husband's income - they monitored the house budget closely. They complained if men spent income on alcohol or they could not meet debt repayments. No woman I interviewed reported doing sex-work, al though another local NGO provided me with the transcripts of 17 sex-workers. 153Some complained that the work affected their health, it made them tired, or their body ached. Some women mentioned that they worked in fields where pesticide and chemicals were sprayed or their husbands did. Skilled workers or those with experience could earn larger incomes but they were subject to the availability of work which was irregular or seasonal. People dr eamed of their future and tried to save money to begin their own businesses or to buy land in Burma. Twelve women out of 43 reported working in the factories around Mae Sot. Here, a Karen woman describes her work and pay: My husband and I came here to work in the factory because we couldn't make ends meet in Burma. We have been here 8 mont hs. When we have a little bit of money we will go back but I don't know when that will be. We work at the looms in the sweater factory. We get paid by piece work. We can earn 2,000 Baht each per month. Another woman Mon, with no children and su ffering a miscarriage is in a similar situation: I earn 2,000 Baht per month and my husba nd earns a little more than me. I got married here. Working in the factory does not affect my health but it does make me very tired. I work at the knitting machine and it makes my muscles ache. When we have a big order we have to work fast and for very long hours. The factory work is skilled and unskille d. One Karen woman I interviewed trains staff in a knitwear factory to use the m achines, and her husband has a good income and a work permit. He can earn 8,000 Ba ht (US $186) per month. But other Burman couples work for considerably less. One couple pack clothes in the factory, earning 50 Baht (US $1.16) per day or a monthly in come of 2,400 Baht (US $56), some of which supports their young daughter in Bu rma. And another working couple whose combined income is 5,280 Baht (US $122) per month says: In Thailand I can earn 85 Baht (US $2) pe r day and my husband earns 135 Baht (US $3) in the Thai factory. This is enough to live on but we don't manage to save much. We earn money and then buy food and then the money is gone. 154 Plate 17 Caring for the family is di fficult in shanty type accommodation Plate 18 Struggling to feed her family in Mae Sot (2002) 155Women factory workers describe a fluctu ating income. A Burman woman only married for six months explains: I came to Thailand to earn some money and I knew that it was easier to get than in Burma. I have lived here five years and I go back home once every year. I work in the factory. I earn about 4,000 Baht per m onth is there is good work but other times just 2,000 Baht. In April the orders came in and for several months I earned very well. I sold food in Burma and I could earn 400-500 Kyats but that is not enough to feed myself. With low wages and a variable income, it is difficult to plan for the future. A Thai researcher (Chuthatip Maneepong, 2003:158) interested in economic theories of development concluded that small busine sses on the border with few employees are excluded from complying with the regulated payment system of Thailand. Some employers paid 'slightly less than the minimum daily wage' and covered health treatments, lent money and assisted the work ers' welfare. She concedes that most businesses in Mae Sot only pay half of th e minimum daily wage to their Burmese workers, 'because there are no rules and re gulations requiring a minimum daily wage for migrant labour.' Maneepong is incorrect in thinking that there are no regulations for registered migrant workers. All workers in Thailand are covered by work regulations (Darunee Paisanpanichkul, 2001). Maneepong does acknowledge that cheap labour assists economic development but fa ils to tell us that her informants, the business owners in Mae Sot, employed their staff illegally in direct violation of the Thai law. The researcher acknowledges sh e did not interview workers but spoke only with employers and local officials. Farm work A further nine women of 43 reported working on farms. Farm work is paid minimally, is seasonal and the pay varies. A Burman woman said, 'We've only been here eight months and we work on a farm. We are bo th paid 80 Baht (US $2) per day. It is enough. I send a little money home for my child ren in Burma. We think we will stay for one more year here.' This means th is couple together ea rn 4,480 Baht (US $104) per month. A wife's income is necessary. Another couple with two children earn 6,300 Baht (US $146) together. 156 Plate 19 Police arrest Bu rmese passengers (2002) Plate 20 Burmese worker s on the farm (2001) 157The husband is a house painter and the wife a rice farmer . But farm work takes a physical toll and one woman said that she woul d have to take two months off work to recoup her strength after her complicated induced abortion. Fourteen women worked in various areas of unskilled work in the construction industry, sales or as house-servants for Th ais which is extremely poorly paid. A 19- year-old woman talks about her work: I couldn't find a job in Burma and I lived with my mother. I don't know how long I will stay here. I've been here six weeks. I work as a maid for a Thai family. I never did this job before. I wash, clean and c ook for the family. I earn 1,000 Baht per month. One Karen woman and her husband explai ned that she and her husband can earn 3,920 Baht (US $91) per month and have surv ived for seven years in town. Some women wash laundry for 30 to 40 Baht per da y, sell illegal lottery tickets or make charcoal. One enterprising Burman wo man developed her own business and her husband helps her when he can: I sell things and cook curries and take them to the factories for the workers to buy. In Thailand I can make 100 Baht per day and pl enty to eat. I don't know if I will go back to Burma. I think I may go back when I have enough money to set up a business there. I don't want to starve there again. My husband does construction work or helps me with my sales. From these statements it is clear that wome n are part of the inco me generating team of the family. As Muecke (1984) points out Thai women began in the 1970s to participate in income generation by migrating to employment and the traditional benefits of children diminished. The income earned by Burmese women is used for food, rent and daily necessities of life, while some is sa ved for the future and often remitted to family and children still in Burm a. Remittances to Burma are estimated to be considerable, and one source quotes a figure of 1.2 US$ bill ion annually (Asian Migrant Centre & Migran t Forum in Asia, 2003). Just as domestic servant work is one of the lowest paying jobs in Thailand, homemaking is also under-valued. Eight women did stay at home and complete house duties and they tended to regard thei r work caring for children or cooking as 158nothing or valueless, and they often referre d to times when they had earned income for the family. The women who had no paid work stated they 'only' looked after the children, cooked, cleaned and car ed for their family. The men who were interviewed with their wives' permission supported the women's accounts of life and work in Thailand. They talked about the low pay, the unstable income, the loss of income if anyone in the family was i ll and their dreams of savings and returning to Burma. Men were often the sole carer of women in the Mae Tao Clinic as there was no extended family to take on this role. They complained they lost income whenever they took time off work. One Karen man, with no education and two children talked about the Thai perception of the Burmese and his future in Thailand. His wife had indu ced her abortion, had a histor y of two previous induced abortions and had many visits to th e Mae Tao Clinic for 'weakness': I don't think Thai people like Burmese people. They think we steal their jobs. I feel that Thai people look down on us. I don't know anything about Burma now because I have lived and worked here for a long time now. I think that if the political situation changes I want to go back to Burma. No w I just don't know where I will end up - there is no future here. It is safer here d espite the situation here for Burmese people. Thailand is good for me because I can wo rk and earn enough for the day. The education system is better. In fact most things are better. In sum, while there are strongly held assumptions about which type of women experience pregnancy losses these were at odds with the women interviewed. The women admitted for post-abortion care, spoke of their fundamental contribution to family income and concerns for their secur ity as working wives and mothers. It is important to have a profile of not only th e numbers of women but their attributes. Preventative public health measures and pl anning for health services requires an understanding of who attend s health services for PA C. The women who would benefit from public health informati on on family planning, and the problems associated with induced abor tion, are women who are working on the factories, farms, construction sites and brothels. Many of the women already have children and are attempting to delay their next pregnancy wh ile they feed their current extended and dislocated families. They often work w ithout regulation or o fficial recognition of being in Thailand. Their education levels are low and they speak several Burmese languages. While information and educati on are important, the inability to move 159freely to access health se rvices means women cannot always attend for initial consultations, follow-up care or life-saving procedures. In Tak province, out-reach services into migrant worker's commun ities and workplaces are essential. Despite fear, worry and in securities the Burmese popul ation tolerates living in Thailand and usually plans their return home with some savings. The Burmese population outside of the camps is a mixed group of people ethnically and religiously. People commented on the lack of life opportunities, grindi ng poverty, political oppression, and human rights abuses wh ich motivated their migration. Many Burmese women reported living in small and large towns in Burma such as Pa an, Mandalay, and even Rangoon before travelling to Mae Sot, so this is not necessarily a rural-urban drift. Many pe ople had work in Burma or even their own farm or small business and despite this could not make a su fficient living to provide for themselves or family. Once in Thailand, various paid work is available to women and even though wages are minimal they are enough to provide some security and savings. Women's income was significant for immediat e family in Thailand and/or extended family back in Burma. Freedom of moveme nt and association is restricted and most people reported feeling safer from Thai author ities if they held a valid work permit. These findings concur with Caouette et al . (2000) study of Burmese migrant workers in Thailand and also about the defining categ ories used to describe groups of Burmese people in Thailand (Caouette & Pack, 2002) . Undocumented migrant workers are rendered non-citizens and their human rights are frequently violated. The results of the medical records review reveal that wome n who attend the out patient service did not return even when requested to do so by staff and thus were denied access to further medical care in the form of physic al assessment as well as counselling and education. This is importa nt in that many women even those who were identified as ending their own pre gnancy, did not receive a modern method of family planning. But even women who were admitted to the Mae Sot General hospital were only supplied female sterilisa tion. The Thai staff gave no information or education while women were on the ward , and expected them to return to the hospital six weeks after discha rge. Recent research in Thailand shows that abortion rates for Burmese women can be reduced by the strategic provision of modern 160methods 2004). The deaths of women who came too late for biomedicine to cure are also important. The Thai hospital is well-equipped to deal with obstetric emergencies but the delay caused by security worries and the nature of undocumented migration inhibits the free movement of individuals. Pregnant Burmese women who die in Thailand are simply a maternal mortality mystery missed only by their relatives. These are the social conditions in which the Burmese women make choices about their reproductive health. Without formal documentation a person does not exist and this is the case on the Thai-Burma border, for without formal id entity papers, passports or work permits women's health is not counted or missed. 161Chapter 6 Jumping shrimp and birds' nests - defining abortion Today, the use of contraception has become not only socially acceptable, but the socially responsible thing to do. Becaus e abortion was left behind - separate, different - campaigns for legal abortion have b een initiated much later, if at all, in most countries. The claim that abortion is not a method of family planning may make sense from the point of view of this history, but not from the point of view of women. Something is clearly wrong if planned paren thood, family planning, fertility control and birth control mean differ ent things to different people (M Berer, 1993:5). In this chapter, I present some of the cat egories of abortion give n by health workers, women and lay midwives. Marg Berer, in the opening quote, righ tly points out that abortion has become 'separate' and 'different' for historical and political reasons; to many women this is an anathema in their lived experience and situated morality. In Tak province, there is no common understand ing of what an abortion is, either by health workers or women. Abortion is ambi guous in sites of low-technology. I argue that definitions and categories have cultura l explanations which make sense and the viability of the embryo, foetus or even neona te, is dependant on th e perceptions of the woman and health care provider. Berer highlights the confus ion between terms regarding the prevention of fertility, and I show that this also exists when abortion is discussed. Local understandings of foet al anatomy and physiology need to be included when analysing pregnancy loss, not just legal or bio-medical categories. 162Excluding opportunities The selection of subjects according to certain criteria is the foundation of research methods but is not always possible. Ra ndomised controlled trials are the gold standard of evidence required of medical research, but in reality this is not always feasible in some settings or with certain research to pics (Baretto et al., 1992; Rychetnik, Frommer, Hawe, & Shiell, 2002). Likewise, ethical guidelines regarding the welfare of research participants are essential but can be unwittingly flouted. My experience of unintentionally interviewing a pregnant woman whom I assumed had recently aborted, taught me about the complexities of research. Choosing research participants according to predetermined cr iteria is not always possible. In Tak province, it is difficult to identify women w ho are aborting or at what stage in the process of abortion they are in, due to cultural understandings, the socio-political environment and the limited access to medical technology. Other research in similar environments does not mention the difficulties inherent in selecting research subjects other than stating that s ecrecy and illegality are barriers (Ankomah et al., 1997; Baretto But Tamang's ( 1996) hospital based survey of 1,241 women does admit to incorrectly classifyi ng 22 women during the research process as well as interviewing 103 women with a threatened abortion: Altogether 1241 abortion cases were covered in the study. Of them 234 were induced abortions, 103 threatened abortions and 904 spontaneous abortions. The follow-up interviews were helpful in detecting and correcting misclassification of 12 abortion cases who, during, the case recruitment stage (Initial Study), had refrained from disclosing the fact that they had actually attempted to terminate the unintended pregnancy and as a result of which, they had to be categorized as spontaneous abortion cases. Later these women confided (sic) the study team that they had resorted to induce abortion. Likewise, 10 induced abortions had to be reclassified as spontaneous abortion cases since they were confident that their case was not a deliberate attempt to terminate the pregnancy but rather a miscarriage. It may be mentioned that such misreporting, withdrawal of previous confession or misclassification of abortion is not at all surprising considering the sensitiveness of the abortion research in the counts, a nd where the women always enjoyed the advantage of either to agree or disagree upon the clinician's diagnosis unless supported by sufficient proof in line with th e clinical criteria for identification of induced abortion (Anand Tamang, 1996:no page number). Tamang sounds slightly resentful that wo men have the final option in defining the pregnancy loss rather than the clinician. Tamang found that 20% of the women 163interviewed in hospital had induced their abortion, which is a somewhat lower rate than for either Thai or Burmese women. An earlier article from 1992 in the same area also used a graduated taxonomy of abor tion 'induced', 'possibly a rate of 10.5% non-spontaneous abortions in women admitted to hospital with abortion related co mplications (Prem J Thapa, Shyam Thapa, & Neera Shrestha, 1992). M yo Mee's case study, below, exemplifies the confusion around self-induced abortion not only for the cl inician and researcher but also for the woman. Myo Mee's case study We interviewed Myo Mee twice at the Mae Tao Clinic after the heal th workers told us that she had induced an abortion and she wa s willing to talk with us. My research assistant Rose was the first to realise that the pregnancy was still viable, and asked me what to do. We apologised to Myo Mee for wasting her time but sh e continued to talk with us. She said she was confused and wo rried and that the nur se had not told her definitively if the pregnancy was finished or not. She said she was not happy and she felt strange. She said that if she had abor ted she would feel happi er. I was confused as well - was the pregnancy viable or not? Initially I felt ann oyed and embarrassed to admit that we had begun interviewing Myo Mee as though her pregnancy was finished while it in fact had continued. Myo Mee, a 28 year old married Mon woman, was two months pregnant and readily admitted that she did not want this pregnancy. She was so determined to end the pregnancy she visited the l\u00e8 the in town twice. In chapter 8 I discuss meeting this abortionist. Myo Mee, a factory worker with no children, taught me to be more thoughtful about cosmopolitan categories. There was no intention to interview women with a threatened abortion. They were excluded fr om the interview crite ria. A threatened abortion is in medical terms a transient epis ode, some small bleed that may or may not terminate the pregnancy. Beischer and M ackay (1986) suggest that 25 to 30% of spontaneous abortions are threatened, and some continue to a 40-week complete pregnancy; others end. The busy health work er tells Rose that Bed 10 is 'induce' as she fills in her charts for the morning. T ogether we sit in the private examination room around the table on plastic chairs. The sunshine streams through the green 164curtains and I can hear the children shou ting outside playing a game. Myo Mee has been married for two months. Her haemoglobi n level is 10.7g/dl so she has not lost too much blood. This is her first visit to Ma e Tao Clinic. Her dark hair is in a loose knot on top of her head. She w ears a pink top with a plain red htamein . She has nail polish on her finger and toe na ils, gold coloured earrings with purple stones. She does not wear any yellow thanakha makeup as she has just come from bathing. Myo Mee tells us her story: The first time I didn't have any pain or bleeding but two days later I got a fever and I couldn't eat. I fe lt sick and wanted to vomit. When I went back to the l\u00e8 the she didn't say anything. She was fr iendly with me. She didn't tell me what she did exactly, except she did say she used the hsei: jou . After two or three hours the stick fell out. I bled a little bit just for one day. There was no pain. The next day I bled and one hta mein was soaked. Then it was on and off. I have been here for eight days and we don't know if the abortion has happened or not. I did this abortion with my husband and he agreed with it. She is worried and says: I have been here for eight days a nd we don't know if the abortion has happened or not...I will leave tomorrow but I still don't know if my baby is alive or dead. This is a terrible proble m and I am really worried. I really want my pregnancy to finish but now I just don't know what is happening. I am not sure if I am still pregnant... The health worker is right. She 'attempted' to induce th e abortion. On examination her cervix is closed. Myo Mee feels anxious because she wants the D&C but is discharged home and admitted fourteen days later when we interview her again. This time she stays for a further four days a nd her blood is tested but her pregnancy continues. I feel sure she is determined to go back to the l\u00e8 the and we talk with her about the risks involved. Five days later she returns agai n, pale and jaundiced with a haemoglobin level of 8.7g/dl. She seems shyer with us this time and not as open to talk. This time her abortion is complete. 165I came back to the clinic after five days to talk with the nurses like they told me to. They said they were still waiting for the blood test. I went away and five days later started bleeding. The pain was extreme and I could not stand it, lots of blood came out. There were big clots. That's when I came back. Something big like a clump came out. I didn't talk with any of my friends or neighbours about this. I didn't take any thwei: zei or do anything. I didn't go back to the l\u00e8 the again. I didn't trust her any more because it didn't work the first time . I gave up. I am not sure why the pregnancy ended. I don't think it was because of the l\u00e8 the . They did the D&C with no anaesthetic. The nurses said it would hurt a bit. I told them I could stand the pain. There were three nurses with me when they did it, it wasn't too bad and they locked the door so I felt safe. I feel happy that this pregnancy is finished now. Myo Mee's case was intriguing but it did not really resonate for me until months later, as I sat though a tedious teaching session at the Mae Tao Clinic on abortion. The teacher stood in front of the class a nd explained each category of abortion: spontaneous, induced, missed, threatened, inco mplete and inevitable - this was basic and I dozed at the back of the class. I noticed that the teache r became muddled and students started to interject, trying to describe each classification. I felt irritated and questioned the ability of the Burmese hea lth workers. My a rrogance tumbled down on me when I was back in Melbourne going through the interviews. On reflection they were difficult to categorise, they did not fit easily with the textbook descriptions of abortion found in cosmopolitan obstetrics and gynaecology. As stated, I made a decision not to intervie w women with 'threaten ed' abortion. I felt very clear about my choice. A woman experiencing a 'threat ened' abortion could continue her pregnancy and would not then be having an 'abortion'. Not only that, it could cause her anxiety and distress and from an ethical stance, I felt it was indefensible. Clinical judgements are not infallible, especially in environments where technology is rare. Mae Tao Clinic does not have ultrasonography (or radiology) and the laboratory ca nnot do a serum HCG pregnancy test and by default, I interviewed several women who were 't hreatening' abortion, which is a liminal state of pregnancy. Much of the research on ethi cal issues and abortion concerns the moral dilemma of choosing abortion (Barnhart, 1998; Maguire, 2003) or the situational 166context within which ethical choices ar e made (Petchesky, 1984; Whittaker, 2002d) but rarely about women who may not be pregnant. Myo Mee's case highlights the process of attempted induced abortion that continues over several weeks. Despite abundant counsel ling and support from the staff, she was determined to end the pregnancy. For wome n, the long process of traditional induced abortion with herbal medicines and pumme lling or sticks can be physically and mentally arduous, especially in an environment of uncertain ty and illegality. There is no defining test of viable pregnancy in th e early stages without reliance on medical technology. Clinicians rely on patient history, clinical examination and their experience in making a diagnosis of aborti on. The clinical signs and symptoms of pregnancy in the first trimester are subjective. Researchers working in areas of low technology or where abortion is substantiv ely illegal should acknowledge that the selection of research subjects will be inconsistent, as only women know if they have attempted to end their pregnancy and they ma y or may not present to be 'researched'. Classification and sequence of abortion Cosmopolitan medical textbooks classify abortio n in specific ways that make sense in context but are not always appropriate. Us ing classifications from other cultures or environments can obfuscate treatment and teaching. Obstetrics and the Newborn (Beischer & Mackay, 1986) begins by maki ng the absolute distinction between spontaneous and induced abortion and then moves on to describe each type and provide a percentage. The classification name is descriptive of the pregnancy outcome. So for example, a 'threatened ab ortion' is a pregnancy where there is an unexpected blood loss before 20 weeks, in wh ich the potential infa nt could be lost (but may not). The majority (50 to 60%) of abortions lost in the first trimester are 'incomplete' and require some pos t-abortion care (See figures 8 & 9). While I could argue the proce ss of abortion is often a cont inuum rather than distinct events as defined in textbooks, I understand that its simplification into a schema assists with treatment decisions. I do not ar gue with this system, but the classification for 'induced abortion' does not represent the events for women who induce their own 167abortions in Tak province. The authors offer just half a page of clinical guidance on complicated induced abortion and do not me ntion the possibility of a continuing pregnancy after an induced abortion, except to note ectopi c pregnancies. Most Australian women have been able to access legal therapeutic abortions for several decades and this is noticeab le in the text book model fo r induced abortion which is deficient in details con cerning unsafe abortion (Beischer and Mackay 1986:141). This cursory discussion of septic aborti on is also found in the seventh edition of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (Llewellyn-Jones, 1999). An induced abortion according to the authors is either 'therapeutic' or 'c riminal' and 'incomplet e' or 'complete'. Specialists in resource rich environments have access to technology to assist their clinical judgement. This is not the cas e for Burmese women or health workers in Thailand and it is confusing to teach it this way to health workers. Where elective abortion is for the most part illegal, as in Tak province, the classification of a pregnancy loss into 's pontaneous' or 'induced ' is in practice difficult even for the most experienced clin ician (Baretto et al ., 1992; Anand Tamang, 1996). As there is no defining clinical or laboratory tests, the diagnosis is a presumptive one made by a combination of the patient's histor y, presentation and clinical examination. Sometimes the diagnos is can only be made in retrospect. The most obvious case is the one where the wo man discloses her abortion method or she has clinical signs such as bruising, traumatised genitals and organs, or a foreign body still in situ. Not all cases are clear. The authors (Baret to et al., 1992) suggestion to classify abortions as 'certain ly' induced, 'probably' induced and 'possibly' induced is a candid self-disclosure of the researcher (or clinician's) fallibility. The experience of the clinician helps but I woul d argue that the health worker's attitude and belief system or prejudices also play a role. This is further complicated when clinician and patient do not speak the same language or share the same culture, as when Burmese women are admitted to the Mae Sot General Hospital. A misdiagnosis between spontaneous and induced abortion can occur. From the 43 interviews with women, I diffe red in diagnosis on 6 occasions and further clarified ambiguous diagnoses on multiple occasions. Health workers frequently omitted to document whether the abortion was either 'spontaneous' or 'induced', and more often relied on the clin ical indications of retain ed products or sepsis as 168descriptors to provide a diagnostic category. In the Mae Sot Hospital I thought two 'criminal' abortions were actually 'spontaneous', two 'incomplete abortions' were 'induced', and one 'incomplete' abortion was 'spontaneous'. He re it must be said that I had the advantage of talki ng with the woman in a privat e room for one hour with a female interpreter, a luxury the Thai medi cal officers did not have. At the Mae Tao Clinic I believed that on one occasion a wo man really induced her abortion when the Burmese health workers wrote 'spontaneous'. To their advantage the Burmese health workers were always able to communicate di rectly with their patients but they often hesitated to classify, also preferring to describe the clinical presentation such as 'septic abortion' rather th an the cause. In these cases of ambiguous causation I clarified a further seven abortions after in terviewing the woman. In several cases of domestic violence, which was rarely docum ented by the health workers, the dilemma of wondering if the pregnancy loss was direc tly or indirectly caused by the violence became apparent; I will talk more about these cases later. The classification of early pregnancy lo ss can not only cause confusion for the clinician and researcher but can have cons equences for the reputation and well-being for the woman, as well as assessing her need for future contraceptive assistance. A 23 year old Mon woman, who had been marri ed for two years and had ceased Depo injections in order to beco me pregnant for the first time, miscarried her two month foetus and was taken to hospital by her Th ai employer. She normally worked in a textile manufacturing factory and she had a wo rk permit. She experienced an infected miscarriage and the malodorous vaginal di scharge was construed by the Thai doctor to mean she had induced her abortion. She was unaware of her presumed diagnosis and said the staff were 'nice' , but they were clearly unaw are of her careful plan to have children with her husband. In another case, an employer was told about the abortion diagnosis of his employee. Wh ile the breach of co nfidentiality was enormous, it was compounded by the fact that staff were entirely incorrect about the cause of the woman's pregnancy loss and th e stigma of induced abortion remained with her. Some aspects of post-abortion care such as contraception and counselling are reliant on accurate diagnosis. While contraception was rarely discussed with women in the Mae Sot General Hospital, it was in the Mae Tao Clinic. As in most areas where abortion is illegal and induced abortion is underreported or recognised, a misdiagnosis can cause contraceptive counselling confusion or a lack of action. 169 There is an assumption in the schematic diagram presented by Beischer and Mackay that criminal abortion is the only typology. In practice this is not the case. Women on the Thai-Burma border often initiate the pr ocess of abortion but it follows a similar pattern to a spontaneous typol ogy thereafter. An 'attempted ' induced abortion is just that and rarely is the 'criminal' aborti on completed in the one action. So a woman who tries drinking ginger and sugarcane with whiskey and then moves on to various other 'hot' methods, such as copious volumes of Kathy Pan , may begin a 'threatened' abortion but linger on to become an 'incom plete' infected abortion. Her induced abortion may take weeks to complete as al ready mentioned in Myo Mee's case. On the Thai-Burma border it is often a slow process of introducing infection, simmering inflammation and fever, heavy bleeding, incr easing pain and then foetal loss before the woman sees a health worker. Most comm only the placenta is still in the uterus. 170Abortion or pregnancy loss before foetus is viable Spontaneous abortion or 'Miscarriage ' Attempted induced abortion or 'Criminal abortion' Complete abortion The contents of the uterus are expelled Pregnancy continues Missed - or an unrecognised abortion. The woman or health worker believe her foetus is still alive for weeks or months before it is expelled Inevitable abortion Bleeding and pain is severe, cervix is open and often products of conception protrude though the cervix Threatened abortion Some pain and bleeding, infection and fever is possible Incomplete abortion The contents partially remain and need removal Figure 13 Classification and se quence of the abortion process In my schematic diagram, I show the cl assic distinction between spontaneous and induced abortion, but the process of pregnancy loss is similar. Just as a spontaneous threatened abortion can continue on to a healthy infant, so too can an attempted induced abortion continue to a birth. In some case where women 'threatened' 171abortion they went on to take thwei: zei with the intention of assisting the 'bad' blood to flow out of their bodies, which may activate and potentiate the abortion. The methods used to produce an abortion vary in efficacy and danger to mother and child if born. One early childhood educator, w ho supported disabled children and their families in a camp of around 45,000 people, cited several cases she knew where mothers had attempted to abort but failed an d their children were born with physical and/or mental disability. Attempted induced abortion is a process which takes days if not weeks to complete and may be life thre atening. The methods used often set up a process of infection and inflammation, wh ich may or may not end the pregnancy. Furthermore, abortions have more recently b ecome defined as safe or unsafe, which is conflated with legal and illegal (Faunde s & Hardy, 1997). Ramachandar (2003) has carefully deconstructed this in the Indian context, where women visit qualified doctors in well-equipped clinics for elective abortions, which are ca tegorised as illegal simply because the practitione r is not registered with the Indian government as an abortion provider. Here, the abortion is ille gal but quite safe. On the Thai-Burma border, any type of abortion can be life th reatening and unsafe. The induced abortion or miscarriage process by its nature causes bleeding and pa in, which can l ead to shock if not treated. Infected abortions are comm on and can lead to septicaemia and septic shock if untreated. A lengthy missed aborti on (>21 days) can initiate endotoxic shock (or disseminating intravascular coagulati on), a condition where a woman can die of internal bleeding and vital organ failure (Llewellyn-Jones, 1999). This is not to mention the traumatic and unhygienic methods used by the lay midwives, which work by the fact they introduce in fection and inflammation. In this particular region, women have few health services where they feel safe and they fear arrest and deportation if caught while travelling. They put off seeking health care not only for these reasons, but also the associated stigma associated with a pregnancy loss. The delay increases their health risks. In summary, it is not surpri sing that medical text books developed for an Australian audience, where access to decriminalised abortion is possible for most; do not fit with the lived experience of abortion on the Thai -Burma border. However, Thai doctors and nurses refer to these type s of text books and the hea lth workers in the Mae Tao Clinic have several versions of 'classic' cosmopolitan me dical text books as reference 172material which are used for teaching purposes.50 They learn to classify in ways that are not culturally correct or appropriate to their pa rticular experience. Defining pregnancy a nd viability - common (mis)understandings Before something can be researched, it must usually be defined so there is a shared common understanding. Aborti on does not mean the same thing to everyone; it has very specific meanings to different groups of people who each use their own definition. While this makes a strict compar ative analysis difficult, it also brings the complexity and diversity of abortion into the foreground. In this section I outline the different ideas about the mean ing of abortion to Thai and Burmese health workers, and for lay midwives and women. Health workers use medical and legal frameworks which define their practice. Medical and legal categories At the Mae Tao Clinic any pregnancy lost before 28 weeks (7 months) is called an abortion and is then further differentiated accord ing to the cause or cl inical features of the abortion. Burmese health workers call a miscarriage a 'spontaneous' abortion and one that ends with action 'i nduced'. When health worker s hesitate to categorise the abortion cause, the most identifying feature is used as a descriptor. Thus abortions are categorised 'septic', 'incomplete' or 'com plete'. Electively induced abortion is not permitted at the Mae Tao Clinic. They never classify induced abortion as a 'criminal' act - this is not in their vocabulary. The health workers at the Mae Tao Clinic do not identify as practicing within the Thai legal framework. They are technically competent in D&C (and now MVA) and th eoretically could perform an elective abortion procedure but the Burmese commun ity leaders do not approve of elective induced abortion. 50 There is a gap in the literature for doctors and obs tetricians working in environments with low access to technology and or conditions where abortion is largely illegal but who wish to have informative texts that reflect their work experience. More appropriate material has been developed (A. A. Burns, Lovich, Maxwell, & Shapiro, 1997). See also Klein's (1995) A Book for Midwives produced two years earlier which deals with abortion in less depth. It would be enhanced by an edition dealing with induced abortion in sites where it is illegal and unsafe, with more information for the formally trained health worker. 173Very few of the Burmese health worker s interviewed were aware of the law concerning abortion in either Burma or Thai land. Some knew there were laws but could not be explicit about the content a nd were confused whether the woman or the abortionist would be charged with an offence. There was confusion whether the KNU had laws about such things and mi xed reports about the KNU response to abortion. One story was repeated, and I hear d it in several different versions of a young woman who aborted herself and was se ntenced to jail for three months in Mannerplaw under KNU rule in Karen St ate some years ago. Nobody knew the National League for Democracy policy on re productive health or abortion, and later National League for Democracy representati ves who were active in exile reported they did not have one. The Thai staff at the Mae Sot General Hosp ital define all pregna ncy loss before 20 weeks (5 months) as an abor tion and then differentiate by the cause. They also use the term 'spontaneous' when referring to either natural miscarriages which are incomplete or threatened abortions. They call an induced abortion 'criminal' if it is performed outside of the Thai health and legal regulations. Elective abortion is possible in Thailand to save the woman's life or in cases of proven rape or incest - so it is still restricted. The Thai obstetric ian works according to the Criminal Code (1957) which allows a termination of pre gnancy up to 28 weeks (7 months) but he says in practice he prefers to offer a term ination of pregnancy we ll before 12 weeks (3 months). Any other kind of induced a bortion and especially those performed by unqualified people are considered illegal and criminal. The only health worker interviewed who wa s well informed was the Thai obstetrician who not only could clearly expl ain Thai law but critiqued it as well. His personal opinion was more liberal than Thai law allo wed as he felt that including reasons for the mental and social well-being for the wo man as reasons for legal abortion would be progressive for Thailand. He assured me he dutifully followed the current Thai law although he would like to see some reformation. He has similar attitudes to many highly educated Thai and those practising medicine and midwifery (Malee Lerdmaleewong, 1998; S. Miller, Billings, & Clifford, 2002; Whittaker, 2002d, 2004). No woman I interviewed was ever investigated by a police officer in a health facility, but one lay midwife did report contact with the police due to her practicing abortion. 174They threatened her and later accepted a few thousand Baht and she continued practising. It would be an important public health message to let women know that unless they are detected by police officers at the time of the abor tion procedure they are very unlikely to face criminal investigation or charges. This may assist them in deciding to attend a formally trained health worker a nd thus prevent complicated sequelae of unsafe abortion. Foetal viability, the ability to live indepe ndently from mother, the uterus and placenta is defined by law (Rahman et al., 1998). Foetal viability hove rs around 24 weeks (or 500g) in environments where the best t echnological expertis e and facilities are available (Llewellyn-Jones, 1999; Petches ky, 1987). In order for a very premature baby to survive it needs piped oxygen, incubators, medicine and specialised nursing and medical care. The Mae Tao Clinic ha s none of these things and experiences regular electricity and water s upply failure. If a premature infant is born it is unlikely to survive in these conditions unless quickly transferred to the Thai health system and this is often not possible logi stically or financially. The Thai obstetrician reports that neonates born prematurely at 28 weeks (7 m onths) have a poor surv ival chance in his neonatal intensive care unit which has more resources than Mae Tao Clinic. Therefore the law is not the defining feat ure of a foetus' or infant's chance of survival, which has more to do with access to resources. Local ethnophysiology Women and lay midwives have their own cultu ral definitions of viability and abortion just as cosmopolitan medicine and nationa l law does. Access to modern health knowledge and technology influe nces local understanding of fertility, pregnancy and abortion. During interviews women talked about their menstrua tion being 'blocked' for several months and taking herbal medicine s to 'unblock' it. It would seem that they were indeed pregnant and had abor ted themselves but this was not always defined by them as an abortion. A married Burman woman with a five year old child who experienced a miscarriage after f our months of amenorrhoea said: I thought my blood was stuck inside me. I didn't think I was pregnant but when it was nearly four months I thought I should come and do the urine test. Then I started bleeding for one day just a little. I thought 'O h here is my period', then it stopped for four days but then it started again heavier. I was worried so I came here. 175A na\u00efve 31-year-old childless woman who ha d only been married for six months was admitted to the Thai hospital also with th e diagnosis of an incomplete abortion. She was also surprised to be pregnant: This is my first pregnancy. I wasn't sure if I was pregnant or not - I only knew that my period was ten days late. I took Kathy Pan , 10 tablets per day for two days. I took four packets or 20 tablets in total. The next day I bled a little. There was no pain. I never used it when I was single. My periods are normally regular. They always come at the same time of the month. N obody told me to take it I just bought some by myself. I didn't have problems like vomiting or no appetite, you know, signs of pregnancy so I thought I wasn't. I don't feel anything about this pregnancy. I don't want a baby now. I am old I don't want to deliver a baby. I also thought I was too old to get pregnant. If I knew that I was fertile I would have used htou: zei . After I got married I didn't use anything you see...I feel ashamed of myself because now everyone thinks I aborted my baby. Her intention was to regulate her period with the emmenagogue ( Kathy Pan ), not to abort as she did not think she was pregnant. A young la y midwife in the rural area who does injections but insists she is not an abortionist, told us how to 'see the blood'. If a woman is single and she hasn't seen her period for up to ten weeks I give her Duoton Forte TP to bring down her blood. It's ok in women who have never had a baby but not ok in women who have. It is thwei: zei purzee - medicine to see the blood. 51 She does not question why 'single' women had not seen a period in ten weeks. Menstruation can be erratic and the abse nce of regular periods does not always indicate a pregnancy. Fertility is not a ssumed and authors writing on women living in conditions of poverty confirm that fertility must be proven as malnutrition, mal- development, anaemia, and chronic infecti ons can thwart fertility (Sobo, 1996). The widespread use of blood purifiers or thwei: zei (hot medicine) in Burma is common (Population Council & Department of Health Union of Myanmar, 2001; Skidmore, 2002) and it is common for women who experi ence menstrual irregularity or who fear it, to use these methods (Hull & Hull, 2001). Without access to modern technology it is remarkably difficult to ascertain if conception, implantation and embryonic growth have occurred and prospective field studies in harsh environments show a foet al loss of between 14 to 45% (DeLuca Progesterone 50mg Oestradi aol Benzoate 3mg 176Leslie, 1996). In the area of the Th ai-Burma border Burmese women's own judgement on the matter prevails until they visit a health service provider and even then the issue may remain unclear as Myo Mee's case illustrates. Amenorrhea glossed as blocked menses is found widely in the literature from Polynesia, Mexico, Malaysia, Afghanistan and Jamaica (Nicht er & Nichter, 1998) Indonesia (Hull & Hull, 2001) and Thailand (Whittaker, 2000). The obstructed blood can be assisted to flow with 'traditional medici nes' and notions of the heal thy uterus mechanistically opening and closing to allow the passage of blood (and also sperm) occur (Nichter & Nichter, 1998). Jamaican women take was houts to clear their 'tubes' which may end a tenuous pregnancy (Sobo, 1996). Native Americans practice similar forms of fertility regulation controlled by women: Within traditional societies and languages, th ere is no word that equals abortion. The word itself is harsh and impersonal. When speaking to traditional elders knowledgeable about reproductive health matters, repeatedly they would refer to a woman knowing which herbs and methods to use 'to make her period come.' This was seen as a woman taking care of hersel f and doing what was necessary (Maguire, 2003:189-90). Burmese women talk about blocked menstrua tion and take some measures against it, without necessarily acknowledging a pregnancy a nd the associated stig ma of abortion. There is a small cultural loophole through which women may try to 'see the blood' again. This is similar to Bangladesh, wher e mechanical 'menstrual regulation' in the early weeks of an unconfirmed pregnancy is legally and social ly condoned and not called abortion (K. Lee, Lus h, Walt, & Cleland, 1998). Anot her example of culturally mediated sanctioning of abortion is among Hmong women for whom children are cherished and large families desired. But as women age and have many children, they are 'allowed' to used herbal medicine to induce abortion. Herbal medicine is not given to younger women with few children and they do not have access to this information (Pranee Liamputtong, 2003). Foetal development and jumping shrimps The cultural rules of abortion not only pert ain to the ambiguity of menstruation but also the perception of foetal growth. La y midwives were able to describe the 177development of the baby, where for several m onths it is 'only a blood clot' and later, in the third or fourth month, becomes hum an-like when it moves and looks like a 'jumping shrimp'. A Karen Christian abor tionist was clear about when she felt she could offer a massage abortion. She had worked as an aide in a hospital in Burma: Suzanne: How did you learn about massa ge - probably not in the hospital, right? Lay abortionist: I learnt about massage from when I felt normal babies - you can feel if they are alive or dead, if they are alr eady human. I don't do it if they are human only if they are blood. Suzanne: How many months is that? Lay abortionist: Two to three months - if they move you can't do it. Movement is a key concept. This idea is similar to Western cultures, where in the past women defined their own pregnancies at 'quickening', sometime around the 18 to 20 weeks (4 to 5 months) when the baby wa s first felt to move (McLaren, 1990). Whittaker's Thai informant Nong is able to describe in Lao language this movement and realisation of another entity apart from her own body. 'Nong: It's self-aware ( huu tuu), right. It (Whittaker, 2002 d:9). Medical technologies have enabled people to see the foetus with ultr asound equipment, hear the heartbeat with a doppler device or test urine when the mens trual period is only three days late, and thus people's awareness and the culture of defining a pregnancy and its viability has changed over time. 52 When I asked the Thai obstetrician when he felt the conceptus was a 'life force', he replie d that it was at the time he saw the heartbeat in the six week old embryo during ultrasound examinati on. So even for the urbane obstetrician, the movement of the heart was a key moment , just as the shrimp-like movement was pivotal for the women and their midwives. The majority of lay midwives interviewe d said they did not do abortion. Some conceded that they knew how to do it but they did not practice their knowledge or 52 See also Rosalind Petchesky's (Petchesky, 1987) article Fetal Images: The Power of Visual Culture in the Politics of Reproduction for further discussion of technolo gy and its impact on the American abortion debate. 178they knew other midwives who did do it. One aged eccentric Karen lay midwife was repelled by my question of whether she ever saw women who did not want their babies. She sharply told me while pulling a disgusted face, 'I never see women who don't want babies. They do that in th e factory!' Anothe r Muslim midwife acknowledged the illegality: This is how they do their business. These thi ngs cause trouble. This is what they do. I know them but I don't want to point them out to you. They may cause trouble for me. They won't talk with you anyway or they will only talk about giving birth. After many months, I did meet an abortionist in town who said she was Buddhist: Suzanne: Are there any times that you sa y no to a woman, that you cannot do it? Lay abortionist: I understand that my j ob is not a good one. I understand that it is dangerous. I do refuse sometimes. Suzanne: I heard from some people that it is an unskilful act in Buddhism - what do you think about this? Lay abortionist: In the Buddhist religion if you kill then it is an unskilful act. Buddhists should help people. If it were possible I wo uldn't do it. I do help women to stay here with me. Suzanne: Some lay midwives said to me that the earlier the better as the unskilful act is less - what is your idea? Lay abortionist: In my experience four to eight weeks is difficult and it just doesn't work. I found that it works best at four months. Technically speaking it is easier. I have no inst ruments. I just use my fingers and a stem so the womb needs to be a certain size. Her main focus then was on the technical aspect of abortion and not with her own birth into the next life. One mature lay mi dwife from the rural area told the parable of the birds' nest by way of explanation of th e negative karma associated with abortion. Her story was that there was a little boy who saw a birds' nest and he climbed the tree and knocked the empty nest to the ground. Then there was a little girl who saw another bird nest in the tree and when she cl imbed the tree she saw the nest held eggs. She took a stick and knocked the nest to the ground. The li ttle boy was naughty but 179the little girl was naughtie r. Her story is easy to understand, the ne st held the potential for life but the e ggs were a greater potential, and so the little girl had committed a greater transgression. Buddhist theology suggests that everything is linked and interdependent and there is no absolute right or wrong. The major ethical ideas include wisdom, compassion, skilful actions and making merit. In Buddhism, unskilful acts can undo merit previously gained and good and bad are relative concepts. The five basic precepts in Buddhism are 'to abstain from taking life; to abstain from taking what not given; to abstain from sensuous misconduct; to abstai n from false speech; to abstain from intoxicants as tending to cloud the mind' but none of these are absolute rules (Keown, 1998:13). Furthermore, while abortion is a serious and unskilful act ( akuala) as it involves the intent to kill, it is moderate d by the gestation and development of the embryo/foetus: the earlier the gestation the less negative karma is incurred (Keown, 1998; Maguire, 2003). Buddhist theology is not a completely cohesive set of beliefs and is interpreted in the context of ev eryday life. Barnhart extends Keown's interpretation of 'life' to question the value of a conceptus or even pre-sentient foetus as the same as that of a human being: On this view, the point of the First Precept is to disqualify inte ntional killing where the clear purpose is to end an individual life. Such an action can never be compassionate in Buddhist eyes. However, questions as to the status and nature of the lives one weighs in such tricky situations where interests clash are obviously relevant. If we are talking about the lives a nd interests of mothers and fetuses, fetuses and families, or fetuses and communities (suc h as in times of famine), then we are directly faced with the issue of the relativ e moral standing of different sorts of life. What I have argued here is that because Buddhism allows a distinction between the biological basis of life and its higher c ognitive as well as affective aspects and insists that an individual human life requires th e conjunction of all such aspects, no Buddhist need equate a presentient fetus w ith a sentient human (Barnhart, 1998:293). Additionally he considers the reasons surrounding th e unwanted pregnancy are pertinent and consistent with a co mpassionate Buddhist viewpoint. Many of the women were keenly aware of th e rules, social mores and religious views of inducing an abortion. Women believed th at there was less sp iritual risk if the abortion occurred in early pre gnancy while it was still 'bl ood', the baby did not move or was already dead. Hnin Hnin Pyne (Sen and Snow 1994:24) tells us more about 180the position of women from the Buddhist perspective. By 'being a responsible daughter, supportive wife, and, most of a ll, a nurturing mother,' a woman can improve her inferior spiritual status. Wo men who abort are not considered nurturing and disrupt the Buddhist worldview. Myo M ee, although willing to talk openly with health workers of her determination to e nd her pregnancy, did not share her problems with her friends and said, 'I feel my co mmunity will look down on me'. Women who were interviewed by the non- governmental organisation wh o donated their transcripts made similar statements. 'I worry that my other friends wi ll know what I did. As I am Buddhist I made a very big mistake and I understand about the law which is why I did it secretly.' Women spoke of it being a 'bad thing' in religion and in law and they believed that their behaviour contravened some social and theological rules. Another woman said: I mean, why not just give birth and give the baby for adoption? The religion says this is bad, you will have five hundred more lives and the unskillful act will stay with you. Karen people don't do this but Islamic Burmese women do it. But a Karen woman who did induce her abortion with a lay midwife called ahpwa: gji (old woman) warned her while laughing. ' Ahpwa: gji told me, 'Don't tell anyone that I did abortion for you or they will come and arrest me. I feel sorry for you so that's why I am helping you.' Some women felt that there was an acceptable window of time for an abortion in the early stages of the pregnancy. A married Burman woman with two children cried as she told the st ory of her induced abortion. 'I didn't feel anything for this baby because it was just blood. If it was four or five months I wouldn't have done it because already it would be like a person.' One 19 year old Karen woman was surprised to see the matu rity of her foetus after the abortion: If I knew I was five months I would not have tried to end it. I think I am lucky. I am scared and I won't do it again. I won't go back to that old woman. I feel so sorry for my baby when I saw it I realised he was older. I did it because I thought I was only two months and my husband had left me. Women's friends confirmed the belief that if a foetus is small it is acceptable. 'I don't know what the problem is to do abortion. I am not educate d. My friends said 'The baby is so small, go ahead do it - don't worry'. 181Five women I interviewed reported following Islam. The Koran elaborates foetal development and describes the creation of a human being originating from clay and semen which is then forced into a 'blood-li ke clot' which turns into flesh, then bones and develops (Maguire, 2003:120). This theo logical recipe is not dissimilar to how the Buddhist women viewed their growing fo etuses, simply clots of blood and later flesh. Some women believed that the lay midwife wa s able to tell whether the foetus was alive or not before the abortion. This Ka ren woman had a history of five recurrent miscarriages and had consulted her lay midwife: I was really ill the first time I miscarried at home. There was no hospital or clinic to go to so I had to look after myself. A wan:zwe (lay midwife - Burmese) looked after me in my house. But I don't know how she knew things. She had a lot of experience with women giving birth. She can tell by just looking at the blood if the baby is dead or alive. Foetal autonomy Some women imbued their aborted foetuses with autonomy as though they were able to control their destiny. As already di scussed, it is difficult to know in this environment whether a pregnancy ends spont aneously or with intent. One Karen woman who had a complex obstetric histor y with ten pregnancies, four neonatal deaths, two living children, one intra-uter ine death at seven months and three abortions describes her feelings. 'Anytime I bleed I feel scared and worried. I go to the clinic straight away but they can't do mu ch. I wonder if the ba bies will stay with me or go.' Her history would certainly ma ke her wonder about her babies and she is probably referring to them pre- and post-birt h in this statement. Other women had fewer complications. A Karen woman in her second marriage with three living children wanted to be ster ilised and disclosed domes tic violence, and probably induced her abortion. She says, 'I feel sorry for the baby but it didn't want to stay with me'. A Burman woman with three living children, who ended her interview abruptly after appearing uncomfortable with the questions explained: I thought that maybe I was pregnant but the ba by did not want to stay with me. I went to stay with my friend and I told her to give me a massage because I had pelvic and back pain. My friend did the massage and a week later I bled a lot. My baby came out in my house on the 26th and the next day I came to the clinic. 182 The way she tells the abortion story is as though the foetus has already decided to leave her prior to her massage. The d ecision is not hers but the foetus'. Some husbands referred to the foetus in a similar way. One husband, a father of two children and whose wife became pregnant wh ile using an intra-uterine contraceptive device said, 'I want to keep this baby but our situation is bad so my child cannot stay with me. If the baby lived it would have a poor situation and it wouldn't have a good life'. A 40-year-old Burman woman, with four living children, w ho had only been in Thailand ten days after an arduous journey from Rangoon, spontaneously aborted her pregnancy at four months. She says, 'I wa s sad to lose this baby. My husband said that the baby is not strong enough to live with us'. These men and women talked about the foetus as though it could i ndependently decide its own future. The idea of foetal autonomy became apparent in one very tense moment during the fieldwork where a distressed Rose inadve rtently witnessed a stillbirth in a lay midwife's hut. The mother of the baby had been discharged in early labour from the Mae Tao Clinic, she was underweight and her baby was small for dates. It was not clear why the young woman was sent away from the Mae Tao Clinic; perhaps the health workers thought her birth was hours away. In any case, she went to one of the lay midwives in town who took her in, co mmenced an oxytocic drip and delivered a dead baby a few hours later. I decided to continue to talk with th e lay midwife about her practice for several reasons. This story had already filtered back to the Mae Tao Clinic and some people were asking me to tell them which lay midwife had 'killed' the baby. It appeared to me that there ha d been a chain of unfortunate decisions by several people. Ethically I could not disclo se the identity of the lay midwife who had agreed to be inte rviewed, but nor could I sit b ack without investigating the circumstances. Rose and I rode to her house on our bicycles and sat down in her shanty hut for a heated discussion wh ich involved challenging the lay midwife's practice. After some conversational cut a nd thrust, the midwife became irritated with me and my aspersions. In frustration she blurted out: 183Well my ideas are not the same as your ideas! I tried to help her and to save the baby. I wanted to take her to th e Mae Tao Clinic but she said no. One woman was in labour for five days and the baby lived. If the baby wants to live, it will live! And so the small baby who died that day wa nted to die and it was no-one's fault, not the mother's, nor the health workers at Mae Tao Clinic, nor the lay midwife. Abortion and infant mortality in this area are common. Baby autonomy seems to me akin to Scheper-Hughes' examin ation of the self-p reserving distant mother-love given to infants on the alto of Bom Jesus in Brazil where infant mortality was allegedly extremely high. She talks of Alto women' s 'willingness to attribute to their own offspring an 'aversion' to life that made th eir deaths seem wholly natural, indeed all but expected' in the chronic poverty of the shanty town (Scheper-Hughes, 1992:270). Abortion and infant mortality are common occurrences in Tak province and some Burmese women felt that their unborn babies had an aversion to life. In this area where there are high rates of spontane ous abortion, women may not emotionally engage with a tenuous pregnancy. Some of these women felt they were mere vessels in which the foetus could choose to stay or not, and often only in the later stages of pregnancy when women saw the foetus as formed, and not only blood, did some emotion emerge. Burmese women in this ar ea do not generally test their urine just days after a missed period, nor would they receive routine ultr asonography; in fact most do not have any antenatal care, and so the idea of pregnancy unfolds slowly even for women who desire children. Similar ideas of foetal autonomy pertain el sewhere. In the everyday speech of the people in Tanzania they say when 'a stillbirth occurs or an incomplete baby is terminated by midwives, the situation is described as the 'the baby returned to where it came from' or 'it was unable to go to the delivery room' (Wembah-Rashid, 1996:87). Allotey and Reidpath (2001) note th e large percentage of infant mortality with an unknown cause in Ghana and suggest the cultural belief in 'spirit' children accounts for many deaths. Mothers or othe r relatives kill newborn infants for a variety of traditionally held beliefs, often if the child displays unusual signs or behaviour, in order to protec t the living members of the community. Likewise, Sobo 184(1996), notes that the category of monster or witchcraft babies could be invoked by Jamaican women when pregnancy was not desired. Mexican foetuses' unsatiated desires for particular foods cause their ow n demise as they become 'unsettled' and begin 'to move around too much' and can trigger contractions which end the pregnancy (Castaneda, Billings, & Blanco, 2003: 79). In these cases the foetus and not the woman or her partner, is central in its own downfall. In some cases Burmese families also perceive unborn children to be unlucky and better dead. To summarise, there is diversity in the m eaning of abortion from various perspectives in this area of Thailand. Just as the word s fertility control, birth control, family planning and planned parenthood can mean di fferent things to different people, abortion is not a consistently underst ood phenomenon. For researchers and policy- makers, this makes comparative analysis of results across regions or cultures questionable. For clinicians it can mean miscommunication with their patients and poor quality post-abortion care. I argue that some definitions and categories do not 'fit' local understandings. The medical cate gories used by the health workers taken from cosmopolitan medicine, where elective abortion is decriminalised and safe, are quite different from the convoluted and ambiguous nature of attempted induced abortion as it presents on the Thai-Burma borde r and this leads to c linical confusion. The variations in gestation show the arbitr ary nature of decisions concerning viability, while stemming in part from moral theological paradigms, more practically are related technological issues. The access to technology or the ability to pay the hospital bill for a premature infant that most likely will not survive or who may be disabled is a greater arbiter of viability. Women's nebulous understanding of me nstruation and pre gnancy provide an ambiguous space of several months for actio n in which they may decide if their menstruation is delayed due to 'blockage' and rectified with traditional emmenagogues. Undoubtedly many 'blockages' are pregnancies, but in areas where there is no access to legal or safe abortion, it makes sense not to know or to be vague. There is no value in confirming a pregnancy when there are no legal or safe abortion services, antenatal care or maternity leave. Women and lay midwives attempt to end the pregnancy in the early stages, when th e foetus is motionless. If intention is 185important in Buddhism then th e intention to regulate mens truation rather than abort a potential human is clearly a wise spiritu al decision that avoids demerit. 186Chapter 7 Kathy Pan , sticks and pummelling - abortion methods Quote from CEDAW Initial Repor t of State Parties Myanmar... The private sector includes both traditional and western medical care at private hospitals, private clinics and drug stores (pharmaceuticals)...The most accessible health facilities to the rural communities ar e the rural health centres, with a female midwife sometimes assisted with a public health supervisor, grade two... Midwives are truly multipurpose health workers... Midw ives are helped by volunteer auxiliary midwives and community health workers. They form the backbone of primary health care of rural communities in Myanmar (Union of Myanmar, 1999:18). In this chapter I describe the methods used by Burmese women to end their pregnancies, their efficacy and complications and the cond itions in which traditional abortions occur. They are often effective methods to end a pregnancy but not without risk. Oral and injectable medicines, both cosmopolitan and indigenous, as well as certain food and drinks found in the kitche n, are taken to proc ure an abortion. Women choose medicines and foods they consider to be 'hot' according to humoral understanding's of the body. Women also employ certain actions and vigorous manipulations to dislodge the foetus. Fr iends, husbands, lay midwives and market vendors assist in the provision of advice, money, transport and support. Market vendors sell traditional and co smopolitan medicines and share referral information to abortionists. Lay midwives offer women a bortion services for a fee, and pummel and insert vegetable material, usually wooden sticks or leaf stems, into the genitals. Such methods have the potential to be harmful and at times life-threatening to the woman. If the attempted abortion fails, they also have the potential to cause disability to a developing foetus. Large numbers of wo men with post-abortion complications from spontaneous or induced aborti on present at the Mae Sot Ge neral Hospital and the Mae Tao Clinic with pain, haem orrhage and infection, and occasionally perforation. As 187liberalisation of abortion law in Thailand is unlikely in the near future (Keown, 1998; Whittaker, 2002c, 2004) and would have little impact on an already 'illegal' and marginalised population, the problem of how to reduce the severity of unsafe abortion remains. By understanding the methods of abortion and meanings of post-abortion complications for women and lay midwives, we may be able to encourage women to seek cosmopolitan health services and thus prevent sub-fertility, infertility, chronic pelvic pain and other consequences of unsafe abortion.

Box 1Causes of abortion in Burmese women Kathy 'hot' medicine ( thwei: thirty year-old Burman woman who has lived in Thailand for more than six years and is now hospitalised with an incomplete septic abortion. She tells Rose and me her story after we promise not to tell the doctors or nurses who do not know how her abortion happened: I have three girls and this is my fifth pre gnancy, I had one miscarriage before...I took ten pills of Kathy Pan over two days with water. I was two months pregnant at the time. I started to bleed a little bit and I got a lot of pelvic pains over three days. I couldn't stand the pain and I was scared so I went to the hospital. My neighbour took me on the motorbike. I didn't want to go to the l\u00e8 the for the abortion. I have seen my friends and what happens to them and I don't want those problems! Most of the time they put a stick inside you or massage yo u and it hurts a lot. I didn't tell anyone I took Kathy Pan , not even my husband. He would yell at me if he knew that. Ma Pyu Pyu is aware of the common methods of abortion in this area: 'hot' medicine, massage and stick abortions. She also know s it is dangerous and like many women, begins her abortion attempts by using the l east dangerous and leas t painful method. It 189is also the cheapest method because women can administer it themselves and do not need to visit the l\u00e8 the . Kathy Pan is a common Burmese medicine for 'menstrual ailments' produced by a Burman business in San Chuang Townsh ip in Rangoon (Myat Chan-Tha Medical Hall, 2003). It is widely available in pharmacies, herbal shops and local markets in both Burma and Thailand. Myat Chan -Than informs the purchaser that Kathy Pan is made of 'rare, costly herbs'. They make no secret about the ingredients: Indian redwood tree, black pepper, nutmeg, cloves, sandalwood, camphor, and in smaller quantities, rosy leadwort, red sanders, wh ite sandalwood, fennel, garden cress, and dill. 53 The very specific instructions for women that are included in packets of Kathy Pan or Ni kwet say (another 'hot' medicine ) relate directly to humoral health, to the balance of hot and cold in the body, and to restore and promote the flow of blood. The instructions in multiple languages are explicit. 'Dosage: 1 For irregular, scanty, incomplete menstruation or clotted menstrual flow, take 5 capsules with water on the day before menstruation is due. 2 If the menstrual flow is overdue for a week take 10 capsules with water for two successive days. 3 If the menstrual flow is overdue for two weeks, take 15 capsules for two successive days. 4 If the menstrual flow is overdue for three weeks or one month, take 20 capsules with water for three successive days. (This medicine can be taken with alcoholic drinks.) 5 To those married women who want to stay away from pregnancy, take 5 capsules with water on the 10th day after menstruation and take 10 capsules after an interval of another 10 days, and take 10 capsules on the day before the next menstrual per iod is due. (Stop taking the medicine when the user wants to get pregnant.) 6 After bearing the child, take 5 capsules everyday in the morning and in t he evening. T he user will experience a flow of foul discharge, get a good sweat all over her body and have abundant secretion of milk. 7 For those who have reached menopause they are recommended to take this medicine every week or every 10 days. The medicine will prevent mens trual disorders and give the user the glow of health. Notes: Do not take this medicine immediatel y before or after meals. Take a good bath (if no fever is present). Do not be constipated. Do not take this medicine if pregnant.' Box 2 How to take Kathy Pan 53 These are similar ingredients to the yaa satri or women's medicines described by Whittaker and the woods are favoured in the practice of mother 'roasting' - staying by a fire in the post partum to dry and purify the body (Whittaker, 2000). 190Source: From insert in Kathy Pan packet - English instructions (MFD 09 2001- EXP 09 2003 -LOT NO.014)54 Due to the ambiguity surrounding Kathy Pan they can manage to keep it a secret. Abortion is not condoned but a hu sband would not necessarily be suspicious if he saw his wife taking Kathy Pan . A 19 year-old woman, only married for six months to a man she met in Thailand, said: When I was single I saw my aunty taking Kathy Pan to help her periods and to get rid of the blood. I never took it before when I was single. I took Kathy according to the instructions but nothing happened. I just felt dizzy. I was worried about getting pregnant when I had sex with my husband and as soon as I missed my period I started taking the Kathy Pan . I took one packet (four pills) th en another and another - so 12 in all but not at the same time. The quantities of Kathy Pan consumed can be substantial. One woman told us she took 30 Kathy Pan tablets but they did not end he r pregnancy as she had hoped. A young husband confirms his wife's story: My wife took Kathy Pan . She took it before she was pregnant but the blood did not come. The periods did not come. She also tried ginger and sugar cane but that didn't work either. Then she tried Kathy Pan and whiskey. Nothing worked! Ginger and alcohol is also c onsidered 'hot' and is often mentioned as a home-remedy emmenagogue. A sex-worker interviewe d by a non-government organisation knew how to abort her unwanted pregnancy: 'I aborted by drinking boiled ginger and s engla thwei: zei mixed with alcohol and Kathy Pan . I used these medicines in the first month and the pregnancy aborted in th e second month. This was my second abortion.' The 'hot' medicine method or thwei: zei appears to work for many women. In order to understand unsaf e abortion in Tak province, we need to understand humoral notions of health, medicinal a pproaches to post-natal care and local understandings of women's well-being. Humo ral theory originated from Greek and Arabic medicine and underpins Chinese and In dian medicine. It is not only confined to medicinal herbs and food but also i llnesses and is found across continents (Casteneda, Garcia, & Langer, 1996; Manderson, 1986, 1987). Chinese humoral 54 This dosage had increased from a packet insert printed for LOT NO. 002 with an expiry date 02-2004 which recommended only 3, 6, 9, and a maximum of 12 capsules, in the graduated dosages. 191health has been concerned with enha ncing women's fertil ity, ensuring normal menstrual cycles and promoting women's well-being for centuries, simultaneously linking menstruation symbolically with polluti social-spiritual inferiority (Furth & Ch'en Shu-yueh, 1992; Manderson, 198 1). In a globalised world, even cosmopolitan pharmaceuticals are categorised into 'hot' and 'cold' qualities by their taste or colour (van der Geest, Whyt e, & Hardon, 1996). Some Thai public and private health workers collect random a ssortments of pharmaceuticals to give to patients in yaa-chut (sets of medicine in bags) in th e same ways that herbalists once used an assortment of ingredients to heal (Bamber, 1998). But humoral classifications such as hot/cold, wet/dry have their own in ternal logic and for the most part are a useful way of promoting health and nutrition. While certain behaviours are encouraged to enhance pregnancy, or influence foetal size, certain actions or substances can be employed to decrease fertility or end a problematic pregnancy (Leslie & Young, 1992; Manderson, 1987; Nichter & Nichter, 1996). 992) in discussing Chinese materia medica note that in Taiwan women use Chung i as an inexpensive and pr ivate alternative to bio- medical management of fertility. Emmena gogues, found in women's kitchens or local markets are 'hot'. Thai women also know and use 'hot' medicines (Bencha Yoddumnern, 1985). Hull & Hull ( 2001:104) mention traditional jamu or combinations of spices/herbs taken by Indonesian women as emmenagogues also taken in very large quantities: Interviews of uses of these jamu in th e same study show that despite written instructions, women follow their own prescriptions for use. They often take much larger quantities that the prescribed dosag e; they combine a number of different purchased herbal products; or combine th ese preparations with the 'traditional abortifacients'; of unripe pineapple, mango or other green fruit, garlic, lime, pepper and chilli. Medicinal wines are also taken as emmenagogues, either alone or in combination with other substance, and so me women report relying on a combination of jamu and prayer. The body changes humorally during pregnancy a nd in post partum or post-abortion. During pregnancy, a woman's body is consid ered 'warm' and after childbirth or abortion, the body is 'cool' and should be ke pt warm through 'roasting' near a fire, wearing special clothes, eating specific f ood and not exposing oneself to cold water for a minimum of several weeks (Hoban, 2002; Whittaker, 2002a). Skidmore (2002) 192describes Burmese women's understandin g of blood circulation which is conceptualised like a river flowing thr ough the woman's body and which if blocked, can congeal in her stomach and rise to her head causing palp itations, dizziness, headaches, madness, shock and ultimately deat h. Similar notions of the importance of regular menstrual flows occur across the region. Cambodian women conceptualise menstrual blood as unclean and believe it should flow freely and regularly (White, 2002). Indian women describe the 'heat' of semen as opening the uterus enabling conception, where the developing foetus nour ishes itself on 'hot' retained menstrual fluid and where a cold-dry womb is associ ated with sterility (P. Jeffery & Jeffery, 1996). While many materia medica present as benign, some author s describe the insertion of corrosive chemicals such as washing deterg ents, acid, oil, ink, animal faeces, sewing needles or bicycle spokes into the gen itals (Ankomah et al., 1997; United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) & Department of Health Union of Myanmar, 1999), extreme actions which do not speak of a tr adition of humoral management. Other studies have shown that many types of medicine are ingest ed or injected in the hope of inducing abortion. 55 Markets and marketing The emmenagogue Kathy Pan is particularly accessibl e to women and is found in local shops and the market place. It is also very affordable. Samina, the Muslim shopkeeper who produces the popular bete l-nut recipe, also sells Burmese dictionaries, newspapers, make-up, Burmese music a nd some common medicines imported from Burma. She talks about the Kathy Pan she sells in her shop: ' Kathy Pan is popular. I can sell th ree large packets every mont h in this neighbourhood. All 55 Etkin (1992) reports the Hausa people utilising the 'side effects' of certain medicines to cause abortion. So plants such as henna, indigo, ca ssia and horseradish as well as manufactured bitter medicines such as chloroquine, penicillin and chloramphenicol are equally valued. Etkin (1992:104) finds that the qualities and characteristics of certain drugs considered 'suitabl e for abortion vary cross- culturally.' But pharmaceutical refe rences indicate that Penicillin is a Category A medication - safe in pregnancy. Chloroquine phosphate is a Category D medication - small risk to the foetus of neurological problems such as deafness and imbalance but often given to pregnant women as risk of malaria to both woman and foetus is greater. Chloramphenicol is a Category C medication - potentially harmful to foetus or neonate and should be avoided in the week before birth as it interferes with gluconate metabolism in the liver. None of these medications are indicated to cause abortion. [http://wnfsyd.appco.com.au/APPCO_WEB/ onlineindex.htm Australian Pharmaceutical Publishing Co - access date 1 September 2004] 193the women take it, single gi rls, unmarried women as well as the married women - they all take it.' She laughs loudly at her indiscretion. On e young man browsing the shelves in her shop says he takes it too. I am surprised as I neve r heard of men using Kathy Pan - he says that it is good for malaria symptoms, and he shivers dramatically for my benefit. A 35 year-old Burman woman with an induced abortion describes Kathy Pan well: I didn't take Kathy Pan before the bleeding. I took it after the bleeding started. It is for bad blood, it helps to clean out the blood . I am scared because some people told me that Kathy Pan is for abortions. I thought the baby didn't want to stay with me and I had bad blood. Most women from Burma take it during their periods to clean the blood. You can see it on TV- there is a famous actress talking about it. Kathy Pan makes you more beautiful. Two packets of Kathy Pan costs just 5 Baht. I don't know how much a big box costs. I never took it before. I never had pain like this before. There are 5 pills per sachet, you mix it with water and it smells quite bad. And so I learn that Kathy Pan is marketed to purify women of noxious stagnant menstrual blood, to make them beautiful (desp ite its strong odour) and to treat fevers. Mae Sot market is a common source of Kathy Pan , other abortifacients and referral information. Normally throngs of Burm ese people with day-passes come over the border to shop for household goods and food in Thailand. The market covers several streets and has a Thai quarter and a Burmese quarter. Some stalls are out in the open or are covered by umbrellas and others are tr ue shop structures. The market is open everyday from early in the morning to late in the afternoon. All manner of consumer goods and fresh and dried food are available. It is a place to meet friends, get a job, sit in tea shops, browse through books, and shop for daily needs. Second-hand clothes, watches, Burmese books, quack medicines, rice, vegetables, spices, tha nakha (white-yellow cosmetic), newspapers from Burma and Thailand, fruit, shoes, fish, pork, cotton sarongs, soap, glitzy hair clip s, padlocks, live frogs, eels, squirming catfish, incense, tobacco, chillies, oil, lopetho (fermented tea leaves ), candles, jeans, contraceptives and abortion advice can all be purchased at the market. Dirty Burmese street-children, old people and lepers beg for money from the shoppers to help them make merit. In some parts, the market is so crowded and the sp ace between the stalls so narrow that it is only po ssible to walk single file. 194 Plate 21'New improved ' white Kathy Pan box Plate 22 Two wooden sticks removed from a woman's cervix 195Despite the narrowness, people on motorbikes and bicycles drive through the crowds with bells clanging. The smells of rotting fruit and yesterday's slaughtered meat, combined with slowly defrosting fish from Burma, can be overwhelming. The spice shops, incense and sandalwood offer some relief. There are many places to buy medicine and the Burmese end of the market has the most abundant source of quack, herbal and cosmopolitan modern medicine. In the first stall Kathy Pan is openly on display and costs 15 Baht per sachet. Kathy Pan contains a leaflet inside about how to take it in several languages: Burmese, Thai, Chinese, Hindi and English. This is an export product. I am told again that Kathy Pan is to regulate periods. Ther e is a new 'improved' version of Kathy Pan in a white packet that I have never seen before. 'The green packet is for regular periods and the white packet is for abortions,' the shop a ssistant tells me. 'Everyone comes here for Kathy Pan . Mostly the women are married and half of them work in the factories and some of them have boyfriends.' The white packet costs 45 Baht and contains enough capsules for three abortions. Kathy Pan in the glossy white box has green capsules in a sealed foil insert. The 'new improved' wh ite box is much slicker than the old green box which had plastic sachets with pungent pr essed dry tablets that were difficult to swallow. When I compare the ingredients between the white and green products, they are exactly the same. Perhaps in capsule fo rm it is easier to swallow larger quantities and therefore easier for abortion? The pr oduct is eye-catching because the beautiful actress sits poised and pink on a sofa. She is the picture of elegance and health. Her rose-pink traditional Burmese hta mein and stole are perfect and so is her hair piled high on top of her head. In her hair sh e wears a spray of flowers. She smiles assertively and looks directly at the purchaser. She is confident and unworried by menstrual irregularity. The directions on how to take Kathy Pan are specific but it is di fficult to tell whether it is a contraceptive, emmenagogue, horm one replacement or menstrual analgesic- antispasmodic medicine.56 The increase according to the amenorrhea. Prescribing alcohol pote ntiates the heat of Kathy Pan as it too is humorally 'hot'. 56 Primary dysmenorrhoea is common and can cause co nsiderable interruption to daily living. In allopathic medicine often no dysfunction can be found and women are asked to rest during painful episodes, exercise at other times, eat nutritiously, consume antispasmodic medication or commence 196 A multitude of liquids, pills, powders and crysta ls are on sale to keep women healthy. One day when Rose and I ask for medicines that prevent a pregnancy, a market vendor hands me one packet of oral contracep tive pills with a fo reign script, called Shuki, for 15 Baht. Dr Choti, a female medical doctor from Bangladesh, tells me later that in Bangladesh it costs one taka and is subsidised by the government reproductive health programme. Shuki has had a long trip to Mae Sot through the black-market; so long in fact that Shuki is now one year out of date. The market woman tells me, 'Take it every day!' and when I ask if there can be any problems, she says there are none. Similarly, we purchase the Chinese once-per-m onth pill with no advice or cautions on how to take it. 57 Rose asks if there is any othe r medicine for blocked menstruation. The market woman, who knows Rose, is reluctant to sell it to her and admonishes her, because, 'This is not for you. This is for the new mother so the blood comes out.' But Rose eventually purchases a packet fo r 12 Baht. Later at home we dissect the small package of Ne kwet zei ('Two Cups Medicine') which is wrapped in plastic. It too has an insert with detailed instructions. 'Ne kwet zei - for one pregnancy - This medicine is for women who have given birth or had a miscarriage. It is good for women who need to bleed and whose period does not come. If you take this medicine after childbirth you will become beautiful. After birth massage your pelvic area and take half the medicine mixed with salt. After one to two hours eat a meal and please take a shower with theyor B (tree with long pods) shampoo. It is good to do this to heat yourself up. If you give birth at night, please do this the next morning. If you feel warm and burning drink tamarind and sugar juice or cool foods...After you have taken the medicine apply thanakha to your body. You should take a shower three times per day. Your womb will be warm and clean in two or three days. If you bleed a lot eat hot f oods. Don't drink fruit juice...when the blood doesn't leave and you feel cold. Or if you have big face or sore body and the neck aches - don't shower and eat hot foods. If you are constipated please take a gentle laxative. If you still cannot go put a sliver of soap in your bottom... If you have a oral contraception [http://www.u mm.edu/altmed/ConsConditions/Dys menorrheacc.html - access date 25 August 2004 University of Maryland Medicine]. Functionally alcohol does reduce uterine contractions and therefore lessen cramping and so can be useful to relieve period pain (Keirse, 2003). 57 One pill contains 12 mg Norgestrel and 3mg Quinoestrogrol which is a long acting contraceptive patented and marketed in China. No other country has approved the use of this product but it is reported found in Cambodia and Laos (Sek Sisokhan, 2002). It is also widely used in Burma and the authors of an assessment team suggested the oral m onthly pill was not necessarily safe or effective. (See - World Health Organization 1997). 197fever, don't shower or drink fruit juice. If you feel thirsty take a hot drink and mix the Ne kwet zei with water and drink. If you have heavy bleeding or miscarriage take half of the Ne kwet zei with salt...When the placenta is retained take the Ne kwet zei as stated and it will all come out in four or five days. If you use this medicine you do not need to roast yourself, heat stones or rub the pelvic area. Don't worry, treat yourself like everyday (sic). If you take the Ne kwet zei will balance the hot and cold in your body. If you feel hot drink sugar in a cool drink. If normal, drink ginger. Eat well and find a good a ne thay (massage woman) - don't take a shower.' Translated from insert in package (2002) Box 3 How to take Ne kwet zei Burmese women wear hats, socks and other warm clothing in the post partum period and some women rub turmeric over their ski n, particularly after abortion. Patented hot medicine such as Ne kwet zei, described above, appear to be a modern solution for busy women who may not have family suppor t or time to spend 'roasting'58 but who still feel the need to 'warm' themselves. Similarly medicines such as Ne kwet zei correct postnatal humoral imbalance and promote uterin e involution, no l\u00e8 the (TBA) is required, just a: ne the (a massage woman) . But the insert sheet makes two rather worrying statements. The suggestion to wait f our or five days after birth (or abortion) for a retained placenta to appear is likely to lead to haemorrhage and infection, and to only advise women who feel they are 'warm' or 'burning' to drink is dangerous as this is a sign of fever and infection, a common post-abortion co mplication. Infection with Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and Cl ostridium cause septicaemia, high fever, circulatory shock, chills-shivers a nd cold extremities. Symptoms usually begin on day two or three after childbirth or a bortion, but can occur up to ten days. If infected, women can experience severe abdo minal-pelvic pain, diarrhoea, rigors, confusion and death. In the past, this clin ical picture was extremely common prior to the legalisation of abortion a nd the advent of antibiotics. Hundreds of thousands of women suffered and died from childbed fever or puerperal fever or similar infections 58 Mother roasting is a traditional healing method whereby women stay inside the house with their newborn baby, near or over a smoking fire, to eat and drink specific foods, and herbs in the post partum period. Rituals to purify and protect mother and child are often initiated by lay midwives, elders or spiritual leaders. Gynaeco logical infirmity and disability in old ag e are thought to o ccur if roasting is not completed (See - Hoban, McCalman, 1998).59 The descriptions of women dying in this manner in the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe and North America resonate with the warnings to protect women from the cold humors or malevolent spirits who harm women in the post partum in some cu ltures today. Doctors, nurses, auxiliary midwives and health stations exist in Bu rma and it is difficult to imagine why the producers of patented herbals such as Myat Chan-Than Medical Hall do not consider advising women to consult them if there is a problem. Medical records revi ew and free-lists The Burmese health workers at th e Mae Tao Clinic are aware of Kathy Pan and other 'hot' methods used to induce abortions. Th e OPD medical record review includes 20 cases of women ingesting either Kathy Pan or another type of thwei: zei and 31 cases where the woman disclosed visiting the l\u00e8 the (Total number of induced abortions = 50).60 During interviews 7 women disc losed taking 'hot' medicines. If thwei: zei is recorded as a method of termination, it is commonly written in Burmese script. The l\u00e8 the also know about Kathy Pan . In one mixed focus group with male and female l\u00e8 the of different ages, a heated debate ensued as packets of Kathy Pan were passed around: Suzanne: 'What's this for?' Young male l\u00e8 the : (Almost shouting) 'It's no good for anything! I don't' agree with it, they say it gets rid of bad blood.' Young female l\u00e8 the : (Loud voice) 'It's good for women - periods can be painful and only small. So Kathy Pan releases the pain and the blood. It's not for abortion!' Suzanne: 'Is Kathy Pan the same thing as family planning?' 59 The terrible irony of childbed fever is that it is usually transmitted to the healthy woman from her birth attendant's hands or instruments. Backyard ab ortions were notorious for sepsis. Doctors, nurses and midwives resisted their involvement in the deaths of thousands of women in the great hospitals of Europe and North America for many decades despite warnings from colleagues. In 1794 the Scottish obstetrician Alexander Gordon wrote a treatise on puerperal fever and later Inaz Phillip Semelweiss promoted hand washing and antisepsis in 1847. The antiseptic techniques of Lister in 1880, Pasteur's germ theory and the discovery of sulphonamides in the 1930s and penicillin in 1940s saved many women's fertility and lives. See - (H. Lee, 2000; Loudon, 2000; McCalman, 1998) 60 Some women cited multiple methods and a few induc ed abortions had no history of causation written in the notes. 199Young female l\u00e8 the : 'No, not true - it helps single women and women whose period doesn't come on time, maybe two weeks or one month late.' Suzanne: 'What would make th e period late like this?' Elderly l\u00e8 the : (Speaks calmly) 'Some women are weak and they are not strong. They have irregular periods ; it's not about doing a bad thing.' Young male l\u00e8 the : 'Well, if it is not for a bad thing then why do only women use it?' Kathy Pan raises strong feelings. Is it a pain killer? Does it unblock menstruation? Is it a contraceptive or aborti facient? The implication is that 'bad' women (perhaps all women) use it. From interviews, it is clear that some women use it like a prophylactic contraceptive. Here a 29 y ear-old married Burman woman who had three pregnancies and two children describe s some side-effects from modern methods of contraception and her preference for Kathy Pan . 'My husband told me to stop taking them [oral pills and Depo] but I continued. Then he blamed me when I complained of pains. The only thing I can take regularly with no problems is Kathy Pan. I take one sachet every ten days.' Fo r this woman there are no discernable side- effects from Kathy Pan , although some health work ers report that it causes perspiration and red eyes. Other women who describe taking large quantities over short periods of time say they felt 'dizzy'. This 31 year-old Burman woman who has lived in Thailand for five years and always had regular menstruation only took Kathy Pan after her period was ten da ys late after she married: This is my first pregnancy. I wasn't sure if I was pregnant or not - I only knew that my period was ten days late. I took Kathy Pan , 10 tablets per day for two days. I took four packets or 20 tablets in total. The next day I bled a little. There was no pain. I never used it when I was single. My periods are normally regular. They always come at the same time of the month. This is not contraception but menstr ual regulation or an early abortion. Kathy Pan is linked with the idea of abortion both for women and in the wider community. The same woman went on to say: I won't use Kathy Pan again. I won't need it. I didn't realise what was happening and now that I know that I can get pregnant I will use htou: zei . I feel ashamed of myself because now everyone thinks I aborted my ba by. I think there are better things to do than take Kathy Pan . 200 From free lists generated with women in the community, health workers and l\u00e8 the , Kathy Pan was taken for multiple reasons and in various mixtures. In answer to the question why take Kathy Pan ? Women responded with the following list: Table 16 Free list: Why take Kathy Pan ? Why take Kathy Pan ? If the body temperature is too low for cough to treat malaria to treat dengue fever for distended stomach and diarrhoea irregular periods pain relief for periods to clean the blood to moisturise skin to regulate periods as emergency contraception to cause abortion to produce more breast milk family planning for married women for use in menopause contraception, child spacing and family planning to get old blood out after delivery or abortion Abortion is therefore only one reason to take Kathy Pan as fevers and other women's health concerns are also represented. Wo men were divided as to whether it works consistently and in probing further; women went on to explain that when it does not work the following things happen. Table 17 Free list: What happens if Kathy Pan does not work? What happens if Kathy Pan does not work? Sometimes we get pregnant Sometimes out hair falls out The pain does not go away We get an allergy to it The period is irregular We get dizzy Get a hot body Stronger feeling than before Specifically in relation to inducing an a bortion, the key sentence 'for women who need to bleed or whose period does not come' may explain w hy some women take thwei: zei as an emmenagogue/ abortifacient. A 23 year-old Burman wife of a construction worker cried while she told us about how she took Ne kwet zei : I stopped my last pregnancy when I was four months. I did it because my parents said that I had no job and my husband had no j ob. \"You will have many problems and why weren't you more careful?\" I went to th e market and talked to the shop keeper. I said \"I want an abortion - how can I do it?\" They gave me Ne kwet zei . It is a powder, a pale yellow colour. You can get a lot of medicine like this in the market. 201When I asked the shop keeper which medicine I should take, they said 'Take this' but they didn't say how to take it. They were a young Burman couple. It was wrapped in paper. I went home and I drank it with water. I took it for two days and then I started to bleed. So it seems Ne kwet zei is thwei: zei , cheap and available in the market where contraceptive and abortion advi ce is given. This type of informal availability of medicines at general stores, markets and by street-hawkers is noted by other authors (Hull & Hull, 2001; Martin, 2004; van der Gees t et al., 1996) and is now promoted as 'social marketing' when implemented by in ternational health and development NGOs who promote condoms or pills in th eir projects (Hartmann, 1995). As there is no regulation of patented herbal medicine, th ere is no evidence of what women are actually consuming in large qua ntities. While cloves, black pepper, nutmeg and sandalwood sound innocuous, th e actual ingredients are unknown. 61 The women informants and their medical reco rds show that injectable cosmopolitan pharmaceuticals were also used, such as various oxytocics and hormonal products purchased over the counter. The market pla ce contains a variety of products sold for profit aimed at menstrual well-being and fertil ity. They are of dubious efficacy and in some cases dangerous or misleading. The medicines are often stored in direct sunlight and are sold despite being out of date. The advice from market women is superficial and often patronising, so even if women do attempt to manage their reproductive health and fertility at the market they may be disappointed. Additionally, Burmese women look to th eir own national products, used and recommended by their friends and aunties, ju st as Thai migrant workers order their medicines from home (see Reeler in van de r Geest, 1996). I did not find Burmese women taking Thai produced emmenagogues or abortifacients described by Whittaker (2004), although they were also cheap and av ailable in local shops; rather, Burmese women retained their own cultural choice of abortifacient despite living in another country. 61 Nutmeg is found on the tree Myristica fragrans . Nutmeg is psychotropic narcotic. It is toxic if taken in large quantities and produces vertigo, flushing, stupor, and psychological disturbance such as hallucinations and altered consciousness - and one r ecorded death. It is also recorded as an emmenagogue and abortif acient (Weil, 1966). 202Pummelling Vigorous physical activity and 'massage ' are also common abortion methods and women's medical records note histories of accidental falling, trippi ng and slipping. Early pregnancy loss is also attributed to carrying heavy loads and working hard, and incidentally are also considered 'hea ting' activities which may cause abortion.62 Most health workers feel that the women's stor ies of unlikely accidents and too vigorous bicycle riding are fabricated. In the case note review, there were 31 records of women who visited the l\u00e8 the for either massage or stick abortions. Women, health workers and l\u00e8 the gave accounts of vigorous physical actions glossed as massa ge abortions. Mu Mu, a junior health worker at the Mae Tao Clinic, tells about her experience of abortion methods: I think there are more abortions than birt hs, especially in Thailand. The women do it by themselves in many ways. They jump up and down, and fall down roughly on the floor. Other times they go to the l\u00e8 the and she does massage and sometimes kicks the woman's abdomen. Mu Mu's description of viol ent manipulations to end the pregnancy is found in other accounts. The non-government organisation tr anscript is graphic: 'I was trying to have an abortion. I had traditional medicine and massage but I did not abort. I asked my friend to stand on my st omach but I still didn't abort and I had to deliver this baby.' An experienced commun ity health-worker described this type of abortion in more detail: I have a friend in Burma who is a TBA who does massages, deliveries and abortions. She is very skilled. She uses a special r oot to poison the baby. She can do very strong massage with her foot into the woman's perineum and pelvic area which produces an abortion. I heard a story once about a female massage abortionist who had such strong hands she could break the ba by's neck through the wall of the womb. They say you could hear it snap! These types of physical manipulations are more than deep pressure massage as described by Whittaker (2002) or 'pressi ng on a woman's this is pumme lling, vigorous enough to displace well developed implanted foetuses and shear off placentae, causing haemorrhage or uterine 62 Robert Pool also makes the association with cla ss and caste risk factors in (Manderson, 1987). 203rupture. They are painful and physically traumatic. Another external technique described by Karen l\u00e8 the is to 'melt' the foetus, wher eby a hot stone is placed on the abdomen. Often methods are combined. Here a 19 year-old Karen house-maid, who earns 1,000 Baht (US $23) per month, desc ribes her massage-stick abortion: I went to see the ahpwa: gji (old woman). She is about 50 years old. She felt my stomach, she said, 'You are pregnant but only two months.' She put the stem of a flower inside me. A hpwa: gji said if there was any pain to call her and she would come. I paid her 900 Baht because she told me she would fix it. When she did the massage it hurt and ached a lot. Two days later she returned to ahpwa: gji who tried to pull the foetus out with her hands. At this point the young women, in extr eme pain, returned to her Thai employer who took her to the local hos pital where she was admitted for three days, had a D&C and borrowed 1,400 Baht (US $32) from he r employer to pay her hospital bill. Sticks O Htoo Kler, a senior health worker in the reproductive health department at the Mae Tao Clinic, shows me her collection of abor tion sticks. She is shy and only speaks English with me when we are alone. She ha s carefully put the stic ks in plastic bags and taped them to the wall of the examination room as a teaching aid for women and junior health workers. It is a motley collection of old sticks, cotton buds and pieces of leaf matter. She is very composed and ha s managed every type of abortion. She has informed and clear opinions about her patients . I ask her if she is ever shocked by the cases she sees: One special case shocked me. One woman had been to the l\u00e8 the who put a chicken quill inside her. This did not work the fi rst time so she returned twice more. She only bled a little afterwards. The l\u00e8 the did not tell her what she was doing so this woman did not understand that the l\u00e8 the was putting a chicken feather in her. Then the woman came to me and I examined her. She had a high fever and she was two months pregnant. I was shocked when I saw it. I said, 'Do you know what is inside you?' The woman said no. I showed her the feather. I was scared to think what would have happened to her if her womb ha d been perforated. I felt very sorry for this woman that she did not understand wh at had happened. This woman was very poor and could not afford to care for a baby. This woman told me that this was the method that this l\u00e8 the did to everyone. I felt so worried for these women. Women corroborated the stick method of abortion that health workers often witnessed. These sex-workers were aware of the stick technique: 204 She put a leaf stem soaked in soapy water into my womb and she told me that if it works or not, that was not her problem. She told me that I had to look after myself. She took 400 Baht from me and told me that it would abort. This is my third pregnancy. I have never done abortion before this. And another woman: They put two cotton buds into my womb and they wanted me to stay in the l\u00e8 the's house for one night. I had the stick in my womb all night but the baby did not come out easily. So I went to an Islamic l\u00e8 the and she took out my baby piece by piece. I did not have to pay anything because we we re friends. That was my first abortion. The two hsei: jou (medicine sticks - Burmese) that O Htoo Kler gives to me measure 8cm and 9.75cm long, between 0.5 to 0.25 cm wide and have been bent into a V shape by the abortionist. She tells me these are from the kapok tree ( Sipoquay - Karen) but other women suggest that hsei: jou originate from the tobacc o leaf. They are round wooden sticks, light in colour and density, and would probably absorb moisture like osmotic dilators and also irritate the cervix. They cause cramping, fresh blood loss and eventually infection, with fever and ma lodorous vaginal discharge. The risk of perforation of the uterus, bl adder or bowel is high. Ma Nwe Ni - case study Sticks are effective and very dangerous an d the most serious complications seen in this study were caused by stick abortions . The following case of Ma Nwe Ni shows the determination and desperation involved in a stick abortion. The first time I meet Ma Nwi Nee she is curl ed in a ball on a hard bed in the Mae Tao Clinic crying to herself in pain. She is ve ry distressed and we do not interview her. I observed her lack of progress over several days which manifests as high fever and extreme pelvic pain. She is referred to the Mae Sot General Hospital. We interviewed her on her seventh day in the hosp ital. Her chart shows that she is taking a cocktail of antibiotics: Ampicillin, Me tronidazole and Gentamycin. She has an intravenous line in her arm and her haem oglobin is 8.7g/dl. She weighs 42kg. She has been given a tetanus vaccination and th e ultrasound shows a foreign body in her uterus and marked inflammation in her fall opian tubes with bila teral 10cm and 15cm 205abscesses. She is now post- operative but cannot get out of bed and agrees to be interviewed as we sit by her bed. Ma Nwi Nee is very pale and weak but sh e smiles at us. She has short wavy hair, clipped back with two green plastic clips and tinted red. She has peeling nail polish on one hand and wears no jewellery. She has a few freckles over her nose and cheeks. She is 26 years old, married and works in a factory for 85 Baht (US $2) per day. We tell her we saw her come into the Mae Tao Clinic and we are happy she is recovering. She speaks about her abortion: I crossed over the river and went to the Burmese side with my friends. I went to the kjei: za: lethe l\u00e8 the . She doesn't do deliveries - if you give her money she will do an abortion. She is 30 years old and she seems a very nice woman. I asked her how much should I pay? It was 5,000 Kyats (350 Baht). I was only one month and ten days pregnant. She put her fingers inside my vagina. She didn't wear gloves but she did wash her hands. She put hsei: jou (stick) 6cm into me. It seemed like she was a clean woman. This is what she did. She put the stick in with one hand and pushed my womb down with the other hand to meet it. I heard something inside pop, but it did not hurt. Some blood did come out. When she took her fingers out there was some blood on them. I started to bleed but in a st op-start way. I stayed in her house for four days and each day she would change the stic ks. Some days she would put two sticks inside me in one day. When I started to bleed she massaged me on the right side. She kept her fingers on the outside of my pelvic area and she pushed and pushed. She massaged my back too. It really hurt then. After four days I came back to Thailand to get my salary and see my husband. During the night the pain was very bad and I couldn't stand it so my husband took me to Mae Tao Clinic. She shows us her abdominal wound, just above her pubic hair, a 15cm incision that is open at one end with a gauze wick and drai ning clear fluid. Ma Nwi Ni's account is remarkable in that she travelled to Burm a and back into Thailand while the border was closed. Most women found their l\u00e8 the in the town or close to where they lived in Thailand. Secondly, the process of the stick abortion extended over a four day period and involved several insertions and repeated pummelling. Ma Nwe Ni's stamina to endure four days of this type of trea tment shows her determination to end the pregnancy. Ma Nwe Ni did recover and was discharged to the care of Mae Tao Clinic for convalescence - the last time we saw her and her husband, they were discussing a tubal ligation. Though I doubt that she will ever conceive again, nobody had told the young couple that future pregna ncies were very unlikely. 206Pharmaceuticals Kathy Pan is one example of targeted and s ophisticated marketing by the domestic pharmaceutical industry in Burma, wher e pro-natal policies and an under-funded health system do not provide universal fam ily planning services. Etkin (1992) makes the point that cosmopolitan pharmaceuti cal companies manipulate the image or symbols of their product. The perceived or re al side effects of cer tain medications to disrupt a pregnancy are also important. 'In the design of new drugs and modification of existing products, manufacturers of pharm aceuticals continue to manipulate such characteristics as taste, colour, and mode of administration to assure 'compliance' falsely confident in their assessment of how 's ide effects' are interpreted.' This is an equally true statement of the thwei: zei Kathy Pan which straddles an essentialist traditional image of pure Burman womanhood a nd an image of a modern, effective, quick-acting substance, for women with 'menst rual irregularity' who are in paid work or unsanctioned relationships. In discussi ng the life histories of pharmaceuticals from an anthropological perspective, van der Geest (1996:171) makes the following point: Pharmaceuticals provide an eminent example of processes of globalization and localization, and they reveal the insufficiencies and paradoxes of some of the modes we have for analyzing cultural comple xity. Pharmaceuticals and indigenous medicines take on meaning in contrast with one another and thus appear distinctive. At the same time, pharmaceuticals provide a prototype in terms of packaging and marketing for indigenous medicines, so that the difference between them is diminished. Pharmaceutical specialists app ear who belong neither to the tradition of biomedicine as practised in fo rmal health institutions nor the tradition of indigenous medicine. These quacks or charlatans or bush doctors, as they are called by professionals, provide examples of creolization or counter work in that they creatively rework forms and ideas. In a similar fashion, l\u00e8 the adopt intramuscular and intr avenous injection techniques and provide cosmopolitan manufactured oxyt ocics and hormonal preparations in a creole form of their craft. The traditional hsei: jou stems from tobacco leaves are transformed into manufactured cotton buds. In sum, this chapter described how wome n end their pregnancies. Many attempted induced abortions were successful. Self-m edication is common and similar to other documented health seeking behaviour but pa rticularly so where privacy and personal autonomy must be maintained. I have pr esented these abortion methods separately but in practice they are often combined. Thwei: zei and pummelling or sticks and 207pummelling are commonly cited by informan ts as abortion methods. Women often began their abortion attempts by taking accessible thwei: zei such as pepper and water or ginger and sugar cane, often with alc ohol added, when they notice their delayed menstruation. Women also reported taking thwei: zei to assist the blood to flow after a stick abortion 'to make the blood flow faster'. My findings concerning the ambiguous nature of thwei: zei, particularly the culturally processed product Kathy Pan, and the folk understandings of blocke d menstrual blood flow support Sobo's and Skidmore's ideas of flexibility in the interpretation of delayed periods. Thwei: zei is relatively cheap and is surrounded by ambiguity, which means it can be consumed without personal or social acknowledgement of abortion and so maintain personal and spiritual integrity. While this offers Burmese women the opportunity to 'unblock' their menstruation rather than abort and risk social shame, the unregulated sale of pharmaceuticals, both traditional and cosmopolitan, is worrying. Other authors have noted that the indiscriminate use of pharmaceuticals contributes to women's gynaecological morbidity in Thailand (P impawun Boonmongkon, Ni chter, Pylypa, & Kornkaew Chantapasa, 1998). This situation al so exists in Burma where it is possible to purchase hormonal contraceptives, inj ectables, quack medi cine and patented herbals with very little information or h ealth screening (Belt on & [as Ma Suu San], 2002; United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA ) & Department of Health Union of Myanmar, 1999). Women seek out l\u00e8 the through social networks to assist them to abort. According to the women, l\u00e8 the charge money for their services which increases with gestation and in the next chapter I will outline the prices. Both women and l\u00e8 the are aware that abortion was not socially acceptable and some knew that it was also illegal. Women would sometimes make several visits to a l\u00e8 the or even stay for a period of days with her while the abortion procedure occurred. Some husbands are aware of the decision to abort and assisted with transportation a nd payment. Very few women insert objects by themselves and there was only one account of a woman using a piece of bamboo to abort herself. A few women attempt to pummel their own lower abdomen or ask others to stand on or kick them in the pe lvic region. As all of the women who told their abortion story were r ecruited from a hospital-like environment, most had suffered complications such as extreme pain, haemorrhage, infection and genito-pelvic trauma. This is probably not th e case with all self-i nduced abortions and 208perhaps many women are able to 'bring down the blood' in the pr ivacy of their own homes without experiencing complications. 209Chapter 8 Mercenary Midwives - the abortionists Nowadays governments are increasingly accep ting the idea that they cannot push the traditional midwives aside, but they mostly train them in schoolroom situations and simply confuse and bewilder them. The hos tility built up by the generations of struggle between modern technicians and traditional attendants is not easily neutralised; many midwife training programmes are as perfunctory... (Greer, 1984:28). Around Mae Sot, the lay midwives are the ma in providers of abortion services. The abortionists are invariably de scribed as other, evil and greedy. People call them the mercenary-midwives ( kjei: za: lethe- l\u00e8 the ), or the ones who only care about money. 63 Lay midwives have a diverse prac tice, incorporating traditional and cosmopolitan methods. Many deliver babies and some offer herbals, injections, intravenous drips, pummelling and stick abor tions which vary in efficacy and danger. I was able to meet and interview three lay midwife-abortionists. In discussing types of reproductive health care certain binaries are invoked su ch as traditional versus modern, safe versus unsafe, interventionist versus non-interventionist and this is also the case in my discussion of unsafe, trad itional methods and the lay midwives who employ them. In the field of public health, the question arises concerning the efficacy of training traditional birth attendants. The arguments on who TBAs are, where they work and what they should or could do are central th emes. The multiple names and functions of the people who assist women to birth have confused researchers and policy makers for decades (Buekens, 2003; Cook, 2002). This confusion has led to ineffective 63 In Mexico midwives who perform abortions are called dogs or pigs (Castaneda et al., 2003). 210development programmes (Pigg, 1995), and more recently have ini tiated calls to pay greater attention to local c onditions. The World Health Organization (World Health Organization, 1995) briefly included traditiona l birth attendants (TBAs) in its Safe Motherhood agenda to recognise the compli cations of abortion, but does not mention them in the range of providers or community level care in later documents (World Health Organization, 2003b). The Mae Tao Clinic staff, informally trained health workers themselves, engage with local TBAs and offer training, supplies and a point of referral. In addition, travelling teams of health workers and informally trained midwives from the Mae Tao Clinic cross the border into several borderlands of Burma to provi de primary health care to villages. In the borderlands reproductive health is delivered by lay midwives, due in part to the poor development of Burma and the policy of 'Four Cuts' against insurgent areas by the SPDC, as I discussed in chap ter 2. The Union of Myanmar's initial CEDAW submission reports both private and public provision of h ealth services, the use of traditional and m odern pharmaceuticals and that midwives and 'auxiliary midwives' (essentially lay midwives with only 6 months training) are fundamental and multipurpose health workers (Union of Myanmar, 1999). Who is a TBA? The variety of roles that the ubiquitous label 'TBA' hides is vast and this is one of the problems universal notions of training for TBAs has encountered. Who is a TBA and what does she do? In some communities th ere are women who are either chosen or who experience a vocation to assist women during birth. They may or may not be apprenticed to older women to learn skills , or they may have empirical knowledge of motherhood (Lukere & Jolly, 2002). In so me communities, there exists no such person as an attendant for the birthing wo man or someone who acknowledges this rite of passage (Allotey, 1995; Byford, 1999). The label 'traditional birth atte ndant' is problematic as it imp lies a generic role that is more diverse than the role of the midwife. A midwife generally refers to someone who has completed a formal biomedical course , is lower in status than an obstetrician, and is paid for her services. The traditional birth attendant is a label given to people who take a role in supporting women in some form, during pregnancy and childbirth, 211who are not formally trained nor work within a framework of biomedicine. They are often not paid for their services or are paid in kind instead, and are found at the village level as well as working in towns. I refer to them as lay midwives or use the Burman term l\u00e8 the, which means the person who uses her hands; the 'hand-operator' according to Mi Mi Khaing (1984:67). The TBA's role varies from the person who cleans away the 'polluted' material that emanates from the birth, to the person w ho advises the woman how to protect herself and her infant from witchcraft and evil sp irits, to providing care during the delivery and post partum period; a role that is cu lturally imbued with specific status and meaning (Hoban, 2002; Rozario, 1995). Antenata l care is rare but can also be found in some communities, often consisting of ma ssage, but also other ritual activities (Berer and Ravindran 2000; Davis-Fl oyd, 1997; Lindenbaum and Locke Ram and Jolly 1998). As Pigg argues, the 'TBA ' may well see her other tasks as more important than the act of birth: A spectrum of birth-related concerns, spanning issues of ritual pollution, the vulnerability of pregnant women and infants to witchcraft and ritual debt, to issues of modesty and embarrassment are reorganized in the framework for training TBAs. The varying social, emotional, protective or pollution-carrying roles the trainees might actually be playing is subsumed under the role of managing birth itself (Pigg, 1995:57). Some lay midwives use their skills to induce abortions (C aouette et al., 2000; Castaneda et al., 2003) but this is rarely mentioned in th e literature. The roles of midwife and abortionist are not incompatible. In Tak province the Burmese lay midwives take on a variety of roles: childcare provider, masseur, herbalist, accoucheur and provider of traditional and modern contraception. Older lay midwives are su spicious of modern methods of family planning and feel they are too 'strong' or 'drying for the womb'. They recommend a revers ible procedure involving exte rnal manipulation. Younger lay midwives were curious about condoms a nd pills and are keen to learn to 'inject medicine'. Abortion is availabl e and provided by lay midwives. 212 Plate 23 Lay midwives work with their hands to deliver babies and perform abortions Plate 24 Preparation of an abortion stick 213Tradition & modernity Competing notions are frequently invoked in discussions around lay midwifery: tradition versus modernity, safe versus unsaf e, evidence versus intuition and cultural versus corporeal. As Luke re & Jolly (2002) explai n, natural-technological, indigenous-colonial, passive-a ctive and other binaries, are evoked from imagined locations, politicised places and historicised times often represented as resistance and in competition, when often they exist simu ltaneously and are negot iated and utilised by women. Traditional customs can be bene ficial, wellness promoting and likewise harmful and limiting. 'Tradition', 'nature' a nd 'culture' are frequently romanticised, plucked from an imaginary past that possi bly never existed. The traditional methods of fertility management used by abortionist s in Tak province cannot be romanticised. They are rudimentary and cause harm but th ey are also effective in ending unwanted pregnancies and in demand by women who wi sh to limit their family, space their babies or defer motherhood to a la ter point in time. Training TBAs Two of the stated agendas of the Safe Motherhood Initiative include: firstly, the training of professional midwives to work in communities as well as hospitals and secondly, promoting midwives to 'train a nd incorporate TBAs into the work of primary care facilities and the health syst em, and gradually to replace TBAs with midwives in the community' (Marg Berer & Ravindran, 1999:7). In order to train young women in formal institutions to be midwives, countries need to have the will, the infrastructure and political and economic stability which is not the case in many countries (Marg Berer & Ravindran, 1999). Since the 1970s, policies to train young women formally to be midwiv es and place them in towns and villages, or to provide more training to existing or potential TBAs who are already in the villages, have been implemented. Both policies have their a dvocates and critics (Fauveau, 1991; Nessa, 1995). The World Health Organization has in the past supported TBAs in the provision of birth kits and training but this is seen by many authors as an interim solution, with formally trained midwives a better option (Kamal, 1998; Maglacas, 1986). Furthermore, even if young midwives are trained in sufficient numbers, they often 214find themselves with poor roads, no means of long-distance communication and nowhere within accessible reach to refe r women who develop complications. The provision of affordable, acceptable, and accessi ble emergency referral services is also an essential component of quality pregnanc y and post-abortion care (Berer, 1993); as Nessa (1995) acknowledges, TBAs alone cannot save women's lives and formal health services are crucial. Hoban's ( 2002) analysis of maternity care in Cambodia also recognises the value of the TBA and suggests a combined system of formally trained midwife and traditional care. For young, formally trained midwives, the so cial and cultural differences between health service provider and acceptor can be so vast as to negate meaningful contact (Lukere & Jolly, 2002). 64 Many Karen women in refugee camps prefer to birth with a Karen birth attendant in their own hut rath er than attend the free and accessible health facility provided by the in ternational non-government orga nisations sanctioned by the Ministry of Interior in Thailand (Na oko Ishikawa, 2000). Similarly, Camey and colleagues (1996:199) note that Mexican women choose TBAs even when they have access to free, state health care as they shar e the same 'cultural codes', categorisation of sickness and trust and good communica tion. But they also point out the inadequacies of many lay midwives: The TBAs are quite limited when it comes to recognizing some risk signs, they do not provide asepsis of material and equipment, they misuse or abuse certain drugs and herbs, they massage (external womb ma noeuvre) in order to change the position of the fetus. These practices cast doubt upon the effectiveness of TBA care since they may have negative effects on the pregnant woman and her baby (Camey et al., 1996:200). Similarly, abortion can be a safe pro cedure if conducted cl eanly with a good technique, but Burmese TBAs in Tak do not practice aseptically, do no use safe equipment, lack basic resources such as soap and clean water, and do not have a deep understanding of the complica tions of abortion. As illu strated in the previous chapters, some of the la y midwives practices are harmful to women. 64 See chapter 5, Colonial Impregnations: Reconceptions of Maternal Health Practice on Nua'ata, Papua New Guinea by Mallett in (Lukere & Jolly, 2002). The local women's discomfort in dealing with a male community health worker's westerni sed approach to childbearing, as well as their confusion in talking with the anthropologist is deftly depicted. 215 Conversely, there are suppor ters who value the TBA's role and argue for the provision of formal training to provide matern al and public health ca re in countries as diverse as Bangladesh (Maglacas & Simons, 1986), Cambodia (Hoban, 2002), Pakistan (Miller et al., 1995), Ghana, Me xico (Hoff, 1997) and Burma (Tin Tin Hmun, 1980). They cite measurable incr eases of knowledge, skill attainment, better outcomes for women and infants, cultural acce ptability and low costs to patients as reasons why it is beneficial to train TBAs and incorporate them in reproductive health care services. The paper entitled Evaluation Findings - Support to Traditional Birth Attendants (United Nations Population Fund 1996) claims that UNFPA, WHO and UNICEF should work together to support TB As with the three pronged approach: to enhance the linkage between health care serv ices and the community; to increase the number of births that are attended by a skilled assistant; and to improve the skills, understanding and status of TBAs. This is a very top-down development approach. Nowhere does it talk about community part icipation or involving local women in the process of improving their maternity care. The conclusion of the report finds women do not experience universal health care cove rage, TBAs provide the service, therefore it is best to train them and provide more atte ntion to the quality of care at the referral site. But this debate is irrelevant fo r those women who want a safe abortion and whose only recourse is herbals or a visit to the l\u00e8 the . It is unlikely that the UNFPA or WHO will train TBAs to perform safer abortions. In the past, colonial medical workers in Burma did not favour traditional birth attendants. In January 1887, Dr TF Pedley gave a paper in London titled, Midwifery among the Burmese , recorded for posterity in The Lancet . He describes with obvious disgust the 'primitive' practices of the trad itional birth attendants (Pedley, 1887:176). 'The midwives are the poorest and lowest cl ass, their chief qualification being age and being the mother of large families. The mo re decrepit, the more they are respected. All new methods are resisted.' He then outlines how the mother's body is washed and rubbed with turmeric and saffron placed on her vulva, after which she stays by the fire for smoking and steaming. He then sums up his very negative vi ews of traditional birth attendants and gives the solution. 'The native system leaves little for perverted 216ingenuity to devise towards preventing recovery, and is about the most severe and fatal in the world. The remedy is a supply of properly trained Burmese midwives.' Although, in other colonies there were effo rts to train and inte grate TBAs within maternal and child health programmes (Manderson, 1996). Burma's developmental trajectory is not the same as Malaysia, wh ere Manderson (1996) describes the history of the increasing regulation of midwifery and the marginalisation of the local lay midwife. In colonial Malaya women were encouraged to submit to health examinations, and give birth in hospital with a trained health worker rather than the local bidan (lay midwife) with the hope of increasing infant survival. In 1912, bidan were receiving training and plac ed under the supervision of 'lady' medical doctors. In Thailand, a country only colonised by economic imperatives, Whittaker describes the 'demise of the traditional birth attendant' to a minimalist role (Whittaker, 2002a). Over one hundred years later in Burma, there was still no universal coverage by trained midwives but the 'primitive' traditional birth attendant was still patiently doing her work as Dr Tin Tin Hmun records in the Burma Medical Journal (Tin Tin Hmun, 1980). In her short article, Training of Traditional Birth Attendants (Lethe), she uses the Burmese word for traditional birth attendants, in acknowledgement of her own culture, but her tone is very pragmatic . She discusses the governments' plan to offer fifty percent maternity health care coverage by 1982 in Burma: (W)e cannot ignore the existence of the tr aditional birth attendants who are virtually ubiquitous. They are found in almost every village and in many urban neighbourhoods. They are about the only s ource of assistance for maternal and child care needs in many rural Communities(sic). In Burma they are an important category as they deliver about 60% of the babies in the rural areas and are creditable (sic) sources of communications for maternal and child care (1980: 69). Her suggestions followed the World H ealth Organisatio n, UNFPA and UNICEF approach to train, minimise harmful pr actices, and support 'modern' health care providers to work with TBAs. She went further than the WHO - Safe Motherhood recommendations, as she calls for training programmes to suit local conditions and to preserve the special cultural practices and knowledge that the l\u00e8 the possess and not alienate them from cultura l capital. However, she s till suggests that 'modern' 217midwives are the solution and trained l\u00e8 the are only an interim measure. Twenty years later Burma still remains in the 'interim' situation. The training programmes for TBAs have come under serious scrutiny. Stacy Leigh Pigg (1995) is critical of programmes in Ne pal that offer univer sal solutions via the training of traditional birth attendants. She argues that the training programmes for traditional birth attendants fragment local realities and generalise across divergent contexts. The development agencies place themselves in positions of power over their participants and are able to control the interpretation of information and knowledge, discounting local cultural capital. Her crit icisms are aimed at the whole notion of development. But I argue that the reci pients of global development aid are not passive and actively engage in training. 'Traditional' and 'mode rn' are interpreted and reinvented by the very people Pigg says are disenfranchise d by the process of global power imbalances. Tradition and m odernity blend to evolve new forms, as Charles Leslie has stated (cited in Nich ter & Lock, 2002), and these forms are readily taken up by birth attendants. Researchers in Mexico note the blending of midwifery craft: It should be noted that there is a growing tendency among TBAs towards the use of a plurality of resources, practices and sources of knowledge. Except in very isolated regions, it is rare for a TBA not to use tools that originate both in biomedicine and in traditional medicine, either combining both or in alternation. There is a need therefore to formulate evaluation methods which will represent elements of both traditions, where two worlds come into contact through the interaction of practices (Xochitl Castaneda Camey et al 1996: 200). Around Mae Sot, l\u00e8 the use oxytocin injections and intravenous lines, cotton-buds, gloves and soap while they pe rform their abortions. The l\u00e8 the also refer to texts prepared by NGOs working in development. Dr Cynthia Maung, a stateless refugee docto r, chooses to train young health workers in maternal and child care as well as offer training and referral support to traditional birth attendants. She works outside of state sanctioned systems and across nation- state boundaries. For displaced communities who cannot rely on the state to provide health services, or who do not wish to rely on internationa l good-will, community initiated primary health care is their only c hoice. The Mae Tao Clinic has a policy of 218training women (and some men) in the TBA role to assist pregnant women because Burmese women give birth at home in Burma and in Thailand (Skidmore, 1997; United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) & Department of Health Union of Myanmar, 1999). The Mae Tao Clinic staff train older self-identified l\u00e8 the as well as younger women nominated by their communities, in aspects of normal birth, hygiene, nutrition, infant care and family planning; they are given kits of soap and clean razor blades if supplies exist (Maung, 2001, 2003) . Abortion is not discussed with l\u00e8 the during training sessions (W EAVE, 2001), unlike in India where it is included (Ramachandar & Pelto, 2002). A study (Tongplaew Narkavonnakit, 1979) of 81 Thai illegal abortion practitioners in northern rural Thailand, found that the majo rity were married women, with several children. Their main income was earned th rough a partner's empl oyment, agricultural activity, or their TBA role. Only 14% relied solely on the income from abortions to sustain their household. Abor tion was widely practised in the region. The methods used to induce an abortion were similar to those I have described in chapter 7. The researcher found the abortionist s cooperative and concluded: These persons are trusted, long-standing community members, who for the most part have shown concern for meeti ng this family planning need. With training, they might play important roles as abortion referral agents or providers of postabortion care (Tongplaew Narkavonnaket 1979:227). In Tak province and the border lands of Burma, l\u00e8 the are private practitioners who charge fees. Almost all of the respondents reported paying for the abortion. The only women who did not were those who performe d it by themselves with herbs, self- massage/pressure or by inserting a bamboo shard. One woman reported the abortionist was her friend and it was seen as a favour between them. Most women paid a l\u00e8 the at the time of procedure but in some cases the l\u00e8 the was prepared to do the abortion and wait for payment if the woman could not fund it immediately. In Mae Sot town and rural area, women paid on average 500 Baht (US $12) if they were less than three months gestation. The pr ice was the same for pummelling massage and herbs or a stick aborti on. Two women who were ov er three months gestation were asked to pay between 1000 to 2000 Baht (US $23 to $46) but they say that when 219they explained their situation and begged the l\u00e8 the ; she reduced her fee to 600 Baht (US $14). Recent literature reports a model to impr ove post-abortion care in Burma which includes formally trained midwives and l\u00e8 the in post-abortion care provision (Thein Thein Htay et al., 2003). They suggest th at lay midwives can act as community educators and health promoters to inform women how to avoid unsafe abortion by other means of fertility management; how to detect the signs and symptoms of abortion complications, and re fer women on to other prac titioners. None of the Burmese lay midwives admitted to performing abortions. In Burma, researchers were reasonably certain that the l\u00e8 the were the main providers of abortion but no l\u00e8 the in their focus group discussions revealed perfor ming abortions (Thein Thein Htay et al., 2003). Castaneda and colleagues (2003) study of the abortion belief s and practices of lay midwives in Mexico found that most we re reluctant to provide assistance to women experiencing post-abort ion complications for they did not know what to do and feared retribution from medical or legal authority figures. Meeting the mercenary midwives The representatives of each ethnic-religious group I questioned told me that 'their' women neither procured nor pr oduced abortions, but they hear d that others did. I was told the abortionists were altogether different from other midwives that had worked in the community. Abortionists whose work is proscribed in every sense are neither easy to find nor readily available to interview in the course of research, and I felt my chance of meeting one who would openly disc lose her practice qu ite remote. I did wonder if some of the lay midwives I inte rviewed also performe d abortions and we skirted around the topic often. The women who had abortions did talk about their abortionists: what they were like, how mu ch they charged, where they practised, and how they responded to them, so I felt that we had insight into abortion practices through the eyes of clients. To my own su rprise I did have the opportunity to meet three Burmese abortionists - a Muslim, a Buddhist and a Christian - who allowed me to understand their perspectives of their work. I met one by accident, one by a long process of gaining trust in the community and one by an act of caring for a young woman's health. 220Villages of iron and nerves of stee l - how to find an abortionist The Burmese health workers introduced me to the lay midwives who came for training at the Mae Tao Clinic. They live in several small communities near the centre of the town or scatte red through the farmland in shanty dwellings, tiny houses that leaked rain and were close to the muddy ground, patched together with sheets of plastic, discarded timber, bamboo and corruga ted iron. In one sh anty village, there was a small group of informal commun ity volunteer health workers who work together across a number of settlements a nd support each other in doing so. Each community health volunteer has different ski lls with which she feels competent, such as massage, baby-care, herbal medicines or deliveries. I talked with them in structured focus-group type m eetings, individual interviews , or while sitting drinking, and chatting informally. The community health workers also do paid itinerant work, such as carrying loads in the market or daily paddy field work according to the season. Their wages are below poverty levels and they have no access to clean drinking water. Some of the settlements have a few flushable squat toile ts but not enough for everyone. The Thai police sporadically raid the communities a nd one or two people ar e taken to jail until they pay the 'fine' or are taken to the bridge to be sent back to Burma; they return to Tak when it is safe again. The communiti es have existed like this for years. Ma Khin Swe Thet, a Burman volunteer health worker, exists on the fringes of Thai society. This excerpt fr om my field notes descri bes her living conditions: Clean washing hangs between all the trees, old shirts with holes in them, sun- bleached loungji , towels and patchwork blankets made from old scraps of material. Ma Khin Swe Thet's house has two areas, 2m x 3m in total, one for living and sleeping and the other for cook ing. It is not pos sible to stand up inside. The roof is made of large dried leaves and has many holes patched with rusty flattened biscuit tins. Her kitchen is simply a charcoal burner and she has large plastic canisters filled with well-water close by. She washes her dishes in a black plastic bowl while s quatting on her haunch es (Field notes 2002). 221Ma Khin Swe Thet enjoys talking. She has more than five years of schooling and can read and write. She is a busy woman, with children of her own to care for, a husband, her health volunteer duties and paid work. She never calls herself l\u00e8 the because she believes she is still too inexpe rienced but is working toward s that goal. During one of the chats with a cold drink and lepetho (fermented spicy tea leaf salad), I ask how many women in the community are currently pregnant. There are more than ten and also lots of children with no immunisations, Ma Khin Swe Thet tells Rose. We offer to organise a small truck to take the pr egnant women and children to the Mae Tao Clinic for a health check. My field not es describe how we met Hassinah and her abortionist. Hassinah introduces her abortionist At the pre-arranged time, Rose and I drive to each shanty community in a truck calling for the women and childre n. Women gather their toddlers on their hips and climb in the back. The wome n believe that if I sit in the back of the truck in the most visible spot, the Thai police will not stop it. As we drive up to a wooden house, I notice a young pale Burmese woman sitting on her veranda wrapped in a blanket. She shudde rs with cold although the day is hot. She has turmeric paste rubbed into he r arms and hands which gives her a jaundiced appearance. 'Are you sick sister?' 'No, nothing is wrong - leave me alone.' 'Sister we are going to the Clin ic, let us take you. Do you have malaria?' 'No, I can't go with you.' Everyone tries to cajole her in to riding with us in the truck but she hesitates. She is in great pain and only when she stands up to go inside her house and leaves a large pool of scarlet sticky blood on the wood that I realise she is aborting. We increase our efforts. Eventually, after much neighbourly harassment, the young woman drags herself into the truck and nearly faints. We support her feverish and turmeric c overed body over our laps until we get 222to the Mae Tao Clinic. Today we are lu cky because the Thai police do not stop us (Field notes 2002). Hassinah spent three days in the Mae Tao Clinic with a di agnosis of a se ptic induced abortion. On admission, a medical examination reveals that her cervical os is torn and open a couple of centimetres; the decompos ing foetal tissue is palpable. She is feverish, nauseated and weak. The health workers start an intravenous infusion to correct her shock. Her haemoglobin level is low at 9g/dl and she has a vacuum curette (MVA), antibiotics and a tetanus vaccination. She tells the health workers that this her third pregnancy and sh e has two living children. She is 27 years of age. Rose and I visit her before her discharge from th e Clinic and she thanks us for bringing her to the Mae Tao Clinic. She tells us she spent two days in pain aborting at home before we found her. We ask for an interv iew and she tells us to meet her in her house in a few days when she will be stronger. Hassinah began her story four days later when we visited her at home. She tells Rose and me that she has lived in Mae Sot fo r seven years and worked in the garment factory. Her mother arranged her marriag e to Mohammed when she was 20 and she had to stop working. But her husband onl y accumulated debts and never worked. Recently, he left her. The debt collector s come every day and she and her mother have no money. She starts to tell us about the abortion a nd her abortionist: I have been pregnant three times. I ha ve a son who is five and a one-year-old daughter. I aborted this third pr egnancy at two months. I took Quedezee and Muedezee , these are hot medicines. I started to get pains. The period did not come out it started 'to go up' (causing pain). Then I went to the massage woman ( a ne the ) and I didn't really see what she did. She told me she would check me - she put her fingers inside me but it hurt and I screamed. I couldn't see what she did and I was in a lot of pain. It cost me 400 Baht because I was already two months pregnant. I knew her from when I was pregnant with my son. She massaged me then. I can see that she is poor and the room is very dirty. When she put her fingers inside me she didn't wear gloves. She didn't tell me what she was doing. There were children in the room and they were playing. Hassinah agrees to show us where her abor tionist lives. She does not want to come with us but will point to the abortionist's house and we should keep her secret. Ma Khin Swe Thet also knows the area and later that week we all walk over to the Islamic area of town. 223Daw Aminah - the abortionist Daw Aminah is in her 80's and we find her in a small, dark, smelly hut, filled with flies and mosquitoes. Many neighbours come to the open door to listen and look and then finally go away. One stoned drug addict sits with us until we gave him twenty Baht to go away. The front room contains a sleeping mat, dirty bed linen and two old TVs. She has a charcoal stove in the back of the hut which makes everything sooty. The toilet is wet and dirty and two chic kens roost inside. Daw Aminah chews kun: ja and her clothes are old and torn. She has yellow-white hair in a bun and about three teeth. Her mood is very strange - she changes from happy to scared and angry abruptly - she does not appear mentally st able. We sit on her dirty mats and she begins to talk about her life. I am from Burma! I don't like it here but I won't go back because it is too difficult to travel there. I've been here fifteen year s. I can see and I can hear and I don't need glasses! Don't ask me how I do abortions! Actually, at this point, we have not as ked her about abortion so her outburst is disconnected. She tells us she is from Moul mein and married at fourteen; she had her first child one year later. She delivered a nd cut the cord herself and carried her baby home in her sarong. She had another twelve babies. She lived with her husband for 30 years until he died when her last baby was still small. She became a l\u00e8 the at age 44. Then suddenly she begins to talk a bout abortion, again not due to prompting by us as we can barely follow her train of thought and her outburst s are quite erratic. If the baby is moving I don't do it. If the baby is still I use my hands. If it is blood I do it. I use gloves and I pull it out... If women want child spacing I lift the womb for them and it lasts three or four years... I didn't need to worry about feeding my family because I had my God. I took my children to school, some went some didn't it was up to them. I live here with my grandchildren because my daughter has a new husband and she only took one child with her. I look after them. I live poorly but my heart is not poor... I don't understand anything about family pla nning I just lift the womb. I have heard about the needles in the arm (points to arm), htou: zei , pills. Also men and women's sterilisation but it's not good! It's not good because it dries the womb out. So I lift wombs. It is better and if they want it reversed I can move it back. 224We left after more than one hour of liste ning to Daw Aminah ramble through her life and thoughts on fertility. I could not tell whet her she was acting insanely to disarm us or if she truly was paranoi d and confused. Rose and Ma Khin Swe Thet were astounded and were unable to explain the woman's apparent madness. Daw Aminah had little to show materially for her abortion craft and she did not disclose her practice although she admitted she did do abortions . The squalor and lack of hygiene explained the fulminant infections wi th which some women presented. Ma Khin Swe Thet agreed to introduce me to another abortionist, more coherent than Daw Aminah. Ma Khin Swe Thet discloses that she too had an abortion long ago because her husband was always arguing w ith her and they had no money. She does not exactly say this is her abortionist but perhaps she is. The abortionist is very cautious so I had to write to her first and Ma Khin Swe Thet delivered the letter for me. Some weeks later I receive her reply which tells me that the abortionist is married, 41 years-old, has six children, is Buddhist and has lived in Thailand for twelve years after migrating from Pa-an, Bu rma. She readily admits to practicing abortions at three to four months and that her clients are married and single women who often have problems with money or their husbands. She says she has done the TBA training and wants to help women with their problems. She says she explains to women that she puts nails, medicine and plas tic inside them - some women leave but some stay. She says that if the women are poor she does not ta ke their money (See Appendix F). I send a note back to the letter writing abor tionist, thanking her for her reply and ask to meet her. I hear nothing. Ma Thida - the abortionist Some weeks later the secret letter writer invites me to her house and Rose and I and Ma Khin Swe Thet ride on bicycles over the dr y bumpy paddy fields to meet her. It is a very hot day even though it is still early in the morning and I can feel the sweat sliding down my neck. The third abortionist has finally gathered her courage to meet with me in her own house after months of negotiation and w ith the diplomatic assistance of Ma Khin Swe Thet. We a ll walk into a small compound of shanty houses where there are eight wooden houses join ed together with tin roofs. We go inside one small house and there are a large group of adults and children. There is very little inside the house except a Buddhist shrine high on the wall with some wilted 225yellow flowers. We introduce ourselves and I comment on the heat. A man begins to fan me with a National League for Democracy magazine with a big bright picture of Daw Aung San Sui Kyi on the cove r. I take it from him to fan myself and begin to talk about some of the awards and honour s she has received and how well respected she is internationally. The group becomes animated and they tell me they are her supporters. After a while I ask everyone in the tiny house if I may speak with Ma Thida privately and with good humour the neig hbours and friends l eave us alone. Her husband, the man who fanned me, remains by he r side. She is 41-years old, skinny with a long face and betel stained teeth. She wears a simple cotton sarong and top. Her hair is long and still dark and wound around a comb placed at the back of her head. Her husband is about the same age, quite plump with a larg e tattoo on his chest. He also has betel stained t eeth. They both can read. As we talk dogs scuffle under the house below us. Suzanne: How did you become a l\u00e8 the ? Ma Thida: I went to the training at the M ae Tao Clinic and with other NGOs and then afterwards just practiced with pregnant women - that was about six years ago now. Suzanne: Did you do any kind of health work before this? Ma Thida: No Suzanne: Why did they pick you for training? Ma Thida: I don't know but my community knows I like to help people. [She stands up and picks something off the shelf. It is the WEAVE Train the Trainer book for traditional birth attendants, whic h was modeled from the World Health Organization.] Ma Thida: I can read Burmese. This is my reference book. If I see people doing things wrong I know what is right from this book. Sometimes I can explain things to others. [We give her an assortment of health in formation pamphlets in Burmese and Karen languages on AIDS, family planning and general health topics.] Ma Thida: Yes, these are good. I have some Karen women who come to see me so this is useful... 226Suzanne: You told me before that you had a special teacher - what did this teacher teach you? [She smiles...] Ma Thida: When I was pregnant a friend asked me to get her some hsei: jou stick so she could do an abortion. I went and got them for her. My friend was five months pregnant but I didn't do it. She took a hsei: jou stick and did it herself. After I arrived in Thailand when my daughter was little I started to do them myself. Suzanne: May I ask you exactly how you do it? Ma Thida: I use a stem of a leaf from a tree. This tree can be used to prevent constipation and also it cures bladder infections. [She goes outside her house and collects a l eaf with a long pink stem. The stem is 15cm long and thin. She demonstrates her technique using her fingers and thumb to make a womb.] Ma Thida: I push the stem inside the womb. After about 30 minutes to one hour blood comes out. The stem is soft, it bends [she pushes it against her arm and it does bend]. It is a safe stick to use. [We talk about the V-shaped harder sticks I have seen and I tell her that she is unlikely to cause a perforation with this soft stem but it still not clean for the woman.] Suzanne: Is it poisonous? Ma Thida: I don't know. Suzanne: Before you said you use nails and plastic....? Ma Thida: No, I never do this. I just say th is to scare the women to see if they really want the abortion. Tha Uu Lah - the abortionist Rose and I decide to travel into the rural areas around the town where most farm workers can be found. We have made some connections alrea dy with focus-group discussions and introductions through key in formants. Today we will meet a female Burmese migrant in her thirtie s who has no work permit and s till learning the craft of l\u00e8 the . She has helped to deliver 50 babies in th e four years since arriving in Thailand. 227There are about 2,000 Burmese mi grants in her community. She can read and write and has attended some training at the Mae Tao Clinic. She also wants to learn to do injections and spends some of her own money, which she has earned from sewing, on medicines for her community. Her house is lik e a plastic tent with a wooden floor; in the afternoon we walk around her community and she intr oduces us to sex-workers and farm workers. As we talk about her li fe and the women she looks after, she tells us that abortion is common and goes on to describe how the women try hot medicines and massages and then sticks when those methods fail. She casually mentions her housemate who performs abortions. We are very surprised and ask if we can talk with her and so the second abortionist is found by pure luck. This woman is a petite Karen woman, a Chri stian. She is in her 40's and has several grown children and a husband. Her children work in Burma and she and her husband now work on a farm. Tha Uu Lah found that her reputation of working in a hospital in Burma drew the local women to ask for help. She worked in a maternity hospital as a cleaner and nurse-aide and observed and learnt. When she was young, her aunt died during childbirth and this greatly infl uenced her desire to become a nurse but with her limited education, this was not possi ble. She has delivered a small number of live babies and recently did two abortions. The local women come and tell her their problems, particularly concerning their husband s' infidelities and l ack of support. She combines her 'massage' practice with the use of ginger and sugarcane, and Chinese medicine ( Kwa: da zei ) which is cheaply available in the shops. I want to know why she does not use the stick method: I don't like it. It is very dangerous for your womb. Something can happen. A woman might get cancer or infections with sticks.65 I don't do it so I don't know much about it. I don't know anyone around here who does it with a stick. She tells me she does not ask for money because when a practitioner asks for a fee it raises expectations of success; she conced es she accepts donations. Her conscience dictates her practice. She says: 65 Infections and cancer can be linked in women's minds and they do not necessarily differentiate between the microbial and intra-ce llular characteristics of gynaecological morbidity. See (Whittaker, 2000) Intimate Knowledge: Women and their health in north-east Thailand and also (Pimpawun Boonmongkon et al., 1 998) on ethno-understandings of gy naecological well-being. 228 If something happens to them I don't want to feel bad. If it works well for them and they want to give something to me I would accept it. I don't want to swap my knowledge for money. I want to help women. The only thing I want to tell you is I want to help the woman and her family. I am not interested in abortion. If they need it how can I refuse them? She is very interested to learn more about modern methods of cont raception. She lifts and mobilises wombs for women if they request it and she says she would go to training if it were offered. Post-abortion care? None of the women who were admitted for pos t-abortion complications said that their abortionist recommended visiti ng a formally trained health worker in the eventuality of excessive pain, bleeding or fever. The belief that it wa s good to bleed copiously to clean out the uterus was widely held by women and the l\u00e8 the . During one of the interviews with Ma Thida, the abortionist , one young woman return ed feeling unwell. She wore a thick jacket, woollen hat a nd socks and was shivering. She had her abortion three days previously at about six w eeks gestation. She said to Ma Thida, 'I am unwell and I have a fever. I don't think all the pieces came out.' Ma Thida talked with her briefly. She did not touch her or examine her. She told her not to wash her hair and that she could expect to bleed for six weeks. She needed to avoid carrying heavy things, she should not concentrate on tasks for too long or she would get a headache and bleed more. She should avoid mushrooms, salted bamboo shoots and green vegetables. Ma Thida advised her to return if she felt worse. The young woman prepared to leave and as she sat on the floor and she bowed her head to the floor three times at Ma Thida's fe et in a posture of deep respect. 66 Each abortionist is different: Daw Aminah the elderly, 'crazy ' Muslim widow who tries to support her large family and ye t remain a devout woman; Tha Uu Lah the Karen woman who tries to only do massage a bortions for 'blood' babies and does not directly ask for money, who one day wants to be a 'real midwife'; and the inquisitive Ma Thida who wants to know how to do a clean and safe abortion and adopts other people's children when they have too ma ny. Ma Thida actually tries to frighten 66 I only witnessed this type of reverence in wors hippers at temples during the rituals before Buddha images or monks. This is not the routine way to take leave in Burmese company. 229women from completing the abortion by tell ing them she will put nails and plastic inside their wombs. In sum, the abortionists represented themselves as caring women serving the community, however many community members and other l\u00e8 the felt they were degenerate and immoral women who only th ought about money. Their services are greatly in demand as women have many unwanted pregnancies and limited knowledge or access to reliable methods of contraception. All were aware of the illegality and the moral and religious dilemma of abortion. Their practices are not hygienic or safe for women. Their own living conditions are unsanitary and at poverty levels. They do accept money for a bortion services but graduate the amount according the woman's perceived means; a nd gestation. While they were not mercenary women they were private practitione rs. In some cases they prefer not to receive remuneration. The 'mercenary' mi dwives were not visibly wealthy - none had motorbikes or refrigerators or copious amounts of gold jewellery. The abortionists knew how to deliv er babies and had attende d TBA training programmes by local non-government organisations or the Mae Tao Clinic, and used their new skills to enhance their own practice of abortion and reputation in the community. The notion of training traditional birth attendants is problematic as it is often patronising and employed from a positio n of authority. But most of the l\u00e8 the interviewed said they enjoyed their trai ning and would like to learn more; they complained that they did not have enough s upport from Mae Tao Clinic. For example, after learning about soap and gloves they remarked they wanted a steady supply but materials were often not available. My im pression of the quality of post-abortion care provided by l\u00e8 the is that it is supe rficial to non-existent. Abortion and the complications of abortion are not discussed during training at the Mae Tao Clinic and this could be introduced. L\u00e8 the appreciated provision of referral opportunities and the younger l\u00e8 the were interested to learn more about modern methods of family planning. As abortion is criminalised and unavailable to Burmese women in Thailand, unsafe abortions and under-effective fertility management are provided by l\u00e8 the who practice in Thailand after migration. In th e borderlands of Thailand and Burma where 230access to and acceptability of formal health serv ices is tenuous or entirely lacking, it is difficult to imagine how to provide reproducti ve health services to women without the assistance of the woman's family, friends and their chosen lay midwife. 231 Chapter 9 Violence, poverty and 'weakness': motivations to end a pregnancy Abortion is an act of self-defence for women whose health, dignity or basic rights are threatened by an unwanted pregnancy. Aborti on is also an act of mercy, motivated by women's concern for their children's well- being. Abortion is an act of subversion against restrictive abortion laws made pre dominantly by men (Germain, 1989:3). This chapter presents the reasons why wo men say their pregnancy is unwanted and why they end it. To develop policy or pr ogrammes that assist women and minimise the need for unsafe abortions, we need to understand not only who the women are, their beliefs, how abortion takes place and who is pr acticing it, but also the events that influence women's decision to abort. The two main topics I will address are poverty and violence and its embodied form 'weakne ss'. Violen ce and poverty, I argue, are common reasons for women to abort pregna ncies. 'Weakness' appears here as a indicator for unsafe abortion. Competing tensions between paid work, family responsibilities, family size, relations hip difficulties, domestic violence and sometimes rare unforeseen events are all imp licated in the reasons to end pregnancy. The daily reality of poverty and suffering are the context for women's decisions. I will discuss these issues using a critical structural approach including social, community and personal levels. Women's human rights, the right to earn enough money to support a family, to control their fertility and to live free of violence are flouted. Public health and human rights re ferents serve as a us eful framework with which to analyse unsafe abortion. 232Why end a pregnancy? The literature on women's motivations to e nd a pregnancy includes large survey type research and ethnographic studi es. Surveys need to be interpreted with caution as prepared responses that offer only one cate gory simply do not reflect the complexity of lived experience and hence are limited in their ability to provide quality findings on sensitive issues such as the importance of violence and pregnancy terminations. Bankole, Singh, & Haas (1998) for example, examined the data from 27 countries asking why women have induced abortions, and noted that there were multiple reasons for not wanting the pregnanc y, some beyond the control of women. 67 The most commonly reported reason was to postpone or to stop childbearing and the next was socio-economic factors such as employme nt concerns or lack of support from the father. They note the association between women's characteristics and the reasons they give for wanting to e nd the abortion. For example, most married or older women felt that limiting childbearing was paramount. Partner rela tionship problems included the father not wanting the child and single motherhood, which in Asia was the reason for ending the pregnancy in 1% to 14% of cases. There was no data available on partner related reasons for choosing abortion for 6 of the 27 countries, and 4 of these were in Asia. In Chile, Honduras, Mexico and Nigeria, relations hip issues were a significant cause of unwanted pregnancy. There is no e xplicit reference to the characteristic of the relationship or ongoing domestic violence other than the statement, 'the husband or partner mistreat ed the woman because of her pregnancy' (page 122). There is an assumption that the pregnancy causes the domestic violence. While this may be true in some circumst ances, women also become pregnant in relationships which are already characterised by violence. The usual reasons emerge from this study: women wanting to stop having children; to space births; too and foetal abnormality. But much is missing. For example, domestic violence, rape and incest are not mentioned and perhaps have not yet entered the minds of the survey researchers, or are too difficult to frame in a question where a box is ticked. Most 67 Burma is not included in the 12 Asian countries but Thailand is included. 233health workers are unable to detect domestic violence in their patients and rarely ask about rape or incest in their history taking; therefore it is not surprising that these experiences are not cap tured in the health sector da ta (Hunt & Martin, 2001; Mazza, Dennerstein, & Ryan, 1996; Montes, 2001; Webster, Stolz, 1994). The multi-country survey style of rese arch, through aggregation, disguises differences. Bankole and colleages (1998) amalgamates the category 'Asia' with countries as diverse as Turkey, Thailand, a nd India and considers Singapore or South Korea not as 'developed' as the United St ates of America, Romania or the Czech Republic. However, while the categories ar e rather odd, the global overview is useful. From the same data sources from 56 count ries researching women's characteristics, Bankole, Singh and Haas (1999) recorded age, marital status and number of births of women experiencing an abortion, as well as other variab les such as education and religion. To summarise their findings: marri ed women in their 20s who already had one child; had a higher educat ion; were in the paid workforce; and who lived in an urban area were more likely than others to have an aborti on. Across religions, Muslims and Protestants had an abortion ra te of 17 per 1,000 women and Catholics 24 per 1,000 women, which may reflect Catholicis m's rejection of modern methods of contraception. Most of this data was gained from large scale surveys, hospital reports and government statistics, and by its natu re cannot tell us of women's personal motivations and meanings in choosing to e nd a pregnancy. Surveys and the analysis of national or health sector statistics provide us with a broad but incomplete picture, they are helpful for policy and programme formation but for fine detail, nuance and complexity, qualitative research is methodologically more refined. The implication of offering women reliable contraception or sterilisation as fertility control options to prevent unwanted pregnanc y is clear. Kabir (1989) focuses on the lack of modern contraceptives, appropriate services and men's role in fertility, as reasons for unwanted pregnancies in women in Asia. She points to the lack of information girls and women have with whic h to make informed decisions and their minimal influence in the family and society at large. She does not mention gender-based violence in the context of domestic violence but notes rape and incest. In addition, in some countries a strong prefer ence for male babies (Bankole et al., 1998; Anand Tamang, 1996; Ramachandar, 2003) ca n lead to the abortion of female 234foetuses. This does not appear to be a strong element in Burmese culture, which seems more similar to Thai culture, where both girl and boy children are valued, bringing religious merit and s upport to parents in different ways (Knodel et al., 1987). Violence against women Gender-based violence can be conceptualised in 3 levels: systems, communities and inter-personal violence (de Bruyn, 2003). Cult urally held gender stereotypes, poor governance and structural discrimination against women can foster abuse and violence where impunity and silencing are the norm. Where c onflict, displacement and forced migration also occur, women and girls can become targets of war not just secondary victims (Allo tey, 2003). In the book War and Public Health, (Levy & Sidel, 1997) Levy mentions women as the targets of modern warfare and displacement but sex segregated data of mortality or morbidity is rarely collected so analysis of the impact is crude. Although th e war tactic of rape and its physical and psychological consequences are discussed, a bortion is not mentioned. The authors of Forced Migration and Mortality (Reed & Keely, 2001) agree that the area of fertility is under-researched. Busza & Lush (1999:160) state: 'Conflict frequently results in changes in desired family size . Nationalistic fervour may fi nd new support if identity politics characterise the c onflict, provoking a desire to rebuild and repopulate the community'(original italics). They cite the example of the refugee camps for Cambodians in Thailand and their initia l sub-fertility due to malnutrition and separation of the men and women. Refug ees then called for limiting or postponing the size of their family until normal c onditions returned. The authors (1999:166) caution interpretation of the enthusiastic embrace of family planning by Cambodian refugees 'since there have been reports of reproductive rights abuse and the Thai government was wary of rising numbers of Cambodians within its borders (Potts, 1980)'. They also record the use of illic it abortions by Cambodian women in refugee camps and call for safe abortion services (Busza & Lush, 1999; Morrison, 2000). In another article, McGinn concludes that the, available data suggest that refugees' status with respect to fertility, family planning and safe motherhood is largely determined by factors similar to those in settled populations. Social and demographic factors, such as age, socioeconomic status, education and urban or rura l residence, as well as access to services, rather than refugee or displaced status in itself, app ear to influence fertility desires and health behavior with respect to these reproductive health concerns (McGinn, 2000:179). 235She also notes that most of the research conducted into reproductive health needs occurs with refugee populati ons in camps and there is a need to work with the 'unofficial' refugee population. While Busza & Lush's conceptual framework is a useful model (See Figure 5) it is not so useful when the conflict is over a longer period of time such as in the Burmese case of the ethnic minority groups and when ther e is an absence of reliable data. The Karen people have been fighting for over fi fty years and it is difficult to imagine where the demographic baseline might be in comparing fertility trends (Lintner, 1999, 2003). However, it is possible to ask women about the conditions in their home villages in Burma and how they perceive th e differences in Thailand. In some forms of conflict over long periods of time the reproductive health conceptual framework advanced by Busza & Lush may not be applicable. Political violence is common and has a dir ect and indirect imp act on health (Zwi & Ugalde, 1989). Much of the informal lite rature produced by women' organisations and local NGOs on the border mentions tw o types of violence against Burmese women: that perpetrated by st ate actors such as the SPDC officers and soldiers and the trafficking of girls and women into Thailand (Apple, 1998; Human Rights Documentation Unit & Burmese Women' s Union, 2000; Human Rights Watch, 2004; Images Asia, 1997; Karen Women's Or ganisation, 2004; Shan Human Rights Foundation & Shan Women's Action Network, 2002; Women's League of Burma, 2000). 68 However, these reports rarely di scuss the violence perpetrated at the interpersonal level. For example, the Shan and Karen women's reports do not cite cases of rape by fellow Shan or Karen me n, nor do they make recommendations that their own men desist from violence agai nst women or support them in denouncing individual violence. One exception is Belak's (2002) Gathering Strength: Women from Burma on their Rights, which does mention sexual di scrimination, rape, forced marriage and domestic violence within Bu rma and which acknowledges the structural nature of discrimination faced by women living in Burma due to customary law, ineffective governance, conflict, forced mi gration, gender stereo types and poverty. 68 Women can face great barriers to gaining refugee status if there are gr ounds based in domestic violence or other gender-based violence experienced during conflict and disp lacement (Charlesworth, 1999; R. J. Cook, 1994; Knight, 2003). 236The documents have a political purpose which is to expose the violence of the regime and the impunity with which Burmese women are treated, either as ethnic minority women or forced migrants in Thailand. Th ey are written as advocacy documents by groups under siege who must represent them selves as the victims of human rights injustices to the international community in the hope that their plight is recognised. The Union of Myanmar strongly denies any problems. The official position on violence against women stated to the United Nations CEDAW committee suggests it is rare: Although the findings of a study in two townships on border areas on the incidence of marital violence reveals that marital violen ce exists, the magnitude is not very great. The Myanmar culture and religion strongly influence the mentality and behaviour of men and women alike. The teachings of Lord Buddha that crimes like rape and sexual violence are great sins serve as protection for women and children. Therefore there are few reported cases of rape or sexual assault in Myanmar (Union of Myanmar, 1999:9). They have also robustly denied that any of their own officers or soldiers rape ethnic minority women (Anonymous journalist - MNA, 2004; Nandar Chann, 2004). The Union of Myanmar representatives do not demo nstrate an understand ing of the nature or scope of domestic violence and conflate rape and sexual assault with domestic violence. Rape and sexual assault are cert ainly one aspect of do mestic violence, but from the limited attention given to domestic violence in the CEDAW document, it appears to be discounted. There is no discus sion of the laws that might be used to protect women from this type of gender-based violence. The law states that mutual divorce is possible on the grounds of 'cruel ty, barrenness, dese rtion, adultery and leprosy' (Union of Myanmar, 1999:21) but the Union of Myanmar's submission fails to give the number of marriages dissolved due to cruelty or provide definitions of what constitutes cruelty. Moreover, it fails to understand that reported crime is not necessarily an indicator of pr evalence. There are no descript ions of domestic violence written by Burmese writers available to sc holars outside of Burma. Spiro's (1977) account of marriage and family relationships from the 1960s states that divorce was rare. Men were expected to be the dominant partner and if wives infringed this they were to expect a beating, despite the recognised qualities of an ideal husband being his good temperament and avoidance of physic al maltreatment. A Burmese proverb says that neither wives nor oxen deserve mercy (Thamein -date unknown). Domestic 237violence laws are not well articulated in Southeast Asia (Manderson & Bennett, 2003) and even if they were, undocumented forced migrant women cannot call on Thai police for protection. Other authors investigating health and vi olence against Burmese women in Burma and in Thailand, that are framed at a nationa l or systemic level, record gross human rights abuses (Amnesty International, 2002; Beyrer, 2001; 'Vio lence against the Burmese population is perpetrated directly and indirectly, and th is total disregard for the human rights and well-being of the population ac ts as a precursor for the flourishing of structured inequality, most especially among women a nd children, that pervades this avowedly equal and non-violent county.' Petersen et al. (1998) documents refugees arriving in refugee camps in Thailand who have experienced ra pe, forced labour, forced relocation, torture and murder in the co urse of their migration. Mistimed and unwanted pregnancies are the outcome s of some of these experiences. There is little data to en able a consideration of gende r equity issues for Burmese women. The United Nations Human Development Report (UNDP 2004), uses a compilation of indicators from various sources , and is unable to classify Myanmar in any meaningful way due to unobtainable or unreliable information, on such standard indicators as life exp ectancy, education, economic and polit ical participation. In this report Myanmar is ranked 131 for Human De velopment Indicators (HDI) and is not ranked on the Gender-related Index (GDI). By comparison, the People's Republic of Lao is 135 (HDI) and 109 (GDI); Vietna m 109 (HDI) and 89 (GDI) and Cambodia 130 (HDI) and 105 (GDI). Similarly, th e Countdown 2015 website initiated by International Planned Parenthood Federa tion, Family Care International and Population Action International who analyse the 10 year progress in ICPD goals since they were launched at Cairo in 1994, have insufficient data with which to comment on Burma (Population Action International, Fa mily Care International, & IPPF, 2004). Reasons to en d a pregnancy In this study, women, men and health workers give multiple and overlapping reasons why pregnancies are terminated. Health workers are adamant that the family, 238community and socio-political situation are directly related to women's health and they feel certain why women end their pregnancies. Naw Paw in the Out Patient Department of the Mae Tao Clinic lists them off: Poverty, difficult jobs, lack of knowle dge about family planning; all influence abortion. People are unable to think well due to the political situation. Some husbands do not take care of their families, some women are abused and others just have many family problems. Some couples live together without marrying but they still get pregnant. Young women at school get pregnant and they have abortions. Sometimes the parents don't agree with the partner choice and if they are already pregnant and not married this can be a cause of abortion. Her colleague in the In-patient Department , the shy O Htoo Kler, is also convinced she knows the motivations for abortion: I believe most Burmese people's economic s ituation is not good and that's the main reason why they abort the pregnancies. Others don't understand the consequences of abortion but some do. Some women rea lly understand family planning but it is impossible for them to come to us due to secu rity issues or other things that get in the way. Other women take htou: zei but they don't follow the dates so they forget. Young women fall pregnant with their lovers due to inexperience. Some men have many wives, one in Burma and one here, and this causes problems. I remember one case where a mother came to me and she was three months pregnant and she told me the truth about inducing her abortion. Her second husband had sex with her daughter and she was now six mont hs pregnant. She knew that it was too late for her daughter to have an abortion so she had one. She was very ill and I took her to Mae Sot hospital. I heard this st ory twice now - the other one was a husband who had sex with both sisters. These kind of men don't respect women at all!... Every time I see a woman with an abortion I get upset with the Burmese government. I directly blame them for reducing the economic standard so low. During interviews women often got round to talking about their motivation to end the pregnancy, although this was neve r asked as a direct question.69 The Burmese health worker summaries are astute and women re ported economic difficulties, relationship problems, a particular desired family size and mistimed pregnancy as reasons. The results of interviews with 18 women who ended their pregnancies found women often had multiple reasons: 69 The method chapter explains why direct questioni ng on this sensitive topic was avoided - see the section on difficulties and complexities in collecting data. 239Table 18 The reasons why women ended their pregnancy (n=18) Women with induced abortion - 18 women Poverty, remittances and concern for living children in Burma 7 Abuse and violence from husband 5 No or incorrect contraception knowledge 4 Problems with husband, alcoholism, poor quality of relationship 3 Modern or traditional contraceptive accident 3 Wrong time or does not want a child 3 Pressured or advised to end the pregnancy by relatives/ friends 2 Debts 2 Unable to work if the pregnancy continues or threatened by boss 2 No work or not enough work 2 Abandoned by husband 2 Widowed 1 Too many children 1 Bad luck to have this baby 1 Some couples are young and inexperienced, and contraceptive naivety is the cause of an unplanned pregnancy. This 19-year-old woman from Moulmein, married for just six months explained: I did this [had an abortion] because of my economic situation otherwise I wouldn't have done it. I talked with my husband before making the decision and we decided together. I never understood or heard about family planning [she looks away and is suddenly shy]. I'm not sure if he understands about this. Many women at the end of each interview asked Rose and myself about family planning methods, where to get them in Th ailand, how much they cost and what we thought about them. The women in the M ae Sot General Hospital who had the least access to this information were especially curious and part of our finalising the interview was to give women this vital information. But even if women understood how to control their fertility, their effort s were not always successful. No modern method of contraception is completely eff ective and one husband reported that his wife had an intra-uterine contraceptive device but still became pregnant. She induced 240her abortion. A 38-year-old Karen woman who had a history of six pregnancies and two living children, and admitted ending at least two pregnancies, knew about modern methods but for various reas ons had trouble taking them: I have used oral pills and htou: zei in the past. The nurse said I should not use htou: zei again after three injections because I gain ed a lot of weight. Then I chose oral pills but I forgot to take them most of the time. That's why I keep getting pregnant. Her husband of 6 years is currently unempl oyed but does have a work permit. He says he sometimes uses condoms with his wife and understands withdrawal, but despite this she got pregnant. Traditional met hods such as breastfeeding are also not completely reliable (Hatcher, Rineha rt, Blackburn, & Geller, 1997). Pressure from friends or family also appear ed to be a key factor in women's decision to end their pregnancies. A 24-year-old Burman woman with a history of four pregnancies felt her current miscarriage was due to being chased by the police and as she told us this story, she recalled her previous pregnancy and abortion. She is a healthy young woman and has had a series of pregnancies in quick succession: I have been pregnant four times now. I ha ve had one induced abortion. This current problem happened because I had to run away from the police. We were in our house and the police were checking everyone and arresting our neighbours so I jumped off my house about one metre down to the ground. I had been raining, it was slippery and I landed directly on my bum. Not even one hour later I started to bleed and the baby came out. My placenta stayed inside and I bled a lot. I saw my baby, he was formed like a human...I am very sad. My parents were very sad as well. We all wanted this baby. I stopped my last pregnancy when I was four months. [Tears well in her eyes] I did it because my parents said that I had no job and my husband had no job. \"You will have many problems and why weren't you more careful?\" ... I got married when I was 18. My first baby came when I was 20 and I have another one who is 18 months. Then I decided to induce the next one. There was only two months between the next pregnancy. I don't want a baby too soon again. She is unable to space her babies without resorting to abortion. Her husband found a job in Thailand as a construction worker for 70 Baht (US $1.60) per day and this was enough for her to decide that she could a fford the current pregnancy. Her parents 241endorse her 'to be careful', but neith er she nor her husband know how to use contraceptive technologies. Another mother took her daughter to the abortionist. The 27-year-old woman of mixed Karen and Burman parentage who induc ed her abortion at th ree months felt her family was complete with two childre n. Her mother took her to see the l\u00e8 the . I have been pregnant three times and I have two babies, one 8-year-old girl and a boy two years six months. This pregnancy was three months. I don't feel sorry about losing this pregnancy because my youngest ch ild is still young. I thought after this baby if it would be born I would get sterilised. My husband and I talked about this already. She goes on to give a second reason, a culturally grounded reason for aborting. If it were another Saturday child there would be more problems. I have two Saturday children and they cause some problems. Saturd ay children are 'hot' and we have to do special things to 'cool' them. My nephew is also a Saturday baby and my mother 'bought' him for 5 Baht from the parents. You see I am not sad about this baby because I believe it would be another Saturday child. Within the Burmese belief system there ar e large numbers of followers of fortune tellers. People wear lucky charms, protec tive amulets and symbolic tattoos, and many believe Mi Mi Khaing, 1984; Pascal Khoo Thwe, 2002; Spiro, 1967). Many events in life are believed to be decided by fo rces that ordinary people cannot control. For example, Burman babies are given names in relation to the day of the week on which they were born ac cording to a system of sounds. The days of the week signify particular personal ity characteristics, so children born on a Thursday are bright, have good minds and are polite and those born on a Sunday have a quick temper. Saturday ch ildren are particularly troubl esome and are attributed to cause arguments, or even a divorce, between parents. In the event that a child (especially a firstborn) is born on a Saturday it should be symbolically sold to another person for a minimal sum of money to displ ace the bad luck. This belief was common among Karen, Mon and Burman women. My educated health worker informants knew these beliefs but said th ey were superstitions only. Other reasons are dramatic and rare. On e 22-year-old woman with one living child was recently widowed when her husband died in a road accident. She terminated her 242pregnancy at four months because of he r husband's death, as no-one would look after her and she did not have any family in Thaila nd. The lack of security and a father for her baby motivated her to terminate her pregnancy. Poverty and employment The majority of women interviewed were in paid employment and they had plans for their income and savings. I have discusse d the very low and erratic incomes earned by Burmese workers in Thailand in chapter 5. One day a desperate woman came to the Mae Tao Clinic seeking help. I recorded it in the field notes. Rose is upset. She has spent the morni ng trying to explain to a woman that the Mae Tao Clinic will not purchase her eye- balls. 'She asked me how much for one eye. She said she had no money, no jo b and no place to live. She sold her mosquito net and clothes to buy food. She is hiding from the police. Her husband is ill and they are starving.' The desperate woman heard about the eye clinic and assumed they needed good eyes for people who had bad eyes. Her husband suggested the idea. He would sell one eye and she should sell one of hers. Rose gave her some mone y and a bowl of noodles but was still disturbed. The woman is five months pregnant (Field notes October 2002). Women said that they had plans to work and save their money before having a child; some women had debts that needed to be repaid. A 29-year-old married woman with two children in Burma tearfully describe d her problems. She has eight years of education. She has been married for seven years and lived for one year in Thailand and was ten weeks pregnant when she paid 200 Baht (US $4.60) for a st ick abortion: The Thai boss is kind and helps us. He found out about the pregnancy and the abortion and he said, 'Why did you do that? We would look after you and your baby. You can leave it with us if you don't want it.' My boss took me to hospital and paid for the medicine. I will pay them back later. The Thai nurse and doctors said 'Calm down and tell us the truth.' They cleaned me up and afterwards the pain stopped. They told me that I did a bad thing. They don't understand why Burmese women do this. They will think that all Burmese wo men are bad women who kill their babies. When the pains came initially I didn't know what was happening. People talked about me in the factory and they gossiped and said that because I had so much pain that this was an induced abortion. I got a fever. My husband wants three children. I think we can have another one later in Burma but not now while we are trying to save money. 243She is concerned that the Thai staff do not understand her reasons and her husband does not support her decision to end the preg nancy. He had also told her to stop taking modern contraceptives because she expe rienced side-effects. Despite the offer to leave her baby with her employer, she is without support and is tearful and goes on to tell more of her story: My husband yelled at me when he found out what I had done. He said 'You're the kind of woman that doesn't like children!' [S he cries and cries at this point in the interview and we stop for a pause].... He is upset with me and he loves children. I did it because I was thinking about my own children in Burma and I thought it would help him if I wasn't pregnant. I was thinking of him. She feels misunderstood and is aware that her behaviour can reflect on other women from Burma who live in Thailand. She ha s put her own children who are home in Burma and her husband's security before her own health. While some women aborted without their husband's knowledge or consent, other women discussed their situation with thei r husband and they made the decision to abort the pregnancy together. A 24-year-old husband talks about his wife's stick abortion at four months: I knew she was pregnant. I feel unhappy becau se I don't have much money and I feel frustrated. I needed to borrow money to co me to the Clinic. We are sad that we are so poor. In the last two months I sent my money to Burma. My wife was sick before the abortion with malaria - it comes and goes. She didn't take the medicine because she was afraid of it. So she got a high fever and got sicker. She couldn't walk for two months. I need to work to earn money. I think it is not the right time to have a baby. I want to have enough behind me before I have a baby. It is expensive to look after a child. Women can't work in the factory af ter they have a baby, the boss doesn't like it. In some farm and factory workplaces, th e choice between pregna ncy and paid work presents another dilemma. A 25-year-old Burman woman was intimidated into ending her pregnancy. I came to Thailand because the economic situa tion in Burma is very bad. I work here as a farm hand and we grow beans, fruit and vegetables. I want to go back to Burma in two or three years. At the moment my husband is working with me. He earns 70 to 100 Baht per day. I never had fever befo re, now I have chills- it is like malaria but it is because I am bleeding. I was pregnant once before with twins. This time when I was pregnant I went to end my pregnancy with the l\u00e8 the because my female boss 244didn't want me to be pregnant. She shouted at me and swore at me. I would lose my job. Women's right to work for equal pay, right to work during a pregnancy or any notions of maternity leave are non-existent for Bu rmese workers. As most women who were interviewed did not have a work permit, they were a particularly vulnerable population. Gender-based violence A small number of foreign authors have recent ly begun to draw atte ntion to structural gender-based violence in Burma which flows across the border into Thailand and they emphasise the connections between a totali tarian state and & Bennett, 2003; Sk idmore, recorded one example of a young woman's experien ce of violence in the field notes: Suzanne, can you help a little? Can you e xplain to Lein Nge that her baby is syphilis positive and we need to give it a Penicillin injecti on today?' the Thai nurse wheedles and then quickly walks off. We walk with the 17 year old to the interview room and tell her that the nurses want her permission to give some medicine to the baby because it was sick with something it caught while inside her. She understands as she has al ready had the injection herself. I ask if we can talk with the fath er to explain that he also needs an injection. 'Oh, the baby has many fathers! When I came to Thailand the carry (trafficker) sold me to the brothel. Now I am going home to my grandmother, I don't want to do this work (Field notes July 2002). In this literature, themes emerge between women's status; their role in the family; individual rights versus family rights; wo men as property; and the construction of gender and sexuality. The authors refe rence the subordination of women with political and religious ideology, and the st ate and military's role in perpetuating patriarchy. Skidmore discusses the extr eme repression of civil society and the 'systematic violation of human rights' and th e 'totalitarian utopia' in which the overt use of violence by the state is not the onl y means to control a population. She says, 'Violence is used selectively in 'pacified' areas of Myanmar as a strategic tool of terror. The threat of political violence is what underpins and makes effective more 245subtle forms of control and coercion' (S kidmore, 2003:83). She describes women's fear of rape and mothers' fear for their chil dren. Fear is the element that controls the individual ensuring docility and compliance. She broadens her story of Burma to take account of the gendered inequality whic h is perpetrated by the State Peace and Development Council. Blatant gender disc rimination is used in propaganda against Daw Aung San Suu Kyi for politi cal motives. Skidmore says: In addition to the structural gender ine quity of militarization is the sustained propaganda attacks upon democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. These attacks (appearing in the state-run newspapers) u sed existing gender stereotypes of women as weak-willed, promiscuous and animal-like, to undermine her authority and question her ability as a national leader (2003: 90). There is little research on the violence wo men experience while they are pregnant (Belton, 1996; Hunt & Martin, 2001) and even less on women who have miscarried or intentionally aborted (de Br uyn, 2002). But it seems that unwanted pregnancy and induced abortion is more frequent in women who experience domestic violence (Astbury et al., 2000). One study (Kaye, 2001) of 311 women seeking post-abortion care in Uganda, found over half of the wome n disclosed surviving domestic violence and just under a quarter i nduced abortion. In Uganda abortion is illegal, as presumably is the assault of women, but th e author does not tell us about the laws on violence against women. Eleven percen t of women in the Ugandan study were targeted in the abdomen and about 28 wome n said it was the reason they ended their pregnancy. Another study of 1,200 pregnant women attempted to find a statistical correlation between spontaneous abortion and violent and controlling behaviour by the intimate partner and found none (Nels on et al., 2003). However, although the sample size of pregnant women is la rge, on closer examination only 23 women experienced a miscarriage who disclosed domestic violence and another 40 women disclosed violence but their pregnancy c ontinued to term, ha rdly large enough numbers from which to draw statistical conclusions. Domestic violence - direct a nd indirect cause of abortion In this study domestic violence appears in several Burmese women's accounts of their motivation to end the pregnancy. As do mestic violence is a relatively common experience for many women in South Ea st Asia (Manderson & Bennett, 2003), I asked Rose to frame the questions in th e following way - 'How is your relationship 246with the father of your child (ren)?' and 'D o you ever feel scared of him?' These two questions elicited evidence of emotional an d physical domestic violence. Five women out of 43 reported surviving various form s of domestic viol ence ranging from emotional abuse to violent beatings and th ree out of ten men disclosed controlling, threatening and beating their wives. Violen ce may directly cause some abortions and make other women feel that they do not wa nt to form a family and rely on violent men. 247 Plate 25 A typical shanty community Mae Sot (2001) Plate 26 Women play wi th their children (2002) 248 Men talking about violence in their relationship Saw Blessing interviewed 10 men, 5 of whom were fathers of newborn babies. The other 5 had wives who had experienced a preg nancy loss. Three men out of these 10 disclosed abusing their wife. A 29-year-old Burman man ma rried to a woman with an induced abortion said: We mainly quarrel at the end of the month before the salary comes. If I want to buy some alcohol she argues with me. Men spend more money. Sometimes I beat my wife but I do feel sad afterwards. My wife isn't afraid of me though, if she wants to say something she does. She must be a very strong woman to say wh atever she pleases despite the beatings. A Shan man whose wife had just given birth said: I can always talk with my wife and we understand each other's ideas. We never have arguments. I am married for five years al ready. If she or I did something wrong we can tell each other and accept criticism. Th e only thing is when I get drunk she doesn't like it and she doesn't say anything - I think it scares her. This man thinks his bad behaviour silen ces and frightens his wife but feels the relationship is balanced. Another 36-year -old Burman man's wife terminated her pregnancy. He told Saw Blessing he sometimes threatens her with a knife: We do quarrel sometimes and lately more th an normal. About three times per month we have an argument. I think it is because of our economic situation. Sometimes I take a knife and show her but I don't touc h her. I pretend but it is not real. The Burmese and Thai health workers ne ver reported domestic violence in the medical records but women were willing to talk about their rela tionships. The women confirmed what the men had said about their own controlli ng and threatening behaviour. A 35-year-old Karen woman with a miscarriage said: He doesn't respect me at all. My husband h as had three wives in the past. He flirts around with older women all the time. He smokes, drinks and takes ya ba (amphetamines). When he is drunk he yells a nd swears at me and I am scared of him. I cannot say anything or speak back because I believe he will hit me. He hit me before so I know he will do it...I don't know how long I can stand this new husband! I am sad most of the time I am with him. He threatens me, 'I will kill you. I will throw you in the river.' I am very scared. He doesn't know about the miscarriage and 249I worry that if knows he won't believe me a nd will take it out on me. I need to tell him carefully. I also worry about the debts we have.70 After running away from a forced teenag e marriage, this 25-year-old Karen woman describes her second marriage: I am very scared of my husband. He is three years older than me. He always hits me. I think this is because I was married befo re. I have a daughter from this previous marriage. He doesn't accept that. We argue about this and about money. If we argue about money he hits me. His mother asks for money all the time but we don't have enough for ourselves. Then when I say this to him he gets angry and hits me and sometimes he gets a knife and tries to cut me. He hasn't cut me yet but he threatens me. One time he hit me with a plank of wood. There was a nail in the wood and it went into the skin on my back. He kicks me and punches me. I can't talk with him about my needs. If he doesn't like what I say he just hits me. This 38 -year-old Muslim woman induced her own abortion with a bamboo stick: My husband always drinks and then he beats me. That's why I got rid of this baby. I don't want any more babies. Anytime he gets drunk he screams and shouts at me. I cannot say anything; if I did he would beat me. When he beats me I feel ashamed and cannot talk with people...I am scared of my husband...he scares me a lot. I worry when he is drunk and that he will hit me... I give up on husbands and I don't want any more babies. I want to look after the one's I've got already. The babies come too closely together. My husband has sex with me even when I tell him that I am bleeding. He doesn't listen to me. In Burm a we all live in one house and sometimes I am too shy to have sex with my parents and the children around. He doesn't care. He is violent and loud. I really would like to leave him. This was the only case we found of a wo man inserting an obj ect into her body by herself as most asked a lay midwife for assi stance. Although we did not ask directly if women had experienced forced sex, this woman's account of not being able to decline sex when she menstruated or when she felt there was not enough privacy is important. Other women talked of their dut y to please their husband or their fear of him finding another woman if they refused sex too often. This also implies some coercion in sexual relationships and an unequal power dynamic. 70 Ya ba is 'crazy medicine' or methamphetamine. Amphetamines are manufactured in Burma and sold across the border into Thailand (Alford, 2001; United States Department of State, 2003a; Yuwadee Tunyasiri, 2001). The illegal drug tr ade is implicated in money laundering in Burma (Gutter, 2001) and sanctions are in place against the State Peace and De velopment Council (United States Department of State,2003). 250This 24-year-old Burman woman describe s the physical viol ence she endures: I did this abortion because I have a lot of problems with my husband. I didn't mean to do it and in a way I would like the baby. My little girl is still small. I didn't experience so much pain and there wasn't so much blood loss. I can live with the idea of the abortion but I do understand that I have killed the baby. My heart is sad... I can't eat (tears come to her eyes and her voice is shaky). People will probably talk about me but some will understand if they know my husband. My husband wants two children. At first I didn't let him know about all this but when I started to get sick I told him what I had done. He agreed with the abortion. I always feel that I have no rights to say anything and he decides everyt hing. He hits me a lot. It hurts me. He kicks, punches and slaps me. I am always fea rful of him. I have been married for four years. She ended her twelve week pregnancy with five sticks from the l\u00e8 the . In these cases domestic violence is an indirect and di rect cause of the abortions. Women are unwilling to carry the baby or bond their relationship further with parenting. Other women articulated qualities of good rela tionships, such as re spect and equality in their relationships with men. I include some examples of these to show the difference in the way women talked about their husbands. 'My first husband was bad but I don't want to talk about that. This husband is not scary. We listen to each other so I do love him and I know he wants a nother baby.' Another woman has a loud but not violent husband, 'I never feel scared of my husba nd. He does swear a lot and shouts and complains. When he acts like this I cry. Then he says - \"This is how I am, my family is always like this and it's not serious\". But he neve r hits me.' Women said they did fight with thei r husbands but the core feat ure was not being scared or fearful. Women who felt they had good quality relationships talked of husbands who listened and shared. This was often e xpressed symbolically through food. Women would comment on how their husband provided for them and men would comment on women sharing their food and eating together. 71 Most Burmese wome n felt entitled to speak and have an opinion and not to be th reatened by their husba nd. I was grateful that these women were able to talk about their experience and I was surprised that men were also so candid about their behavi our. Clearly the husba nds were aware of the methods they used to threaten and terr ify their wives and th ey understood that it 71 Spiro (1977) also discusses the symbolic nature of cementing the relationship between husband and wife in the 1960s. According to Spiro, the man prov ides it and the woman prepares it, when it is then eaten together (see page 274). Bu t in Mae Sot some forty years after this data was collected women were providing it too. 251was a way to control them. It was not clear from the research whether men understood that their behavi our contributed to their wives' deci sion to end their pregnancy. Women's 'weakness' - a: ne 'Weakness' is a common reason to seek out health care at the Ma e Tao Clinic and is linked with poor reproductive health outcomes. The Reproductive OPD Daily Logbook records 167 visits during 2001 wher e women were diagnosed with 'weakness'.72 During interviews with women with post-abortion complications, three had a history of 'weakness' in their medical records. The first is a Burman woman with her ninth pregnancy and a spontaneous abortion, the second a Karen woman with her sixth pregnancy, two previous induced abortions, two living children and current induced abortion, and the third a Burman wo man in her fourth pregnancy with three living children and a violen t relationship. She lost the pregnancy after a severe beating. Naw Paw, a senior medic in the RH OPD, cleans out the metal cupboard where a rat had decided to live amongst the stores of p ills, syringes, condoms and stationary. By 1pm the morning clinic is fini shed and she is rea dy to talk with me. She chooses one of the consulting rooms furnished with two wooden beds, plastic chairs and one folding metal table. She sticks her ball poi nt pen into her pony tail, puts one foot on the rung of the table and rests her ha nds on her chubby cheeks and explains 'weakness' for me: Well Suzanne, the woman is dizzy, she has poor nutrition, she has cold hands and feet, she worries a lot. We do an examina tion. Sometimes there is anaemia but not always. We give her health educati on about nutrition, maybe multivitamins or ferrous sulphate. We say 'don't think so much' and we talk about meditation; something like counselling for her. A typi cal patient would be a woman who has had a lot of children, maybe more than four. She would come and say, 'Oh my goodness my period doesn't come, maybe I am pregnant again.' Also those who are breastfeeding they have weakness. The women who talk about food, family and money worries they get weakness. 72 For comparison, other annual counts of the RH OPD logbook show abortion (196), STI/ PID (193), menstrual problems (110), urinary tract infection (76) , and low fertility (46) as reasons for women to come to the Clinic. I have excluded the numbers for antenatal care and family planning which exceed thousands of visits. 252'Weakness' is a combination of physical, me ntal and social symptoms; these may not all be present in the same patient. Me n do not get weakness like women do, maybe only if they worry about their job security or if they have to work very hard. Children never get weakness, except those poorly nourished. Skidmore (2002) describes thwe aah neh or a weakness of the blood, which can be glossed as anaemia and can also be linked to irregular menstruation or ameno rrhea. Many women who come to the OPD are measurably anaemic but the health workers are detecting the socio-cultural determinants of weakness and not just the iron content of red corpuscles. Although the Mae Tao Clinic models itself on bio-me dicine largely informed from Western sources and has many Wester n volunteers, the health workers use their own Burmese diagnosis in interpreting thei r patient's symptoms. 'Weakness' as a diagnostic category is also found in India and Ba ngladesh and can be interpreted as an expression of distress. While narrativ es of 'weakness' and white discharge are common, Ramasubban & Ris hyasringa (Ramsubban & Rishyasringa, 2001) feel that weakness is more likely connected with a poor reproductive history and the combined stresses of poverty and ge nder-based violence. The authors say the word weakness ( ashaktapana ) in India combines physical and mental states. Women attribute the cause of their 'weakness' in order of frequency to include: excessive housework or caring for family members; tens ions and stresses; sterilisation; burden of child bearing; erratic diet ; neglect in childhood; neglec t of diet during pregnancy; and poor postpartum care. Unemployment in the family, alcohol abuse and wife beating also played a role. (Ramsubb an & Rishyasringa, 2001:28) suggest: Women who make the strongest associati on between problems during pregnancy and the onset of a chronic feeling of ashaktapana are those who have experienced spontaneous abortions, prenatal child loss, or delivered stillborn babies. Around half the women in this subgroup have experienced prenatal child loss or spontaneous abortions. Ross, Laston, Nahar and colleagues (1998: 95) exploratory study of Bangladeshi women's priorities on illness notes that 'weakness' ( durbalata ) is commonly mentioned in a country where, when a Bangladeshi woman 'reaches puberty, [she] has already experienced a lif etime of discrimination compared to males.' In Bangladesh, 'weakness' is an indicator of and cause of abortion. Where abortion is 253criminalised or access limited as in Tak, 'weakness' is similarly an indicator and cause of unsafe abortion. The following two Burmese case studies outline the connection with 'weakness'- a: ne and poor reproductive hea lth outcomes. Paw Bree (T iny Flower) is Karen and has a history of six pregnancies. She is now 38-years-old and is married with two living children. She cannot read or write a nd she works on a farm while her husband, a construction labourer with a work permit, is currently unemployed. She frequently feels unwell with headaches, fevers, dizzine ss and palpitations. She says 'I have a weak heart and felt worried after the birth of the second baby'. Her medical notes show many visits for advice and counselli ng with no specific di agnosis other than 'weakness.' She received oral contraceptive pills and condoms in the past and has a history of two induced abortions but disc loses during the interview visiting the lay midwife twice and aborting by her own methods twice. She admits that there is only just enough money for daily needs. She stat es she is not scared of her husband and can talk to him. She gives us permission to speak with him. During his interview he does not appear to know about th e abortions and states that she fell over. He says he is not willing to have a vasectomy but w ill allow her to have a tubal ligation. He wants three children but now r ealises this is not possible and that he cannot provide for any more children in his current situation. Cho Cho, a Burman woman has a medical hist ory of scabies and 'weakness'. She is 37-years-old, has four pregnancies and thre e living children. She is a farmer who speaks very quietly and has an old scar over one eye. She miscarried the current pregnancy possibly from the beating she received from her husband as she describes here: I feel very sad to lose this baby because I wanted it. When my husband started to kick me, I was lying in bed. I didn't feel very well at the time. Then he started to kick me. I don't think I will get back together with him...I fought with my husband. My husband kicked me in the back and stomach three or four times. My lower abdomen ached for two or three days. So I went to the massage woman. She only did gentle massage and I started to bleed two days after the massage. Her notes show that she received family planning c ounselling and supplies two years prior to the current visit. She says she pl anned this pregnancy and wanted the baby. 254These two cases illustrate the presentation of a: ne diagnosed by the Burmese health workers. Both women experience violence, one at the interpersonal level from an abusive husband and the other from grindi ng poverty and lack of life opportunities. In summary, to answer the question w hy women end their pregnancies, the motivations or intentions to end a pregnancy are important when developing sound public health policy strategies. Burmese wo men are able to articulate their reasons which they represent as dilemmas in which they negotiate conflicting pressures and consideration for others, particularly fam ily members. And they make pragmatic appraisals of the socio-political situation as well as the forces beyond their control when deciding to terminate a pregnancy. I suggest there are multiple, interrelated and competing reasons why women choose abor tion. Burmese women speak of poverty, insecurity and poor relationships combined with a lack of access or ignorance of reliable contraception. Apart from these factor s, I argue that violence is an important factor in many women's decisions to abort. For Burmese women, Thailand does offer opportunities for economic advancement and social development for families and individuals, and women were aware of this. Burmese men and women stated they were saving for a better future by coming to earn money in Thailand and paying their de bts. For some, pregnancy disrupted this plan. Clinically defined 'weakness' or distress ex perienced by women can be a precursor to unsafe abortion in this context. The medicalisation of social or cultural disruptions in the forms of oppression, repression, violence and genocide is a widely accepted theme in anthropological and feminist writing (Andarjani-Sutjahjo, 2002; & Bennett, 2003; Petchesky, 2003). The medics at Mae Tao Clinic are perceptive clinicians who note the connections between the disease they are aske d to treat, and their particular social circumstances as forced migrants living on the borders of both Thailand and Burma and citizens of neither. Di stress and suffering are invoked as warning signs by the 'patient' that life has become unbearable in the illness of 'weakness' and they also appear in the reasons why the pregnancy mu st end. Women talk not only of their own personal suffering but often consider the pot ential suffering of the unborn child. They 255also make reference to their living child ren, who may or may not be in Thailand, specifically the need to provide for them through waged labour or not bring them into a violent family. In this location, the Thai police and judiciary are not perceived as advocates for women and as most wome n do not hold work permits, they are unwilling to make themselves visibl e to Thai authorities. 256Chapter 10 One thousand muscles: fertility management and men Quote from Initial Report of State Parties Myanmar to the CEDAW Committee ... Information on the well-being of families and family planning, which are crucial for youth and women, are included in the upper secondary-level health curriculum. The school health curriculum is available for both boys and girl s. Many similar health topics are included in adult education pr ogrammes which are also equally available for men and women (Union of Myanmar, 1999:16). Little qualitative research has been conducte d on the involvement of men in women's abortion experiences (Population Council, 1998) . This chapter introduces men as the reproductive partners of wo men. A gendered analysis of unsafe abortion most commonly gazes at women but rarely men, as Alvarez-Castillo, Arcenal and Jimenez argue: The gap in knowledge and theoretical groun ding about men in reproductive health in general, and abortion, in particular, resu lting form a gender bias, has created a cycle where interventions and research continue to target and zero in on women, in turn widening that knowledge gap and furthe r marginalizing men from subsequent interventions. We have not developed as much analytical discourse about male responsibility in abortion as we have about women (Alvarez-Castillo et al. 2004:179). Their analysis uses examples from the Phili ppines and names the medical fraternity as gender and class blind. As explained in chapter 3, it was difficult to make contact with men who wished to give interviews. Only when I began to work with Saw Blessing was it possible to interview men. This chapter includes men's observations on their wives' reasons for 257hospitalisation and their knowle dge and attitudes to family planning. It draws on interviews with 10 Burmese men whose wive s consented to their participation, in addition to information from the 43 wo men who were hospitalised who commented on their partners' knowledge, beliefs and behaviour. Three articles written in th e late 1990s from the journal International Family Planning Perspectives discuss the role of men in fer tility and contraception use. Two are country specific - in Jordan and the Phil ippines - while the third is a meta-analysis of 18 countries mainly from sub-Saharan Af rica. All call for more involvement and research into men's reproductive hea lth wishes concerning family size and contraceptive use, and point to the recent inclusion of men in this field. In a previous survey in the early 1980s, half the me n believed God determined the number of children in a family, and that men were less knowledgeable about contraceptive methods than women. Petro-Nustas's (1999) cross-sectional survey of 241 men from Jordan who were recruited while their wives delivered in hospital, showed that less than half could correctly de fine birth-spacing and many did not know where to find information about contraception. He found th at most men believed they were as responsible as women for pr eventing pregnancy and half thought that their use of contraceptives would increase if there were male-oriented services. There was a positive association between higher education levels, higher income and a positive attitude towards birth-spacing and contraceptives. Petro- Nustas (1999:181) concluded that 'culturally sensitive family planning services designed specifically for men in Jordan would increase their i nvolvement in contraceptive use.' Bankole's & Singh's (1998) meta-analysis of contraceptive decision-making process in 18 developing countries draws data mo stly from sub-Saharan Africa. They conclude by saying: 'Spouses may have di sparate reproduc tive goals, and data from both partners are necessary to ascertain these differences. Fertility and family planning programs and research must continue to expand their focus on men's attitudes and behavior' (1998: 15). Questions were asked about desired family size, fertility intentions, contraceptive knowledge and behaviour as well as contraceptive use. Generally in this region couples want ed large families, but about two thirds of couples had discordant views on family si ze; husbands wanting more children than the wives and wanting a child sooner than the wife. Bangkole & Singh (1998:22) also 258believed that women were better informed and more often initiat ed contraception use than men, but they conceded: 'success in achieving a smaller family will depend on how responsive husbands' fertility preference s are to the changes in their spouses' preferences and on the couples' reproductiv e behavior.' Here men's power in relationships becomes apparent; only in 6 of 14 countries where data is available do they believe women's opinion prevail. Ho wever, since the data includes populations where polygamy is common the comparison with monogamous coupling is limited. Not surprisingly, some couples disagree ab out their reproductive choices, and we should ask who makes the final decision and how is it reached? A study in the Philippines analyses the husband-wife dyad, us ing qualitative research techniques to untangle the puzzle (Biddlecome et al., 1997) . The authors interviewed 780 matched couples in the Philippines. They speci fically mention gender issues and power dynamics in their analytical framework. Th ey point out that th e Philippines has had wide access to modern methods for over twen ty years and assume that men will hold views and have opinions on contraception a nd family size. The authors found that generally men had well developed ideas about contraception and held similar perceptions to women (even when they were female controlled methods). They found that few couples discussed contraception and therefore agreed by chance alone. They used quantitative data from a detailed na tional survey which found that in an aggregate analysis, men and wo men have very similar view s on contraception. At the couple level however, men's perceptions diffe red from their wives. The researchers distinguished between holding a view, taki ng an action and assu ming responsibility for reproductive behaviour, and noted the multifaceted decision making process. To untangle the contraceptive decision-maki ng process between husband and wife is a particularly complex task. They say c onversations between husband and wife were incomplete. They note the asymmetry between spouses and conclude by saying 'when spouses disagree, women's family pl anning aspirations will more often be frustrated than men's' (1997: 114). Limited choices Men have few choices of methods of contr aception if they wish to reliably control their own fertility. Vasectomy is a relative ly simple and effective modern method but not particularly popular; only suitable to thos e men who have completed their family. 259Landry & Ward's (1997) study of randomly selected couples from Bangladesh, Kenya, Mexico, Rwanda, Sri Lanka and the US A and invited them to disclose their reasons for choosing vasectomy. They found that men's concern for women's health was a strong factor in choosing vasectom y across countries. Vasectomy is not a common method used by men and they report ed prevalence rates less than 1% to 1.5% in Bangladesh, Kenya, Mexico and Rwa nda and a little higher in Sri Lanka 4.9% and USA 12.6%. The study took place ac ross six countries and included 218 in- depth semi-structured interviews with c ouples who had chosen vasectomy. They interviewed between 10 to 31 couples in each country and partners were interviewed separately. A limitation of the study is th e comparisons between resource-rich and resource-poor countries. Several themes emerged. Economic reasons were the most pressing reason to choose not to have more children, and the negative impact on women's health during pregnancy. But w hy did the men accept vasectomy? Many had contact with a health car e provider or another sterilis ed man who could allay their fears and worries. 'Some sa id that men were strong er and thus should take responsibility for the operation, while the African and Asian men in the sample (though not the Mexican or US respondents) often felt that as the economic provider or head of household they had to take responsibility' (Landry & Ward 1997:61). Other men stated that it was their turn. The couples in this study understood that when female tubal ligation was compared with vasectomy, male sterilisation was simpler and recovery faster. Some couples cited unpleasant side effects and dissatisfaction with other methods of contra ception. Men in multiple relationships or polygamous marriages felt it suited their n eeds better, and couples said they could enjoy the fun of sex without anxiety. Othe r men in resource poor areas said that they could not access or afford other contracep tive choices and this influenced their decision. But the study begs the question w hy men reject vasectomy and this was not explored. This study also found gender power differences where men made the decision about family size in all countries, except the USA. Women said to suggest a vasectomy to a man was \"delicate\" and had to be handled with diplomacy (Landry & Ward 1997:64). The authors recommended more information be given to women and men about this method of male contracepti on. Almost all the women reported that, despite initial doubts, 'she was pleased that her partner had obtained a vasectomy, in that it lessened the burden on them' (1997:65). 260Burmese men But what of men from Burma and their be liefs, knowledge and practice? The United Nations Family Planning Association (1999) in conjunction with the Department of Health, Union of Myanmar conducted a reproductive health needs assessment in the late 1990s. The brief was to work with Bu rman, Mon and Shan groups and to report on a national needs assessment, review the reproductive health s ituation, examine the private and public health sector, talk with people from the centre and periphery, and suggest programme actions. The report focu ses its attention very much on women as potential clients and service providers; so me n are not visible other than in leadership positions. The UNFPA team reported on talks with community leaders inside Burma (United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) & Department of Health Union of Myanmar, 1999:57): Our discussions with community leaders (mai nly men) revealed that they were both inadequately informed and insufficiently concerned about STDs, birth spacing or adolescent reproductive health issues. They were better informed about maternal health issues and more aware of HIV/AI DS although even for the latter their understanding was often quite superficial. The UNFPA team found condoms strongly associated with commercial sex and therefore taboo. Vasectomy is almost illega l in Burma and can only be performed if the wife applies for tubal ligation first and it cannot be performed for medical reasons. The cost of vasectomy in Burma is 10,000 Kyats and the average monthly income in Mandalay is 6,000 Kyats ( Pers comm. Marie Stopes staff Melbourne 2001 ). Vasectomy requires long and convoluted procedures to obtain and men reported travelling to Thailand to get one. The UNFPA team identified unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion as major problems stemmi ng from poor health services and lack of community education, and concluded by st ating that men were not aware of birth spacing methods (1999:34-35): While not opposed to contraceptive use, the assessment team found that husbands were generally not actively supportive of thei r wife's desire to use contraception. Not all men were against the practice, but many people, both women and men, reported that men believe that it is the r esponsibility of the woman to make decisions regarding contraceptive use. Another report conducted by the Populati on Council in Myanmar (Population Council & Department of Health Union of Myanma r, 2001) included focus group research: to 261understand the local vocabulary used to talk about reproductive illnesses; men and women's personal experience and health seeking behaviour; the perceptions of causation; symptoms; treatments; and serv ices; and issues concerning menstrual regulation; abortion; and side effects of contraceptives. The researchers felt that the limitations of the study were the lack of generalisation that could be made after talking with 380 people and the short amount of time w ith which to build rapport on sensitive topics. They f ound distinctive gender differen ces in knowledge and beliefs regarding reproductive health and stated that men had 'littl e interest' and low knowledge of women's reproductive health pr oblems. The authors found widespread knowledge of abortion providers, procedures and complications but again men rarely had any 'detailed understanding of the methods and risks associated with abortion' (2001:21). Caouette, Archavanitkul and Pyne's (2000) study of Burmese migrant workers in Chiangmai, Mahachai and Ranong in Thailand also commented on the gender divisions in reproductive health. They conduc ted their study in two phases, the first being observation, interviews and focus group discussions with a total of 147 people, and phase two involved admi nistering a structured qu estionnaire to 827 people. Burmese people who were working illegally in Thailand between th e ages of 15 to 50 participated. The main participants were Shan or Burmans, while only a few Mon and Karen took part. The resear chers would have liked to c onduct comparison studies in the towns of origin of the migrants but due to the political situation, they were not able to conduct cross-border research. The undocumented nature of the research subjects made contacting them and worki ng with them difficult and women were particularly afraid to be out side of their rooms. The rese archers note the freedom with which men were able to discuss topics on sexuality and reproductive health and they felt that on average, the higher the educati onal status a man held, the more open the discussion. Gender roles are firmly demarcated in Burma with men holding the most privileged positions (Belak, 2002; Than Than Nwe, 2003). Umemento's (1998:73-74) report into women and men's sexual health using qualitative research methods with 510 participants in Rangoon, found that men 'f elt honoured and lucky to be men' and believed themselves to be 'at an advantag e over women religiously, biologically and 262culturally.' Men stated that it was difficu lt to control their sexual impulses, women should be dutiful to their husbands and fulf il their desires, and 'women have a lower status in society than men and must bear more burden of blame for sexual misconduct.' The most often researched aspects of Burmese men's reproductive health relate to HIV and condom use (Umemoto 1999; UNFPA 1999). On the topic of abortion, qualit ative research with Thai men demonstrates they feel the burden of responsibility fo r the child's future; they c ite poverty as a reason for considering induced abortion; and believe th ey have some rights in determining the outcome of the pregnancy (Whittaker, 2002d). The limited literature on men's involvement with abortion shows that gene rally the lack of a partner or unstable relationship is one of the main characteri stics of women undergoi ng abortions but this was not always the case with the Burmese couples. Men, family planning and abortion One day I went to the local refugee camp to visit two Karen midwives to discuss unwanted pregnancy and abortion. We sat ta lking in the bamboo hut, peeling the small sweet green-skinned oranges I had bought from the local market. Suzanne: Are men in the camp in terested in family planning? Say Paw: Husbands don't come to clinic becau se they don't feel it is their problem. The women understand their situation better. Men don't care. Suzanne: What about the male leaders? Say Paw: The male leaders don't talk a bout family planning. We have many churches here, Roman Catholic, Baptist and Anglican. The Roman Catholics have a strong opinion against family planning. I don't think the Baptists like it either. If you get a paper from the doctor saying you should take family planning, then it is ok. Moonlight: I remember one woman who already had six children and her previous pregnancy ended in abortion at six months . Any way she got pregnant again even though the doctor told her and her husband they should contracept. They thought 263children were God's gift so they did not contracept. She died of post partum haemorrhage after that birth. At the Mae Tao Clinic labouring women who are leaking amniotic fluid are carried by men into the ward. Men also put bleeding women on the backs of their bicycles and ride them to the hospital, despite the risk to their male spiritual power or hpon . 73 In the post-abortion ward at the Mae Tao Clinic, the men snooze next to their partners in the afternoon heat on the hard wooden beds, wearing cotton loungji's slung low on their hips, their tattoos glistening over wiry fr ames. They take time off work with loss of pay to be here. Men ar e deeply involved in women's lives and particularly their reproductive health. These include intimat e life partners as well as transient boyfriends, sexual clients, bosses, doctors, monks, health workers, church leaders and community leaders of women. Men obviously have important roles to play in inflicting reproductive disease as well as nurturing reproductive we llness. But while men may be present in the crisis moments of birth or abortion, they are absent in the mundane moments. As I sat and obser ved the flow of patients through the Reproductive Outpatient Clinic at the Mae Tao Clinic, there was a dearth of men. The women are processed qui ckly and efficiently. There are about 28 women in the department as I watch the team. The team work well together. One female health worker walks out and picks up the record card; she knows her patient without calling her name and gen tly taps her on the arm to indicate she should follow. The woman follows behind to the examination room. Dah Ne Tah ('Gift' - Karen) weighs her patient on the upright scales. Two health workers prepare fresh tetanus injections in front of the waiting women. Blood pressures, antenatal blood screens for hepatitis, HIV, syphilis and 73 Here Than Than Nwe explains the meaning of hpon . 'Central to the notion of male superiority is the concept of hpon. Hpon strengthens the spiritual elevation that men enjoy in Burmese society, which is essentially a Buddhist society. All males have hpon , an intrinsic quality that is accorded to few females, and even if it were, less than that accorded to a male. Hpon is hard to define. It is a highly abstract quality that has no practical relevance. It gives men th e advantage of a special status, higher than that of women. Having hpon is having hpon , not much else. But losing hpon is wrought with unknown dangers. Thus, at the spiritual level, the position of Burmese women fares badly. The belief in the attainment of Buddhahood is possible only for a male and the pollutive effects of women on men's hpon is a subject on which little research has been u ndertaken, if at all.' She argues that Burmese women have historically had a better position than Chinese or Indian women regarding personal power but society undermines equality between men and women and is reflected in spatial and symbolic cultural artefacts. (Than Than Nwe, 20 03:Electronic source- no page number) 264haemoglobin are done. Vitamins and eggs are dispensed as well as advice. There are only two males in the room. A Burman doctor sits at the front at the OPD main desk and takes a history. His is the only voice that is audible above the quiet hum of the women's voices. The other young 'man' sits patiently next to his pregnant mother on a plastic chair. He is abou t four years old and is in full military camouflage suit with 'US Army' stitched on his breast (Field notes June 2002). This absence of men in repr oductive health services around the world is the norm according to the literature. Burmese men sit and wait for their partners, carry fretful toddlers and pay for the transport to post-ab ortion health visits, but husbands are not invited into the delivery room in the Mae Ta o Clinic except to help their wives off the high table after the birth. The men sit outsi de, watch TV or try to catch peeks through the green curtains that shroud the entran ce into the delivery suite. Being the background support person during birth or aborti on, I was able to invite men to talk about reproductive health, th eir wives' and their own. Ten men were interviewed following a semi -structured questionn aire and recruited from the Mae Tao Clinic after their wives gave permission for them to speak to the researcher. Men were not approached in th e Mae Sot General Hospital as they rarely entered the ward except to pick their wive s up at the time of discharge home. Two other women gave permission to intervie w their husband but both had disclosed extreme domestic violence and I declined to interview them, fearing a potentially bad reaction from their husbands, thereb y putting the wives at risk. The interview schedule focused on several areas including ethnic ity, religion, age, marital status, years of education, home town in Burma, length of stay and location in Thailand. Men were asked specifically about their migration from Burma to Thailand, their economic status, employme nt, and sexual and dr ug histories were taken. Questions were asked about their experience in th e Clinic; what had happened to their partner and why their wife needed to come to hospital (See Appendix E). If they disclosed knowing about the induced or spontaneous abor tion, further probing questions were asked. Fertil ity regulation, the desire fo r children and the size of family were topics of interest. Men were asked to name which methods of 265contraception they knew and which they had actually used; the nature and quality of the relationship; and feelings about personal safety while living in Thailand. They were interviewed by Saw Blessing, a male , married Karen health worker who had worked in a garment factory before his me dical training. Neither Rose nor I were present during the interview. Nearly all women interviewed reported an ongoing married rela tionship as did the men. One man stated he was 'living' with the mother of his three children. In this small sample of ten men, there were five cases of induced abor tion, all confirmed by viewing the woman's case notes. Two sets of couples gave interviews, the woman was interviewed and then if she and her partne r agreed he was interviewed separately. Eight men were Burman, 1 Shan and 1 Ar akhan. All were Buddhist. Their ages ranged from 19 to 37 years of age (mean 28.5 years). Four men had work permits, 4 men did not, 1 man did not say and the other man lived and worked in Burma. The 9 men who lived and worked in Thailand had been in Thailand between 18 months at the minimum and 18 years at the maximum. The average length of time spent in Thailand at the time of the interview was 7 years. The men originally came from Pa-an, Tennerissm, Rangoon, Pago, Thaton, Papoun and Moulmein in Burma. One couple was still living in Burma and anothe r couple was from a rural area, while the majority were from the town and surrounds. Their level of education was higher than the majority of women interviewed. Two men had attended ten years of school, 4 had eight years of school, 1 seven years, 1 six years, another only two years of schooling, and one man declined to say his level of education but said 'I am not an educated pe rson'. Five of their wives were admitted for a normal birth and 5 were admitted due to a pregnancy loss, the majority were induced abortions. The 10 men had a total of 19 children; with some men having no living children and one man four. Men and induced abortion The men were asked why their wives had co me to hospital and they responded with their understandings. Some men were open about the induced abortion, others more evasive, and perhaps were not informed of the true reason for the women's admission. 266The men referred to the superior quality of care at the Mae Tao Clinic as opposed to the Mae Sot General Hospital, or the health services available in Burma. A Burman man who had lived in Thailand for 12 years and whose wife had been pregnant 6 times explained: 'The firs t son was delivered in the Thai hospital and the nurses pinched and yelled at my wife.' However, all were enthusiastic about the Burmese- Karen staff at the Mae Tao Clinic and spoke warmly of the support, kindness and encouragement they received. Some men were aware why their wives were admitted to Mae Tao Clinic. One Burman man knew that his wife had asked fo r a pregnancy test an d then gone to the lay midwife after their opti ons had been discussed: I came here to visit my wife who has a lo t of trouble with an abortion, otherwise I wouldn't have come here. The nurse told us that we couldn't get an abortion here but they would help us to look after the baby or give it away for us. And this man was anxious: I am worried and I was so lucky that she di dn't die. The baby came out already. I am sad because my child is dead -it was my flesh and blood too. We will try for another baby later when it is safe. In post-abortion care, men are often excluded by health service procedure and protocol but say they would like to know more about their wives' condition (Alan Guttmacher Institute, 2003). However, this has to be balanced with confidentiality issues. 267 Plate 27 A health worker practices a condo m demonstration, Mae Tao Clinic (2003) Plate 28 Karen and Burman boys at a football match, Mae Tao Clinic (2003) 268 Generational differences and desired family size The men were asked about the size of th eir grandparents' families and their own mother's family by way of introducing the idea of family size. The numbers were impressive. The number of th e grandparent's children rang ed from 16 to 5, while the men themselves had between 7 and 4 childre n. The men often had clear ideas about the number of children they desired in th eir own family unit. A young Burman man said: 'My grandmother had eight children a nd my mother had five children. I would like to have three babies.' Another man declared: 'My grandmother had two children and my mother had seven children. I plan to have three children. Three children are absolutely enough.' One Burman man believed that family planni ng was his decision alone, but other men found themselves argui ng with their wives. 'I was planning to have three with my wife. We always argue d about that. She didn't want more babies. She said no. Sometimes we joked about it...but now I have two chil dren.' His wife requested a sterilisation af ter her induced abortion. The consistent view for Burmese health workers, men and many women was that three children, regardless of se x, was an ideal number. Th is is different from the general idea in Thailand where two child ren are considered the ideal number of children (Whittaker, 2000). On whether the men preferred to have boys or girls, there was not a strong feeling. Only in one family where there were an a bundance of three girls di d the father want a boy. Even though he wanted a son, his wife aborted the pregnancy: My grand mother has four children and my mother has seven children (one is dead already)... I discussed with my wife the number of children we should have every night, and we agreed we should have only three. She agreed. Now we have four but I want one more son. We have three daughters and one son. Another man talks about his assertive wife: I would like to have a son. Now we have two children. We never discussed the idea of stopping the pregnancy. After I saw my wi fe's pain and suffering I don't want any children. My wife said to me if you want a son you can adopt one or go and marry another woman! 269But the overriding opinion was th at financial matters were of greater importance, as a Shan man explained: I think about the economic situation and my age and I think that two babies are enough for me. The first baby was a boy. If th e other one is also a boy I will stop - it doesn't matter. I think about that my father had four children and had many problems. I thought about this responsibility to look after all these children. I talked with my wife about this and she agrees that two children are enough... She has thirteen brothers and sisters so she comes from a big family and has to help them. Men are aware of the responsib ilities of caring for children and believe if they have a large family they would not be able to se nd their children to school. While some men were able to articulate their desired family size, others found it much more difficult. Some had never talked about it before the interview. The men were asked which methods of c ontraception they had personal experience with, either as a single man or as a couple. Again, this was posed as an open question with no prompts or lists to aid memory. The men were interviewed after their wives had been in contact with M ae Tao Clinic staff, and they may have already had some education and counselling about contraceptive methods either at antenatal visits or during the current admission. The question wa s not prompted and we relied on men to spontaneously remember their knowledge. Daily or monthly oral contraceptive pills and progesterone depot injections were most frequently mentioned, with only half of the men mentioning c ondoms. One man also told the researcher he knew of the technique of moving the uterus to in crease fertility and ai d conception. No men mentioned the 'morning after pill' (emerg ency contraception in Thailand is or Postinor ). 270Table 19 Methods of contraception known or used by men (n=10) Method Known Ever used (single or married) Oral pills (daily or monthly) 9 3 Injections 7 2 Condom 5 2 Sterilisation 2 0 IUCD 2 1 Withdrawal 1 1 Home remedies and herbals 1 1 Some men reported multiple methods. Men ha d heard of more methods than they had used or practised. Eight men mentioned th eir partner using cont raceptive pills and injectables. Two men had never used any ty pe of contraception with any partner. One young man told of his experience with herbal and home-remedy style contraceptives/abortifacients th at he believed would assist his wife's menstruation to return. His wife tried various 'hot' medicines in the hope of regulating her menstruation but eventually decided on an abortion in Burma. The men were aware of the uncomfortable side-effects of so me of the methods their wives used: My wife took the everyday pill for the last five or six years. She did get some side- effects like a shaking heart. When she took the injection she gained a lot of weight. She worried about being fat in case it affect ed her mental health or blood pressure. I didn't know about all these side-effects before but now I do because she told me. His wife induced her abortion with a stic k and then consented to be sterilised. Another man helped his wife avoid the side effects of contraceptive methods by using withdrawal during sexual inte rcourse: 'I always used wi thdrawal before. My wife doesn't like the pills or Depo - they are not good for her. I just use my own experience with withdrawal and I tell my friends about it. ' His wife chose sterilisation after her indu ced abortion and after asking him to accept a vasectomy. There is no perfect method of contracepti on and all have failure rates. The intrauterine contraceptive de vice usually has a very low failure rate but one couple did experience an unintended pregnancy with th is method. She chose to induce abortion and the husband talks about their experience: 271 I thought she couldn't get pregnant because she was using the pei: hte . She had it put in one year ago. I was told it should last th ree to four years. I wasn't worried but then she didn't get her periods and we went fo r a pregnancy test and found out she was pregnant! Another man was particularly anxious that his wife not conceive a baby and wanted her to use an injectable form of contracep tion so she could not acc identally forget to contracept with oral pills. Other men were sensitive to their wives' suffering whilst they still retained the power to decide. 'I don't want her to have this kind of pain anymore so when she asked me if she coul d have sterilisation I said yes.' The medical record shows his wife accepted a tubal ligation. Some men strongly felt that contracepti on was women's business and the women should make the decisions. A Burman hus band whose wife experienced a pregnancy loss said: 'Women should discuss the idea of family planning and be able to choose the method because only women suffer with pregnancy.' Other men were open to their wives taking the lead: 'I want my wife to make the decision and try and make the best decision about this. I will agree to do whatever she says.' Ultimately some women just asserted their opinion. A 27-year-old Burman man married to a Karen woman, both stil l living in Burma, struggled with the new idea of contraception. He could name three modern methods without prompting but still felt it was agains t his Buddhist religion and the opinions of his elders. He clearly did not want a large family and in his moral dilemma, left his wife to decide this aspect of their family lif e: 'I want three children. My wife told me that one was enough and said that we can adopt more if I want more. I did talk to her before, and before the labour she said three was okay [laughing].' After the birth of their baby the woman chose a proge sterone three-month injection. Although the men had many opinions, it appeared from analysing the interview data and comparing with the actual outcomes record ed in the medical records, that there was not concurrence between what the me n thought was appropriate and what the women received as a supply of contraceptives . The health workers appear to have greater influence of the method of choice th an the husband. In no case did the man's 272preference prevail except in the refusal of vasectomy. It appears that women who come to the Mae Tao Clinic with their partners may lis ten to the opinion of their husband but decide for themselves. Women were not able to c onvince their husbands of the benefits of vasectomy despite th eir grave reproductive morbidity during the abortion. Men had many anxieties about the vasectomy procedure and outcomes, and a few men mentioned the pressure applied by thei r wives to consider and consent to a vasectomy. There are local understandings of anatomy and physiology that render a man very much weakened by the procedure. The weakness is linked to notions of potency and virility and rarely has an organic cause (Cohen, 1996; Hartmann, 1995; Raju & Leonard, 2000). One man said, 'I do know about male sterilisation but I don't know much about it. I heard th at men get tired after this operation so I think there must be a problem for them if they can't work.' Another man told us, 'My wife encouraged me to do vasectomy and I want th at but I am worried th at I won't be able to carry heavy things if I do it. You know most men need their strength.' One man drew upon a Burmese proverb to describe the effect of vasectomy. By implication if one part of a man is cut or damaged, the body will not function as well as before: I did hear about men's sterilisation. People say boun datoun ne pwezee deh.' A man's body is built with a thou sand joined muscles - so if you cut one (vasectomy) there will be a problem. I don 't think men's sterilisation is good. Women were not perceived to need stre ngth like a man. Although some men were perceived to be physically weaker after a vasectomy, other men thought that vasectomy would enhance sexual libido: I heard about male sterilisation and I heard th at after you have it you feel sexier. It is not enough to have one woman you want to have many! Other men say that they cannot work like before. The myth of promiscuity was retold again by a Burman man with 6 years of education who had accompanied his wife who gave birth to their third child. 'One of my friends had a vasectomy in Burma and after that he went around visiting many women. He can't work any more. I think I need to discuss it with my wife because she is worried.' She accepted a tubal ligation after the birth, perhaps fearing her husband's increased 273sexual appetite or his inability to earn money. Men were put off vasectomy by the idea of the pain it would cause. Women did apply pressure for their husbands to consider the idea of a vasectomy. A Burman man who used condoms prior to the birth of his second child said, 'My wife as ked me to get vasectomy again and again but I didn't do it.' One man said that he ha d seen a vasectomy and so was not relying on myth in making his opinion: 'I have seen a vasectomy. It is convenient. If you are going to do some family planning then va sectomy is a good way' but despite his positive view during the interview his wife accepted a progesterone injection. Women have few contraceptive choices but men have even less when considering the male-controlled methods of withdrawal, c ondoms and vasectomy. Often men's role is limited to providing emotiona l and social support or the economic means for women to choose a method of contraception. C ondoms, vasectomy and w ithdrawal are three ways that men can actively avoid an unw anted pregnancy and the men did express their thoughts and feelings about these me thods. Previous annual reports from the Mae Tao Clinic show that the quantities of condoms distributed were not recorded for public viewing until January 2002, and in this year a section speci fically reporting the activities of family planning services appeared for the first time (Maung, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002a, 2003). The total number of visits for family planning consultations increased from 2,559 visits in 2000 (twice as many as in 1999) to 3,723 (2001), 3,965 (2002) and 6,469 (2003). In the recent Annual Report (2003), there were 930 new acceptors of condoms and 273 repeat accepto rs. Sterilisation was accepted by 203 women and 26 men (2003) and in the prev ious year's repor t (2002), 249 women accepted a tubal ligation and 7 men a vasectomy. Some men saw the link between avoiding preg nancy and sexually transmitted diseases when talking about condoms. One 37-yea r-old Arakhan man e xplained: 'I think condom is the best because it prevents HIV an d it is clean for my wife too.' Many of the men had no experience in using condoms but knew of them. A 29-year-old Shan man said, 'I never used a condom because I do n't go to the prostitute and I have no experience. I heard about condoms and unde rstand but didn't actually put one on.' The idea of illicit or co mmercial sex and condoms was closely related. One man talked about his experience of visiting Thailand for commercial sex and using condoms while he lived in Burma. Anothe r man felt so badly about using the word 274'condom' he apologised to the male intervie wer for even mentioning it out loud. The difference in sensation between using a condom or not was also important to the men. One Burman man said, 'I do use condoms with other women but I don't with my wife. Using a condom is not \"tasty\".' So me men just did not like the idea although they had no experience in usi ng them. Withdrawal as a me thod of reducing the risk of a pregnancy was mentioned by two men. My husband doesn't understand - women talking about men The lack of including men in discussions about future family planning during post- abortion care caused problems especially in explaining condoms or considering vasectomy. One woman said: I don't know anything about family planning that is why I have this problem. The Mae Tao Clinic told me about htou: zei and pills and I think I will use pills. My friends told me they used something but they didn't really explain it to me. My husband doesn't understand anything about fa mily planning but when they told me, they only told me but not my husband. Some husbands were directive in ensuring th eir wives were sterilised. A 27-year-old Karen woman with a history of four pregnanc ies said of her husband, 'He told me that after this baby we get sterilisation for me a nd even if the nurse w ouldn't arrange it he would.' Another wife stated: 'My husband w ould like a girl. He said that I should have the sterilisation after the next ba by because I am old now.' Although some women did not want to be st erilised, they submitted. So me men were amenable to their wives using family planning but were reluctant to use it themselves, as this Karen woman in her second marriage explains : 'He wants me to ha ve a sterilisation after the three childre n. He understands about family planning but he won't use it himself.' Other women felt that their husband just did not understand about family planning. This 38-year-old Karen woman with a hi story of six pregnancies and a pummel abortion said: 275I never knew about family planning befo re. My husband told me not to use the injections or pills. He said we will accept a ll the babies. We never heard about family planning but he heard about it from his fri ends. He didn't know much about it. Condoms were often given to women to take home after a pregnancy loss, and while they are a good temporary method for some couples, women identified problems such as trying to take condoms seriously and men not using them. A Karen woman who accepted a tubal ligation found condoms useful to entertain her children: The staff talked with me about family planning. My husband doesn't understand anything about this but he doesn't stop me from arranging it all. They have taught us how to use condoms but my husband just gives them away to friends and sometimes I give them to the children like balloons to play with [laughs]. Another woman elaborated: My husband understands about family planning too. The nurses here gave me education and I agree with this idea. In the future I will take oral pills. The nurses gave me condoms to use with my husband bu t I think it is unlikely he will use them with me. (24 years, two pr egnancies, stick abortion) This woman with a history of domestic violence explained her situation: My husband understands a bit about family planning and he does listen when he is not drunk but when he is drunk I cannot explain anything to him. He wants a baby but I don't know how many. I never heard of family planning before as I had no opportunity to hear about it but in the ref ugee clinic they taught me about condoms. I have one pack of condoms but I haven't s hown my husband and I don't think he will use them. (35 years, six pregnancies) The women said it was difficult to talk w ith men about family planning, either the men would not talk about it or they did not listen to the wo men. With reluctant, silent husbands, women often independently decide their method of contraception. One woman who was in the Mae Sot General hos pital said that her husband knew nothing about family planning. She was considering going to the Mae Tao Clinic to 'get the injection.' Another woman who accepted so me family planning information at the end of her exit interview from the Mae Sot General Hospital said: My husband doesn't want me to use family planning and said we would accept the babies. I am not scared of my husband we respect each other. I am interested to know more about condoms [we give her a pamphlet and tell her about Mae Tao Clinic]. I 276need to ask my husband about this. I believe he will help me. He will know where to get them. I don't think he ever used them before. He can read. A 19-year-old woman married for six months commenced the oral contraceptive pill despite her husband's silence on the matter. During the interview with the male interviewer, her husband said he only want ed one baby but he never discussed it with his wife. She induced her abortion with stic ks and needed to be transfused due to haemorrhage. She is fearful of another pregnancy: The nurse explained about modern contraceptiv es to me and I agree. They gave me a book to read but they said read it when I am stronger. I choose to take oral pills. I told my husband and he didn't say anything. I started my first dose this morning. I am scared to get pregnant now. In sum, the Burmese men who agreed to be interviewed were neither knowledgeable nor particularly obstructive concerning fertility manageme nt. This is not only a gender issue but linked to the limited contac t with notions of family planning or reproductive health services available in Burma today. The opening quote from the Union of Myanmar's report to the CEDAW committee suggesting that sexual health topics are widely available through edu cation programmes to boys and girls would appear to be fictional. Burmese men ha d only superficial info rmation about modern or traditional methods of contraception and limited experiences from which to draw opinions. Condoms were perceived largely to be used with 'other' women rather than their regular partner and vasectomy was rej ected. Vasectomy was frequently refused by men due to deep fears, despite some me n acknowledging the benefits to them as a couple. Even though the wives were desp erately ill and many had cajoled their husband to submit to vasectomy, this was refused by naming 'weakness' or potential infidelity as reasons. Furtherm ore, the price of contraception is not the only issue that couples consider. Tubal ligation is far more expensive than vasectomy and it is still the most common form of sterilisation met hod. These findings are substantiated by the recorded lack of uptake in vasectomy at either the Mae Tao Clinic or Mae Sot General hospital. Fertility management is more often the domain of Burmese women and while this is positive, better informa tion and education for men would enhance the uptake and continuation of reliab le and safe family planning. 277 Chapter 11 Conclusion Quote from the Joint Statement Stressing the strengthening of the Economic Cooperation among the four Countries - \"Ayeyawady - Chao Phraya - Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy\" ENVISIONING to transform the border areas of the four countries into zones of durable peace, stability and economic grow th, to promote, social progress and prosperity of our peoples and to blend lo cal, national and regional interests for common benefit and shared prosperity...(Mini stry of Foreign Affairs & Union of Myanmar, 2003:no page number) Abortion is widely practised around the worl d for a multitude of reasons regardless of legal or social sanctions. The specific cultural and political milieu fashions the particular practice and outcome of induced abortion. The vast quantity of death and disability associated with substandard fertility control methods, both bio-medical and traditional is tragic and preventable. Reproductive desires do change during migration, displacement and conflict but th ere are few theories which adequately explain how or why. Due to the in creased recognition of human rights and specifically women's rights, women's health needs have begun to be addressed but remain unavailable or services are of poor quality for many women around the world, especially those who are forced to migrate. 278The central concern of this study is the lack of reproductive heal th services for marginalised and displaced populations. This research found that access to reliable modern methods of contraception is di fficult, and elective, safe abortion was unavailable, contested and criminalised; l eaving women who did not want to become pregnant very few options. Most of the Burmese women who conceded they induced their abortion, were working wives and moth ers of multiple children. Their income was vital to provide for their existing nuclear and extended families both in Thailand and Burma. In particular, this study explores the reproductive experiences of Burmese women outside of the refugee camp system in Tak province, Thailand. The vast majority of Burmese people in Thailand do not reside in refugee camps but in urban and rural areas of the country. Most are employed in formally in manufact uring, agriculture, construction, fishing, retail or servant work for low wages in insecure workplaces. Women are particularly vulnerable to exploitative work practices and are discriminated against due to their reproducti ve capacity. Women spoke of saving for their own future and production rather than reproduction was favoured. Women not registered to reside or work in Thailand, experience human rights abuses in accessing reproductive health services, travelling a nd earning a fair wage. Even documented migrant workers are 'bonded' to their Thai employer in the province and are unable to move freely. I argue that this has a direct impact on wo men's health. Between four to five hundred women are treated at the Mae Tao Clinic each year for the complications of an early pregnancy loss. At the Mae Sot General Hospital, several hundred women occupy beds recovering from complicated pregnanc y losses annually. At least one third of these women have ended their own pre gnancy and two thirds have natural miscarriages. Limited resources are avai lable to treat life-t hreatening obstetric emergencies that can occur during a co mplicated early pregnancy loss or the subsequent emotional and social impact on individuals, families and the community. Women suffer pain, haemorrhage, damage to their internal organs, impaired future fertility, sterility, and occasionally death. In addition, they risk legal action and social stigma. 279This thesis argues that refugee-led health services are the most appropriate model to deliver primary reproductive health care, drawing on the resili ence and autonomy of the people most affected by forced migra tion. However, they cannot function well without emergency referral systems and financ ial or other external supports. The host population's willingness to accommodat e a 'foreign' health care system is pivotal. I am not arguing that the Mae Tao Clinic is superior to the Thai public health system but rather that some elements of post-abortion care are now performed technically better by the refugee-led hea lth service. The Mae Tao Clinic has functioned with minimal forward planning for a decade, due in part to the refugee community's instability and reliance on external aid in the forms of financial and medical capital from international and Thai sources. Th e Mae Tao Clinic provides basic services when and if possible. The Mae Sot Gene ral Hospital provides emergency referral support and more complex treatment options on a 24 hour basis. Its capacity and medical resources are far greater that the Mae Tao Clinic's. However, the Mae Tao Clinic provides MVA and family planning e ducation and supplies to in-patients which the Mae Sot General Hospital does not. More over, the Burmese staff has experienced forced migration and live with insecurity a nd fear in the same way as their patients; therefore they share common understandings of the difficulties of life in Burma and Thailand, as well as the more obvious comm onalities of cultures and languages. Lay midwives provide considerable quantitie s of reproductive health care. They not only deliver infants but some also offer fe rtility management methods. While often effective they are not without danger. Lay midwives receive no information about abortion, post-abortion care and limited e ducation on modern methods of family planning during TBA training programmes. In displaced and migrating populations that cannot rely on host-government, interna tional aid or home-government to provide health services, local initiatives which use a combination of primary health care and community development strate gies are a solution. The Ottowa Charter of Health Promotion suggests the need to build hea lthy public policy, create a supportive environment, develop personal skills, st rengthen community action, and reorient health services as five ways to promot e health (International Conference on Primary Health Care, 1978). In hostile environm ents these principles are difficult to implement and sustain but not impossible. 280 As described in chapter 1 the objectives of this study were: \u0083 to describe the issue of fertility, un wanted pregnancy and pregnancy loss for Burmese women living in Thailand outsi de of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees system of camps; \u0083 to quantify the number of admissions and women presenting to Burmese and Thai public health services for post abortion problems; \u0083 to identify demographic, bio-medical a nd socially relevant information in women with any type of pregnancy loss; \u0083 to document the methods which Burmese women use to regulate fertility; \u0083 to analyse the causes and preven tion of abortion practices; \u0083 to analyse fertility outcomes in relati on to the socio-political situation in Thailand and between Burma and Thailand and particularly forced migrations; \u0083 to consider the link between fertility outcomes and reproductive health rights. In chapter 3 I explained the research methods which were a combination of quantitative and qualitative t ools. The mixed method approach was used for several reasons. Firstly, I believe that much can be achieved by working across academic disciplines as well as cultures, and numb ers and meanings are equally important. Secondly, in Tak province where instabil ity, secrecy and illegality are dominant features, any numbers collected are inherently flawed and can only give an impression of the scale of the problem. Thirdl y, I believe local pe ople's opinions and experiences, particularly women's, are vital in order to provide a complete understanding. The major findings that emerge from this thesis are: 1) the unaddressed issue of abortion morbidity and mortality in the Burmese population in Thailand; 2) the ambiguous categories used to define Burm ese people's access to resources; 3) the intersections between gender and socio/ politics and poor reproductive health outcomes; 4) the widespread use of traditional fertility management practices; 5) the variable quality of post-abortion care; and 6) the disregard for women's human rights. In this conclusion I focus on the broad im plications of the findings. Clinicians, community leaders, researchers, teachers, po licy makers can all ma ke contributions to 281lessening the harm of unsaf e abortion. In appendix G, I outline very specific recommendations which address issues such as the particulars of clinical practice, providing education, public health strategies, advice to future researchers and government and non-government workers. Th ese recommendations cover three pages of detail that are relatively specific to area of Mae Sot but some may be applicable in other areas where a sim ilar situation of chronic forced mi gration and insecu rity exists. The report in Burman and English, Working Out Way Back Home: Fertility and pregnancy loss at the border of Thailand which can be viewed online at http://www.burmalibrary.org/ by Dr Cynthia Maung and myself, also contains local and general recommendations. Unaddressed issue of abortion mo rbidity and mortality in the Burmese populati on in Thailand The literature review presented in chapters 1 and 4 demonstrates the limited and partial information available on unwant ed pregnancy and abortion for Burmese women. In Burma elective induced abortio n is highly restrict ed, abortion is a common cause of maternal morbidity and mo rtality, and there is a documented unmet need for contraceptive services and falling fe rtility rate. The censored literature from Burma suggests a 'culture of abortion' wh ere there is limited health education, a faltering health system, marginalised a nd displaced populations who find access to health services difficult. Traditional midw ives provide basic mate rnal health care and fertility limiting services. Burmese migrants bring their culture with them as they migrate into Thailand, where the reproductive culture is different. In Thailand fertility rates are low, modern contraceptive use high, maternal and infant mortality low and th ere is good access to public health services. Many informants in this study reported hearing about contraception and purchasing it for the first time after their arrival in Thailand but despite this Burmese men and women have lo w levels of sexual health knowledge and limited experience with modern methods of contraception even when in Thailand. In chapter 5, approximately one third of patients with post-abortion complications had attempted to end their own pregnancy. Married women who al ready had children were the most typical patient to present for post-abortion care and they were working 282wives, employed but not registered to work or live in Thailand, and were therefore 'invisible' as citizens. The Mae Sot General hosp ital records show that reproductive health services are used by the Burmese. The numbers from hospital reports and annual reports only reflect the people who could get to the health services, not those who wanted or needed to go to hospital. The major findings were that complicated abortion was a frequent problem seen in both out-patient and in-patient Thai and Burmese health facilities but one that coul d be reduced by bette r delivery of modern contraceptive technology, community based in formation and education strategies, as well as assisted transportation and refe rral for routine and emergency reproductive health care. As abortion is substantively illegal a nd the population is largely undocumented any statistics need to be regarded critica lly. Most are flawed or underestimates. Invariably only the severest cases are visibl e. The Thai Ministry of Public Health rigorously collects and publishes health statistics from local health stations and public hospitals; it was therefore surprising to fi nd that Burmese women's mortality was not recorded or remarked upon at a national le vel. The higher rates of morbidity and mortality in a single public hospital in th is study suggest that complicated abortions are the cause of many admissions and several deaths, and this is probably replicated in areas where there are large Burmese populations in Thailand such as Bangkok, Chiangmai, the southern fishing communities and the northern provinces where the Shan people work. It is unlikely that the Burmese military government is aware of maternal mortality or morbidity of their citi zens in Thailand, or that the international community is informed. This information needs to be recorded and action taken by the health departments of both countrie s, the World Health Organization Bangkok office and UNFPA regional office. Ambiguous categories used to define Burmese people's access to resources Chapter 2 discussed the categorisation of Burm ese in Thailand as either 'refugees' or 'migrant workers', when in fact the populations are mixed and the overlapping categories have more to do with geographi cal location or ethnicity than surviving human rights abuses. The dichotomy be tween refugee and migrant worker is ambiguous. The fluidity of the Thai-Burma border offers opportunities for travel and 283trade to women, often mediated by traffickers. While it may be expedient for the Thai government, UNHCR or NGOs to categorise gr oups of people for political purposes, a more nuanced stance is required if health policy and programmes are to be successful. Within the Burmese population there exist diverse groups of people who speak various languages, stem from urban and rural areas of Burma, and identify with particular ethnic or political gr oups. Health promotion strate gies need to reflect this diversity. The population outside the camp system is typically referred to as transient and public health strategies of providing h ealth information and education are thought not to be effective. It was a revelation that many of my informants were long-term residents in Thailand and th is would suggest that a heal th promotion strategy to prevent unsafe abortion and promote fam ily planning would be beneficial. Intersections between gender and socio/politics and poor reproductive health outcomes Women are pressured by social and political circumstances to end their pregnancies. I argue that the decision to terminate a pregnancy does not occur in a vacuum and generates dilemmas. I not only refer to the involvement of partners, friends, neighbours and family who pr ovided advice, money and tr ansport but also to the systemic pressure exerted on women. In chapter 9, women cited: poverty; concern for living children; domestic violence; relationshi p problems; fear of loss of employment; low family planning knowledge; contraceptiv e accidents; a wish to delay pregnancy; debts; and pressure from part ners, family and friends in influencing their decision to terminate their pregnancy. Women's income was significant for the immediate family in Thailand and the extended family back in Burma. Furthermore, men and women had low levels of knowledge about modern methods of contraception and often relied on traditional methods of menstrual regulati on. Men's behaviour such as creating debt, drinking alcohol, absence, sexual infi delity, and violence, form part of women's decision to end a pregnancy. This discussion was elaborated in chapter 10 where I argued that men are deeply involved in the business of unwanted pregna ncy and abortion but ra rely is the gaze on their beliefs, behaviour or body. Burmese men leave the responsibility of fertility management to their partners and only activ ely block vasectomy. Some are aware of abortion as an option and assi st their partners to end the pregnancy - others are not 284informed. Discussions with men and wo men revealed not only low levels of knowledge concerning traditional or modern methods of contraception, incorrect use and myths, but also a reluctance to disc uss contraception although most only desired three children. Some women reported domestic violence as influencing their decision to abort and this was not well recognised by health work ers. 'Weakness' or distress experienced by women can be an indicator of potential unsafe abortio n in this context. The medicalisation of social or cultural disrupt ions in the forms of oppression, repression, violence and genocide is internalised and expressed as 'weakness'. The medics at Mae Tao Clinic are perceptive clinicians who note the conne ctions but did not detect 'weakness' as a risk-factor for induced abor tion. The women talk not only of their own personal suffering but often consider the potential suffering of the unborn child and make reference to their living childre n who may or may not be in Thailand, specifically the need to provide for them through waged labour or not bring them into a violent family. Health workers require training and support to identify and act on gender-based violence in their patients, many of whom present with 'weakness'. Community leaders and men in the community should also be included in awareness raising and activities to dimi nish violence against women. In this location the Thai police and judiciary are not perceived as a dvocates for women, and as most women do not hold work permits they were unwilling to make themselves visible to Thai authorities. Citizenship is marginal to non-existent, and protection from harassment or violence is often not available a nd corruption by authorities common. The recognition of violence in women's lives and their lack of power in some circumstances and the inclusion of men in reproductive health issues would be positive. Additionally the reforms of laws which criminalise acts of abortion or policies which inhibit people's access to fertility control are required. Widespread use of traditional fertility management practices Abortion is generally represented as a taboo topic. It was therefore an unexpected finding when women talked of induced aborti on as a traditional method of fertility management. As there is no access to el ective safe abortion, lay abortionists and home remedies are the only recourse wome n have to end an unwanted pregnancy. In 285chapter 7, women disclosed the details of their attempts to terminate their pregnancy. They discussed what they did, where they went, who they asked for information, interactions with the abortionists, how mu ch it cost and their fears and motivations. The other state of ambiguity found is the categorisation of induced abortion in low- technology environments. The line between a spontaneous miscarri age and an induced abortion is unclear as I outline in chapte r 6. Fertility is not assumed, pregnancy testing is non-existent and so women's knowledge and expe rience is authoritative. The liminal state of a late period and no foetal movement may be defined as congested menstrual blood, which can be enc ouraged to flow by herbal and manual manipulations. In the even t of the blood rema ining blocked then a pregnancy is assumed, and a stick abortion may be attemp ted. Bio-medical definitions of abortion are inconsistent across health care setti ngs, depending in part on Thai law and on medical pragmatism. The viability of the embryo, foetus or even neonate, is dependent on the perceptions of the wo men and health care provider and the conditions available to support a fragile life in a resource-poor setting. These ambiguities mean that clinical diagnosis and research categories are highly questionable and need to be in terpreted with caution. The methods of terminating a pregnancy are crude. In chapter 7, I examined the traditional abortion methods: 'hot' food and medicines, pummelling and stick abortions. Women knew of and used a vari ety of methods to end their pregnancy including self-medication with multinational and Burmese medicines, ginger and whisky, vigorous pelvic pummelling and inse rtion of objects into the genitals. Pummelling and stick abortions produced the most morbidity and mortality but were effective abortion methods. In chapter 6, not ions of foetal development and viability were defined differently by va rious people. While there wa s no single definition of an abortion, people agreed that the foetus should be motionl ess and not well developed for an abortion to be attempted. As I recruited from health service facili ties, I inevitably interviewed those women with the worst outcomes but despite this, traditional abortion methods are not safe, and even thwe: zei ('hot' medicine) may produce foetal abnormality or other maternal health problems. When post-abortion compli cations arise, treatment in hospital can 286be expensive if a woman does not have a work permit or is not referred by Mae Tao Clinic; it can leave her with consider able debts. As gossip is common and confidentiality in hospital is not practiced well, a woman's reputat ion can be seriously jeopardised. I argue that lay midwives are common, accepta ble to local women, practice aspects of maternal and child care and some are also abortionists. In chapter 8, I discussed the varied practice of lay midwives. They assist pregnant wo men with antenatal massages, delivery and post-partum care. Some l\u00e8 the are skilled herbalists. Many l\u00e8 the advise women to space their next baby a nd offer to 'lift the womb' to ensure conception is delayed. L\u00e8 the attend training sessions o ffered by NGOs and take on some cosmopolitan practices. Training a nd exposure to 'modern medicine' enhances lay midwives' reputation and expands their repertoire of skills. Some lay midwives incorporate injections, intravenous lines, ut erine stimulants and hormonal preparations into their practice, as they are easily purchased by anyone over the counter. The conundrum to train or not to train lay midw ives becomes more problematic when this is understood. The better regulation a nd monitoring of pharmaceuticals by the Thai government would ameliorate this problem. Variable quality of post-abortion care Not only does the quality of post-aborti on care vary depending on which health services the woman enters, but the model of post-abortion care delivered is limited. Women's access to post-abortion care is important, as Greenslade's model demonstrates in chapter 1, but in Tak provi nce, freedom of movement and association is restricted and most people report living in fear and insecurity. They cannot always reach centrally located services. While information, education and counselling are important, the inability to move freely to access health services means women can not always attend for initial consultations, follow-up care or life-saving procedures. In this area out-reach services into migrant worker's communities and workplaces are essential but only occur in an ad hoc manner. As Thailand has undergone a fertility revolution and has a broad acceptance of modern contraceptive methods it is surprising that in-p atient post-abortion family planning counselling and supply is so dysfuncti onal. Sterilisation is the only method 287offered to Burmese women while they are in-patients and cons ent procedures are below international acceptable standards of care. Temporary contraceptive methods are not offered to women during post-abortion care in the Mae Sot General Hospital but are only offered six weeks af ter discharge on an out-patient basis. This is entirely ineffective as it is possible to ovulate two weeks after any type of pregnancy loss or abortion and most women will not return to visit the hospital due to travel fears and costs. The Mao Tao Clinic is supportive and progressive in teaching a nd delivering modern contraceptives to its patients but ev en they frequently failed to supply women at risk with the effective means to contro l future conceptions af ter pregnancy loss. Both of these failures were due to a lack of skills in health workers, no shared common language, patients' low literacy a nd education levels, the partitioning of family planning as an out-pa tient activity, women's fear of travelling and potential arrest, and the lack of inclusion of men in family planning progr ammes and services. Thailand's reproductive revolution is an example of a conservative, Buddhist population's acceptance of modern methods of fertility limitation due to changing social and economic conditions and developm ent aspirations. Burmese women would probably behave in the same way if they we re given comparable opportunities as Thai women to choose the number and timing of their children. In the areas of technical pe rformance and appropriate technology for the treatment of complications, informally trained Burmese health workers provide high-quality and appropriate post-abortion care. The refugee-led health care service at the Mae Tao Clinic provides manual vacuum aspirati on treatment of retained products of conception, family planning educational opportunities and modern contraceptive technology on discharge. This is a superior service to that provided by formally trained (university and college) Thai medical doctors and nurses who use sharp curettes (D&C) and are unable to offer education, counselling or contraceptive supplies during admission or on discharge. I suggest that where long-term displacement is the norm, there is merit in training and monitoring informal health workers to deliver a range of reproductive hea lth services, and the technical aspects of post-abortion care, if they can be s upported and medical supplies maintained. Furthermore, training conduc ted by international or multi-national NGOs should be offered to host population health staff to ensure similar standards of care and equity. 288Greenslade's model is incomplete, as I have already remarked men are absent, but the environment beyond the health sector is al so missing. The market place is a popular source of information and medicine. A variety of herbals and pharmaceuticals are available over the counter in pharmacies or in the market stalls, some of which are poor quality. The health information given to purchasers is superf icial or incorrect. There is an opportunity to not only better re gulate the sale of me dicines but also to improve community knowledge about the emergency contraceptive pill, condoms, every-day low dose contraceptive pills a nd injectables. The market vendors may appreciate public health information regarding the storage and sale of pharmaceuticals, as well as information on the correct use of oral contraception or condoms. They make an ideal point of re ference for public health information, an activity which they already do; a service they could charge a fee fo r if the quality of information improved. Abortion referrals are also available in the market place and there is scope for community education projects to work w ith market vendors concerning safer fertility management strategies and other sexual health issues such as HIV or STIs. Furthermore, out-reach projec ts with a reproductive health focus into brothels, farms, factories and co mmunities would be beneficial. Abortion and post-abortion care are not include d in the current TBA training curricula taught by the Mae Tao Clinic and this is an omission. A module on abortion and post- abortion care needs to be deve loped and included in future training programmes. It is unlikely that lay midwives will stop o ffering abortion to women but they may recognise danger signs of post-abortion complication like pain, haemorrhage and fever better, and refer women for M VA and antibiotic therapy. Moreover, incorporating humoural notions of hea lth with evidence-based knowledge would enhance the cultural acceptabili ty of teaching about post-abortion care. Nevertheless women request fertility management, and in areas where elective, safe abortion is not an option, the lay midwives' multiple roles, one being abortion, is in demand. In this area where access to services is limited and travel difficult, lay midwives offer a valuable service which could be improved with better educ ation, reliable supplies of equipment and basic medicines, and referral options. Repatriation across the border is always possible and future plans need to encompass this potential. As refugees are granted asylum in third countries, training needs to be 289replicated and sustained. In the borderla nds of Burma, health care does not reach internally displaced people and the national health syst em is under-resourced as discussed in chapters 1, 4 and 8. The Uni on of Myanmar states that midwives are fundamental and multipurpose health workers and recent reports of a model including l\u00e8 the in post-abortion care provision imply that this model is a useful one for Burma (see chapter 8). Furthermore, it is unlikel y that Burma's economy will be able to fund the infrastructure required for a comprehensive public health system or one where emergency obstetric facilities are widely accessible across the country in the near future. In this scenario, local health initiat es and traditional health systems need to be supported. Disregard for women's human rights and women's health Ultimately, as I suggest in this thesis, the issue of reproductive health is one of human rights. Human rights are well articulated in several international conventions, treaties and charters and Burma and Thailand are si gnatories to few but they have ratified CEDAW. In chapter 1, I highlighted the relevance of CEDAW to women's health as it specifically mentions the right to deci de whether or when to have children, and family planning (CEDAW 1979 Articles 12 & 16). Other international conventions are now so widely accepted they form a ne twork of international law called customary law, and express rights such as: the right to health care and health protection; the right to the benefits of scientific progress; the ri ght to liberty and securi ty of the person; the right to be free from torture and ill-tr eatment. The IPPF Charter on Sexual and Reproductive Rights has compiled human right s proclamations and integrated them into health statements and other simila r documents exist formulated by the World Health Organization (See chapter 1). My study found that Burmese women's human rights in this border region ar e disregarded with impunity. Inter-personal violence is common and state sanctioned violence and human rights abuses direct ly contribute to poor reproductive health outcomes. The economic imperatives of Burma and Thailand over-ride any commitment to CE DAW and closer economic ties have been recently cemented as the quote at the beginning of this the final chapter suggests. Burma's militaristic, nationalistic, anti-democratic agenda dominates, causing forced migration into Thailand and a culture of abortion in Burma. Thailand offers a partial sanctuary, so long as the forced migrant re mains quiescent, apolitical and 'unseen'. Undocumented and documented Burmese work ers contribute to Thailand's economic 290success but pregnant women workers are th reatened or deported. Women are caught between economic, political and aspirational disparities, as they move across national borders. The perceived fear and real chance of arrest prohibit Burmese women from seeking timely health care. In the case of a complicated abortio n this delay can be fatal. Burmese women as non-citizens are not included in Thai death statistics at a national level so the deaths of Burmese women are unnoticed, by both Thai and Union of Myanmar authorities. While it is understand able that Thailand needs to analyse its own population without the confounding Burm ese population, this information should be recorded and acted upon at the highest level. At the local level it is also imperative that the four major reproduc tive health providers; the public sector, the private sector, the international aid organi sations and the Burmese informal health sector, share information and develop strategies to le ssen reproductive risks for Burmese women (See Appendix G). The Royal Thai Government and the Burmese military regime (SPDC) are accountable for Burmese women's health. Th ey are responsible for the budgeting and distribution of health resour ces and they need to devi se innovative public health measure which will prevent unsafe fertility management. Local health public health measures and initiatives play an important role as well as wise policies and prudent laws. It is possible to pl an reproductive health servic es in areas of conflict and displacement even when data are imprecise a nd situations protracted as is the case in Tak. At this stage the Thai R oyal Government's solution, is to refoule or repatriate all pregnant Burmese migrant workers to Bu rma (see Prologue-Beginnings & endings). It is likely that this policy will further increase the incentive for Burmese women who wish to remain in Thailand to procure uns afe abortions. Thailand benefits from a cheap, compliant workforce, who is willing to do the unpalatable and hazardous work. Thailand's relative safety and wealth are pull factors to impoverished Burmese. The Burmese military junta's harsh and poor gove rnance is a push f actor forcing people over national borders; its priority is to main tain political power by fear and force, and the health and education of their population is of ma rginal concern. The SPDC benefits by the considerable remittances into their domestic economy from migrant workers, as well as Thailand absorbing indigent Burmese workers who cannot 291participate in the Burmese economy. The flow of capital, developm ent projects, trade and investment is an important priorit y, as the signing of the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy in Bagan (Burma), in 2003, between Burma, Thailand, Lao and Cambodia indicate s (Ministry of Foreign Affairs & Union of Myanmar, 2003). Thailand will have to reckon with the cont inuous stream of female workers some of whom are conventi on refugees, who wish to benefit from the increased economic development and opport unities it brings and they deserve Thailand and Burma to honour their international commitments to CEDAW. 292References Abuduhou, J.

It entered into force as an international treaty on 3 September 1981 after the twentieth country had ratified it. By the tenth anniversary of the Convention in 1989, almost one hundred nations have agreed to be bound by its provisions. The Convention was the culmination of more than thirty years of work by the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, a body established in 1946 to monitor the situation of women and to promote women's rights. The Commission's work has been instrumental in bringing to light all the areas in which women are denied equality with men. These efforts for the advancement of women have resulted in several declarations and conventions, of which the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women is the central and most comprehensive document. Among the international human rights treaties, the Convention takes an important place in bringing the female half of humanity into the fo cus of human rights concerns. The spirit of the Convention is rooted in the goals of the United Nations: to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity, and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women. The present document spells out the meaning of equality and how it can be achieved. In so doing, the Convention establishes not only an international bill of rights for women, but also an agenda for action by countries to guarantee the enjoyment of those rights. In its preamble, the Convention explicitly ackno wledges that \"extensive discrimination against women continues to exist\", and emphasizes that such discrimination \"violates the principles of equality of rights and respect for human dignity\". As defined in article 1, discrimination is understood as \"any distinction, exclusion or restriction made o.1 the basis of sex...in the political, 323economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field\". The Convention gives positive affirmation to the principle of equality by requiring States part ies to take \"all appropriate measures, including legislation, to ensure the full development and advancement of women, for the purpose of guaranteeing them the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms on a basis of equality with men\"(article 3). The agenda for equality is specified in fourteen subsequent articles. In its approach, the Convention covers three dimensions of the situation of women. Civil rights and the legal status of women are dealt with in great detail. In additio n, and unlike other human rights treaties, the Convention is also concerned with the dimension of human reproduction as well as with the impact of cultural factors on gender relations. The legal status of women receives the broadest attention. Concern over the basic rights of political participation has not diminished since the adoption of the Convention on the Political Rights of Women in 1952. Its provisions, theref ore, are restated in article 7 of the present document, whereby women are guaranteed the rights to vote, to hold public office and to exercise public functions. This includes equal rights for women to represent their countries at the international level (article 8). The Convention on the Nationality of Married Women - adopted in 1957 - is integrated under article 9 providing for the statehood of women, irrespective of their marital status. The Convention, thereby, draws attention to the fact that often women's legal status has been linked to marriage, making them dependent on their husband's nationality rather than individuals in their own right. Articles 10, 11 an d 13, respectively, affirm women's rights to non- discrimination in education, employment and economic and social activities. These demands are given special emphasis with regard to the situation of rural women, whose particular struggles and vital economic contributions, as noted in article 14, warrant more attention in policy planning. Article 15 asserts the full equality of women in civil and business matters, demanding that all instruments directed at restricting women's legal capacity ''shall be deemed null and void\". Finally, in article 16, the Convention returns to the issu e of marriage and family relations, asserting the equal rights and obligations of women and men with regard to choice of spouse, parenthood, personal rights and command over property. Aside from civil rights issues, the Convention also devotes major attention to a most vital concern of women, namely their reproductive rights. The preamble sets the tone by stating that \"the role of women in procreation should not be a basis for discrimination\". The link between discrimination and women's reproductive role is a matter of recurrent concern in the Convention. For example, it advocates, in article 5, ''a proper understanding of maternity as a social function\", demanding fully shared responsibility for child-rearing by both sexes. Accordingly, provisions for maternity protection and child-care are proclaimed as essent ial rights and are incorporated into all areas of 324the Convention, whether dealing with employment, family law, health core or education. Society's obligation extends to offering social services, esp ecially child-care facilities, that allow individuals to combine family responsibilities with work and participation in public life. Special measures for maternity protection are recommended and \"shall not be considered discriminatory\". (article 4). \"The Convention also affirms women's right to reproductive choice. Notably, it is the only human rights treaty to mention family planning. States parties are obliged to include advice on family planning in the education process (article l O.h) and to develop family codes that guarantee women's rights \"to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and to hove access to the information, education and means to enable them to exercise these rights\" (article 16.e). The third general thrust of the Convention aims at enlarging our understanding of the concept of human rights, as it gives formal recognition to the influence of culture and tradition on restricting women's enjoyment of their fundamental rights. These forces take shape in stereotypes, customs and norms which give rise to the multitude of legal, political and economic constraints on the advancement of women. Noting this interrelationship, the preamble of the Convention stresses \"that a change in the traditional role of men as well as the role of women in society and in the family is needed to achieve full equality of me n and women\". States parties are therefore obliged to work towards the modification of social and cultural patterns of individual conduct in order to eliminate \"prejudices and customary and all othe r practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women\" (article 5). And Article 1O.c. mandates the revision of textbooks, school programmes and teaching methods with a view to eliminating stereotyped concepts in the field of education. Finally, cultural patterns which define the public realm as a man's world and the domestic sphere as women's domain are strongly targeted in all of the Convention's provisions that affirm the equal responsibilities of both sexes in family life and their equal rights with regard to education and employment. Altogether, the Convention provides a comprehensive framework for challenging the various forces that have created and sustained discrimination based upon sex. The implementation of the Convention is monitored by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). The Committee's mandate and the administration of the treaty are defined in the Articles 17 to 30 of the Convention. The Committee is composed of 23 experts nominated by their Governments and elected by the States parties as individuals \"of high moral standing and competence in the field covered by the Convention\". At least every four years, the States parties are expected to submit a national report to the Committee, indicating the measures they have adopted to give effect to the provisions of the Convention. During its annual session, the Committee members discuss these reports with the 325Government representatives and explore with them areas for further action by the specific country. The Committee also makes general recommendations to the States parties on matters concerning the elimination of discrimination against women. The full text of the Convention is set out herein, CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINAT ION OF ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN The States Parties to the present Convention, Noting that the Charter of the United Nations reaffirms faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women, Noting that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms the principle of the inadmissibility of discrimination and proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth therein, without distinction of any kind, including distinction based on sex, Noting that the States Parties to the International Covenants on Human Rights have the obligation to ensure the equal rights of men and women to enjoy all economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights, Considering the international conventions concluded under the auspices of the United Nations and the specialized agencies promoting equality of rights of men and women, Noting also the resolutions, declarations and recommendations adopted by the United Nations and the specialized agencies promoting equality of rights of men and women, Concerned, however, that despite these various instruments extensive discrimination against women continues to exist, Recalling that discrimination against women violates the principles of equality of rights and respect for human dignity, is an obstacle to the participation of women, on equal terms with men, in the political, social, economic and cultural lif e of their countries, hamp ers the growth of the prosperity of society and the family and makes more difficult the full development of the potentialities of women in the service of their countries and of humanity, 326Concerned that in situations of poverty women ha ve the least access to food, health, education, training and opportunities for employment and other needs, Convinced that the establishment of the new international economic order based on equity and justice will contribute significantly towards the promotion of equality between men and women, Emphasizing that the eradicatio n of apartheid, all forms of racism, racial discrimination, colonialism, neo-colonialism, aggression, foreign occupation and domination and interference in the internal affairs of States is essential to the full enjoyment of the rights of men and women, Affirming that the strengthening of international peace and security, the relaxation of international tension, mutual co-operation among all States irrespective of their social and economic systems, general and complete disarmament, in particular nuclear disarmament under strict and effective international control, the affirmation of the principles of justice, equality and mutual benefit in relations among countries and the realization of the right of peoples under alien and colonial domination and foreign occupation to self-determination and independence, as well as respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, will promote social progress and development and as a consequence will contribute to the attainment of full equality between men and women, Convinced that the full and complete developmen t of a country, the welfare of the world and the cause of peace require the maximum participation of women on equal terms with men in all fields, Bearing in mind the great contribution of wome n to the welfare of the family and to the development of society, so far not fully recogni zed, the social significance of maternity and the role of both parents in the family and in the upbringing of children, and aware that the role of women in procreation should not be a basis for discrimination but that the upbringing of children requires a sharing of responsibility between men and women and society as a whole, Aware that a change in the traditional role of me n as well as the role of women in society and in the family is needed to achieve full equality between men and women, Determined to implement the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and, for that pur pose, to adopt the meas ures required for the elimination of such discrimination in all its forms and manifestations, Have agreed on the following: 327 PART I Article I For the purposes of the present Convention, the term \"discrimination against women\" shall mean any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoymen t or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social , cultural, civil or any other field.

I worked on a farm when I first got here. We were robbed. I did the TBA training. I also do abortions. I le arnt it from my teacher. I saw many women who have troubles and want an abortion. This is why I wanted to do TBA training. Women come to me who have an unwanted pregnancy. These women have been raped or are just living with thei r boyfriends. Even married women who have poverty problems come to me. The best time to do it at three to four months. I put medicine inside the womb. For example nails , sticks, plastic pipe. I always explain to the woman what I will do and if she agrees I do it. Some women did come back to me and other go and I don't see them. I know pills and Depo and Norplant, tubal ligation and IUCD. I don't know the traditional ways. Sometimes I recommend tuba l ligation. I would like to understand more about modern methods. I would like to have this kind of skill it is very relevant to my job and I could give advise and education to the women. I take responsibility for looking after my patients. I do try to prevent danger from happening to women. For example, one woman was very weak and another had a lot of bleeding. I sent these women to the hospital. I see a lot of women who quarrel with their husbands and then they do abortions. I ask women to consider their family and talk with their husband. I advise them to take some time to think things over. In my experience if a woman cools off she can change her mind. If women are poor I don't take money from them. 347Appendix G Policy, programme and community recommendations In 2004 Dr Cynthia Maung and I wrote a report for the local NGO community which was translated into Burman. It is titled Working Our Way Back Home: Fertility and pregnancy loss at the border of Thailand (Maung & Belton, 2004). I include the specific recommendations from it aimed at policy, programme and community issues. ...issues for research and teaching \u00be In this area there is a variety of definiti ons of abortion and direct comparisons often cannot be assumed. \u00be Definitions found in 'classic' medical te xtbooks particularly from countries where induced abortion is legalised and an elective surgical or medical procedure, should be 'localised' with the experience and definiti ons of pregnancy loss found on the border. \u00be Health workers should be encouraged to record a full social and gynae/obstetric history for each woman, unless it is apparent from the sum of all past entries. \u00be Health workers appear need more time w ith patients in order to provide complete post- abortion care in the OPD. \u00be The provision of life saving post-abortion care at the hospital level uses many health resources and public health measures shoul d be implemented to prevent unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions. \u00be Burmese women's death's record ed at a local level, should also be recorded at the national level in Thailand. \u00be Health statistics and costs should be supp lied to the Union of Myanmar and they should be asked to contribute to Bu rmese women's health in Thailand. ...issues for the prevention of unwanted pregnancy \u00be Women who complain of 'weakness' before pregnancy should be offered counselling and asked if they wish to delay the next baby until they feel stronger, as they are at risk of an unsafe abortion. \u00be Women's groups, religious or welfare groups should design community support programmes to assist women with 'weakness.' \u00be Male community leaders should denounce all violence against women and assist women to live safely. 348\u00be Safe-houses where women and children can live without fear of male violence should be in all communities. \u00be Perpetrators of violence should be sancti oned in culturally appropriate ways and when power-sharing occurs in Burma marri age, assault, and rape laws should be reviewed. \u00be Trade unions should work towards equity of pay and maternity assistance for women \u00be Clinics for workers primary health care should be established in or near large factories and include contraceptiv e and sexual health advise. \u00be Public health workers should have access to work-places to offer health education. \u00be Men and women workers should have the option of separate secure accommodation. ...issues for family planning \u00be Women who have induced an abortion, who are very young, or who have five or more pregnancies should be given longer time and more support to understand the benefits of delaying the next pregnancy. \u00be Thai health workers would be greatly assi sted by employing bi-cultural health workers who can teach and explain all aspects of post-abortion care, such as nutrition, hygiene and fertility issues in Karen and Bu rman languages, as well as help doctors collect informed consent for medi cal and surgical procedures. \u00be Women and men should be informed in thei r own language that fertility will return two weeks after any kind of abortion and given a choice of temporary modern contraceptives at discharge. \u00be Women should be screened for domestic vi olence and not given male controlled methods of contraception if they have little influence in the relationship. \u00be Sterilisation should be offered to women in their own language and with time to consider the implications of a permanent method of contraception. \u00be Public health education projects should incl ude men and outline the benefits of family planning to them, for the health of their wives and children. \u00be Family planning projects should be promoted as improving the health and survival rates of women and children for a strong culture. \u00be Men's education should include the responsib ility to ensure the health of their wife through spacing babies. \u00be Young couples who need to save money for their future should be helped to delay their family. 349...issue for public health education \u00be Out-reach programmes with the assistance of Thai public health officials should be implemented. \u00be Providing educational opportunities for Burmese children is important as it gives a sense of hope for the future. \u00be Children should be offered some identity papers so they may go to school and eventually back to Burma with their parents. \u00be Organisations which offer temporary care and support of Burmese babies and children, as well as long-term adoption should be promoted. \u00be The family planning clinic at Mae Tao C linic should be expanded and extend to out- reach services. \u00be Men should be offered family planning info rmation in culturally appropriate ways by male health workers. \u00be Lay midwives should continue to be traine d but an advanced module on abortion and family planning should be developed for them. \u00be Referral systems between Mae Tao Clinic and the Thai public health need to be improved. \u00be General health data should be sent to the Myawaddy Township hospital to notify the health director of how many of hi s patients were treated in Thailand. \u00be Factual, positive, calm and informative hea lth information should be produced for the diverse Burmese community on unsafe abortion and family planning. \u00be Songs, plays, picture books, posters, radi o programmes which are interesting as well as educational should be produced. \u00be Out-reach projects in the markets, factories, construction sites and farms would reach the intended audience in Thailand. \u00be Health information products should also be sent into Burma.
