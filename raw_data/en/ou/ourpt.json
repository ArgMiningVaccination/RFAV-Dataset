It is used to treat pain in muscles, bones, joints, and associated tissues such as cartilage, tendons, and ligaments. It is a type of treatment that goes into the nervous system of the body and disorders of the bone system, without operating. In chiropractic therapy, therapists (chiropractor) press the spinal cord with the help of hands to get the bone system in the right shape without any surgery or medication. By which the body itself heals the pain.

Method of chiropractic treatment Before performing chiropractic treatment, the chiropractor therapist asks some health-related questions and also performs a chiropractor X-ray, a physical examination focused on the spine. After this, some chiropractors use the technique of twisting with strength for treatment, while some use a more gentle method in contrast. In this, the spine is slightly stirred. In addition, chiropractor therapists also use methods for treating cold or hot compresses, electric simulations (creating stimulation in cells by light current), spinal cord stretch devices, and ultrasound to heat tissues. Most of the techniques for treatment are used on a padded and adjustable table. Therapists begin treatment, usually by sitting or sleeping in a fixed position. The chiropractors then try to bend the joints more than normal by using sudden force on the joints in a reasonable range. While doing this, the sound of bones is also heard many times.
