I'm Gabriella Nelson, a degree qualified Naturopath (Bachelor Health Science, Naturopathy) practicing on the Bellarine Peninsula, Victoria. I see patients from surrounding areas such as Portarlington, Indented Head, St. Leonards, Point Lonsdale, Queenscliffe, Ocean Grove, Barwon Heads and Geelong. As well as working with Melbourne and interstate based patients via Zoom. Herbaceous began in 2009 with a clear vision of helping people to enhance their health and vitality, and to become more connected with the natural world. Herbaceous is a labour of love, and I have truly enjoyed growing it into the wonderful business it is today. I am very passionate about my craft, and I believe in a practical and down to earth approach to helping people achieve the best possible health outcomes. I draw upon the ancient wisdom of herbalism, and strongly encourage people to become aware of the importance of food as medicine. I also believe in a modern scientific, evidence based approach to treatment. I work in conjunction with other health professionals such as allied health practitioners, GPs and specialists. I also teach meditation for people of all ages.
