It is the insertion of needles just under the skin. The needles are only as thick as three or four pieces of hair. Most people find acupuncture very relaxing and that it does not hurt. It can remove negative emotions, addictions, stress, body soreness or pain, and almost any disorder or problem that upsets the vitality in the body. What is the process for acupuncture? When you come in for your first treatment, Michael will have you fill out several health forms. He will then go over them with you to know how to treat you. He will most likely be treating you for several ailments at a time. Michael will give you a gown to put on, and the treatment will start on the back of your body. He will insert the needles into various acupuncture points, which are helpful to your specific needs. You will then relax for about twenty minutes while listening to very relaxing music. Michael repeats the process on the front of your body. What can it help? Acupuncture can be a beneficial treatment for many health conditions, including addictions. It can help ease cravings, reduce stress, and detoxify the liver. After only a few treatments, most clients report better sleep and a more stable and positive emotional state. There is a standard protocol treatment for addiction that is personalized with specific acupuncture points to help every organ and system for that individual. Addictions can include but not be limited to drugs, alcohol, tobacco products, caffeine, and food addictions (sugar, chocolate, and carbohydrates). Treatments for allergies have both long and short-term results. Treatments can immediately decongest the sinuses while reducing or eliminating your reactions to the allergen over time. Today, many people suffer from body pain from sports injuries, car accidents, arthritis, fibromyalgia, etc. Michael uses the 8 Principle acupuncture, which uses symptomatic treatments to reduce physical pain or eliminate it. Most illnesses do have symptomatic treatments or recipes of points, which are used in combination to help treat making disease symptoms better. Acupuncture is treating the whole person to a deeper level so that the symptoms go away and the subtle causes of these symptoms. Most patients who have acupuncture treatments continuously improve with no ill side effects. Acupuncture is also an excellent treatment for people with negative emotions, anger, and grief problems. There are specific treatment protocols for many emotional states, including fears and phobias. Many people claim that their stress level drops, and they sleep better after only a few treatments.", "sitename": null, "date": "2018-01-01", "cleaned_text": "What is acupuncture?
