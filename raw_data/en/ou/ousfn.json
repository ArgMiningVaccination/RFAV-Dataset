We are committed to ensuring that the educational experience of our students is intellectually challenging and provides the skills needed to become a leader in public health. We are very proud of the graduate programs that we offer as part of our commitment to excellence in teaching, research and service to achieve population health improvements. First, the Master of Public Health (MP H) Program is accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH), the only accrediting body for public health programs and schools in the United States . CEPH is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education, to accredit and assure that the school or program has met accepted standards established by and with the public health profession. PPH is one of 1 98 CEPH accredited schools and programs to date. In addition, the PPH is a founding member of the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health (ASPPH) . The ASPPH is the voice of accredited public health e ducation. Second, the Master of Health Administration (MHA) Program has achieved Candidacy Status for national accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education and is the only MHA program offered by a SUNY campus at thi s time . The MHA Program is a participant in the American College of Healthcare Executives (ACHE) Higher Education Network (HEN) . The MHA Program also is an active member of The Association of University Programs in Health Administration (AUPHA) . Third, the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Population Health and Clinical Outcomes and the Master of Science (MS) in Epidemiology and Clinical Research are both mentor -matched research training program s for individuals seeking a career as a scientist in this field of inquiry. PPH faculty and collaborating clinician scientists at Stony Brook Medicine provide a mentored research training experience and coursework leading to the design, conduct and successful defense of a dissertation project (PhD) or research practicu m (MS) . The PPH is located in the Stony Brook University Health Sciences Center at Stony Brook Medicine , the only academic health sciences center on Long Island. The Health Sciences Center includes the School s of Medicine , Nursing, Dental Medicine, Socia l Welfare, and Health Technology and Management, in addition to the Stony Brook University Hospital. Together, we generate collaborative research and practice -based innovations that have contributed to an improved quality of life for many individuals and communities . Stony Brook Medicine also is a partner in scientific research with the Brookhaven National Laboratory , Mount Sinai Health System and has expanded to include Stony Brook Southampton . A unique feature of Stony Brook Medicine is its emphasis on multidisciplinary education and research combined with community service . The PPH shares this emphasis . The Program's educational , service, and research initiatives emphasize an ecological understanding of health promotion and disease prevention. In keepin g with this orientation, o ur Program draws its faculty from many disciplines representing the clinical, social, and behavioral sciences, as well as the humanities. We believe our graduates have the skills to design, implement, and evaluate programs for population health improveme nts in a variety of settings, to inform and use evidence -based interventions and to translate research into beneficial programs and policies. The PPH offers a stimulating learning environment for full - and part -time students in our Advanced Graduate Certificates, MPH and joint -degrees, MHA, MS, and PhD programs. Our students are inquisitive and passionate about making a difference in public health . We seek applicants to our program s who are academically competitive and likely to be successful in a rigorous and professional graduate program.

The Program offers the Master of Public Health (MPH) degree , the Master of Health Administration (MHA) degree , the MS in Epidemiology and Clinical Research, the PhD in Population Health and Clinical Outcomes Research degree, and there also are a number of combined and concurrent programs available, as well as Advanced Graduate Certificates. The Program advocates a population health approach to public health . The hallmarks of population health include an ecological understandi ng of the determinants of health and a systems approach to solving health problems; emphasis on proactively stabilizing and improving health among all populations; and insistence on accountability, evidence -based practice, and continuous performance improv ement. The population health approach requires multi -disciplinary collaboration among scholars in the social, behavioral, clinical, and basic sciences and humanities . Furthermore, it incorporates the development of comprehensive health information systems, and the use of advanced analytical tools to examine health problems and evaluate solutions . The population health orientation is consistent with the traditions of public health and with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations for public health ed ucation, although it expands upon them. The IOM (2002) recommends these areas of action for those who work in public health: \"Adopt ing a population health approach that considers the multiple determi nants of health; Strengthening the governmental public h ealth infrastructure; Building a new generation of intersectoral partnerships; Developing systems of accountability; Making evidence the foundation of decision ___________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ August 2020 Pg. 9 making and the measure of success; Enhancing and facilitating communication within the public he alth system. \"1 The populatio n health orientation of the Program also is compatible with the educational philosophy of Stony Brook Medicine which includes the five schools of the Health Sciences (Medicine, Nursing, Dental Medicine, Social Welfare, and Health Technology and Manag ement,) and the Program in Public Health . The Health Sciences Center emphasiz es the need for interdisciplinary education and collaboration, and recogniz es the critical importance of training health profession als to work together. T he PPH values a collegial atmosphere at an early stage in a student's education and fosters an environment of mutual respect among students who represent diverse backgrounds and competencies . The emphasis of the PPH reflects the changing environment in which public health practice occurs, and recent thinking about how to respond to these changes. Public health retains its distinct role as the specialty emphasizing prevention, with the object of its work being populations, in contrast to the historical ro le of medicine, dentistry, and other clinical disciplines that focus on healing, with the object of their work being individuals. Since the 1980s, the three main functions of public health were identified as assessment, policy development, and assurance. However, the knowledge and skills needed to perform these functions optimally has changed radically in light of advances in information technology and increased knowledge about the determinants of health and disease. These changes are occurring at all leve ls of inquiry - from the micro (genetics and microbiology) through the macro (the social and behavioral sciences). Changing political, economic, demographic, and social conditions make the application of new knowledge and technologies all the more importan t. As one Institute of Medicine (2002)1 report states, \"The beginning of the twenty first century provided an early preview of t he health challenges the United States will confront in the coming decades. The system s and entities that protect and promote t he public 's health, already challenged by problems like obesity, toxic environments, a large uninsured population and health disparities, must also confront emerging threats, such as antimicrobial resistance and bio -terrorism. The social, cultural, and glo bal context s of the nation's health are also undergoing rapid and dramatic change. Scientific and technical advances, such as genomics and informatics, extend the limit s of knowledge and human potential more rapidly than their implications can be absorbed and acted upon. At the same time, people, products, and germs migrate and the nation's demographics are shifting in ways that challenge public and private resources.\" 1 Institute of Medicine. The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press, 2002. Recent, influential reports regarding public health education suggest ways to address t he evolving training needs of public health professionals. These publications include one report issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - Public Health's Infrastructure - and three reports from the Institute of Medicine - Who Will Keep th e Public Healthy?; The Future of Public Health in the 21st Century; and Crossing the Quality Chasm. The recommendations in these reports challenge new public health programs to train public health leaders to be boundary spanners - able to use the new tools and knowledge available in order to formulate solutions to the complex public health problems facing us. These recent recommendations regarding public health can be synthesized as follows. In addition to the traditional knowledge, including epidemiology and biostatistics, public health leaders need: 1. An ecological understanding of the causes of poor health including, social, behavioral, environmental, occupational, demographic, policy, economic, and genetic factors as well as the interrelationship of these factors; 2. A thorough understanding and appreciation of the cultural heterogeneity of populations, its impact on public health initiatives, and tools to deal with issues arising from cultural heterogeneity; 3. A thorough understanding of the current system of addressing poor health - medical, dental, and public health - including organization, financing, regulation, accessibility, quality, effectiveness, and efficiency; 4. An orientation toward policy, as well as programmatic, solutions to public health probl ems and the skills to assess, develop, implement, and evaluate policies; 5. An orientation favoring evidence -based decision - making and the skills to develop evidence for public health decision -making including study design and analysis of data; 6. An orientati on favoring accountability and continuous quality improvement in public health and the skills needed to measure accountability and assess performance; 7. Informatics skills including application of information technology to obtain, organize, and maintain use ful data for public health decision - making; 8. Leadership skills including the conceptual and analytical tools to prioritize problems and make sound decisions. Instilling a population health orientation and fostering the skills necessary to act upon it prov ide the Program's graduates with the ability to meet the basic needs of public health today - defined as provision of the Essential Public Health Services and the three core public health functions (assessment and monitoring; formulating public policies; a nd assuring access to appropriate and cost -effective care) - as well as to expand the work of public health to achieve its broad mission \"to fulfill ___________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ August 2020 Pg. 10 society's interest in assuring conditions in which people can be healthy.\"2 MISSION, VISI ON, VALU ES: MPH DEGREE PROGRAM The mission of the Master of Public Health degree program is to train the next generation of public health practitioners, scholars and leaders so as to promote improvem ents in the health of all populations - including the elimination of health disparities across the life -course through excellence in education, research, community engagement, service and empowerment locally, nationally, and globally. The vision of the PPH's Master of Public Health degree program is to improve the health of all people on Long Island and globally through leading and collaborating on impactful public health research, training competent public healt h professionals and developing future leaders, and engaging with diverse communities. The specific goals a nd measurable objectives developed by the faculty (with feedback and contributions from our public health community and constituents) of the Master of Public Health degree program are contained in Table 1 of this bulletin (pg 34). The Program 's website als o contains this table with all associated measurable objective s, at: http://publichealth.stonybrookmedicine.edu/about/visionmissi onandgoals To achieve its general educational , research, and community benefit goals, the Master of Public Health degree program trains public health professionals who: 1. Understand the multiple determinants of health and illness including the social, behavioral, environmental, demographic, o ccupational, policy, economic, genetic, and health care determinants ; and 2. Appreciate the need for interdisciplinary collaboration in order to understand population health problems and develop optimal strategies to address them; and , 3. Have the strongest an alytical, conceptual, and communication skills in order to facilitate development and implementation of optimal strategies for addressing population health problems.

Graduates will be prepared to contribute immediately as managers to support the delivery of high quality care throughout the health services sector. Master of Health A dministration Degree Program Vision The Vision of the MHA Program is to be recognized as one of the premier health management graduate programs in our nation by delivering an innovative and high quality health management curriculum in collaboration with ou r multifaceted stakeholders who are committed to excellence in teaching, scholarship and service in population health and healthcare. Master of Health Administration Degree Program Values The Values of the MHA Program are: Community Engagement Scholarly Excellence Professionalism Collaboration Innovation Continuous Improvement The specific goals and measurable objectives developed by the faculty (with feedback and contributions from our health administration community and constituents) of the Master of Health Administration degree program are contained in Table 2 of this bulletin (pg 36 ) MHA ACCREDITATION CANDIDACY The MHA Progra m is currently in Candidacy Status for national accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Educat ion (CAHME) , and conducted a self -study year from July 1, 2019 through July 1, 2020. The Program will host a site visit with CAHME site visitors in October 2020, at which time CAHME will also evaluate the MPH in Health Policy and Management for dual accreditation by CAHME (in addition to its existing CEPH accreditation). The MHA curriculum uses an adapted version of the National Center for Healthcare Leadership (NCHL) Healthcare Leadership Competency Model. The primary domains of the MHA /MPH HPM Concentration Competency Model include assessment of student capabilities at a beginner, intermediate, or advanced level in four key areas at multiple points througho ut the curriculum. These key domains include competency assessment in: Management Functions Health Systems and Policies Leadership and Professionalism Business and Analytic Skills ADMISSION TO THE MPH AND MHA DEGREE PROGRAM S Although admission requirement s are rigorous, the PPH aims to develop camaraderie, cooperation, and cohesiveness among students in each cohort. For this reason, admission to the MPH and MHA degree p rogram s is during the Fall semester only. We are from different socioeconomic, educati onal, racial, and ethnic backgrounds who can provide special contributions to the field of public health, health management and the Program. Admission processes consider the potential contribution of each MPH and MHA applicant to the student body and the p ublic health or health management field. Applicants are evaluated on academic achievement, leadership potential, professional accomplishment, and personal attributes. Excellent written and oral communication skills are expected. Fluency in more than one la nguage is not required for admission, but it is becoming increasingly desirable for the practice of public health and health administration. The PPH reserves the right to limit MPH and MHA class size in order to maintain a faculty/student ratio that ensu res a high quality academic program. Therefore, admission to the MPH and MHA programs is highly selective , and all qualified applicants may not be accepted. The degree program s are open to students from all academic disciplines. MPH s tudents can select fr om one of three concentrations : Community Health, Health Analytics , and Health Policy and Management . A Generalist concentration , currently in progr ess for review by SUNY, is also available to a select group of students (primarily clinicians and clinical students). The admission requirements for the MPH and MHA Program s are: 1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university with a 3.0 GPA or better. Admitted students usually have GPAs that are higher than 3.0. The major must have an equivalent at the State University of New York (SUNY). ___________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ August 2020 Pg. 12 2.

ADVANCED GRADUATE CERTIFICATE S Health Communication The Advanced Graduate Certificate in Health Communication is offered as collaboration between the PPH and the School of Journalism. This 18 -credit p rogram is designed for members of the public health workforce, healthcare professionals, master's and doctoral candidates, and media professionals in journalism, marketing, public relations, and communications. The certificate prepares students to be effe ctive communicators, bridging the gap between medicine and public health and the world -at-large and providing the skills necessary to communicate health -related issues to the public, directly or through the press. Graduates will likely find employment in academic settings, research facilities, public health organizations, and healthcare institutions. Graduate s may also serve as health communications experts in media, consulting, and public relations settings. Working professionals will gain communication skills that help them advance within their respective public health, healthcare, or media professions. Health Education and Promotion The Advanced Graduate Certificate in Health Education and Promotion is a 25-credit program that will enhance students' knowledge, experiences, and skills in health education and promotion and positively impact their chosen career pathway in public health. It is anticipated that graduates will find or enhance employment in academic settings, research facilities, public hea lth organizations, or health care institutions. In addition, courses in this certificate address the health education competencies that are the basis for the nationally recognized Certified Health Education Specialist (CHES) certification offered by the Na tional Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. Students completing this certificate will obtain some of the credits necessary for eligibility to take the exam. Notes for MPH applicants and students also pursuing a certificate program : Studen ts pursuing either Advanced Graduate Certificate concurrently with the MPH at Stony Brook may use approved courses to count towards both the certificate and degree. Students who have earned the Advanced Graduate Certificate prior to matriculation in the MP H will be held to the 12 credit rule outlined in the Non - Matriculated Student s section of this bulletin (page 20. Students who have completed the MPH prior to acceptance into the Advanced Graduate Certificate will not be able to count MPH credits towards the certificate. In this circumstance, students may take different courses than those counted towards the MPH degree.

Visit our website for current information regarding available funding. https://publichealth.stonybrookmedicine.edu/phcor/fund ing PhD CURRIULUM AND REQUIREMENTS The Population Health and Clinical Outcomes Research (PHCOR) program offers one doctoral degree with two possible concentrations: Population Health or Clinical Outcomes Research. Core requirements are the same for both concentrations. Students specialize through the different concentration requirements. With advisor approval, students may tailor their degree to their specific interests via the selection of elective course offerings in departments such as Molecular Geneti cs, Molecular and Cellular Biology, the Graduate Program in Public Health, Technology and Society, Pharmacologic Sciences, Sociology or Psychology. Population Health The population health specialization will focus on understanding the community and the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of public health and community -based interventions. It will emphasize methodology in observational study design, determinants of population health, and development of evidence -based public health practice including ef ficiency, effectiveness, and access studies. Students will identify a cognate area that provides theoretical and/or methodological depth related to a population health problem and its determinants. A cognate area may be multi - disciplinary or discipline -specific. As an example of a multi -disciplinary approach, a student might develop a family violence cognate through the selection of courses in psychology, sociology, public policy, and social welfare. Another example of a potential cognate area might be heal th communications, with courses found primarily in journalism or psychology. Clinical Outcomes Research The clinical outcomes specialization will provide students with the tools to enhance preventive or chronic care strategies, and analyze the patient car e outcomes for clinical disciplines. Moreover, the students within the clinical outcomes specialization will be able to formulate policies, advance clinical practice, or identify patient -based opportunities to improve medical care. As an example of a multi -disciplinary approach, biomarkers for cancer may become a cognate emphasis with advanced courses selected from the graduate programs in Experimental Molecular and Cellular Biology or Molecular Genetics. Another cognate area might relate to evaluating the impact of e -health initiatives upon ischemic heart disease medication management, with advanced courses selected from the departments of Technology and Society or Pharmacologic Sciences. Additional Requirements In addition to the core and concentration re quirements, doctoral students will be required to pass a preliminary written examination, submit and have approved a dissertation proposal, complete a dissertation, and submit two publishable manuscripts. Comprehensive Paper Students will write a paper t hat does not present primary data analyses (i.e. systematic review, meta -analysis, propos e new model or theory framework , etc.). The goal is a publishable paper (not a requirement to actually publish). One section/chapter of the paper must connect the topi c of the paper within the br oader context of public health. Students will submit a topic (brief description, including explanation of novelty, plus annotated bibliography) to a three person committee (likely but not required to be the same as the disserta tion com mittee). This commit tee should include the primary research mentor and two others, at least one of whom must be PPH core faculty. If approved, they will have four months to turn in their paper. Failure to meet this deadline will result in a wait of one full calendar year before the paper can be su bmitted for approval. Dissertation The most important requirement for the Ph.D. degree is the dissertation, which must be an original scholarly investigation that meets the standards in the field for schol arly publications. Following the successful completion of the Preliminary Examination, students may be advanced to candidacy upon successful completion of all degree requirements of the Graduate School and program, other than the graduate ___________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ August 2020 Pg. 18 seminars and the dissertation requirements. The Dean of the Graduate School confers this status upon recommendation from the Doctoral Program Director. Students must advance at least one year prior to the dissertation defense. A proposal for the dissertation must be prepa red, orally defended, and approved by the student's research supervisor or supervisory committee - appointed by the Doctoral Program Director in consultation with the student. The proposal will synthesize the literature on an important topic in population health or clinical outcomes research, and identify gaps in the literature that clearly demonstrate the importance for the student's planned dissertation research. The topic should be broad enough to allow for the preparation of at least two publishable pap ers in peer -reviewed journals. The makeup of the dissertation committee includes the dissertation supervisor (faculty mentor), defense chairperson, a third member from the program, and at least one person outside of the program or University. To avoid a ny potential perception of a conflict of interest, the student's dissertation supervisor (faculty mentor) will not be able to chair their dissertation committee. Preliminary research to develop a dissertation topic will normally begin in the second year of study and the third year will be mainly devoted to developing and refining the doctoral research. Seminars organized by the program related to research in progress (i.e., a formal research in progress presentation) will provide an opportunity for studen ts to present their thesis material to other students and interested faculty. Upon approval of the research supervisor or chair of the supervisory committee (and approval of the Graduate Program Director), a public presentation with a defense of the disser tation will be scheduled. Additional requirements for the dissertation may be found in the Graduate School Bulletin under \"Degree Requirements .\" Practicum in Teaching Doctoral students will be provided with teaching opportunities and are expected to devel op their teaching skills through the \"Practicum in Teaching ,\" an advanced two semester sequence completed after the Preliminary Examination has been passed. Teaching opportunities for doctoral students will include undergraduate and graduate teaching.

PROGRAM AND UNIVERSITY POL ICIES GRADING The following grading system is used in the Program in Public Health : A (4.0), A - (3.67), B+ (3.33), B (3.00), B - (2.67), C+ (2. 33), C (2.00), C - (1.67), and F (0.00). Unless specified differently in the course syllabus, course grades on a 100 point scale are: A (93 -100); A - (90-92); B+ (87 (83 - (77 -79); C (73 -76); C - (70-72); F (69 or lower). In order to encourage students to develop excellent writing skills, course grades will reflect the quality of writing in course assignments. The specific policy on grading the quality of writing will be the prerogative of the course instructor, and it must be explained in the course syllabus. ACADEMIC PROGRESS & ACADEMIC STANDING Students must maintain a B average ( 3.0) in the ir Core and a B average (3.0) in the ir Concentration courses . All electives must be listed as selectives or approved by the student's faculty advisor in order to count toward completion of the degree. In evaluating a student's standing, the Program will not include electives in the GPA that are not listed as selectives or approved by the faculty advisor. When a student's cumulative graduate GPA falls below B (3.0) for grades earned in courses numbered 500 and above taken at Stony Brook, the student shall be placed on probation. If the student 's overall GPA has been raised to B (3.0) by the end of the next semester of enrollment after being first notified of probation, the student will be returned to regular status. Students may be on probation for a maximum of two semesters. A student on aca demic probation who fails to achieve a 3.0 cumulative GPA by the end of the second semester on probation will usually not be permitted to re - enroll. A student enrolled part time who has accumulated six semester credits with a cumulative average below 3.0 will have two semesters, or six additional credits (whichever comes first) to bring their cumulative GPA to 3.0. Temporary grades (I and NR), missing grades and those grades for which no numerical equivalents are defined (P, S, U, and R) are not calculate d in determining the eligibility for academic probation. The degree requirements are rigorous, ___________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ August 2020 Pg. 27 and students must be able to devote sufficient time to meet the performance standards required. MPH and MHA : Part-time students typically complete the program in 3 years. The Program a lso accommodates full -time study leading to completion of the degree in as short a time as 22 months . PhD: For full -time students , minimum time to completion is 3 years. Academic Standing Procedure A. The Program Director will se nd a Notification of Academic Standing to all students facing academic probation or dismissal. The letter will also contain the procedure for requesting an Academic Standing Hearing . The letter must be sent via U.S. mail with return receipt requested, or Federal Express with signature required, or hand delivered. If mailed, the letter will be sent to the student's mailing address indicated in SOLAR. B. The Notification of Academic Standing will be sent to full-time students at the end of the fall and spring semesters, following the policy outlined above . C. The Notification of Academic Standing will be sent to part-time students after the completion of 6 credits and then the subsequent 6 credits, following the policy outlined above . Any appeal of academic stand ing must follow the procedure outlined here: The student will have three days to submit an appeal in writing to the director . The letter must include reasons for the appeal. The Committee on Academic Standing ( composed of the Affiliated Program Director a nd the Associate Director for Academic Affairs ) will determine whether to uphold or reverse the academic standing decision . A meeting will be scheduled between the student and the committee to inform them of their decision. The faculty member who initiall y submitted the charge may choose whether to be present. ENROLLMENT NOTIFICATION POLICY Students must enroll in at least one course per semester (Fall and Spring) unless they complete a Change of Enrollment Form and submit this form to the Assistant Director for Student Affairs . A Leave of Absence (LOA) of more than one year requires a written justification that must be approved by the Director of the Program in Public Health. When a student wishes to return to active status after a LOA, a Term Activ ation Form must be completed and submitted to the Assistant Director for Student Affairs in order to enroll in courses. TIME AND LOCATION OF COURSES Synchronous courses are taught on the Health Sciences Center campus and are offered in the late afternoon o r early evening. COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT (MPH and MHA ONLY) Each course in the MPH and MHA degree programs aims to develop specific Competencies among students through a set of Learning Objectives. In order to assess how well we are conveying these Compet encies, we require students to complete Competency Assessment survey s at various points across the curriculum. Students are assessed on their competency development by other stakeholders (faculty, preceptors, mentors, employers, etc.) periodically as well . All information from the Competency Assessment surveys is kept strictly confidential and is not, in any way, used to evaluate a student's academic progress in pursuit of the degree. This information is analyzed only for the purpose of improving the MPH and MHA program s and to inform our accrediting bodies, the Council of Education for Public Health (CEPH) and Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education (CAHME) of our progress . The PPH reserves the right to withhold grades or prevent su bsequent course registration for students who do not complete assessment surveys . COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT (MHA ONLY) The MHA Program aims to develop student competency in skills and knowledge areas specific to the health management field. Competencies are ma pped to relevant courses throughout the curriculum, and, in turn, to relevant learning objectives and assignments. In order to assess student s' development toward competency attainment, students will encounter a variety of assessment , including but not lim ited to : pre- and post -course self-assessments, and periodic faculty assessments, preceptor assessments, mentor assessments, and peer assessments. Competency attainment is measured using a scale ranging from \"Beginner,\" to \"Intermediate,\" and \"Advanced.\" Students and other stakeholders (faculty, preceptors, mentors) will be familiar with the competency model 's terminology and definitions, allowing and encouraging them to assess themselves and others honestly. The MHA Program aims to prepare all graduates of the program to attain at least intermediate proficiency in all competencies upon completion of the degree. Competency attainment is measured separate ly from course grades and is intended to guide students and graduates toward lifelong learning and contin uous improvement, whi le simultaneously informing the P rogram of its efficacy in conveying these competencies. The PPH reserves the right to withhold grades or prevent subsequent course registration for students who do not complete any required competency assessment surveys. E-PORTFOLIO USE AND REQUIREMENTS ___________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ August 2020 Pg. 28 Digication is an E -Portfolio system used to collect important documents and assignments throughout the Program. MHA and MPH students use provided templates to upload various assignments and other docume ntation . Completion of Digication requirements as instructed by PPH faculty and staff is considered a degree requirement. The PPH reserves the right to withhold grades or prevent subsequent course registration for students who do not complete Digication re quirements. CREDIT TRANSFERS All MPH core courses must be taken at Stony Brook University, unless an equivalent was taken in an accredited public health program with a grade of B or better within the last five years. All MPH concentration courses are to be taken at Stony Brook University, unless an equivalent course, with a grade of B or better, was taken at an approved graduate program in the past five years and transfer of credits is approved by the Assistant Director for Student Affairs. All MHA courses must be taken at Stony Brook University, unless an equivalent course was taken and completed with a grade of B or better within the last five years , demonstrates equivalent competency coverage, and is approved by the MHA Program Director and Chair of the PPH Curriculum Committee . The student must request a credit transfer and complete the necessary forms. In all respects, the PPH follows Stony Brook's Transfer of Credit policy as stated in the HSC Bulletin: \"Graduate candidates may petition the school to accept credits from another institution toward his or her degree. The school has the responsibility of deciding on the applicability of credits to the specific program. Normally, transfer credits will be limited to no more than 6 credits.\" CHALLENGE EXAM POLICY & PROCEDURE (MPH and MHA ONLY) Stony Brook University has established a challenge program that permits matriculated undergraduates and graduates to earn advanced placement credit and course credit by taking examinations instead of traditional course work. No more than five courses (including credit from advanced placement examinations) can be credited to any student from challenge examinations, and no prerequisite for a course already passed may be included. Credit by examination does not count towar d the University's residence requirement and cannot be used to satisfy total credits necessary to qualify for degrees with distinction (From HSC Bulletin, page 31). Students who have previously completed coursework that duplicates a course in the curricul um may request a Challenge Exam for that course, if the previous coursework cannot be transferred into the program. This should be a rare occurrence, but it provides flexibility when necessary. Examples of these situations are: Students who have taken courses that have already counted toward another degree. Students who have taken non -credit bearing courses, which cannot be transferred into and counted toward the degree. A Challenge Exam can only be taken once. Students who do not pass a Challenge Exa m must take the regular course. Challenge Exam Procedure 1. The student completes the student section of the Challenge Exam Application and provides the application to the Assistant Director for Student Affairs . 2. The Assistant Director for Student Affairs validates eligibility to challenge. This may require the student to provide a transcript and/or course syllabus for review. 3. If approved, the student brings the completed Challenge Exam Application with a check for payment to the Bursar's Office. 4. Checks are m ade payable to \"SUNY Stony Brook.\" The cost is $65 per graduate credit. 5. The student returns the completed Challenge Exam Application with a copy of the Bursar's Office receipt attached to the Assistant Director for Student Affairs . 6. The student schedules a n appointment with the Course Instructor responsible for the Challenge Exam to discuss the exam requirements. 7. When the Challenge Exam is complete and graded, the faculty member administering the exam submits a letter to the Assistant Director for Student A ffairs indicating the grade received. 8. The Assistant Director for Student Affairs forwards a copy of the faculty letter, Challenge Exam Application, and Bursar's Office receipt to the HSC Office of Student Services, which posts the grade to the transcript. Special Note: Any student who receives the MD/MPH waiver does not have to pay for the credits at the Bursar. However, all paperwork must be received prior to taking a Challenge Exam. TIME LIMITS Not including granted leaves of absence, all requirements towards the MPH degree, the BS/MPH degree, the MBA/MPH degree , the MPH/MAPP degree, MSW/MPH degree , MPH/MS in Nutrition degree, and the MHA degree must be completed within five years from matriculation in the Program. The MD/MPH joint degree and the DDS/MPH concurrent degrees can take six years. The time limit for a doctoral degree is seven years for a student who has a closely related previous graduate degree or 24 credits of graduate study in such a degree program. For all other students, the time limit fo r a doctoral degree is seven years after completion of 24 graduate level credits at Stony Brook University. GRADUAT ION The PPH has only one graduation ceremony (convocation), which is held each year in the Spring. This ceremony serves all students who gra duate from the Program during the year. ___________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ August 2020 Pg. 29 MPH and MHA students: It is the responsibility of students to notify the University through SOLAR of their intent to graduate. In addition, students should be tracking their academic progress to ensure that they are meeting all University and Program requirements for graduation. PhD students: PhD students are responsible for meeting all degree requirements outlined by the program and by the Graduate School. For information regarding the graduation process for Ph D candidates visit http://grad.stonybrook.edu/academics/graduation_information. php. ADVISING POLICY (MPH and MHA ONLY) Each student is assigned a Faculty Advisor upon matricul ation into the program. Whenever possible, for MPH students, the advisor will be a faculty member in the student's concentration: Health Analytics , Community Health, or Health Policy and Management . Whenever possible, MHA students are matched to a facult y advisor within their specified field of interest. The student may change advisors at any time with the consent of the Director of the PPH. In addition, students who change their MPH concentration will be assigned, or may select, a Faculty Advisor in th e new concentration. Faculty Advisors meet with their advisees discuss students' progress through the program, assess academic growth, and provide guidance with independent study and Practicum /Integrative Experience projects. The Faculty Advisor also discusses the students' expectations for the future and acts as a touchstone if the student is having problems. For MHA: Students are required to attend at least one faculty/career advising session per year and one academic advising session per year with the Assistant Director for Student Affairs. For MPH: Students are required to meet with their Faculty Advisor twice a year, typically a t the end of the Fall and Spring semesters and can be conducted in person or by phone, whichever is preferred by both the student and Faculty Advisor. At specified times throughout the year, s tudents will be contacted by the Program to schedule an appointment with their Faculty Advisor. At other times, s tudents should contact their Faculty Advisor directly to make app ointments. GENERAL INQUIRIES Questions and concerns about course offerings, plans of study, degree requirements, deadlines, practicum requirements, and procedural issues including registration, academic standing, leaves of absence, change of concentratio n, and graduation should be directed to the Assistant Director for Student Affairs (444-2074). Questions about classroom assignments, text books, and class schedules should be directed to the Assistant to the Director/Administrative Coordinator (444-9396 ). Questions related to student employment, research assistan tships, scholarships, and other matters related to finance , should be directed to the Assistant to the Director for Administration and Finance (444-1120). All course specific concerns should fi rst be directed to the instructor as appropriate, and if not resolved to the satisfaction of the student, the concerns should be brought to the attention of the appropriate degree program Director (for the MPH, to Dr. Benz Scott; for the MHA, to Dr. Agris; for the PhD, to Dr. Smith). FORMAL GRIEVANCES If a specific concern brought to the attention of the appropriate degree program Director is not able to find resolution, the concern will be brought to the Academic Integrity and Grievance and Appeals Commit tee. If a student is not satisfied with the PPH program's handling of a concern or incident, he/she may contact the Stony Brook University Ombudsman's Office with a formal grievance. The Stony Brook University Ombuds Office provides an alternative channel for confidential, impartial, independent and informal dispute resolution services for the entire University community. They provide a safe place to voice your concerns and explore options for productive conflict management and resolution. The Ombuds Offic e is a source of confidential advice and information about University policies and procedures and helps individuals and groups address university -related conflicts and concerns. For more information visit: http://www.stonybrook.edu/ombuds/ Students may also bring concerns or incidents to the Vice Provost of Graduate Education who may forward the compliant to the Stony Brook University Graduate Council Appeals Committee (GCAC) for review and recommendations for resolution. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY Intellectual honesty is a cornerstone of all academic and scholarly work. Therefore, the offenses of plagiarism and cheating are considered by the PPH to be grave violations of academic integ rity. Students are required to take the Plagiarism and Cheating Tutorial (followed by a brief self - test) in our Orientation Program. After the tutorial, students must sign an official document attesting that they understand both 1) what cheating and plagia rism are and 2) the consequences for cheating or plagiarizing while pursuing their MPH , PhD , or certificate program at Stony Brook. Any student found to have cheated or plagiarized on an assignment will fail the assignment on which they cheated or plagiari zed. The following represents the Program in Public Health's Four Part Policy on Cheating or Plagiarism. ___________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ August 2020 Pg. 30 1. Education : Our students undergo an educational experience, taught or administered by a core faculty member of Public Health in orientation, to define and explain plagiarism and cheating and to clarify the consequences of engaging in cheating or plagiarism. Students may additionally be required to go through a more comprehensive educational experience about cheating and plagiarism, for example in the req uired HPH 501, \"Introduction to the Research Process.\" 2. Definitions : The Program in Public Health distinguishes instances of blatant or deliberate cheating and plagiarism from unintentional misuse of sources. Our policy is designed to address unambiguous cases of plagiarism or cheating. The following definitions are used to make a distinction between cheating, plagiarism, and misuse of sources. A. Cheating : Cheating is intentional fraud for the purpose of improving a grade or obtaining course credits, bu t includes all behavior intended to gain unearned academic advantage. Cheating also includes either helping or attempting to help another person cheat. Examples of Cheating Copying from another student's test Allowing another student to copy from your tes t Using unauthorized notes or \"crib sheets\" during an exam or using your cell phone to text answers to other students during an exam Informing students in later sections of the content of an exam Using unauthorized assistance in a take -home exam (e.g. work ing with another student when the instructor has not explicitly authorized it, or using reference works when that is not permitted by the instructor) B. Plagiarism: Plagiarism occurs when a student attempts to deceive by using someone else's language, ide as, or other original (not common -knowledge) material without acknowledging its source (see: The Council of Writing Program Administrators. \"Defining and Avoiding Plagiarism: The WPA Statement on Best Practices.\" WPA Position Statements and Resolutions Jan . 2003, 12 Feb. 2004 http://www.wpacouncil.org/positions/WPAplagiarism.pdf ) Examples of Plagiarism Downloading an entire paper or sections of a paper from a website without acknowledge ment Copying sentences or paragraphs from a book or website without citing them, without using quotation marks when appropriate, or both Turning in a paper someone else has written Having someone else write a portion of your paper (even a sentence) C. Mis use of Sources : Misuse of sources is defined as \"carelessly or inadequately citing ideas and words borrowed from another source. . . . Ethical writers make every effort to acknowledge sources fully and appropriately in accordance with the contexts and genr es of their writing. A student who attempts (even if clumsily) to identify and credit his or her source, but who misuses a specific citation format or incorrectly uses quotation marks or other forms of identifying material taken from other sources, has NOT plagiarized. Instead, such a student [has] failed to cite and document sources appropriately\" (Council of Writing Program Administrators. \"Defining and Avoiding Plagiarism: The WPA Statement on Best Practices.\" While misuse of sources is not plagiarism, i t is still represents an error in citation. As such, depending on the context and particular professor involved, a student may still lose points or be downgraded on an assignment in which he or she has misused a source or has failed to properly cite in an instance that has determined not to be cheating or plagiarism. WPA Position Statements and Resolutions Jan. 2003. 12 Feb. 2004; Caps our own emphasis. See http://www.wpacouncil.org/posi tions/WPAplagiarism.pdf .) 3. Consequences for Cheating or Plagiarism : A. First offense: Any student who has deliberately or blatantly cheated or plagiarized on any graded assignment will at a minimum fail the assignment and at a maximum fail the course. Addi tionally, students may be required to attend remediate coursework or submit written assignments on cheating and/or plagiarism. All charges and consequences will be recorded in the student's academic file. B. Second offense: Any student found to have delibera tely or blatantly cheated or plagiarized on a second assignment for any course taken en route to their degree should expect to be expelled from the Program in Public Health. 4. Process: A. The faculty member of Public Health or instructor of a Public Health g raduate course who accuses a student of plagiarism will present evidence of the infraction in hand to the Academic Integrity, Grievance and Appeals Committee. . B. The student will be made aware of the charge by the committee and will have three days to submit any additional evidence to the committee in writing. C. The committee will confer about whether or not plagiarism or cheating has indeed occurred. This is intended to confirm that the identified offense actually rises to the level of \"deliberate\" cheating or plagiarism. D. If the committee determines that plagiarism or cheating has occurred and was deliberate, the ___________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ August 2020 Pg. 31 faculty member who brought the charge is expected to recommend a suitable consequence within the parameters mentioned above. The ultimate decision o n consequences , however, rests with the committee. E. A meeting will be scheduled between the student and the committee to inform them of their decision. The faculty member who initially submitted the charge may choose whether to be present. For more comp rehensive information on academic integrity, please refer to the academic judiciary website at http://www.stonybrook.edu/uaa/academicjudiciary/ . STUDENT CONDUCT Stony Brook University expect s students to respect the rights, privileges, and property of other people. Faculty are required to report to the Office of University Community Standards any disruptive behavior that interrupts their ability to teach, compromises the safety of the learnin g environment, or inhibits students' ability to learn. Faculty members are required to follow their school -specific procedures. For further information about the Code of Student Responsibility see: http://studentaffairs.stonybrook.edu/ucs/conduct/conduct.html ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS Attendance is mandatory, unless there is a medical reason or the student is excused by the Program Director or course instructor. If a cou rse instructor has no written policy in the syllabus regarding the consequences for being absent from class, the PPH policy will apply : three or more unexcused absences from class will reduce the final course grade by a full letter grade (e.g., A to B). HIPAA TRAINING AND P ROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS TRAINING The PPH requires all students to successfully complete an on- line training program in Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and protection of human subjects in research, offered by the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) at: http://www.citiprogram.org . This training is part of the Human Subject Protections Program at Stony Brook, which ensures that the University keeps safe those individuals who volunteer to participate in our research activities as well as the use of protected data . Protection of human subjects training must be complete d as part of new student Orientation or by the start of the Fall semester in whic h the student matriculat es in the Program. A copy of the certificate of completion from CITI must be provided to the Assistant Director for Student Affairs . STUDENT BACKGROUND CHECKS Students who are required to participate in a practical experience are ad vised that some of the facilities they choose to select for their placements may require background checks as a prerequisite to placement. Such background checks may include, but are not limited to, Social Security trace, fingerprinting for criminal histor y, drug testing, sex offender registries, child abuse and maltreatment screening, and federal and state health care program exclusion screening. Students seeking placement in a facility requiring background checks are personally responsible for obtaining t he background check (including cost, unless the clinical site is willing to assume the cost) and may bear the responsibility of delivering the required documentation to the facility. It will be the decision of the site to determine the acceptance of studen ts into its facility. NON -MARICULATED STUDENTS Any person holding a bachelor's degree, its equivalent, or an advanced degree from an accredited institution of higher learning is eligible to be considered for admission to the University as a non -matriculate d graduate student. A maximum of twelve (12) credits may be taken as a non - matriculated student in the PPH. Permission to enroll in courses must be obtained from the A ssistant Director for Student Affairs . Non-degree students who later wish to pursue a g raduate degree will need to make a formal application for admission . SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY Stony Brook University and the PPH faculty and staff are committed to creating and maintaining a working environment that is free from all forms of inappropriate and disrespectful conduct that may be deemed as sexual harassment. Harassment on the basis of sex is a form of sexual discrimination and violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the New Y ork State Human Rights Law, and University policies and regulations. Stony Brook University reaffirms the principle that students, faculty and staff have the right to be free from sex discrimination in the form of sexual harassment inflicted by any member of the campus community. This community includes, but is not limited to, employees, students, visitors, contractors, and vendors associated with Stony Brook. Sexual harassment is contrary to the University's values and standards, which recognize the dignit y and worth of each member of the campus community. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when: 1. submission to such conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition of an individual's employment or academic advancement; 2. submission to, or rejection of, such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment or academic decisions affecting such individual; ___________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ August 2020 Pg. 32 3. such conduct has the pu rpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work or academic performance, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working, living, or academic environment. The University is responsible for, and fully committed to, the preve ntion and elimination of unlawful sexual harassment. Deans, Department Chairs, Directors, Administrators, Managers and Supervisors are responsible for promoting an atmosphere that prohibits such unacceptable behavior. Individuals who are affected by, or ar e aware of, suspected cases of sexual harassment are urged to bring such situations to the University's attention by contacting the Office of Institutional Diversity and Equity . The Office of Institutional Diversity and Equity has professional staff traine d to investigate and provide assistance regarding issues of sexual harassment, and can be reached by calling (631) 632 -6280. DIVERSITY , EQUITY AND INCLUSIVENESS The PPH is committed to creating and maintaining a climate of diversity, equity and inclusivene ss. The PPH endorses ASPPH's Statement of Commitment to Zero Tolerance of Harassment and Discrimination, https://s3.amazonaws.com/aspph -wp-production/wp - content/uploads/2014/02/ASPPH_Statement_of_Commitment _to_Zero_Tolerance_of_Harassment_and_Discrimination.pdf . Consistent with federal and state guidelines, Stony Brook University and th e Program in Public Health do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex, age, ethnicity, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, or veterans' status in its educational programs or employment. If you are a student or an employee of Stony Brook University and you consider yourself to be a target of discrimination or harassment, you may file a complaint in writing with the Office of Institutional Diversity and Equity . If you choose to file a complaint within the Unive rsity, you do not lose your right to file with an outside enforcement agency such as the State Division of Human Rights, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or the Office of Civil Rights. For additional information go to: http:www.stonybrook.edu/dive rsity/complaint.html . Stony Brook University has had a longstanding commitment to express and to demonstrate Equal Employment and Educational Opportunity for all persons in our community, and further, to afford all faculty, staff and members of all groups an environment in which the integrity of all is assumed and each individual is treated with dignity, respect, and fairness. In compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), as amended, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 , The Rehabili tation Act of 1973, The Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the New York State Human Rights Law, Stony Brook University prohibits unlawful discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, sex, age, religi on, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, or status as a disabled or Vietnam -era veteran in the implementation of any of its policies, procedures, or practices regarding the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment and/or access for students, faculty, and staff. This non -discrimination policy affects all employment practices including, but not limited to, recruiting, hiring, transfers, promotions, benefits, compensation, training, educational opportunities, and terminations . The University's administration, faculty, staff, and students are each responsible for creating and maintaining an environment conducive to work, study, and learning. The result of harassment and discrimination, in any form prohibited by this policy, is to impede the realization of the University's mission to provide an education of distinction in a dignified and respectful learning and employment environment. Any such unlawful discrimination or harassment in any venue of Stony Brook University will not b e tolerated.
