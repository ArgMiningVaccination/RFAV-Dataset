Huber, Ph.D. President THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE THE COLLEGE| 7 LEGACY Nano Nagle founded the Presentation Sisters in Ireland in 1775. She began her ministry by teaching children, which was against the law at that time. Her belief in the power and importance of education has spanned the centuries and continues to shape the ministry of the Presentation Sisters around the world. Education is the underlying fabric that weaves itself into all of the Presentation ministries. Mother John Hughes, Mother Agnes Hughes an d Sister Teresa Challoner, Presentation Sisters from Ireland, arrived in Dakota Territory on March 19, 1880. They came at the request of Bishop Ma rtin Marty, to teach children of the Lakota Sioux and of the European settlers. During the ne xt two years, their journey in pursuit of this missionary call to teach took them to Wheeler, Deadwood and Yankton. Their next stop was in Fargo, where they remained for four years. In 1886, Fr. Robert Haire invited the Presentation Sisters to open the first school in Aberdeen. An education ministry that has spanned more than 125 years began when Mother John Hughes, Moth er Aloysius Chriswell and Sist er Joseph Butler responded to this invitation. Presenta tion Academy opened on October 15, 1888. The Academy offered education for children in kindergarten through grade eight, fine arts including music, piano, organ, needlework, as well as typing, shorthand and bookkeeping. In a foreshadowing of Presentation College, the acade my also offered teacher training. Two hundred and thirty-two Presentation Sister teachers have touched the lives of over 300,000 students over the years. Today, the Presentation Sisters can be found ministering to the n eeds of those in all walks of lif e, yet they remain grounded i n their first ministry: education. The Presentation Sisters of Ab erdeen are the only Presentation Sisters to sponsor a college. Msgr. John Brady established Notre Dame Ju nior College in 1922, in Mitchell, South Dakota. Presentation Sisters staffed the Junior College as well as Notre Dame Academy, which educated students in grades 1-12. The Pr esentation Sisters relied on the Junior College to provide an education for their young members. Due to financial difficulties and concerns about accreditation, the ownership of the College was given to the Sisters in August 1951, and the College moved to Aberdeen. The name was changed to Presentation Junior College. In 1965, the College was officially incorporated as Presen tation College, an entity separa te from the Presentation Sister s, although the Sisters continu ed their sponsorship. The mission of the Sisters is to go where there is the greatest need. In the early 1900's, the Aberdeen ar ea experienced diphth eria and typhoid epidemics. The Sisters began providing health care for those af flicted. In 1901, the Sisters opened St. Luke's Hosp ital in Aberdeen. This health care ministry continued to grow. St. Luke's School of Nursing was soon established. Sisters Ma ry Margaret Grainer, Peter Bu ckley and Vincent Hennessy were members of the first graduating class in 1904. In 1942, the four Presentation Schools of Nu rsing combined to form one Central School of Nursing at St. Luke's Hospital in Aberdeen. In 1962, the School of Nursing affiliated with Presentation Junior Colle ge. This affiliation led to the eventual designation of Presentation College as a specia lty Health Science Baccalaureate Institution. Offering degrees primarily in health related fields, Presentation College thus represents the convergence of the two ministries which have been the focus of the Presentation Sisters since the early years of their ministry in South Dakota - education and health care. In 1988, the Presentation Sisters adopted a ne w mission statement, which was faithful to the Gospel values of their Foundress, Nano Nagle, and of their authentic spiritual and service tradition. This mission is to do works of justice, alleviating oppress ion and promoting human dignity, especially among the poor; and to o ffer Good News proclaimed in a spirit of love, zeal and joy. The Sisters specifically noted that this mission was to be applied to each of their ministries. Soon after this mission statement was adopted, the Leadership of the Presentation Sisters affirm ed that the mission was present in the mission and philosophy of Presentation College. As sponsors, the Sisters promote their mission and values within the College. Many sist ers are active as members of the Board o f Trustees as well as in supporting campus activities and providing educational support services such as tutoring and prayer ministries. THE COLLEGE 8| PRESENTATION COLLEGE 2018-2019 CATALOG HISTORY Presentation College has been continuously accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of The North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (previously known as the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools) sinc e 1971. Presentation College conferred a diploma on its graduates until 1966 when the College began to confer associate degrees in Arts and in Science. In 1990, the College was accredited to also offer four-year professional baccalaureate programs. In 1980, the Cheyenne River Lakota Nursin g School at Eagle Butte, South Dakota, a satellite of the nursing program of Presentation College, enrolled the first cl ass of Native American st udents. In 1991, the name of the school was changed to Presentation College-Lakota Campus. The athletics program began in 1995 and contin ues to grow and expand. The 1,200-seat St rode Activity Center was dedicated in 1998 as the home of Saints Athletics. The College participated in athletics at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NC AA) Division III level until April 2013 when it became an approved member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). Presentation College offers male and female students th e opportunity to participate in a number of sports including basketball, soccer, softball, baseball, cr oss country, volleyball, and football. A new student housing complex opened in 1999, featuring suites that are on a space-available basis, with private bedrooms, semi-private bathrooms, living room s, kitchens, and Internet access. Distance learning programs at the College were added in 2000 under the umbrella known as PC Virtual. PC Virtual currently includes distance-based programs in a variety of areas. The cl assroom work for these programs is offered completely online to students who reside in states where Presentation College has received state approval to operate. In 2003, Presentation College-Fai rmont Campus was opened in the community of Fairmont, Minnesota. In 2006, Presentation College offered programs within the Sioux Falls, South Dakota, area on the campus of Kilian College. The College moved its Sioux Falls offerings to an independen t location in Sioux Falls in May 2013. In the 2011-2012 academic year the College completed a renovati on of its chemistry, biolo gy, anatomy and physiology and athletic training lab facilities. During that time period, the College also invest ed in infrastructure and programming by constructing a practice football field with artificial turf and by expanding the St rode athletic facility to accommodate the addition of football as a conference sport. In 2013, Presentation College open ed a multi-million dollar student suites housing facility, as well as a new athletic training and wellness center with expanded space and high-tech exercise equi pment. At the same time, a project to reconfigure the campus parking lots and open areas was begun. In 2014, the finished result was a beautiful new campus green, with sidewalks, paths, and trees. The Presentation College Lakota Campus on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation, in Eagle Butte, South Dakota, closed in May 2014. There were many deciding factors that went into th is decision. The Presentation Sisters and the College have accomplished the mission in Eagle Butte and have provided a great service over the past three decades when the campus opened. Presentation College broke ground in 2014 for the new winter Dome, which was fully erected for the first time in early 2015. Each year in November, the Dome is infl ated to provide indoor space for sports , intramurals, recrea tion and community activities. It comes down each April wh en teams begin playing outside again. At the beginning of 2017, construction began on the Avera Simulati on Center, a high-tech, hands-on learning center for students in Nursing, Athletic Training, and other Allied Health fields. Th e facility, containing six distinct simulation areas, and equi pped with specialized equipment and interactiv e mannequins, opened in early summer. During the summer of 2017, a new Welcome Ce nter for visitors, alumni, prospective students and families was constructed at the entrance of the main buildin g. \"Saint Square\", a resource and service office for students, was designed on the second floor . The Wein Gallery, containing display space for artworks , was renovated and re-opened in the Southeast Building. In the spring of 2018, Presentati on College launched its first-ever graduate prog ram: a Master of Science in Nursing with two tracks: Family Nurse Practitioner and Nurse Educator. The program is designed with a focus on rural health care. The College, in 1998, received the ABBY Award for Community Involvem ent; in 2002, the Outstand ing Rural Health Program Award from the National Rural Health Association recogniz ing SEED (Skills Enhancement & Education Through Distance Learning). In 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013, the Corporation for National and Community Servic e named Presentation College to the President's Higher Educati on Community Service Honor Roll.

Aid may be offered in the form of grants, scholarships, loans, or employment, and is funded through federal, state, institutional, and pri vate organizations. The College offers a number of scholarship s that are funded from its own resource s that are awarded based upon academic merit, athletic ability and/or financial need*. The College also participates in the following federal, or Title IV, financial aid programs: Federal Pell Grant Federal Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Federal Work-Study (FWS) Federal Direct Subsidized Loan Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan Federal Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate St udents (PLUS) Title IV financial aid is contingent upon the availability of fe deral funding and the student's ability to meet program guideli nes.

Loans, which must be repaid, are usually offered at a low interest rate and have an extended repayment period. The College offers student employment positions both on and off campus for eligible students. Financial need* is defined as the difference between the cost of attendance (COA)* and the family's federally calculated contribution to these costs: the Expected Family Contribution (EFC)*. Where need* exists, the College assists in meeting the student's educational expenses within the resources available to the institution. Presentation College serves approximately 98% of its student body through an extensive financial aid and scholar ship program. The College encour ages all students to apply fo r financial aid. The financial aid office (FAO), located at the Aberdeen campus, administers aid for students attending all Presentation College campuses and sites. Information on application procedures, type s of aid, program requirements, and educational costs as determined by the College, and the students' rights and responsibi lities is detailed in this section. Students' Rights and Responsibilities The receipt of financial aid is a privilege, wh ich creates both rights and responsibilities. 1. Whether or not students receive fina ncial aid, they are PERSONALLY RESPONSI BLE for all financial charges that they incur at the College. The College may permit students to register and to attend cl asses before the final determination is made regarding their eligibility for financial aid. If, however, students are or become ineligible for financial aid (including grants, loans, scholarships, em ployment and waivers) for any reason, they ar e responsible to pay their accounts in full, including any collection and/or attorney's fe es that may be incurred by or on behalf of the College to satisfy their personal financial obligations. 2. Students have the right to know the methodology used to determine their financial need; the right to have access to information and records that are part of th e student's College file used in determin ing need; and the right to be awarded aid as equitably as funds permit. Under the Family Educational Righ ts and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA*) a student is defined as a person who has enrolled for classes at a post-secondary institution. At Presentati on College individuals are not subject to FERPA until they have enrolled for classes and begun attending classes. 3. Students have a right (as defined by FE RPA) to the privacy of their financial ai d information. Students (and any others who inquire about an applicant's status) are required to properly identify themselves in order to receive service. Students should present their College identification card or a state-issued photo ID card. The financial aid staff is governed by strict FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 21 federal privacy laws and is therefore limited in both the type of information that can be released, and the persons to whom student information can be disclosed. For additional information, please read the FERPA section of the Catalog. 4. Applicants and students have the righ t to receive financial aid based solely upon their ability to meet financial aid program regulations. Students are not re quired to, nor are they encouraged to, in any way perform favors for, provide services or goods to, or in any way to remunerate any member of the financial ai d staff in exchange for financial aid, counseling, advice, processing, or funding. 5. Applicants and students should not engage in financial transactions (i.e., loaning to or borrowing from, payment for services or goods, receipt of payment for goods or services) with members of the financial aid staff. Any student to whom the suggestion is made or advice is given by a member of the fi nancial aid staff that his or he r financial aid will in any way be positively affected by the provision of remuneration, favo rs, goods or services should immediately report such to the Director of Financial Aid (notice may also be given to the Director of Human Reso urces or any Presentation College Vice President). 6. Applicants and students have the righ t to receive financial aid based solely upon their ability to meet financial aid program regulations. The receipt of financial aid is to be free fr om any threat of reprisal, and is not to be under threat to i n any way act beyond the specific requiremen ts of the financial aid programs. Any stud ent to whom a suggestion is made by a member of the financial aid staff that his financial aid will in any way be negatively affected by the failure to provide remuneration, favors, goods or services shou ld immediately report such to the Director of Financial Aid (notice may also be given to the Director of Human Resources or any Presentation College Vice President). 7. Applicants and students are discouraged from giving gifts to members of the financial aid staff. While it is understood that the provision of a gift can be a means of expressing grat itude, office policies and College regulations prohibit staff members from accepting personal gifts. 8. Applicants and students have the ri ght to expect professional and courteous service from the financial aid staff. Students should expect to receive accurate advice and timely responses to their inquiries. St udents who have received poor customer service from the FAO are encouraged to report such to the Director of Financial Aid. 9. Students are responsible for maintaining Satisfactory Ac ademic Progress (SAP). Students who fail to maintain satisfactory progress will lose their eligibility for financial ai d until the required credits and grade point average have bee n earned. For additional information about the College's SAP policies, read the section on Federal Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (p. 37) in this catalog. 10. Students who fail to meet financial aid filing deadlines or document submission deadlines, and, as a result, have outstanding account balances with the Coll ege, will not be permitted to register for any upcoming semester, will be denied access to grades and transcripts, and will be subject to collection activity. 11. Applicants, students, parents and spouses applying for fi nancial aid are responsible for accurately and truthfully portraying information, financial resources, and circumstan ces, and for notifying the FAO of any changes in status, including the receipt of outside scholarships; for applying by the deadline; and for maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress. Students who receive external scholarships or other resources (such as employee tuition benefits or any other educational benefits) are required to report the receipt of these benefits in wr iting to the FAO. Failure to report external scholarships or other resources may require students to repay th e College or the government all or part of any need-based financial aid funds. 12. As a service, the College makes an early release of financial aid available to eligible students to help them purchase their required books and supplie s. These funds are called a book voucher and are not a separate or additional type of financial aid. If eligible, students are able to use a portion of their financial aid credit to buy required books and supplies . Students are responsible for al l purchases they make. When using a financial aid credit for purchase, students should buy only those books and supplies that are requir ed for their classes. If students drop classes, fail to attend, or stop attending, their financial aid will be reduced or ca nceled. If the student's financial aid do es not cover bookstore purchases for any reason whatsoever, including College error, the student is still responsible for payme nt in full of all amounts spent in the bookstore. Violation of the regulations governing the financial aid prog rams is sufficient grounds for termination of all financial aid and referral for disciplinary action. Violations include, but are not limite d to, using financial aid funds for non- educational purposes (e.g., using the b ook voucher to purchase non-educationally related items), transfer of financial aid funds to others (e.g., using the book voucher to purchase items for others), converting the book voucher to cash (e.g., purchasing books and/or supplies and then selling th ose items to other students for cash), and using someone else's book voucher. 13. Applicants, students, parents, spouses or others who knowingly provide false or misleading information on any financial aid document (financia l aid documents include but are not limited to the FAFSA, verification forms, work-study time cards, appeal applications, correspondence, and loan a pplications) will be referred for disciplinary action, which may include loss of financial aid, reprimand, suspension or expulsion from the Colle ge. Additionally, students and other aid 22| PRESENTATION COLLEGE 2018-2019 CATALOG recipients so identified will be billed for all aid disbursed to them for which they are inelig ible. Further, such individuals may face criminal prosecution by the U.S. Department of Education, which may result in imprisonment, a fine of up to $20,000, or both. 14. Applicants, students, parents, spouses, and others are re sponsible for interacting with the financial aid staff with civility and courteousness. All students enrolled at the Colleg e acknowledge with their enrollment an obligation to abide by the College's regulations and policies, as approved by the administration and Board of Trustees. Students are responsible for their own actions and are expect ed to maintain the highest standards of conduct at all times and in all places affiliated with th e College. Each student must, of course, respect the rights and privileges of all other students as well as College administrators, faculty and staff. The College reserves the right to dismiss from a course or from the College, or restrict from any other Co llege activity or facility, any student whose behavior is detrimental to the College or its studen ts. For a full explanation of the College 's Code of Conduct, read the Student Handbook. (Academic policies and procedures shall gove rn dismissal or suspension for academic reasons.) 15. In order to preserve the privacy, confidentiality, and comfor t of other visitors and staff, cell phone use in the financial aid waiting areas and offices is prohibited except when necessary to conduct business related to the studen t's visit. Students and other visitors are expected to complete their cell phone conversations, text messaging, and other use prior to entering the FAO and waiting area. 16. While the FAO staff is available to assi st applicants through the application proc ess, it is the applicant's responsibility to see to the correctness and completeness of his or her applicat ions. If the applicant receives notification that his or her FAFSA or loan application is incomplete, she/he must determin e what is necessary to complete his or her application(s), and promptly submit the required information. 17. An application for financial aid will have no effect on the decision concerning admission. The admission decision is made without access or refe rence to financial aid data. 18. Students are required to provide thei r social security numbers on the FAFSA. Provision of the student ID or social security number (as specified on the individual document) is required on all supporting documents used to apply for financial aid. Students' social security numbers will be used for the College's system of student records, to process the FAFSA, to award financial aid, for compliance with federal and state reporting requirements, as well as for debt collection. The College will not disclose students' social security numbers to anyone outside the institution, except as required or allowed by law, and will make every effort to protect students' privacy. 19. Policy on Non-Discrimination in Educat ional Programs. The College complies with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, Sectio n 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Older Americans Act of 1975, and South Dakota's laws agains t discrimination. Thes e laws (and others) prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, affectional or sexual orientation, sex, famili al status, domestic partnership status, disability and handicap. Decisions on admission, financial aid programs, access to course offerings, or other aspects of the College's educational pr ograms or activities are not made on the basis of any of the aforementioned factors, except when lawful to do so. Inquiries regardin g these laws may be submitted to the College's Director of Human Resources or to the U. S. Department of Education, Washington, DC 20201. 20.

Students who receive federal, stat e and/or institutional financial aid are subject to all of the governing regulations whether or not they are aware of these rules. For addition al information about financial aid at Presentation College please visit the College's website at www.presentati on.edu. The following U.S. Department of Education and other websites may also be of interest to financial aid applicants and recipients: www.fafsa.ed.gov www.irs.gov www.sss.gov www.studentloans.gov www.fastweb.com www.nslds.ed.gov www.studentaid.ed.gov Definitions of terms used in the Students ' Rights and Responsibilities are included in the financial aid glossary at the end of the financial aid section of the catalog. Attendance The College awards financial aid to students with the expectatio n that they will attend their classes for the entire semester. Full eligibility for financial aid cannot be confirmed until students ha ve attended their classes beyond the midpoint of the semeste r. That is, students incremen tally earn their financial aid during the early week s of the semester and do not become fully eligibl e for their aid until the latter weeks of the semester. Students who withdr aw from the College or otherwise stop attending their FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 23 classes may be required to immediately repay a portion of their fi nancial aid even if they have already paid for books or recei ved a refund and spent the money. When students fail to attend their classes they could leave th e College owing money because their charges for tuition, fees, th e suites, and meal plan are higher than the amount of financial aid that they have ea rned. For information about the calculation (R2T4*) that the College is required to us e to determine how much of the student's fi nancial aid must be returned to the federa l government see the R2T4 section and the glossary at the end of th is section. Students are advised to meet with a member of the Business Office or FAO to discuss the financial consequences of dropping out or withdrawing from the College before doing so. Fraud Falsification of documents and any other information that is used to determine eligibility for financial aid is an extremely se rious criminal offense. Students who gain access to and are disbursed Title IV* financial aid based upon fraudu lent information are subject to immediate repayment of those funds. Ex amples of fraud include, but are not limited to: 1. deliberately and willfully providing information that is inaccurate or materially incomplete 2. applying for Title IV* financial aid using someone else's identity 3. submitting FWS timecards that reflec t time that the student did not work 4. using Title IV* funds for non- educationally related expenses 5. making purchases in the bookstore fo r other students using Title IV* funds Students who falsify documents used to ob tain financial aid are subject to disciplin ary action which may include expulsion from the College. The College may refer any instance of suspected fraud to the U.S. Department of Education's Office of the Inspecto r General as well as to local law enforcement agencies. Title IV* regulations provide for the impositi on of fines and imprisonment for those wh o are convicted of fraud. By signing the FAFSA* parents and students are acknowledging that \" if you purposely give false or misleading information, you may be fined up to $20,000, sent to prison, or both.\" Application Procedures To apply for financial aid, students must complete the Free Appl ication for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)* for each year of their enrollment. Students are enco uraged to complete the FAFS A online at www.fafsa.ed.gov The FAFSA should be submitted as soon as possible after October 1 to secure the most favorable funding package. Presentation College's priority deadline date for submitting the FAFSA is March 1. The FAFSA is used to determine eligibility for federal, state, and institutional aid. In order to be considered for federal aid and mo st other forms of assistance the student must: 1. be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen; and 2. have and provide a valid So cial Security Number; and 3. if a male between the ages of 18 and 26 register (o r if older have registered) with Selective Service; and 4. have a high school diploma, its equivalent, or a General Education Development (GED); and 5. be enrolled or accepted for enro llment as a regular student; and 6. be enrolled in an eligible degree program; and 7. be enrolled in courses that are a pplicable to the eligible degree; and 8. be enrolled for the required number of credits; and 9. not have a drug conviction for an offense that occurred while receiving Title IV* financial aid; and 10. not owe a refund on a federal grant; and 11. not be in default on a federal student or parent loan; and 12. demonstrate financial need* as applicable; and 13. maintain satisfactory academic standing in accordance with federal and College policies; and 14. meet all other the eligibility requirements. Financial aid eligibility for courses that are applicable to the program When eligibility for financial aid is calculated, only those cred its that are applicable to the student's degree program (and a ppear on the checklist) are counted. As an exam ple, if a student is enrolled in six credit s and three of those credits do not count t oward the student's program he is not eligible to receive a Direct lo an, which requires a minimum enrollment in six program-eligible credits. 24| PRESENTATION COLLEGE 2018-2019 CATALOG Financial aid eligibility and completion of the baccalaureate degree or its equivalent Once students have completed the requirements for the baccalau reate degree (or its equivalent), they are ineligible for Pell an d FSEOG grants, as well as PC athletic and merit scholarships. Stud ents who have earned a baccalaureate or its equivalent from an institution outside the United States are also subject to this regulation. Students cannot prolong their eligibility by delayin g receipt of their diplomas nor can they re ceive these grants and scholarships during their enrollment after having earned a baccalaureate degree. Deadlines The College uses deadlines for a number of reasons. Deadlines are primaril y used to assist students in maximizing their funding by helping them to meet eligibility guidelines for state, fede ral and other external financial aid programs. Deadlines are also used to allow the College sufficient time to process students' financial aid applications to allow them to plan for their enrollment. In addition, the College must adhere to deadlines that are imposed upon it by the state, federal, and other agencie s that provide funding to students. Financial aid applicants are subject to several types of deadlines and should understand the cons equences of failure to submit information in a timely manner. In general, students who miss financial aid deadlines may be ineligible for funds that they would have otherwise received. The primary financial aid deadlines are listed below: 1. March 1 - Priority processing deadline . Students should submit their FAFSAs by March 1 (preceding the award year) in order to maximize their eligibility for funds from all financial aid programs. Students who submit their FAFSAs after March 1 will be awarded financial aid on a funds-available basis. 2. March 31 - Scholarship deadline. Each year the College offe rs a number of donor scholarships. Application information and procedures are posted on the College's website. Most scho larships require that the studen t submit an essay along with an application for consideration. 3. First day of the fall, spring and summer semesters. In orde r to begin attending classes, students should have completed their FAFSAs and submitted all required do cuments. Students who do not complete their financial aid files by the first day of the semester are required to pay their ac count balances from their own resources. 4. Last day of enrollment. Students who fail to complete thei r financial aid files by submitting all required documents and information by their last day of enrollment during the academic year are ineligible for unprocessed financial aid. Students who delay the submission of financial aid information and docume nts until the final days of the semester may be ineligible because there is insufficient time to process their files. Students who wish to be considered for assistance from the Co llege's financial aid programs are encouraged to apply early and to submit all requested information and documents promptly. Census Date The amounts and types of students' financial aid awards are set on the Co llege's census date each semester. The census date is generally the last day of the add/drop pe riod. The student's enrollment as of the ce nsus date determines eligibility for the financial aid which has been awarded as of that date. For example, if a student begins the semester with twelve credits and the n after adding and dropping classes during th e first two weeks of the semester is enrolle d for nine credits on the census date, h is financial aid will be adjusted based upon nine credits. Awarding After the FAO reviews the student's financial aid file it may make an offer of one or more types of financial assistance in accordance with the student's eligibility. This offer of aid is called an award letter* and is made available electronically in the student's portal. Students may view and dec line any aid that they do not wish to rece ive by selecting the My Financial Aid link available on the Student Portal at http://www.presentation.ed u/students/ Students who wish to borrow less than the loan amount offered should send an email to financialaid@presentation.edu from their PC email account The FAO makes award offers to incoming students once they have been accepted to the College and have completed the financial aid process (which may include verification). The FAO also makes award offers to pr ovisionally accepted students; however, funds can only be disbursed after all required document ation is received and they have been fully admitted. Returning students will receive an award offer once their registration for the upcoming semester has been confirmed, they have completed the financial aid process and their grades have been reviewed. FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 25 Award Adjustments The College may make adjustments to students' financial aid awar ds at any time and without pr ior notification due to such factors as new or conflicting information in the student's file, decreases or increases in fundin g levels, modifications in pro gram eligibility rules and changes in the studen t's ability to qualify for financial assistance. The College may also adjust award amounts based upon the student's enrollment status at any time during the semester. Students should visit the FAO prior to adding or dropping courses to discuss the chan ges that will be made to the award offer. For most families the information provided on the FAFSA is a good indication of the financial resources that will be available during the year the student is enrolled in college. Sometimes there are changes in the student's household that are not reflect ed on the FAFSA and that decrease the resour ces that are available to pay for college. The most common changes are related to separation or divorce, major illness or injury, job loss, and death. The FAO may be able to assist when the student or family h as experienced these types of changes. Contact the FAO to confid entially discuss your circumstances and a staff member will determine if you meet the requirements to appeal for a review of the student's financial aid award. Financial Aid Disbursement The annual amount of financial ai d (scholarships, grants and loans) is divided so that half of the award is disbursed for the f all semester and the remaining half is disbursed for the spring se mester. Financial aid for students who enroll only for the spring and summer semesters and have eligibility is disbursed so that th e students receive half for the spring and half for the summer . The College is required to review each student's enrollment and other eligibility criteria on the day that aid is disbursed to determine if the student is still eligible to receive the assist ance. For example, a student who was awarded a loan based upon her credits at census date will not be eligible for the funds if sh e has dropped below six eligible credits on or before the date t he loan is disbursed. Students who are considering dropping or withdraw ing from a class or classes should meet with a financial aid counselor before doing so. Summer Financial Aid Eligibility All of the sessions during the summer (from May to August) ar e combined to comprise the summer semester. Thus, a student who enrolls for three credits in the first six-week session and fo r an additional three credits in the second six-week session is considered to be enrolled in six credits for the summer semest er. The summer is the third se mester of the academic year following the fall and spring semesters. Typically, students who enroll full-time (twelve credits or more) during each of the fall and spring semesters will consume all of their financial aid eligibility and will have no remaining fund s for their summer enrollment. Students who enroll part-time (le ss than twelve credits) during on e or both of the fall or spring semesters may have financial aid funds remaining for the summer semester, particularly if they are Pell Grant recipients. Students who want to be evaluated for summer financial aid eligibility should submit the College's summer financial aid application which is usually available in Ma rch and can be obtained on the web site. Social Security Use Policy The purpose of this policy is to define and describe the FAO's collection, retention, use, and disclosure of students' Social Security numbers. The policy is also intended to provide st udents with information that th e FAO collects and uses Social Security numbers if specifically required by law to do so or if necessary for the performance of the College's duties and responsibilities. The U.S. Department of Education (the fe deral agency that provides and governs the Free Application for Federal Student Aid - FAFSA) requires applicants and students to provide their correct Social Security number on the FAFSA. Students who fail or refuse to provide their correct Social Security number on the FAFSA are thereby ineligible for Title IV (federal) financial aid and may also be ineligible for other types of aid from the College as well as state agencies and other agencies. Provision of the student's Presentation Coll ege student ID number or Social Security number (as specified on the individual document) is also required on all supporting documents used to apply for financial aid. The student's Social Security number will be used for the College's system of student records, to process the FAFSA, to award financial aid, for compliance with federal and state reporting requirements, as well as for debt co llection. The College will not disclose the student's Social Se curity number to anyone outside the institution, except as required by law, and will make every effort to protect the student's privac y. Students who fail or refuse to provide thei r Social Security number or student ID nu mber when requested will delay or prevent the processing of their financial aid. 26| PRESENTATION COLLEGE 2018-2019 CATALOG The U.S. Department of Education requires students to subm it their Social Security numb er when completing federal applications for student aid. The student's Social Security numb er is then used by the College to match applicants' records, verify eligibility, and to coordinate benefits with other programs. The FAO uses Social Security numbers to verify eligibility and disbursement requirements for federal, state, and institutional aid programs. As required by law, the College reports So cial Security numbers for students receiving benefits from aid programs to various state and federal agencies. Agencies includ e but are not limited to the National St udent Clearinghouse, the Department of Veteran Affairs, and the State of South Dakota. As required by law, and in performing the duties required to administer the financial aid programs, Presentation College releases students' Social Security numbers to vendors contracted by the College and external agen cies to assist with compliance with federal and state requirements. The vend ors and other agencies are authorized to use Social Security numbers to complete the tasks contractually required and are no t authorized to use Social Security numbers for any othe r purpose. Currently, vendor s include (but are not limited to) the National Student Clearinghouse, Federal Family Educational Loan providers, guarantors and servicers of federal loans. The following statement may appear on and is applicable to all of the College's financial aid forms: *Social Security Number Policy: Federal regulations require that you provid e your Social Security number (SSN) on the FAFSA. Provision of your Presentation College student ID numb er or SSN (as specified on the individual document) is also required on all supporting documents used to apply for financial ai d. Your SSN will be used for the College's system of student records, to process your FAFSA, to award your financial aid, for compliance with federal and st ate reporting requirements, as well as for debt collection. The College will not disclose your SSN to anyone outside the institution, except as required or allowed by law, and will make every effort to protect your privacy. Failure to provide your SSN or student ID number on this form will delay or prevent the processing of your (insert name of form here). Verification Presentation College has established the following FAO policy and procedure to define and administer verification and correction of data that applicants submit on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and other documents used to apply for Title IV (or federal) funding, as well as several othe r types of financial assistance administered by the College. Al l recipients of Title IV funding (and other sources of funding as determined by the College) are governed by this policy as specified below. The verification policy is in accordance with and references the language fr om regulations, CFR 34, Section 668.51-61, promulgated under the Higher Educ ation Act of 1965 (HEA), as amended. The College adheres to federal policy, as set forth in HEA in the administration of verifi cation for Title IV reci pients, in all respects. The verification policy applies to the following types of Title IV aid administered by the College: Federal Pell Grant Federal Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Federal Work Study (FWS) Federal Direct Loan (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) Federal Parent Loan for Unde rgraduate Students (PLUS) The verification policy may also be applied to other types of fi nancial aid that are administered by the College that are need- based. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) sets forth both the framing regulations as well as significant detail governing the proce ss of verification. ED requires that institutions document certain verification guidelines over which they have discretion. Those policies are described below: selection for institutional verification, the deadlines by which students must submit verification documentation, the consequences for failing to submit verification documents by applicable deadlines, the method the FAO will use to no tify students if their EFC and/or Title IV aid amount changes, the procedures the FAO or students will follow to correct FAFSA data, the procedure the FAO will follow to refer a student to the Office of Inspector General. Other policies and procedures are copied from and closely based upon the federal Application and Verification Guide (AVG) from the Federal Student Aid Handbook, Chapter 4. FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 27 Verification, Updates and Corrections Because students sometimes make errors on their application, there is a process for verifying applications and making corrections. The Central Processing System (CPS) selects which a pplications are to be verified, but the FAO has the authority t o verify additional students. The FAO must verify applications selected by the CPS of stud ents who will receive (or have received) subsidized student financial assistance. Verification is not required if the studen t will only receive unsubsidized student financial assistance ( see verification exclusions later in this policy), though a student cannot avoid verification by accepting only unsubsidized aid. I f the student tries to do this, the FAO must continue with verification. Institutional Notification Policies ED selects, on a random basis and through edits at the Centra l Processing System (CPS), ce rtain financial aid applicants nationwide for review in a process called verification. When an applicant has been selected for verification the FAO is require d to review the student's FAFSA for accuracy and completeness. Typi cally, students and their families are required at minimum to submit a verification worksheet (available from the College) and an IRS tax transcrip t (available from the IRS and required if the Data Retrieval Tool was not used). Depending upon the sources of income reported on the FAFSA, the student (and parent or spouse, as applicable) may be required to submit additional documents. All students who have been selected for verification must submit all required documentation and any other requested information prior to being issued an award offer. Students an d parents are reminded that by signing the FAFSA they have agreed that \" If you are the parent or the student, by signing this applicatio n you certify that all of the information you provided is true and complete to the best of your knowledge and you agree, if asked, to provide information that will verify the accuracy of your co mpleted form. This information may include U.S. or state income tax forms th at you filed or are required to file. Also, you certify that you understand that the Secretary of Education has the authority to verify informatio n reported on this application with the Internal Revenue Servi ce and other federal agencies.\" Typical Documentation When a student is selected for verification, the following documentation, at minimum, is required: 1. Verification Worksheet (Dependent or Independent). Available from the college. 2. Transcript of Tax Return student's tax transcript (must be obtained from the IRS, not a photocopy of the tax return) parent's (for dependent students) or sp ouse's (for married independent students) tax transcript (must be obtained from the IRS, not a photocopy of the tax return) if the student (and parent or spouse) used the IRS Data Re trieval when submitting the FAFS A, a tax return transcript is not required unless changes are subsequently made Additional documentation may be required to substantiate data on the FAFSA or to resolve conflicting information, as follows: child support received child support paid payments to tax-deferred pensions value of real estate investment properties wages earned current valuation of assets When students are selected for verification, the FAO generates an email informing them as to the process and the documentation required to review their file and applicable deadlines. Students who fail to respond to requests for documentation are repeated ly contacted on an establishe d schedule with information about the importance of complying and the consequences of failure to do so. Title IV regulations require that institutions have written policies supporting their administ ration of several aspects of verification. An overview of each required element is presented below. Title IV regu lations require that the institution have t he following written policies: Selection for Institutional Verification The FAO may at its discretion select students for verification wh o were not selected by the Central Processing System (CPS). Th e FAO may also select students for verification of data elements in addition to those required in the student's verification grou p. For example, the FAO will select students whose files contain co nflicting information either with in the award year or between 28| PRESENTATION COLLEGE 2018-2019 CATALOG award years. The FAO will also select known members of the sa me household when one member is selected by CPS. The FAO will not select students for verification base d upon any discriminatory or unlawful reason. The FAO may require those students it selects to verify any FA FSA information and to provide an y reasonable documentation in accordance with consistently applied FAO policies. In either si tuation the FAO may, but is not required to, include any of the 2018-2019 CPS verification items not already included. Students who have been institutionally iden tified are considered to be selected for verification and, as with CPS-selected applicatio ns, all other verification requirements, such as notifications, deadlines, allowable tolerances, and interim disbursement rules, apply. The deadlines by which students must submit verification documentation The FAO notifies selected applicants upon receipt of the Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) to submit required documents, which are listed in the notification email. On a weekly basis the financial aid co unselors review the document tracking report which lists those students who still have inco mplete files due to missing documents. The FAO requests that applicants submit their documents within te n days of the date of the notification em ail or their last day of enrollment, whiche ver occurs first. The FAO continues to notify enrolled students throughout the seme ster to complete their files. Since the College does not issue financial aid awards until after the verification process has been successfully completed, students must submit all of their verification documents so that they are received in the FAO duri ng regular business hours by the last day of the semester or th e student's last day of attendance, whichever comes first; however, students who delay and do not submit their financial aid form s until the final days of their enrollment may render themselves in eligible for grants and loans by doing so because there may be insufficient processing time. For example, if a student would have been eligible for a Direct loan and the loan was not origina ted prior to the student's last day of enrollment the student is ineligible to receive those funds. The consequences for failing to submit veri fication documents by applicable deadlines In the initial notification email and in all subsequent communica tions, the FAO notifies students that failure to submit all required documents will result in ineligibility for all forms of Title IV financial aid as well as some types of institutional aid. If the student has already received a disbursement(s) of Title IV ai d for which he has become ineligible the notification from the FAO contains the information that he will also forfeit those funds. The method the FAO will use to notify students if their EFC and/or Title IV aid amount changes The FAO initially prepares awards only for those students who have completed the verifi cation process. If a student is selected after having been packaged and prior to all disbursements, the FA O provides notification as above. If the student's EFC and/or Title IV aid amount changes, the FAO notifi es the student via email. The notification email contains information to enable the student to access the revised award letter. The procedures the FAO will fo llow to correct FAFSA data When any dollar or non-dollar it em changes as a result of the verification pr ocess, the FAO submits the updated information correcting the student's FAFSA via the web. The ISIR is the report that is produced after the student files a FAFSA. The ISIR contains all of the student's answers to the questions on the FAFSA. The FAO usually downloads ISIRs daily: Monday - Thursday. When the corrected ISIR, reflecti ng the updates, is download ed into the College's student information system, the FAO confirms that the data is accurate. The FAO packages (or re packages, as necessary) applicants and students whose ISIRs are accurate and their files are otherwise comple te. The FAO then notifies affected applic ants and students vi a email as to their updated EFC and/or award. The procedure the FAO will follow to refer a student or others to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) If any college employee (or other individual) develops a credible suspicion that a student, pare nt, employee, or other individu al has misrepresented information or altered documentation to fraudulently obtain federal funds, he or she is to report the observation to the Director of Financial Aid (DFA), Vice Pres ident for Student Affairs or th e Director of Human Resources (DHR). Unless the report is that the DF A's conduct has caused the suspicion, the DFA is to be immediately advised of the evidence. If the DFA is suspected of fraudulent activity the report is to be ma de to the DHR. Otherwise, the DFA is responsible for assembling any available evidence and providing it along with a statement (usually in writing) of the suspect activity to t he OIG. The DFA will also refer the student for institutional disc iplinary action. The DFA may also be required to report the suspected fraudulent activity to state ag encies (and other entities) from which th e student received financial aid funds. FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 29 Return of Title IV (R2T4) Presentation College has established policies and procedures to define and administer the Retu rn of Title IV (R2T4) funds requirements as promulgated in the Higher Education Act (HEA), Section 668.16. The R2T4 policy includes information that reflects institutional procedures as well as text that is copi ed from the Federal Student Aid (FSA) Handbook, Volume 5 Chapter 1. The R2T4 policy governs the determination of students' eligib ility to receive funding from the following federal programs offered at Presentation College (PC) wh en they cease attendance in all Title IV eligible classes during a semester: Federal Pell Grant Federal Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Federal Direct Subsidized Loan Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan Federal Parent Loan for Unde rgraduate Students (PLUS) The U.S. Department of Education (ED) offers Title IV programs in addition to those listed ab ove. Presentation College only participates in the programs listed. The College adheres to federal policy, as set forth in the FSA Handbook and the Higher Education Ac t (HEA), Section 668.16, in the administration of R2T4 policies and procedures in all respects. Title IV funds are provided to students wi th the expectation that they will attend th eir classes for the entire period for whic h the assistance has been awarded. When students stop attending their classes, for any reas on including medical withdrawals or even circumstances that are beyond their control, they may no longer be eligible for the full amount of Title IV funds that they wer e originally awarded and may have already received. When students stop attending all of their Title IV eligible classes and are no longer participating in any academically-related activities (last date of engagement), the Co llege is required to determin e if the student is eligible to retain or to receive a ny Title IV financial aid. Federal regulations require the College to use a calculation called Return to Title IV (R2T4) to determine th e percentage of financial aid funds the student has earned as well as the am ount that is unearned. The R2T4 calculation is based upon the concept that students earn their financial aid in proportion to the number of days they are enrolled in and attending their classes. The calculation is ba sed upon the number of days th at the student attended as a percentage of the days in the semester. Under this reasoning, a student who withdraws in the second week of classes has earned less of his financial aid than a student who withdraws in the seventh week. Once students ha ve begun to attend approved classes, they begin to incrementally earn their Title IV financial aid (if they have completed their files and are otherwise el igible). Prior to the 60% point of the semester students earn a percentage of aid that increases with ea ch day of attendance. Once aid recipients have attended their classes for 60% of the semester, they ar e considered to have earned 100% of their financial aid (as long as they are otherwise eligible) for that term and will not be required to return any funds. If students withdraw from all of their Ti tle IV eligible courses prior to completing at least 60% of a semester, typically they would have earned only a portion of the federal financial aid that they received, or are scheduled to receive, for that term. I f a student remains enrolled in only those cour ses that are not Title IV eligible, an R2 T4 calculation is likewise required. A pror ated schedule is used to determine the amount and type of federal student aid funds they have and have not earned at the time of the withdrawal or cessation of attendance in all Title IV eligible classes. Of note, students may have earned a percentage of their Title IV financial aid when they begin and then cease attendance during the two-week add/drop period at the beginning of the seme ster. Thus, students may be eligible for a post-withdrawal disbursement of Title IV aid when they cease attendance prior to the census date, regardless of whether the College has disbursed aid or assessed any institutional charges. When students fail to attend their classes they could leave the College owing money because their charges for tuition, fees, housing and meal plan exceed the amount of financial aid that they have earned. For these reasons, st udents are strongly advised to meet with a member of the business office or FAO to discuss the financial conseque nces of dropping out of or withdrawing from the College before doing so. Determination for students who earn all \"F\" and other zero quality point grades When students receive all \"F\" and other zero quality point grades, the College is requir ed to determine if they earned the grad es or ceased to attend at some point in the semester. 30| PRESENTATION COLLEGE 2018-2019 CATALOG When final grades for the semester have been posted, the FAO reviews the records of those students who received any combination of \"F\", \"I\", \"U\", \"W\", and \"WF\" grades to identi fy the last date of attendance as submitted by the students' instructors. Order of return of Title IV funds to the federal programs As dictated by federal regulation, the FAO returns Title IV funds that the student has not earned to the applicable program in the following order: 1. Federal Direct Unsubsidized loan 2. Federal Direct Subsidized loan 3. Federal Direct Parent Loan fo r Undergraduate Students (PLUS) 4. Federal Pell Grant 5. Federal Supplemental Education al Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) 6. Federal Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant The student's grace period for loan repayment of unsubsidized an d subsidized Direct Loans will commence as of the date of the withdrawal from the College. The student's gr ace period is also triggered when he is no longer attending at least six credits. Students should contact the FAO if they have questions regarding their grace period or repayment status. Post-withdrawal disbursements If a student receives less federal student aid than the amount earned, the College must offer a disbursement of the earned aid that was not received. This is called a post-withdrawal disbursement. A post-withdrawal disbursement to the student for earned Title IV funds in excess of outstanding current (educationally related ) charges must be made as soon as possible, but no later than, 45 days for grants, and as soon as possible, but no later than, 18 0 days for loans. The College's policy is to make post-withdrawa l disbursements for grants within two weeks whenever it is possible to do so. Whenever possible, post-withdrawal disbur sements for loans are made within two weeks of the deadline established for the student to accept or decline the loan portion of a post-withdrawal disbursement. Institutional and student responsib ilities under the R2T4 policy The institution's responsibilities under the R2T4 policy include: 1. provide students with the info rmation about the R2T4 policy; 2. identify students affected by this po licy and complete the R2T4 calculation; 3. inform the student of the result of the R2T4 calculation an d any balance owed to the Colleg e from the required return of unearned funds; 4. return any unearned funds to th e applicable Title IV program(s); 5. notify the National Student Loan Data Syst em (NSLDS) of the student's withdrawal date; 6. notify the student (or parent, as applicable) of eligibility for a post-withdrawal disbursement, if any. The student's responsibilities under the R2T4 policy include: 1. review the R2T4 policy and unders tand how withdrawing from courses affects eligibility for Title IV aid; 2. adhere to the College's withdrawal policy and promptly notify the institution of intention to separate; 3. promptly pay any outstanding balance owed to Presentation College resulting from the required re turn of unearned Title IV aid; 4. pay all collections costs and attorney's fees that may be re quired to satisfy any balance th at the student fails to promptly pay. Sample R2T4 calculation To review an example of how the R2T4 calculation affects a stud ent who ceases attendance before the 60% point of the semester visit the financial aid pages on the College's website. Return to Title IV Questions The procedures and policies listed above are subject to change without advance notice as may be required by federal and institutional regulations.

LOAN PROGRAMS Federal Subsidized and Unsubs idized Direct Loan Program The purpose of the Federal Direct Loan Prog ram is to make low-interest, long-term loan s to students to assist them in meeting their educational expenses. First-time Federal Direct Loan borrowers are required to complete the Master Prom issory Note (MPN)* and entrance loan counseling prior to disbursement of funds. Once a student has comp leted the MPN, the Note is valid for ten years so long as it is used within the first year after it is signed. Students must be enrolled at least half-time (six credit hours) in an eligible p rogram to receive the funds from the Direct Loan Program. Students who are enrolled but are in less than six eligible credits at the t ime of disbursement are not eligible to receive Direct Loan funds. Repayment generally begins six mo nths after students graduate or drop below half-time (six credits) enrollmen t in an eligible program. Generally, borro wers may take up to 10 years (or more) to repay their federal student loans. FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 35 Federal Direct Subsidized Loan The Federal Direct Subsidized Loan is available to students wh o qualify based on their financial need*. Students who qualify fo r subsidized loan funds are not required to make interest paymen ts during in-school, deferment an d grace periods. Students who qualify for unsubsidized loan funds are required to make inte rest payments during in-school, deferment and grace periods. Students who qualify for unsubsidized loan funds may elect to capitalize their interest during in-school, deferment and grace periods. Otherwise, the same application processes, terms and conditions apply to both the subsidized and unsubsidized loan programs. After graduation or cessation of half-tim e enrollment students are required to make payments on both the principle borrowed and interest as it accrues on their subsidized (and unsubsidized) loans. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan The Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan is available to students who do not qualify for the Federal Direct Subsidized Loan based on their financial need*. The same application processes, terms and conditions apply to bo th the subsidized and unsubsidiz ed loan programs, except that unsubsidized loans require payment of interest during in-school and grace periods. Borrowers are required to begin making interest payments on unsubsidized loans wh ile they are still enrolled. Students may elect to capitalize the interest on their unsubsidized loans; however, this adds to the cost of borrowing. If they can afford to do so, students should make interest payments on their unsubsidized loans to ke ep the principle amount borrowed as low as possible. After graduation or cessation of half-time enrollment students are required to make payments on both the principle borrowed and interest as it accrues (as well as any accumulated capitalized inte rest) on their unsubsidized loans. Dependent students whose parents are not approved for a Direct PLUS Loan due to adverse credit history, may be able to receive additional unsubsidized direct loan funds. The following chart from https: //studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized shows the annual and aggregate limits for subsidized and unsubsidized loans. The student loans we bsite is an excellent source of information about the federal loan programs. Year Dependent Students (except students whose parents are unable to obtain PLUS Loans) Independent Students (and dependent undergraduate students whose parents are unable to obtain PLUS Loans) First-Year Undergraduate Annual Loan Limit $5,500\u2014No more than $3,500 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. $9,500\u2014No more than $3,500 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. Second-Year Undergraduate Annual Loan Limit $6,500\u2014No more than $4,500 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. $10,500\u2014No more than $4,500 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. Third-Year and Beyond Undergraduate Annual Loan Limit $7,500\u2014No more than $5,500 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. $12,500\u2014No more than $5,500 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Loan Limit $31,000\u2014No more than $23,000 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. $57,500 for undergraduates\u2014No more than $23,000 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. The aggregate loan limits include any subsidized Federal lo ans and unsubsidized Federal loans from both the Federal Family Education Loan and Direct Loan programs. If a student's grade level changes during the academic year and this results in additional direct loan eligibility, the student must submit a written request to the FAO for the additional funds. Direct Loan eligibility dur ing enrollment in an as sociate degree program Most of the College's associate degree progra ms are designed to be completed in two years. Students who are enrolled in an associate degree program are eligible to receive as a maximum th e loan amount for sophomores. Students are not eligible to exceed the annual sophomore loan level during any academic year even when th ey enroll for more than two years to complete any associate degree program. Simultaneous enrollment 36| PRESENTATION COLLEGE 2018-2019 CATALOG Students who are simultaneously enrolled in any combination of associate and/or baccalaureate degree programs are typically eligible to receive Direct Loan funds at the grade level for wh ich they qualify in the program that has the longest length. For example, a student who is simultaneously enrolled in associate and baccalaureate degr ee programs and has reached the junior grade level in the baccalaureate program is likely eligible for a junior level loan, even though the associate is a two-year program. Changes in type of program Students who are enrolled in a baccalaureate degree program and change to an associate program may decrease the amount of their eligibility for Direct Loan funds. For example, if a student is enrolled in a baccalaureate degree program in the fall se mester and has earned sufficient credits to place hi m at the junior grade level and changes to an associate program in the spring, his loan eligibility will decrease to the fres hman or sophomore level depending on th e student's academic progression in the associate program. In this scenario a portion of the student's loan for the spring semester must be cancelled and cannot be disbursed. Direct Loan eligibility for enro llment in the nursing programs Students who enter the College's nursing prog rams after previous enrollment at anothe r institution should carefully monitor the aggregate amount that they have borrowed. Nursing students should also carefully proj ect the amount that th ey anticipate they will borrow to complete their program to determine if they have sufficient remaining eligibility in Direct Loan funding. Nursin g students can monitor their annual and aggregate amounts bo rrowed from the federal studen t loan programs through the National Student Loan Data System at www.nslds.ed.gov If you are a nursing student who borrowed at one or more institut ions prior to your enrollment at Presentation College, please visit the FAO for assistance in understa nding your remaining loan eligibility. Loan Proration for graduating students The FAO is required to prorate loan eligibility for those stud ents who will graduate, or comp lete, their programs after one semester of enrollment during the academic year. For example, if a student will gr aduate at the end of the fall semester, the F AO is required to prorate her loan eligibility. The maximum that a student who enrolls for twelve credits is eligible to borrow is generally one-half of the annual amount fo r which she is otherwise eligible. Students who enroll for six or more but less than twelve credits are eligible for less than half of the annual maximum amount of loan funds. If you will graduate after attending only one semester in an ac ademic year, please visit the FA O for assistance in understandin g your remaining loan eligibility. Monitoring annual and aggregate amounts borrowed Students who have borrowed from any of the federal student loan programs can monitor th eir annual disbursements and aggregate amounts by logging into the National Student Loan Data System at www.nslds.ed.gov Changes in your program, number of credit s, and your prior borrowing history can significantly alter your eligibility for funding from the Direct Loan program. If you have questions about the aggregate or annual amounts that you have borrowed or are considering changes in your enrollment or program please visit the FAO for assistance in understanding your status. Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) The Direct PLUS program is available to credit-worthy pa rents of undergraduate dependent students. The parents of independent students are not eligible to borrow from the PLUS program for the student. The amount of loan eligibility is determined by the cost of attendance (COA )* minus the financial aid (including stud ent loans) already awarded. The students must be enrolled at least half-time (six credit hours) for the pa rent to be eligible for the PLUS program. A parent must comple te the Direct PLUS Loan Application and Master Promissory Note (MPN)* and submit authorization for a credit check. Dependent students whose parents are not approved for a Direct PLUS Loan due to adverse credit history may be able to receive additional unsubsidized Direct loan funds. Graduate PLUS Loan The Graduate PLUS loan program is availa ble to credit-worthy graduate level students. The amount of loan eligibility is determined by the cost of attendance (COA )* minus the financial aid (including stud ent loans) already awarded. The students must be enrolled at least half-time (five graduate credit hours) to be eligible for the PLUS pr ogram. The student must complete FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 37 the Graduate PLUS Loan Application, Mast er Promissory Note (MPN)*, Graduate PLUS Loan Entrance Counseling, and submit authorization for a credit check. Nursing Education Assistance Loan Program The 1998 South Dakota Legislature authorized this loan program to provide financia l assistance to qualified South Dakota residents who are admitted to a nursing program. The number an d amount of each loan will be determined annually by the South Dakota Board of Nursing but may not exceed $1,000 per full academic year. Studen t borrowers may elect to repay the loan either by employment in nursing in South Dakota at a conversion rate of $1 per hour or monetary payments within the required time period of five years. Applications are available at doh.sd.gov/boards/nursing/loan.aspx Alternative Loans Information on alternative loans is available on the Presen tation College website at www. presentation.edu/tuition-aid Alternative loans may be an option for qualifying students (and parents) who are in need of additional resources to cover education-related expenses. Typically alternative loans require that the borrower have a good credit history and may have minimum income levels as well as a maximu m debt-to-income ratio. Students and/or parents may borrow up to the remaining cost of attendance * for the student's education. Studen ts have the right to select a lender of their choice. FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID SATISFACTO RY ACADEMIC PROGRESS POLICY Presentation College (PC) has established the following policy and procedure to define and admi nister Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) for those students who are reci pients of Title IV* (or federal) funding, as well as several other types of finan cial assistance administered by the College. All recipients of Title IV * funding are governed by this policy as specified below. The SAP policy is in accordance with and refe rences the language from regulations, CF R 34, Section 668.16, promulgated under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (H EA), as amended. The Colleg e adheres to federal policy, as set forth in HEA in the administration of SAP for Title IV* recipients, in all respects. The College has also established academic standards apart from the SAP policy that go vern all students including those who are not Title IV* recipients. HEA requires that, to demonstrate admini strative capability, an institution must have a SAP policy th at is equivalent to or stricter for Title IV * recipients than the standards for students enrolled in the same educational program who are not receiving federal aid. Students who are Title IV* aid reci pients are also subject to all of the College's academic poli cies and must meet those standards in addition to the minimum fe deral policies detailed below. In those instances when the College's academic policies are stricter than the minimum SAP standard, students are subject to the College's academic policy for receipt, continuation or reinstatement of their Title IV (p . 29)* financial aid. Thus, PC's SAP policy is stricter for Titl e IV* recipients than it is for those students who are not receiving federal aid. For addi tional information ab out the College's acad emic progress policies that govern all students please read that section of the catalog. The SAP policy applies to the following types of Title IV* aid: Federal Pell Grant Federal Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant Federal Supplemental Education al Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Federal Work Study (FWS) Federal Direct Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) Federal Parent Loan for Unde rgraduate Students (PLUS) Federal Graduate PLUS Loan The SAP policy also applies to several other types of financial aid that are administered by th e College which may include, but not be limited to, institutional aid, Minnesota state grants and work study, and scholarships (which may require a higher grade point average than the minimum in the SAP policy). Academic progress (and other) requiremen ts for non-Title IV* aid are described in the eligibility criteria for those forms of assistance. Components of Presentatio n College's SAP Policy The quantitative and qualitative standards li sted below are used to evaluate the cumulative results of all periods of students' enrollment, including those semesters or pa yment periods during which they did not re ceive Title IV* funds or other types of financial assistance. Thus, a student who has not previously rece ived Title IV* aid may be ineligible to do so at initial application. The numbers that result from the qualitativ e and quantitative calculations for SAP ar e not rounded. Thus, the student's GPA and rate of completion must be equal to or ab ove the minimums cited below without rounding. 38| PRESENTATION COLLEGE 2018-2019 CATALOG 1. Frequency of evaluation: HEA requires that an institution evaluate SAP at least annually for programs that are longer than one year and every payment period for programs of one year or less. PC evaluates all components of SAP at the end of each academic year which corresponds to the end of the spring semester. Students who fail to meet the College's academic progress policy are reviewed at any time du ring the academic year for financial aid el igibility if they appeal their academic suspension and are permitted to return to the College. All students who submit the Free Application for Federal Stud ent Aid (FAFSA*), as well as those who receive any type of Title IV* financial assistance, are evaluated for SAP annu ally. Transfer students and th ose who are returning to the College after a hiatus are evaluated upon entry (or reentry), whether or not that point in time is at the end of the academic year. Financial aid recipients and applicants (upon submission of th e FAFSA) who are found not to be in satisfactory academic standing will be notified. Students can also check their eligibility status by logging into the student portal. When a change of grade is submitted subsequent to the SA P evaluation, PC will recalculate the student's SAP status using that new information. 2. Qualitative component: PC uses the student's grade point average (G PA) to measure qualitative progress. To meet this standard, Title IV* recipients are required to achieve and maintain a minimum cumulative 2.00 GPA for undergraduate programs of study and a minimum cumulative 3.00 GPA for graduate programs of study, which is consistent with PC's graduation requirements for most programs . If the Title IV* recipient is enrolled in a program that requires a higher GPA (usually 2.50 for undergraduate programs of study) the studen t must meet the program GPA in order to maintain eligibility for financial aid. When the GPA required by the program is higher than the SAP GPA, students will be considered to have met the SAP qualitative standard so long as they are eligible to continue in the pr ogram and their cumulative GPA is 2.00 or higher for undergraduate programs of study and 3.00 or higher for graduate programs of study. The cumulative GPA that PC uses to evaluate the student's SAP status is calculated ba sed upon all courses that have been attempted, excluding those that are developmental, audited, or have no quality points asso ciated with the course. Courses that have been repeated will have the highest grade earned calculated into the SAP GPA. Th e SAP GPA also includes grades for courses that have been forgiven under the College's ac ademic forgiveness policy. Thus, the GPA used to evaluate SAP may be different from the student's GPA on the academic transcript. 3. Quantitative component (maximum timeframe and pace of completion): HEA requires a quantitative component that evaluates the maximum timeframe in which students must comp lete their educational program and a pace of completion that ensures they will complete the progra m within the timeframe. PC requires that all financial aid recipients successfully complete a cumulative minimum of 67% of the credits that they attempt. Successful completion for this standard is defined as earning a grade of A, B, C, D, P or S (and any pluses or minuses assigned to the letter grade). Undergraduate financial aid recipients must also complete their pr ogram within 150% of the published length required for their program of study. Graduate students must complete their program within six years from the start of their program per academic requirements. The SAP quantitative calculat ion is based upon all courses that the students has attempted, including those that are developmental; the calculation also includes grades for courses that have been re peated or forgiven under the College's academic forgiveness policy. 4. ESL and developmental courses: Students may attempt a maximum of 30 credits of ESL and/or developmental coursework, during which time they may or may not be Title IV* recipients, prior to becoming ineligible for such funds during future attempts. Developmenta l and ESL courses are included in the quantitative assessments of SAP. 5. Changes of program: Students are permitted to make changes to th eir program in accordance with their academic goals. So long as students are meeting all other SAP standard s, changes of program alone will not disqualify them for Title IV* eligibility. After a change of program, the student's next scheduled SAP evaluation will include all previously attempted courses. The student's cumulative credits for this standard are the total of all courses attempted at PC combined with all transfer credits. Students who reach (or will reach) 150% of the length of their programs (below) and who are otherwise in satisfactory standing, may request a recalculation of their maximum timeframe based upon only those credits that are applicable to their degree. 6. Additional degrees: Students who seek additional degrees are trea ted in the same way as those who change their programs (as above). After the completion of the first degree (a t PC or elsewhere), the next scheduled SAP evaluation will include all previously attempted courses. The student's cumula tive credits for this standard are the total of all courses attempted at PC combined wi th all transfer credits. Students become ineligible for Title IV* aid when it be comes mathematically impossible to complete the program within 150% of the published length requ ired for their program of study, even when the student has not yet reached 150%. Students who are enrolled to complete an eligible asso ciate degree are eligible, but not guaranteed, to receive Title IV* for up to 150% of the published length required to complete the associate degree. FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 39 Students who are enrolled to complete an eligible ba ccalaureate degree are eligib le, but not guaranteed, to receive Title IV* for up to 150% of the published leng th required to complete the baccalaureate degree. Thus, the Title IV* recipient is subject to the limitation of 150% of the publis hed length required by the degree being sought. 7. Course incompletes, with drawals and WF grades: Successful completion of coursework is defined as earning a grade of A, B, C, D, P or S (and any pluses or minuses assigned to the letter grade) at PC. All other grades including I (Incomplete), F, U, WF and W (Withdrawn) are defined as unsuccessful completion. Accordingly, all courses having grades of I, F, U, WF and W count as the applicable credits attempte d and count as zero credits earned in the SAP calculation. The grades of F, I and WF additionally count as zero quality points when the qualitativ e SAP standard is assessed. Grades of P, S, U and W are not counted when the qualitative SAP standard is assessed. Grades of P, S, U and W do not carry any quality points. Students who have grades of Incomplete (I) and who are, as a result, in unsatisfactory standing, will have their SAP status recalculated when those grades are later reported as an A, B, C, D, P or S (and any pluses or minuses assigned to the letter grade). Students who receive other grade changes w ill also have their SAP status recalculated. Students who achieve satisfactory standing as the result of a grade recalculation will be evaluated for reinstatement of financial aid so long as the end of the same academic year has no t occurred and all other eligibility criteria are met. 8. Course repetitions: Under HEA regulations, Title IV* recipients ar e permitted to repeat a course in which they previously earned only failing grades (F, U, WF and W) without a limit, except as imposed by the SAP and College academic standards. Once a student has earn ed a grade of A, B, C, D, S or P (and any pluses or minuses assigned to the letter grade) one repeat of the course is permitted to be counted toward calculating Title IV* aid eligibility for any payment period or semester. All subsequent attempts of that course, ev en those required by the College, are ineligible for Title IV* funding. Course repetitions are counted in the ev aluation of the qualitative standard by using the highest grade earned. All course repetitions are counted in the quantitative SAP standard. 9. Transfer Credits: HEA regulations require that, at a minimum, transf er credits that are applicable toward the student's current program must count as both attempted and completed ho urs. PC counts all transfer credits as both attempted and completed hours when evaluating the quantitative SAP standard. 10. Financial aid warning semester: Students must meet all of the SAP stan dards to be considered in satisfactory academic standing. The College does not is sue a formal warning semester. Students ar e advised that if they are found to not be in satisfactory academic st anding at the end of the academ ic year they are immediately ineligible for Title IV* financial aid for the subsequent semester. Students who fail to reach all of the SAP standards and are ther efore not in satisfactory academic standing are ineligible to receive further Title IV* funding, unle ss they have submitted an appeal (as below) which is approved. Students who submit an appeal, which is approved, w ill be placed on probation and requir ed to follow an academic improvement (AIP) plan. 11. Financial aid probation: Students who fail to reach all of the SAP standards and are therefore not in satisfactory academic standing are only eligible to receive further Title IV* funding if they submit an appeal (as below) which is approved. Students who fail to reach all of the SAP standards after the probationary semester are also not in satisfactory academic standing and are ineligible to receive further Title IV * funding, unless they have submitted an appeal (as below) which is approved. Students who submit an appeal that is approved will be placed on probation and must continue to follow their academic plan. During any probationary semester the student must meet the SAP standards based upon their term GPA and term rate of cred it accumulation. Students are also required to meet the College's academic standards during any probationary semester. 12. SAP appeals: HEA regulations allow but do not require an institution to permit students who are not in satisfactory academic standing to appeal th eir status in order to receive Title IV* funds. PC permits such appeals. Title IV* applicants and recipients, who are not in satisfactory academic standing, may appeal their stat us by accessing the College's SAP appeal process as described on the website. All st udents, except those who are eligible to request a recalculation of their SAP status , who submit an appeal must also include a completed academic plan. In order to develop the academic plan, the student must meet with an advisor and adhere to all associated requirements. If the appe al has been approved, the student must adhere to the associated academic plan. The FAO will review the stud ent's progress at the end of the probationary semester to determine if the terms of the academic improvement pl an (AIP) have been met. Students who wish to change their academic plan must appeal to do so. Students who wish to appeal to change their academic plan should su bmit a letter to the FAO. In the appeal, the st udent must explain what has happened to make 40| PRESENTATION COLLEGE 2018-2019 CATALOG the change necessary and how academic progress can be achieved. The appeal letter should be accompanied by appropriate documentation. Students who wish to appeal must submit the SAP appeal form along with appropriate documentation to the FAO for evaluation. Students are responsible for developing and composing their own SAP appeal s. SAP appeals that were completed by anyone other than the student are not accept able and will be rejected. The FAO will respond to the appeal in writing by Presentation College email, and US Postal mail to the billing address, usually within two weeks of receiving the complete appeal. Students may contact the FAO to request the SAP appeal form and instructions. As required, PC reviews progress at the en d of the semester for those students on probation, to determine if the student is meeting the requirements of the academic plan. If the st udent is meeting the requiremen ts of the academic plan, the student is eligible to receive Title IV* aid so long as th e student continues to meet th ose requirements. Students who experience extenuating circumstances, that were reasonably unforeseeable at the beginning of the semester and that are beyond the student's control, may appeal. The circumstances that are cited in the appeal must be timely to the semester of enrollment during which the academ ic difficulty occurred. These extenuating circumstances must have been sufficiently disruptive that the studen t was prevented from continued enrollmen t and/or successful completion of the semester and meeting of the SAP standards. Students who are otherwise in good acad emic standing but who have exceeded 150% of the pu blished length required for their degree and who have changed their program of stud y no more than four times may appeal based solely upon their change of program without presen ting extenuating circumstances. Such students may request that their SAP status is recalculated based only on those credits which are applicable to their current pr ogram of study. Students who have failed one or more of the SAP standards and have ch anged their program more than four times are required to present and document extenuating circumstances with their appeal. Circumstances such as difficulty adjusting to college, time management issues, failure to balance social life against academic workload requirements, prioritization of other activities above coursework and inability to afford enrollment expenses in the absence of fina ncial aid are not alone sufficient to qualify as extenuating. Documented extenuating circumstances might include, but are not limited to: student's major illness or injury major illness or injury in the student's immediate family student's spouse's major illness or injury student's loss of employment student's parent's loss of employment student's spouse's loss of employment student's separation or divorce student's parent's separation or divorce death in the student's immediate family student's spouse's death student's deployment to active duty student's spouse's deployment to active duty student's parent's deployment to active duty natural disaster affecting the student natural disaster affecting the student's parent(s) natural disaster affecting the student's spouse All SAP appeals will be evaluated by th e SAP appeals committee or its designee. As noted in the instructions that accompany the SAP appeal process, the student must docume nt all extenuating circumstances, explain changes that will allow for academic success during future enrollment, and must submit an advisor-approved academic plan. Documentation typically consists of provider confirmation of injury or illness, an employer's separation letter, police incident or accident report, attorney's letter, divorce decr ee, deployment orders, obituary or death certificate as applicable; however, the SAP appeals committee or its designee solely determines the sufficiency of documentation in accordance with the circumstance(s) presented. If a SAP appeal is appr oved for a student who does not enroll for the ne xt scheduled semester, the approval is subject to submission to the SAP appeals committee for reevaluation . If the SAP appeals committee confirms that the approval is still valid the student is eligible to receive financial aid so long as all other eligibility criteria are met. If the SAP FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 41 appeals committee determines that the approval is not valid the student is ineligible for any financial aid that is governed by the SAP policy. 13. Reestablishing eligibility for Title IV* aid: Students who choose not to appeal, or whose appeals are not approved, may be able to reestablish eligibility for Title IV* aid. Such st udents may (if they are otherwise eligible) continue to enroll for courses at the College at their own expense until they have met all of the SAP standards that are applicable for Title IV* aid receipt. Neither paying for one's classes nor sitting out for a term affects a student's academic progress standing, so neither (alone or together) is sufficient to reestablish aid e ligibility if the student has not met all SAP standards. 14. Satisfactory Academic Progress definitions: Appeal: The process by which a student who is not meeting SAP standards petitions PC based upon extenuating circumstances for reconsideration of eligibility for financial aid funds. Financial aid probation semester: The status PC assigns to a student who is failing to make satisfactory academic progress and who successfully appeals. Eligibility for aid is re instated for one payment period or semester. During any probationary semester the student must meet the SAP standa rds based upon their term GP A and term rate of credit accumulation. Maximum timeframe: For an undergraduate program measured in credit hours, the maximum timeframe is a period no longer than 150% of the published le ngth of the program. Students become ineligible for Title IV* aid when it becomes mathematically impossible to complete the program wi thin 150% of the length of the program, even when the student has not reached 150%. Graduate students have ex ceeded their maximum timefr ame when they have not completed their program within the six year program limit. Payment Period: The definition of a payment pe riod applies to all FSA programs except FWS. The common definition is integral to requirements for the administration of FSA funds in that FSA program disbursements (except FWS payments) must be made on a payment period basis, and a student's satisfactory academic progress (SAP) evaluation is required to correspond with the end of a payment period. At Presentation College a payment period is equivalent to a semester. Minnesota State Programs Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy Students who receive Minnesota State Grant, Minnesota Postseco ndary Child Care Grant, Minneso ta Indian Scholarship, and Minnesota Work-study are subject to the Federal Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy (SAP) requirements as outlined in the College Catalog in order to maintain eligibility to receive these fu nds. Students who fails to meet the SAP standards will be disqualified from furthe r Minnesota State financial aid funding. Glossary of terms used in the financial aid section Award Letter The College updates information in the students' portal as the me thod of notifying fi nancial aid applicants of the financial ai d assistance offered. These updates are considered an electronic award letter. The paper or elec tronic award letter provides information on the types and amounts of financial aid offered, as well as specific program information, student responsibilitie s, and the conditions which govern the award. Students are considered to have accepted all aid amounts that th ey do not decline. Students should decline those forms of ai d that they do not wish to receive. Cost of Attendance (COA) The COA (or student's budget) is the total estimated amount it will cost the st udent to attend Presentation College for one academic year consisting of th e fall and spring semesters. The COA for those students who enroll for three semesters (fall, spr ing and summer) during the academic year is increased so that it also includes the estimated costs for the summer term. The COA includes tuition and fees; room and board (or a housing and food allowance); and allowances for books, supplies, transportation , loan fees, and dependent care. It also includes miscellaneous an d personal expenses; may include an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer; costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. Contac t the FAO at PC if you have any unusual educationally -related expenses that might affect your COA. The College's COAs for full-time and half-t ime students are detailed on the website in the financial aid pages. Full-time is defined as enrollment for twelve or more credits per semester. Half-time is defined as enrollment for six to eight credits per semester. The College also calculates a prorated COA for studen ts who enroll three-quarter-time (nine to eleven credits) and less-than half-time (five credits or less) per semester. For studen ts attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition a nd fees, an allowance for books, supplies and transportation; room and board expenses ar e not included. Students who enroll on a 42| PRESENTATION COLLEGE 2018-2019 CATALOG less-than half-time basis are not eligible for federal Direct loan s, thus loan fees are not included in the COA for this enroll ment status. If a less-than-half-time student app lies for and is eligible to receive an alternative loan the COA can be adjusted. Expected Family Contribution (EFC) This is the number that is used to determine the student's eligibility for federa l student financial aid. This number results f rom the analysis of the financial information the student provides on the FAFSA*. The EFC is reported to the student on the Student Aid Report (SAR). Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) The application that is used to apply for federal student aid, such as federal grants, loans, and work-study. The FAFSA must be filed for each year of enrollment. The College's FAFSA priority deadline is March 1. Master Promissory Note (MPN) The MPN is a binding legal document that the student (or parent) borrower must sign in order to apply for a federal student (or parent) loan. The MPN can be used to make one or more loans for one or more academic years (usu ally up to 10 years). It lists the terms and conditions under which the student (or parent ) agrees to repay the loan and explains the rights and responsibilities of the borrower. It is important to read and save the MPN to refer to it later when loan repayment begins or a t other times to access information about provisions of the loan, such as deferments or forbearances. Need Financial need is the number that result s when the student's EFC is subtracted fr om the COA. In the following example the student's estimated cost for tuition, fees, books, housing, me als and personal expenses totals $30,000 for one academic year. $30,000 COA - $ 5,820 EFC = $24,180 Need In this example the st udent is eligible for a maximum of $24,180 in financial aid that is based upon need. Return to Title IV (R2T4) When students stop attending all of their classes and are no lo nger participating in any academically-related activities the College is required to determine if the student is eligible to retain or to receive any Title IV* financial aid. Federal regula tions require the College to use a calculation called R2T4 to determin e the percentage of financial aid the student has earned as wel l as the amount that is unearn ed. The calculation is based upon the number of days that the student attended as a percentage of the days in the term. Once students have begun to attend approv ed classes they begin to incrementally earn their Title IV* financial aid (if they are otherwise eligible). Prior to the 60% point of the semester studen ts earn a percentage of aid that increases with each day of attendance. After the 60% point of the semester students are cons idered to have earned 100% of their Title IV* financial aid. When students fail to attend their classes they could leave th e College owing money because their charges for tuition, fees, th e suites, and meal plan are higher than the am ount of financial aid that they have earn ed. Students are advised to meet with a st aff member in the business or FAO to discuss the financial consequences of dropping out or withdrawin g from the College before doing so. Title IV Title IV* financial aid is also called federal financial aid. The Title IV* programs were created with the passage of the Highe r Education Act in 1965. All Presentation College campuses participate in th ese Title IV* programs: Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, and Supplementa l Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) pr ograms; Direct Loans (for students and parents); and Federal Work-Study (FWS). The College also offers state and institutional scholarships and grants. To apply for Title IV* aid, students must file the FAFSA for each year of college. Presentation College reserves the right to update and change these and all other financ ial aid policies as may be required by federal, state and institutional regula tions at any time and without prior notice. FINANCIAL AID & FINANCIAL INFORMATION| 43 TUITION AND FEES Tuition and fees for the academic year may be found at http://www.presentation.edu/aberdeen/tuition-aid/ Student Billing Statement, Balance Due and Refund of Credit Balance Once a student has registered at Presentation College, the st udent's billing information can be viewed online through the Student Portal. The billing statement on the Student Portal will de tail what costs will be incurred for that semester, along wi th any payments made and pending financial aid that will be app lied to the balance. Any changes to students' schedules may generate a change in billing and financial aid. It is the stud ents' responsibility to check their ledger periodically throughou t the semester. All students are required to sign a Payment Agreement and Initial Disclosu re form each year. The form is available online at www.presentation.edu/tuition-aid/tuition-fees/ and must be submitted once per year. Failu re to complete this form will result in a HOLD being place on your student ac count and will prevent future registration or release of transcripts. The Payment Agreement and Initial disclosure document contains the official explanation of the College's payment policies. Students are expected to pay any balance due to the College prio r to the first day of each term . The balance due is calculated based on the term charges less payments made to date and less the pending financial aid shown on the statement. Financial aid will be posted to students' accounts within three (3) days of receipt of the funds from the U.S. Department of Education. If a student's payments, including financial aid, exceed the charges shown on the statement, the student will have a credit balance and will be issued a refund within 14 days of the date financial aid funds are received by the College. Refer to the website for the dates refund checks will be processed each seme ster. Students are encouraged to complete a form for automatic deposit of their refund checks in order to receive the refund as quickly as possible.

Late Fees A late payment fee of $50 per month may be assessed on unpaid accounts, including accounts not settled by the first day of clas s, unpaid accounts as of the first of each month, and delinquent payments on monthly payment plans. Unpaid Accounts and Business Holds Students with unpaid balances who have not made payment arrangements with the College will have a HOLD placed on their account. A HOLD means the College will not issue degrees, transcr ipts, employment placement cred entials, financial aid, final grade reports, or statements of honorable dismissal. Students are also not permitted to register for subsequent terms once a HOLD has been placed on an account. If students fail to pay any balance due at the specified ti me, they may be administratively withdrawn from the College. Delinquent accounts may be transferred to a collection agency an d fees for this service will be added to students' accounts. Students with unpaid balances who have not made payment arrangements with th e College may have their Moodle access suspended . A suspension will remain on the stud ent's account until the balance is paid in full or a payment plan has been agreed upon. If payment in full or a payment plan are not co mpleted within 5 days of the suspension, the student may be administratively withdrawn from courses. Institutional Refund Policy - Withdrawal Withdrawing from a course (within the publicized add/drop refund period) Students who wish to withdraw from a re gistered course and receive a tuition/fees adjustment must initiate the necessary process with their academic advisor. In so me cases, financial aid that has been awar ded or disbursed to the student may require adjustment. 44| PRESENTATION COLLEGE 2018-2019 CATALOG Withdrawing from a course (after the publicized deadline for a refund) Students who wish to withdraw from a sc heduled course after the publicized add/drop period must complete the necessary process with their academic advisor. In so me cases, financial aid that has been awar ded or disbursed to the student may require adjustment. Withdrawal from College Students who wish to withdraw from the College must contact their academic advisor or the Registrar's Office. When students officially withdraw from the College or stop attending all of thei r classes during the early weeks of the semeste r, they may be eligible to be assessed only a percentage of costs as sessed for the semester; they may also be eligible to retain a percentage of their federal, state and institutional financial ai d to assist them with the payme nt of their costs due to the Co llege. Students must officially withdraw by us ing the appropriate forms and completing the withdrawal proce ss. When students complete the official withdrawal process, th e date on which the withdrawal form is received is used to determine the percentage of tuition and other account charges the College will assess. St udents who wish to withdraw fr om the College should contact their advisor or the Registrar' s Office and complete the official withdrawal process. When it is not possible for students to complete the official withdrawal process or they stop attending their classes without providing notice, the College will determine their withdrawal date once the College becomes aware that a student is no longer attending classes.

The institutional refund policy for dropped classes is described in the Tuition and Fees (p. 43) section. Classes held in an accelerated format can be added or dropped according to the above policy regardless of start date; however, financial aid adjustments will not be made. NOTE: *Summer session add/drop requirements may vary and are posted on the summer schedule STUDENT CLASSIFICATION Undergraduate students are consid ered full-time when enrolled in 12 or more cr edit hours per semester during the academic year. Students enrolled in fewer than 12 credit hours are classified as part-time. Summer session classifications vary. The number of semester credits completed towards grad uation classifies students in the following levels: Freshman = 0-29 semester credits Junior = 60-89 semester credits Sophomore = 30-59 semester credits Senior = at least 90 semester credits CREDIT HOUR EXPLANATION In an effort to ensure conformity with commonly accepted practi ces in higher education, Presentation College utilizes the U.S. Department of Education's definition of a credit hour. A credit ho ur is an amount of work that reasonably approximates (1) one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimu m of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately 15 weeks for one semester or at least the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or (2) at least an equivalent amount of work as requ ired in paragraph (1) of this definition fo r other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, in ternships, practicum, studio work, and ot her academic work leading to the award of credit hours. 52| PRESENTATION COLLEGE 2018-2019 CATALOG CLASS LOAD For undergraduate students, the recommended academic load is 12-15 credit hours during a regular semester. To exceed 18 credit hours requires the recommendation of the faculty advisor, written approval of the Vice President for Academics, and a 3.00 (B) cumulative grade point average. STUDENT ACADEMIC LOAD EXPECTATION The average student workload for one credit hour would be one clock hour of direct teacher interaction plus two clock hours of outside work related to the course. At Presentation College , a 15 credit semester schedu le would require an average commitment of 45 hours per week for 15 weeks. This definition is consistent with the U.S. Department of Education's expectation. Laboratory courses, clinicals, practicums and inte rnships vary in expectations an d are outlined in the course syllabus. ATTENDANCE Students are expected to attend every class session and be on ti me. Online students report their attendance by participating in their online course(s) as designated by the instructor. If for any reason students must be absent from class, the responsibilit y of making up work rests entirely upon the students. Each facult y member has the responsibility to develop his/her own policy on class attendance. The instructor's attendance policy must be included in the syllabus. This should include statements regarding make-up work and the relationship of attendance to grading. The added costs of supervision for missed classes/clinicals may accrue to the students. Faculty and administration will honor officially approved absences where individuals or groups ar e absent as part of a College- sponsored activity or in the inte rest of the College. The director of the activity and the students will be responsible for not ifying the appropriate faculty and staff prior to th e absence. Officially approved absences may include tours, athletic competitions, field trips, and professional conferences. Faculty are required to track and report stud ent attendance on a weekly ba sis. In addition, faculty are to report a last date o f attendance for students who have not met any of the activities included in the definition of academic attendance found in 34 CFR 668.22(l)(7)(i) within 12 days of last attendance, or less if specified in the course syllabus. Please see the Last Date of Attendance (p. 52) section for more information. LAST DATE OF ATTENDANCE In determining a last date of attendance for students, Presenta tion College utilizes the definition of academic attendance foun d in 34 CFR 668.22(l)(7)(i) \"Academic attendance\" and \"attendance at an academically-r elated activity\"\u2014 1. Include, but are not limited to\u2014 a. Physically attending a class where there is an opportunity for direct interaction between the instructor and students; b. Submitting an ac ademic assignment; c. Taking an exam, an interactive tutorial, or computer-assisted instruction; d. Attending a study group that is assigned by the institution; e. Participating in an online discu ssion about academic matters; and f. Initiating contact with a faculty member to ask a ques tion about the academic subjec t studied in the course; and 2. Do not include activities where a student may be present, but not academic ally engaged, such as\u2014 a. Living in institutional housing; b. Participating in the institution's meal plan; c. Logging into an online class without active participation; or d. Participating in academic counseling or advisement. Faculty are to report a last date of attendance for students wh o have not met any of the functi ons listed in (A)(1) through (A) (6) above within twelve calendar days of last attendance, or less if specified in the course syllabus. After receipt of a last date of attendance, the advisor will be notified of attendance issues and will make contact with the student. If the student does not respond, a formal letter will be sent by the Registrar's Office indicating a possible administrative withdrawal.

The first digit indicates the level of college study: 0xx = Courses that are remedial and do not carry credit toward any degree* 1xx = Courses primarily for students in their first year of college study 2xx = Courses primarily for students in their second year of college study 3xx = Courses primarily for students in their third year of college study 4xx = Courses primarily for students in their fourth year of college study 5xx = Courses primarily for students in th eir first year of a graduate program+ 6xx = Courses primarily for students in their second year of a graduate program *Remedial courses carry no degree credit and ar e not calculated in the grade point average. +Undergraduate students are permitted to take graduate courses, limited to 500-level courses only , provided the student is in his or her senior year and in good standi ng within their current program (GPA of 3. 00 or higher, has advisor approval, has the approval of the program director housing the graduate co urse, and whose financial account is in good standing). GRADING POLICIES Grading System Student achievement is determined by evalua tive procedures according to objectives set by instructors. This achievement is reported by instructors and assi gned grade points per credit hour according to the following: ACADEMIC POLICIES| 55 A = 4.0 grade points - outstanding achievement A- = 3.7 grade points B+ = 3.3 grade points B = 3.0 grade points - more than satisfactory performance B- = 2.7 grade points C+ = 2.3 grade points C = 2.0 grade points - satisfactory performance C- = 1.7 grade points D+ = 1.3 grade points D = 1.0 grade points - passing but less than satisfactory D- = 0.7 grade points F = 0.0 grade points - unsatisfactory performance AU Audit. Not computed into GPA. I Incomplete. Given when some portion of the work is lackin g for a satisfactory reason. Students who receive an \"I\" (Incomplete) in a course must complete the course by the last date to add a course in the next semester (spring/fall) or as designated on the Incomplete Contract. If the coursework is not completed by that date, students will receive an \"F\". Students with an \"I\" on their record cannot be considered for the President's List or Dean's List in that semester until the Incomplete is graded. Not computed into GPA. P Pass. Not computed into GPA. S Satisfactory performance. Not computed into GPA. U Unsatisfactory performance. Not computed into GPA. W Student- or College-initiated withdrawal through 60% of semester (publicized wi thdrawal date). Does not affect the GPA, but is considered as credit hours attempted for financial aid purposes. Not computed into GPA. WF Student- or College-initiated withdrawal after 60% of semester (publicized withdrawal date). WF is computed in the GPA at 0.00 grade points per credit hour. WU Student- or college-initiated withdrawal after 60% of semest er (published withdrawal date) from a course graded S/U. WU is not computed in the GPA. To calculate GPA, multiply the grade points by the number of co urse credits. Divide the total gr ade points by the total number of course credits. Example: Course Grade Grade Points Graded Credits Total Points EN113 A 4.0 x 3 = 12.0 HMS324 B+ 3.3 x 4 = 13.2 There are a total of 7 credits with a total of 25.2 grad e points. 25.2 points divided by 7 credits = 3.60 GPA. Students who complete and/or earn unde rgraduate degrees from Pres entation College and subsequently pursue a graduate degree will have separate cumulative GPAs on their acad emic record. Undergraduate de grees include associate and baccalaureate. Transcripts will illustrate the complete academic record and note the separation of the undergraduate and graduate GPAs. Course Repeat Policy for Undergraduate Students If a student repeats a course, the record of all attempts will be retained on the student's tran script. Cumulative totals will be adjusted in the term in which the highest grade is achieved, and the cumulative GPA wi ll thereafter be computed using only the 56| PRESENTATION COLLEGE 2018-2019 CATALOG highest grade1. The cumulative GPA will remain unch anged up to the term in which the hi ghest grade is achieved. Students are allowed to enroll in a course three times. This repeat policy will affect courses repeated from Fall 2014 forward. Graduate students should refer to the Course Repeat Policy (p. 137) in their section of the catalog. 1See the Federal Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy (p. 37) section for more information. Grade Reports Grades are submitted at the end of each semester and are accessed through the student portal. Students may not receive transcripts until outsta nding financial accounts have been paid. Access to final grades may be withheld from students with outstanding financial accounts.

Such identified practice may be either academic or non-academic in nature. Academic/Non-Academic Appeal/Grievance Defined For the purpose of the policy and procedur es that follow, academic/non-academic appeals/grievances refer to a substantial complaint of a serious nature. It is a student's claim of injury or wrong resulting from a decision, practice, or act by a memb er or members of faculty, administration, or staff, which is arbitr ary and capricious, unjust, oppre ssive, discriminatory, fundamenta lly unfair, or exceeds the limits of academic freedom. For any matter to give rise to such an appe al/grievance subject to these procedures there must be clear and convinci ng evidence, which demonstrates either arbi trary or capricious action on the part of the individual faculty, administration, or staff member or acti on which is oppressive, discrimin atory, fundamentally unfair, or which exceeds the limits of academic freedom. The evidence must also establish that such action was injuriou s. In all such appeals or grievances, the burden of proof and persuasion is upon the student. Academic/Non-Academic Appeal/Grievance Process Students who wish to appeal or grieve academic or non-acad emic actions/decisions are to follow appropriate channels of communication in seeking resolution of diff erences. Note: ordinarily a final grade ma y not be appealed. In order for a student to pursue an appeal of a final grade, the st udent must have specific concrete evidence that the grade was either erroneously or unfairly awarded. A challenge to a grade received in a course , comprehensive examination, or other graduation requirement ACADEMIC POLICIES| 59 will be considered only when the student a lleges that the grade received reflects othe r than appropriate academic criteria, tha t is, achievement and proficiency in the subject matter as stated in the course syllabus. When a student appeals a final grade, the student will provide the faculty memb er with a copy of all petitions. Informal Phase: When a student believes that he/she has a grievance or compla int related to his/her enrollment and successful progress at the College, within 10 business days of the action for which the grievance is being filed, the student must approach the instructor/staff/administrator directly and attempt to reach an understanding at that level. In those rare instances where a student believes that a direct approach might prejudice his/he r standing, the student may bring the problem directly to the attention of the instructor/staff person's supervisor or Dean. Th e Informal Phase shall last no longer than two weeks from the date the grievance was initiated. Formal Phase: Level 1. In those instances in which a satisfactory resolution is not secured in the Informal Phase, and in those instances where the grievance involved more than a sing le event/course or College employee: 1. The student should provide written no tification of the complaint to the appr opriate Dean and/or area supervisor within two weeks after the comple tion of the Informal Phase. 2.

ACADEMIC POLICIES| 61 ACADEMIC INTEGRITY Academic Integrity - Policies and Procedures Inherent in the mission of Presentation Co llege is the strong belief in the principle of academic integrity. Students' actions reflect their moral character and, by extension, the College's reputation . Therefore, all students are ex pected to recognize and abide by the following: It is a major responsibility of students and faculty to promote academic integrity. The College will not tolerate violations by cheating, plagiarism, fabrication and other academic misconduct. The principles of academic integrity require that a student: properly acknowledge and cite all use of the ideas, results, or words of others. properly acknowledge all contribu tors to a given piece of work. make sure that all work submitted as his or her own in a co urse or other academic activity is produced without the aid of impermissible materials or impermissible collaboration. obtain all data or results by ethical means and report them accurately without suppressing any results inconsistent with his or her interpretation or conclusions. treat all other students in an ethica l manner, respecting their integrity and right to pursue their educational goals without interference. This requires that a student neither fa cilitate academic dishonesty by others nor obstruct their academic progress. uphold the canons of the ethical or professional code of the profession for whic h he or she is preparing. Adherence to these principles is ne cessary in order to ensure that: everyone is given proper credit for his or her idea s, words, results, and other scholarly accomplishments. all student work is fairly evaluated and no stud ent has an inappropriate advantage over others. the academic and ethical developmen t of all students is fostered. the reputation of the College for integrity in its teachi ng, research, and scholarship is maintained and enhanced. The faculty shares the responsibility for educating students about the importance and principles of academic integrity. Faculty members are expected to inform students of the particular re quirements regarding academic in tegrity within their specific courses, to make reasonable efforts to minimize academic dish onesty, and to respond appropriat ely to violations of academic integrity. Faculty members are strongly encouraged to provid e a statement concerning academ ic integrity and a link to the Academic Integrity Policy on their course syllabi. Students are responsible for understandin g the principles of academic integrity and abiding by them in all aspects of their work at Pr esentation College. An online tu torial on academic integrity is required in some courses at Presentation College. Once students pass the online examin ation they will receive a score in Moodle indicating they have been educated on th e academic integrity policy at Presentation College. Students not in a course that requires this can ask to take it to assess their knowledge. Students are also encour aged to help educate fellow students about academic integrity and to bring all alleged violations of academ ic integrity they encounter to the attention of the appropriate authorities. Violations of Academic Integrity and Recommended Sanctions Types of Violations Plagiarism Plagiarism is the act of presenting anothe r person's work as your own without approp riate acknowledgement of his or her work. You commit plagiarism if you: Quote or paraphrase from another pape r without crediting the original author. Fail to cite information or ideas from another source. Propose another author's idea as if it were your own. Submit a paper to be graded or reviewed that you have not written on your own. Copy answers or text from another cl assmate and submit it as your own. Cite data without crediting the original source. Fabricate references or use incorrect references. Submit someone else's presentation, program, assignment, spreadsheet, or other file with only minor alterations. This is not a definitive list - any action, which misleadingly im plies someone else's work is your own, can constitute plagiari sm. Levels of Plagiarism 62| PRESENTATION COLLEGE 2018-2019 CATALOG Various levels of plagiarism are recognized from intentional to unintentional plagiarism; however, all are unacceptable in submitted assignments. Level 1 plagiarism is plagiarism that is perceived to be due to a student' s inexperience with academic writing or presentation of academic work, or a lack of kn owledge of the conventions used for paraphrasing, referencing, or acknowledging sources, rather than an intention to deceive. Level 1 plagia rism is not considered an academic integr ity violation, but is reported for trackin g purposes. Level 1 plagiarism is defined as doing any of the following without attribution for a minima l portion of the assignment: Inserting verbatim phrases of 2-3 distinctive words. Submitting synonyms into the original sentence rather than rewriting the complete sentence. Reordering the clauses of a sentence. Imitating the sentence, paragraph, or organizational structure, or writing style of a source using a source's line of logic, thesis, or ideas. Faculty should use instances of Level 1 plagiarism as teaching opportunities and adjudicate it themselves as deemed appropriate. Instances of Level 1 plagiarism should be report ed to the academic integrity committee for tracking purposes. Level 2 plagiarism describes incidents where student conduct is consider ed dishonest and unfair in connection with their academic work. Level 2 plagiarism is considered a minimal academic integrity violation, and is subject to the sanctions for minimal violations described in the Levels of Violations and Sanctions section. Level 2 plagiarism is defined as doing any of the following: Any of the Level 1 items without attribution to the extent that it comprises a significant portion of the assignment. Multiple occurrences of Level 1 plagiarism. Inserting verbatim sentences or longer passages from a source. Combining paraphrasing with verbatim sent ences to create a paragraph of more text. Reusing or modifying a previously submitted assignment for a present assignment without obtaining prior approval from the instructors involved. Level 3 plagiarism describes serious incidents where student conduct is considered dishonest and unfair in connection with their academic work. Level 3 plagiarism is considered a substantial academic integrity violation and is subject to the sanction s for substantial violations described in the Levels of Violations and Sanctions section. Level 3 plagiarism is defined as doing any of the following: Multiple occurrences of Level 2 plagiarism. Submitting or presenting someone's complete published or unpublis hed work (paper, article, or chapter). Submitting another student's work fo r an assignment, with or without th at person's knowledge or consent. Using information from a campus file of old assignments. Downloading a paper from a web site. Buying a paper from a mail order co mpany, web site, or another student. Cheating Cheating is the use of inappropriate or proh ibited materials, information, sources, or aids in any academic exercise. Cheating also includes Level 3 plagiarism such as submitting papers, rese arch results and reports, analyses, etc., as one's own work whe n they were, in fact, prepared by others. Some common examples are: Receiving research, programming, data coll ection, or analytical assi stance from others or working with another student on an assignment where such help is not permitted. Copying another student's work or an swers on a quiz or examination. Using or possessing books, notes, calculators, cell phones, or other prohibited devices or materials during a quiz or examination. Preprogramming a calculator or other electronic device to contain answers, formul as, or other unauthorized information for use during a quiz or examination. Acquiring a copy of an examination fr om an unauthorized source prior to the examination, including the use of websites to find answers to textbook's test bank. Having a substitute take an examination in one's place. Submitting as one's own work a term paper or other assignment prepared by someone else. ACADEMIC POLICIES| 63 Fabrication Fabrication is the invention or falsification of sources, citati ons, data, or results, and recording or reporting them in any academic exercise. Some examples are: Citing a source that does not exist. Making up or falsifying evidence or data or other source materials. Falsifying research papers or reports by selectively omitting or altering data that do no t support one's conclusions or claimed experimental precision. Facilitation of Dishonesty Facilitation of dishonesty is knowingly or negligently allowing on e's work to be used by other students without prior approval of the instructor or otherwise aiding others in committing violations of academic integrity. A student who intentionally facilitates a violation of academic integrity can be considered to be as culpable as the student who receives the impermissible assistance, even if the facilitator does no t benefit personally from the violation. Some examples are: Collaborating before a quiz or examination to develop methods of exchanging information. Knowingly allowing others to copy answers to work on a quiz or examination or assisting others to do so. Distributing an examination from an unauthorized source prior to the examination. Distributing or selling a term paper to other students. Taking an examination for another student. Violations Involving Potentially Criminal Activity Violations in this category include theft, fraud, forgery, or distribution of ill-gotten materi als committed as part of an act of academic dishonesty. Some examples are: Stealing an examination from a faculty member's or College office or from electronic files. Selling or distributing a stolen examination. Forging of any College document Falsifying a College transcript. Levels of Violations and Sanctions Any violation of academic integrity is a serious offense and is therefore subject to an appropriate sanction or penalty. Academ ic integrity violations at Presentation College are classified into two levels called minimal and substantial. Minimal violations are less severe violations for which the possible sanctions do no t include suspension or expulsion from the College; substantial violations are more severe violations for which the possible sanctions include suspension or expulsion. Whether a given violation is classified as minimal or substantial depends on a number of factors including: the nature and importance of the academic exercise; the degree of premeditation or planning; the extent of dishon est or malicious intent; the academic experienc e of the student; and whether the violation is a first-time or repeat offense. 1. Minimal Violations Minimal violations are less serious violations of academic integrity. These violations are generally quite limited in extent or represent a small percentage of the total co urse work. Below are a few examples of violations that are most often considered minimal, at least when committed as a first- time offense. This list is not exhaustive and classification of a given violation a s substantial or minimal is always heavily dependent on the facts and circumstances of the violation. Any instances of Level 2 plagiarism. Unpremeditated cheating on a quiz or minor examination. Unauthorized collaboration with anothe r student on a homework assignment. Citing a source that does not exist or th at one has not read on minor assignments. Fabricating a small number of data points on a laboratory exercise. Signing in for another student via attendance sheet or clicke r in a course in which attendan ce counts toward the grade. An alleged second minimal violation is treated as an alleged substantial violation Sanctions for minimal violations include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following, and do not include suspension o r expulsion: Required participation in a noncredit workshop or seminar on ethics or academic integrity. 64| PRESENTATION COLLEGE 2018-2019 CATALOG An assigned paper or research project re lated to ethics or academic integrity. A make-up assignment that may be more difficult than the original assignment. No credit for the original assignment. A failing grade on the assignment. A failing grade for the course. Disciplinary warning or probation. 2. Substantial Violations Substantial violations are very serious violations of academic in tegrity that affect a more significant portion of the course w ork compared to minimal violations. Below are some examples of viol ations that are most often cons idered substantial. Again, the list is certainly not exhaustive and classification of a given violation as minimal or substantial is always heavily dependent on the exact facts and circumstances of the violation. A second minimal violation. Any instances of Level 3 plagiarism. Cheating, as described above. Fabrication, as described above. Facilitation of dishonesty, as described above. Knowingly violating research or professional ethics. Any violation involving potentially criminal activity. Sanctions for substantial violations include, but are not limited to, one or more of th e following, and may, but need not, invo lve suspension or expulsion: A grade of F for the course Dismissal from a departmental or school honors program. Denial of access to internships, ex ternships, or research opportunities Loss of appointment to academically-based positions. Loss of departmental/graduate program endorsements for internal and external fellowship support and employment opportunities. Removal of teaching assistantship, scholarships, or work-study support. Suspension for one or more semesters. Permanent expulsion from the College wi th a permanent notation of disciplinary expulsion on the stud ent's transcript. Faculty should report all substantial violations to the committee for adjudication. The recommendations for sanctions at each level are not binding, but are intended as guidelines for the College community. For both minimal and substantial violations, the severity of the sanc tion imposed should be proporti onal to the severity of the violation committed. Administration of the Academic Integrity Policy Role of Faculty and Administration Faculty and staff at Presentation College are required to report instances of student academic misconduct. Minimal violations can be adjudicated by the faculty member, but an incidence report must still be filed. Faculty/Academic Staff Faculty and academic staff are the expect ed to promote academic integrity and ed ucate students about the importance and principles of academic integrity. Faculty members are expected to inform students of the part icular requirements regarding academic integrity within their specific courses, to make reas onable efforts to minimize acad emic dishonesty, and to respond appropriately to violations of academic integrity. Academic Integrity Committee Academic Integrity Committee is a standing Faculty Assembly Committee. Membership of the committee includes a representative from each academic depa rtment and a representative from Studen t Government Association. Each faculty committee member is elected for a two-year term. The Academic Integrity Committee will help educate faculty and students concerning academic integrity, advise faculty members concerni ng academic integrity policies and procedures, and adjudicate allegations of academic integrity. 1. The Academic Integrity Committee will meet regularly to review cases of alleged student academic misconduct. If needed, the Committee will conduct an investigation of the comp laint, including but not limited to interviewing the person ACADEMIC POLICIES| 65 bringing the complaint forward and the student accused. The Committee will determine whether adequate evidence is available to warrant student sanctions and determine the leve l of sanction deemed appropriate for the level of student academic misconduct. a. For minimal offenses the Academic Integrity Committee, at the request of the faculty member, can provide a written statement to the student explaining the offense and the sanctions assigned. i. For a first-time offense, the individual faculty me mber can adjudicate the student violation themselves, but a report must be submitted to the Academic Integrity Committee. The reporting process provides evidence if multiple infraction occur and al lows review of disciplinary action taken. b. For substantial violations the Academic Integrity Committee must hold a Disciplinary Conference with the student accused, explaining the offense and the sanctions assigned. i. For substantial violations the Academic Integrity Committee can levy a sanction as severe as course failure without involving the Vice President for Academics. ii. For substantial violations that the Academic Integrity Committee believes warrants expulsion from an academic program, the Committee will recommend su ch sanctions to the Dean of the appropriate Department. iii. For substantial violations that the Academic Integrity Committee believes warrants expulsion from Presentation College, the Committee will recommend such sanctions to the Vice President for Academics. Vice President for Academics 1. The Vice President for Academics will receive recomme ndations from the Academic Integrity Committee if the Committee feels the offense warrants expulsion from Presentation College. 2. The Vice President for Academics will be provided wi th the evidence from the Academic Integrity Committee and conduct his/her own investigation befo re adjudicating the final sanction. Procedures for Adjudicating Allegations of Academic Violation Initial Reporting of an Alleged Violation A faculty or staff member who observes or is apprised a possible academic integrity violation by a student or group of students must report the incident on the Academic Integrity link. 1. Minimal Violations a. If a faculty or staff member wishes to adjudicate th e matter, he or she will complete the academic integrity reporting form, indicating what he or she believes the alleged violation to be, along with evidence or a narrative supporting the claim and how the allegation was resolved. i. The faculty member must also notify the accused stud ent in writing or by elec tronic communication that he or she is alleged to have committed a violation of academic integrity, that the matter has been referred to the Academic Integrity Committee, and that the stud ent should expect to be contacted shortly by the Committee if follow up is required or if this incident advances the student to a substantial violation due to multiple violations. Following the referral the Academic Integrity Committee assumes responsibility for any additional follow up. 1. The Academic Integrity Committee will run a report to ensure this is the first violation of the student. If this is not the first violation an d the alleged act moves the student to Substantial Violation, the Academic Integrity Committee will open an investigation and notify the student. b. If a faculty or staff member does not wish to adju dicate the matter, he or she will complete the academic integrity form, indicating what he or she believes the alleged violation to be and the evidence or narrative supporting the claim and requesting the Committ ee adjudicate the incident with the student. i. The faculty member must also notify the accused stud ent in writing or by elec tronic communication that he or she is alleged to have committed a violation of academic integrity, that the matter has been referred to the Academic Integrity Committee, and that the stud ent should expect to be contacted shortly by the Committee.

If this is not the first violation and the alleged act moves the student to Substantial Violation, the Academic Integrity Committee will open an investigation and notify the student. 2. Substantial Violations 66| PRESENTATION COLLEGE 2018-2019 CATALOG a. If a faculty or staff member believes a student has committed an alleged substantial violation of academic integrity, he or she is required to complete an academ ic integrity form, indicating what he or she believes the alleged violation to be and the evidence supporting the claim. b. The Faculty member must also notify the accused student in writing or by electronic communication that he or she is alleged to have committed a violation of academic integrity, that the matter has been referred to the Academic Integrity Committee, and that the student shou ld expect to be contacted shortly by the Committee.

Investigation of Alleged Academic Integrity A faculty member or Academic Integrity Committee adjudicating an allegation of a first time minimal violation of academic integrity must meet with the student un less the student elects not to meet wi th the faculty member or the Committee. At the meeting, the faculty or Committee members will specify th e alleged violation, discuss the typical range of sanctions for such violation and ask the studen t to respond to the allegation. In addition to meeting with the accused student and carefully considering his or he r response to the allegation, the faculty member or Committee members will investigate the matter and reac h a decision by considering al l available physical evidence and interviewing available witnesses. If the student does not re spond within the prescribed time limit or chooses not to meet with the faculty member or the Committee, the faculty member or Academic Integrity Committee will reach a decision regarding responsibility and sanction, based on the available evidence, including any wr itten response from the student. At the end of this process, the faculty member or Academic In tegrity Committee will take one of the following actions: 1. If it is found that the student has not violated the Acad emic Integrity Policy, the faculty member or the Committee will notify the student in writing or by electronic communication within 10 work ing days after meeting the student. The matter will be considered closed. 2. If it is found that the student has violated the Ac ademic Integrity Policy, the Committee will communicate the proposed sanctions in writing or by electronic communication within 10 work ing days after meeting the student.The notification will also inform the student of the opportunity to appeal the sa nction following the College Grievance Process. The form will be placed in the student file. 3. If the sanction recommended for the violation is suspensi on from the student's academic program, the Committee will forward the recommendation and evidence on to the appropriat e Dean. Following the referral from the Academic Integrity Committee, the Dean will assume final responsibility in re gards to a student's removal from an academic program. 4. If the sanction recommended for the violation is suspen sion from Presentation College, the Committee will forward that recommendation and evidence on to the Vice Presiden t for Academics. Following the referral from the Academic Integrity Committee, the Vice President for Academic s will assume responsibility for final sanctions.

Up to eight participation credits may be applied toward graduation as elective credit, with no more than five of the eight credits from a single category of athletics or arts. SERVICE-LEARNING PROGRAM Service-learning is an important component of Presentation College's extended mission statement. All candidates for the associate and baccalaureate degrees at Presentation College must satisfactorily complete the required and approved service- learning projects. Associate degree students are required to complete one service-learning project* Baccalaureate degree students are required to complete two service-learning projects** Students who transfer in 60 or more credits are requ ired to complete at least 1 service-learning project *RS293 Christian Ethics curriculum requires a service-learning project; therefore, su ccessful completion of RS293 satisfies an associate degree seeking student's service-learning requirement. **Baccalaureate degree seeking students who successfully complete RS293 Christian Ethics will satisfy one of the service- learning requirements. St udents who entered Presentation College prior to Fall 2014 may use the service-learning hours toward the volunteer service hours requ irement needed for graduation. This requirement is intended to provide st udents with an opportunity to serve thei r community, apply knowledge gained in the classroom and become informed, active, responsible, and ethical ci tizens. Service-learni ng is different from volunteerism. It i s anticipated that through these projects an d reflection students will enrich their un derstanding of the gifts and opportunities they have been given in life and that all persons have an obligation to give back to their communities. Students are placing their g ifts and talents at the service of others with no expectation of monetary reward. These interactions add to the richness of the student-learning experience and provide occa sions for reflection on life and its meaning. It is our belief that in serving othe rs, we serve God. Service-learning objectives: Connect meaningful service, relevant academic work, and critical reflection Apply knowledge and skills to specific service projects Grow and develop academically, spiritually, and civically Students who are granted transfer credit for RS293 Christian Ethics will be gran ted credit for one serv ice-learning project. Students who transfer an ethics courses wi thout a service-learning comp onent will be granted credit for RS283 and must register for SLC000 Service-Learning to meet one of the required service-learning projects required for graduation. Any student enrolled in a course that integrates a service-learni ng project must successfully complete both the academic course and the service-learning project to pass the course and fulfill a service-learning project. Students can fulfill a service-learning project in three ways: 74| PRESENTATION COLLEGE 2018-2019 CATALOG 1. Successful completion of RS293 Christian Ethics 2. Successful completion of an academic course with an integr ated service-learning project.

ATHLETIC TRAINING, BACHELOR OF SCIENCE Athletic trainers (ATs) are heal th care professionals who collaborate with phys icians. The services provided by ATs comprise prevention, emergency care, clinical diagno sis, therapeutic intervention, and rehabili tation of injuries and medical conditions . Athletic trainers utilize their knowledge and skills in a variety of settings. The athletic trainer plays a vital role in the p revention, recognition/management, treatment, and rehabilitation of injuries that occur during physical activity. Athletic Trainers may work in professional, college/university, and secondary school at hletics; hospital/clinics; occu pational/industrial health; the military; in physician offices. Many athl etic trainers work outside of athletic settings; they provide physical medicine and rehabili tation, as well as other services to people of all ages. Athletic training is practiced by athletic trainers (AT), health care professionals who collaborate with physicians to optimize activity and participation of patients and clients across age and care continuums. Athletic training encompasses the prevention , diagnosis, and intervention of emergency, acute and chronic medical conditions involving impairment, functional limitations, and disabilities. ATs work under the direction of physicians, as prescribed by state licensure statutes. Th eir patients and cli ents include everyone from professional athletes to industrial work ers. Recognized by the American Medical Association as allied health professionals, athletic trainers specialize in the preven tion, diagnosis, assessment, treatment, and rehabilitation of m uscle and bone injuries and illnesses. Program Certification Students must graduate and complete a Commission on Accred itation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE) accredited athletic training education program before they are eligible to sit for the Board of Certification, Inc. (BOC) certification ex am. Once the student successfully passes this exam ination, he or she earns the \"Certified At hletic Trainer (ATC)\" credential from t he BOC. The ATP at Presentation College is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE). For more information regarding the accreditation standards of athletic training programs, please visit www.caate.net The Athletic Training Program Students in the Athletic Training Program (ATP) must demonstrate: 1.

DIVISION OF HEALTH & NATURAL SCIENCE DIVISION OF HEALTH & NATURAL SCIENCE| 77 Technical Standards for Admission and Retention The ATP at Presentation College is a rigo rous and intense program that places sp ecific requirements and demands on the students enrolled in the program. An object ive of this program is to prepare graduate s to enter a variety of employment setting s and to render care to a wide spectrum of individuals engaged in physical activity. The technica l standards set forth by the ATP establish the essential qualities considered necessary for studen ts admitted to the clinical phas e of the program to achieve th e knowledge, skills, and comp etencies of an entry-level athletic trainer. The following abilities and expectations must be met by all students admitted to the clinical phase of the Athletic Training Program. In the event students are unable to fulfill these tec hnical standards, with or without reasonable a ccommodation, students will not be permi tted to progress to th e clinical phase. Compliance with the program's technical standards does not guar antee progression in the ATP at Presentation College and/or eligibility for the Board of Certification, Inc., and certification exam. Candidates for selection to the Presentation College ATP must demonstrate: 1. The mental capacity to assimilate, analyze, synthesize, integrate concepts, and problem solve to formulate assessment and therapeutic judgments and to be able to distinguish deviations from the norm. 2. Sufficient postural and neuromuscular control, sensory fu nction, and coordination to perform appropriate physical examinations using accepted techniques; and accurately, safely and efficiently use equipment and materials during the assessment and treatment of patients. 3. The ability to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients and colleagues, including individuals from different cultural and social backgrounds. This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to establish rapport with patients and communicate judgments and treatment in formation effectively. Students must be able to understand and speak the English language at a level consistent with competent professional practice. 4. The ability to record the phys ical examination results and a trea tment plan clearly and accurately. 5. The capacity to maintain comp osure and continue to function we ll during periods of high stress. 6. The perseverance, diligence, and commitm ent to complete the athletic training program as outlined and sequenced. 7. Flexibility and the ability to adjust to changing situations and uncertainty in clinical situations. 8. Affective skills and appropriate demean or and rapport that relate to professional education and quality patient care. Candidates for progression into the clinical phase of the athletic training program will be required to verify they understand and meet these technical standards or that they believe that, with certain accommod ations, they can meet the standards. Presentation College disability services, in conjunction with th e athletic training program director, will evaluate a student w ho states he/she could meet the program's technical standards with accommodation and confirm that the stated condition qualifies as a disability under applicable laws. If a student states that he/she can meet the technical standa rds with reasonable accommodation, the College will determine whether it agrees that the student can meet the technical standard s with reasonable accommodation. This includes a review as to whether the accommodations requested ar e reasonable, taking into account wh ether accommodation would jeopardize clinician/patient safety, or the educational process of the st udent or the institution, including all coursework, clinical experiences and internships deem ed essential to graduation. Admission to Athletic Training Program Students who are enrolled in the Athletic Training Program (ATP) are subject to two different minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) standards. Students who ar e enrolled in courses that are prerequisi tes for the clinical phase of the ATP or general education courses required for the degree must earn a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00. Students are, however, advised that maintaining a minimum GPA of 2.00 is not sufficient to meet the standard for enrollm ent into the clinical phase of the ATP. Students applying to the clinical phase of the ATP are required to have a 2.50 cumulative grade poin t average or higher at the end of the semester they are applying. Students apply for the clinical phase of the ATP after completing the foundational core during their non-clinical phase. During this time, students are required to take the following athletic training courses (may be taken concurrently during application semester): AT111 Introduction to Athletic Training BI162 Medical Terminology BI213 Human Anatomy and Physiology I Lecture BL211 Human Anatomy and Physiology I Lab BI293 Human Anatomy and Physiology II Lecture 78| PRESENTATION COLLEGE 2018-2019 CATALOG BL291 Human Anatomy and Physiology II Lab EXSC112 First Aid and Emergency Cardiac Care EXSC333 Care and Prevention of Injuries and Illnesses These courses require a grade of a \"C-\" or higher in order to apply to the clinical phase of the athletic training major. Competitive Admissions Application and Selection Process In addition to the above academic requiremen ts, acceptance into the clinical phase of the ATP will be determ ined by evaluation of the student's formal application to the ATP. The following a pplication materials are due to th e ATP Program Director in Apri l of the spring semester: 1. Two letters of recommendation (one from faculty - non- ATC (Certified Athletic Trai ner); one from supervisor) 2. Completion of 10 observation hours and worksheet packet (given in AT111) 3. Completed application form 4. Typed 500-word topical essay 5. Formal interview with ATP selection committee Selection of the student for the clinical phase of the ATP is ba sed on a scored rubric. Each application item (overall GPA, GPA for pre-application courses, evaluation of observation student, observation worksheet, two letters of recommendation, application essay, and interview) is scored, weighed to a maxi mum of 100 total points, and then multiplied by a predetermined percentage. The top point-earning students fr om each cohort will be selected based on the number of available openings for the ATP. For example, if 10 seats are open for a given cohort, th e top 10 point-earners will be selected. During non-competitive application years (more ATP cohort seats open than a pplications), the interview component may be omitted. Official acceptance into the Athletic Training Program will occu r after final grades for the spring semester are posted. Studen ts offered a position in the Athletic Training Progra m will have one week to confirm their appointment. Provisional Progression In situations where cohorts do not fill all the available clinical phase openings for the ATP, st udents who do not meet applica tion minimum requirements may progress provisionally to the clinical ph ase in the ATP. In such cases, a formal letter of provisional acceptance stating the terms of admission to the clinical phase of the program will be sent to the student and placed in his/he r official academic file. The terms will include: which requirement was not met the process the student will take to meet the requirement the length of time the student ha s to meet the minimum requirement If the student does not meet the minimum re quirement in the time allotte d in the written contract, the student will be not be allowed to progress in the clinical phase of the program. During the provisional time of accept ance, students may be subject to certain clinical and/or academic requirements or limitations. Any student acce pted into the clinical phase of the ATP under provisional status must meet minimum program acceptance standards within one academic year (two semesters). Program Academic Rete ntion Requirements Once accepted into the clinical phase of the Athletic Training Program, the student must cont inue to meet the academic and clinical requirements of the program. Stud ents who fail to meet the academic retention standards will be placed on probation. Athletic training students' compliance with the academic retentio n requirements will be measured at the end of the fall and spring semesters. Listed below are the academic rete ntion requirements for each level in the program. Clinical Level I: minimum 2.50 cumulative GPA; minimum 2.75 GPA in athletic training major courses; grade of \"C-\" or higher in all \"AT\" prefix courses Clinical Level II: minimum 2.75 cumulative GPA; minimum 2.75 GPA in athletic training major courses; grade of \"C-\" or higher in all \"AT\" prefix courses Clinical Level III: minimum 2.75 cumulative GPA; minimum 3.00 GPA in athletic training major courses; DIVISION OF HEALTH & NATURAL SCIENCE| 79 grade of \"C-\" or higher in all \"AT\" prefix courses Clinical Education Students formally accepted into the clinical phase of the ATP will complete a minimum of 140 hours of clinical education at various sites per semester.

These students are hi ghly encouraged to take the GRE to de monstrate to the admissions committee their readiness for graduate work. Additionally, letters of reference for ad mission to a graduate program are determined by the individual programs; prospective students should refer to the admissions criteria and catalog information for the program of interest. ACCEPTANCE POLICIES - GRADUATE Students applying to a graduate program must complete an on line application. The application fee is $35. Once it has been verified that the minimum institutional requirements for admissi on to a graduate program are met, the admissions department will forward the application to the appropriate division/progr am for a final admission decision. Graduate programs offer limited capacity and admission is competitive with individual departments/programs making the final decision on whether a student will be offered acceptance to the program. AUDITING A CLASS Students may audit a course if space is available in the class. Course prerequisites are the same for audit as for credit. Pers ons who audit a class will not receive college credit nor may they take credit examinations for the course audited. Audited courses are not considered in establishing student enrollment status for financial aid purposes or for establishing eligibility to comp ete in intercollegiate contests. Veterans and dependents may not receive educational benefits for audited courses. A change from audit to credit or credit to audit must be made before the end of the add/drop refund period for a semester. Graduate programs may have more specific policies and procedures related to au diting a class that supersede this process. Please see the appropriate Graduate Program Handbook for more information. ACADEMIC ADVISING Graduate students will be assigned to a Graduate academic advisor who will help them develop a plan of study for their academic progress. Graduate stud ents pursuing a thesis plan will need to wo rk with their academic advisor to arrange a graduate advising committee and major thesis (research) advisor. STUDENT CLASSIFICATION Graduate students are considered full-time when enrolled in 8 or more credit hour s per semester during the academic year. Graduate students enrolled in fewer than 8 credit hours are classified as part-time. In addition to other eligibility requireme nts, a minimum of 4 credits is required to be eligible for Title IV (federal) aid. CLASS LOAD The recommended academic load for graduate students is 6-13 cred its during a regular semester. To exceed 13 credits requires the recommendation of the faculty advisor, written approval of the Dean of the program, and a 3.00 (B) cumulative grade point average. GRADUATE STUDIES GRADUATE STUDIES| 137 ATTENDANCE Students are expected to attend every class session and be on ti me. Online students report their attendance by participating in their online course(s) as designated by the instructor. If for any reason students must be absent from class, the responsibilit y of making up work rests entirely upon the students. Each facult y member has the responsibility to develop his/her own policy on class attendance. The instructor's attendance policy must be included in the syllabus. This should include statements regarding make-up work and the relationship of attendance to grading. The added costs of supervision for missed classes/clinicals may accrue to the students. Graduate programs may have more specif ic policies and procedures rela ted to auditing a class that supersede this process. Please see the appropriat e Graduate Program Handbook for more information. Faculty and administration will honor officially approved absences where individuals or groups ar e absent as part of a College- sponsored activity or in the inte rest of the College. The director of the activity and the students will be responsible for not ifying the appropriate faculty and staff prior to th e absence. Officially approved absences may include tours, athletic competitions, field trips, and professional conferences. TRANSFER OF CREDITS The maximum number of transfer credits accepted at the graduate level is 9 credits and all remaining credits must be taken at Presentation College. Each tran sfer course requires departmental approval. Courses for which any grade lower than a B was earned will not be accepted in transfer. COURSE NUMBERS *5xx = Courses primarily for students in their first year of a graduate program *6xx = Courses primarily for students in their second year of a graduate program Undergraduate students are permitted to take graduate courses, limited to 500-level co urses only, provided the student is in hi s or her senior year and in good standing within their current program (GPA of 3.00 or higher, has advisor approval, has the approval of the program director housing the graduate co urse, and whose financial account is in good standing). COURSE REPEAT POLICY For graduate students, no more than two graduate courses ma y be repeated, each graduate course repeated may only be repeated once, and all repeated courses must be completed with at least a \"B\" grade. In addition, all courses at the graduate l evel with less than an earned grad e of \"B\", will be repeated.

Academic Probation The purpose of academic probation is to warn students of thei r scholastic standing. Notification of probationary status will be made in writing to students from the Registrar's Office and a copy of the notice will be sent to the appropriate Dean and advis or. Academic probation will be noted on the transcript. A student who earns below a 3.00 cumulative GPA after any semester is placed on academic probation. Students may take other graduate courses towards degree if the courses meet pre- and co-requisi te requirements to continue graduate studies. However, students must retake any course(s) they received less than a grade of \"B\" in the next semester that the course(s) is/are offered in the curriculum. Academic Suspension Based on credits attempted at Presentation College, a student will be subject to dismissal from the College if, while on probat ion, the semester GPA falls below 3.00.

GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS Graduate students who lack the required credits for a certific ate or degree may apply to the Vice President for Academics to participate in the May commencement ceremony of that year if they are able to complete all graduation requirements successfully by the end of the next academic term. Time Limitation For students enrolled in a graduate program, graduation must oc cur in the semester which repres ents the end of six academic years since their first enrollment. At that time, if a student has not successfully graduated, the Graduate Council shall deter mine which courses taken by the student are obsolete and which cour ses may continue to be applied to a Master's degree. With Graduate Council approval, students may test out of a course that goes beyond the si x-year time frame; however, a maximum of two graduate courses can be tested out of over the course of a student's program. Graduation Processes Specific to Graduate Programs Students applying for graduation from a gr aduate program at Presentation College ha ve several additional requirements. These requirements take significant time and should be discussed with the student's graduate ac ademic advisor (and graduate committee/research advisor as appropriate) from the earliest stages of the student's graduate work. 1. Thesis or Non-Thesis Project and Or al/Written Comprehensive Examinations a. Graduate students are required to complete either a thesis or a non-th esis project as part of their degree requirements. Each division/p rogram offering a graduate degree may have specific guidelines as to which of these two summative works would be appropriate for a pr ogram and students may consult with their graduate academic advisor as to which of these two summati ve works may best fit their individual goals. b. Track #1: Thesis Plan: Thesis work allows the student to gain valuable research and publication experience while increasing the scholarly activity and productivity of involved faculty. Students wishing to pursue doctoral education, and particularly those wishing to work in acad emic settings, may desire to consider a thesis track. c. Track #2: Capstone Project Plan: A capstone project is defined as a summative work th at involves basic research methodologies without undue statistical analysis and may or may not proceed to public ation. Capstone projects are conducted within the confines of an establishe d course or series of courses within a program.
