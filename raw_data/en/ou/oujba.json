I am, obviously, a 100% pro vaccination, but I think, also, that it is best to avoid making it compulsory. Of course, anthroposophists have their special agenda when arguing about this, but you will find many non-anthroposophists, and even specialists in the field, arguing that the best policy is to try to build a wide and general acceptance for vaccination so that the vast majority of people will want to vaccinate their children. This takes trust, and you don't get that with compulsion. As for a potential covid vaccine -- nobody yet knows what we will have, or if it's even a great idea to vaccinate children (whether by free will or force, non-risk children may not benefit enough from it to take the risk with a new vaccine -- it's different for older people). The rest of this hullaballoo is quite mysterious to me. Discontented anthroposophists should have come to Sweden -- we never had a lockdown and almost nobody wears face-masks! -alicia | | "}
