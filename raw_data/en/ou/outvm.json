Henry Ford is one of the few medical centers in Michigan that is certified to administer a highly personalized immunotherapy treatment option called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Our participation in [clinical trials](/services/cancer/clinical-trials) and our work with advanced stages of cancer have provided us with the expertise, technology, and resources that allow us to offer this revolutionary cancer treatment to select patients. Our cancer team is specially trained to administer and conduct CAR T-cell therapy to patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In addition to killing cancer cells, CAR T-cell therapy may help protect patients against cancer recurrence and may result in long-term remission. Connect with our Cancer Team 24/7. Call us at [(888) 777-4167](tel:+1-888-777-4167) CAR T-cell therapy is a one-time treatment at the forefront of precision medicine that uses engineered cells from a patient's immune system to destroy cancer. This therapy \"supercharges\" a type of immune cell in the body called T-cells to target and destroy cancer cells - much like the immune system would work to fight the common cold. Unlike chemotherapy that treats the whole body to kill cancer cells, CAR T-cell therapy treats the cancer with targeted and precision medicine for the immune system. CAR T-cell therapy is sometimes called a \"living drug\" because the fighting T-cells remain active in the body for many years after the treatment. If cancer cells try to relapse, the CAR T-cells have a greater chance of recognizing and destroying the cancerous cells. Our cancer team is here for you in-person, by phone and virtually for all your cancer care needs. When prior cancer treatments have failed, patients with two types of [blood cancers](/services/leukemia-lymphoma) -B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma - still have an option at Henry Ford. CAR T-cell therapy can strengthen the patient's immune system to out-smart and out-fight cancer cells. Like many other cancer-fighting drugs, CAR T-cell therapy can produce side effects. Our experts will discuss possible side-effects with you prior to your treatment. In certain cases, patients have severe flu-like symptoms caused by the strong action of the T-cells as they fight cancer. Others may experience confusion or additional neurological symptoms that can be reversible. To monitor patients after therapy is administered, we require that they return to Henry Ford Cancer and be followed closely and can be admitted to the hospital for two or more weeks. Patients are closely watched in the transplant unit and if needed intensive care unit, and they are given medication for any side effects. This helps patients rest assured that everything possible is being done to manage their care. We take a multidisciplinary team approach to planning and managing your CAR T-cell therapy treatment and care to address all your needs. Our team includes: Our goal is to make the process very easy for our patients, so they can learn more and move forward with CAR T-cell therapy. By using this highly individualized approach to treat cancers that have been previously resistant to other drugs, our team of experts can give you a fighting chance for remission.
