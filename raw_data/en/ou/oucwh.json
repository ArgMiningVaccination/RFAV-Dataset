My primary concern is that my patients are relieved from any pain and suffering as quickly and as possible, in the most practical way. It is of fundamental importance to me that the underlying cause is both honoured and investigated. One of my main aims as a practitioner is to support my patients to become more autonomous with regard to their health issues and well-being. My approach is to steer people away from popping pills and suppression of the disease, as it doesn't pay off in the long run. Instead, we can rely on nature and ancient wisdom to regain balance. Diseases are happening at different levels: mental, emotional, spiritual and physical. Consciously and unconsciously. All these levels need to be seen or felt in order to let go, move on and heal. This can be achieved with my multi-pronged approach of integrating different modalities: acupuncture, herbs, and homeopathic remedies. Contact me today for a free 15-minute telephone consultation to find out how I can help you.
