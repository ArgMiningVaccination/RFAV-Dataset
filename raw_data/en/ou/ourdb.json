The Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation of Harvard Law School advocates for legal, regulatory, and policy reform to improve the health of underserved populations, with a focus on the needs of low-income people living with chronic illnesses and disabilities. All Amici promote access to health care and services for chronic disease communities, including people living with HIV and hepatitis C. Additionally, Amici have a signicant history combating discrimination against people living with chronic illnesses. As such, Amici are uniquely positioned to provide insight on the im-portance of the coordinated, standardized package of 1 Amici submit this brief pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.3(a). Both parties have consente d to the ling of amicus curiae briefs in support of either party. In compliance with Supreme Court Rule 37.6, Amici state that no counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part and that no person or entity other than Amici, its members, and its counsel contributed monetarily to the preparation or submission of this brief. 2 preventive services established by the Patient Protec- tion and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) and certain harms to third parties that would and could arise should the judgment of the Third Circuit Court of Ap-peals be reversed. Amici write to articulate the harm to people at risk for and liv ing with chronic illness that inescapably will arise should expanded religious ex-emptions to the contracept ive guarantee set forth in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.132 (2019) be upheld as promulgated. --------------------------------- --------------------------------- SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT The expanded religious exemptions to the contra- ceptive guarantee set forth in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.132 (2019) (the Rule) will caus e signicant harm to third parties, including people living with HIV, hepatitis C, and other medical conditions for whom contraceptives are an essential part of health care. Furthermore, alt- hough the Rule applies specically to the contraceptive guarantee, this Court's decision could have far-reach-ing effects beyond the facts of this case. If the Court holds that the Rule is permi ssible under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), future reli-gious objectors could block vulnerable populations from accessing other forms of essential, life-saving pre- ventive care included in the ACA's preventive services mandate (the Mandate). The Court should reafrm its own well-established princip le of \"tak[ing] adequate account of the burdens a requested accommodation may impose on nonbeneciaries,\" Cutter v. Wilkinson , 3 544 U.S. 709, 720 (2005) (citat ion omitted), and uphold the judgment of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. --------------------------------- --------------------------------- ARGUMENT I. The Rule will imp ermissibly harm third parties entitled to co verage for preventive health care services under the Mandate. This Court's jurisprudence on balancing third- party harm caused by gove rnmental recognition of religious rights has not been distilled to a singular doc- trinal test. Nevertheless, it is beyond argument that the principle directing courts to account for such harm is well established in the constitutional rmament. As commanded in Cutter v. Wilkinson, \" courts must take adequate account of the bu rdens a requested accom- modation may impose on nonbeneciaries.\" 544 U.S. at 720 (citation omitted). That holding was built on an ar-ticulation, in Estate of Thorton v. Caldor, Inc. , 472 U.S. 703, 710 (1985), of \"a fundamen tal principle of Clauses\": \"The First Amendment . . . gives no one the right to insist that in pursuit of their own in- terests others must conform their conduct to his own religious necessities.\" Id. (quoting Otten v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. , 205 F.2d 58, 61 (2d Cir. 1953)). The absence, as yet, of a singular test spelling out a method by which to take account of third-party harm caused by religious accommodation does not erase the Court's requirement to consider it. Indeed, throughout the extensive litigation over the Mandate, this Court 4 has recognized third-party harm as a limiting factor on religious accommodation. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. , 573 U.S. 682 (2014), in which the Court considered entitlement to accommodation from the Mandate's contraceptive guar antee for closely held for- prot corporations, the Court afrmed that \"[i]t is cer- tainly true that in applying RFRA 'courts must take adequate account of the bu rdens a requested accom- modation may impose on nonbeneciaries.' \" 573 U.S. at 729 n.37 (quoting Cutter v. Wilkinson , 544 U.S. 709, 720 (2005)). See also id . at 739 (Kennedy, J., concur- ring) (stating that religious exercise must not \"unduly restrict other persons . . . in protecting their own inter-ests\"); id. at 745 (Ginsburg, J., joined by Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor, JJ., dissenting) (\"Accommodations to religious beliefs or observances . . . must not signi-cantly impinge on the interests of third parties.\"); id. at 764 (Ginsburg, J., joined by Breyer, Kagan, and So- tomayor, JJ., dissenting) (\"No tradition, and no prior decision under RFRA, allows a religion-based exemp- tion when the accommodation would be harmful to oth- ers . . . .\"). The Court also noted that \"our decision in these cases need not result in any detrimental effect on any third party,\" id. at 729 n.37, because there ex- isted other means to ensure that employees of an ob-jecting entity maintain coverage, without cost-sharing, for the health care to which they are entitled by law. The Court most recently considered the Mandate in Zubik v. Burwell , 136 Zubik , employer-petitioners objected to the means by which the government accommodated 5 religious objections to the Mandate's contraceptive guarantee. Entities seeking an accommodation were required to submit notice to the government, upon which responsibility to \"contra ct, arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage\" would shift to an insurance company or third-party alleged that submitting notice imposed an ongoing substantial burden on religious beliefs in violation of RFRA. Zubik , 136 S. Ct. at 1559. This Court remanded the case, in- structing that the parties be afforded \"an opportunity to arrive at an approach going forward that accommo-dates petitioners' religious exercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by petitioners' health plans 'receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.' \" Id. at 1560 (cita- tions omitted). In so doing, the Court reinforced its longstanding concern with balancing religious accom-modation in a manner that minimizes third-party harm. Whatever the level of third-party harm that suf- ces to overcome a claim for religious accommodation to government requirements, that level is met as ap-plied here because the Rule fails to consider adequately the substantial, widespread effects\u2014measured both in direct detriment and in opportunity cost to prevent future injury\u2014that it will occasion. This is especially so in the context of explicit congressional intent to avoid the harm at issue. The purpose of this brief is to describe distinctly the harm that stands to be inflicted 6 on individuals living with or at risk for HIV, hepatitis C, and other chronic illness.2 II. The Rule will harm people living with chronic illness for whom contraception is a critical component of health care. The Petitioners assert that a notice requirement presents a substantial burden to religious objectors. As a consequence, they s eek sweeping exemptions, un- precedented in the recent history of the federal govern-ment's accommodation of religious belief. The Rule eviscerates the Mandate's contraceptive guarantee by allowing employers, schools, insurers, and other organ-izations to curtail some or all coverage of contraception and by impeding the government from making sepa- rate arrangements to ensure access to these services. In promulgating this Rule, Petitioners failed to con- sider adequately the harm such an evisceration would have on third parties. Instead, as the Third Circuit noted, Petitioners \"downplayed this burden on women, contradicting Congress's mandate that women be pro- vided contraceptive coverage.\" Trump Pet. App. 41a. 2 While this brief describes the harm to third parties that would arise under expanded religious exemptions and while Pe-titioners cannot (and do not) assert that RFRA authorizes the Administration's promulgation of moral exemptions, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.133 (2019), similar harm would befall third parties should employers, schools, and other organizations be permitted to \"edit\" the mandated set of preventive services on the basis of moral ob-jection. 7 The Rule would cause particular harm to people living with HIV, hepatitis C, and other medical condi- tions, for whom contraception is a critical component of health care. Because of the unique health concerns people living with these chronic illnesses face, it is im- portant that standardized access to no-cost preventive care includes access to the full range of contraceptive methods as directed by the Mandate. Whereas prior to the Rule alternative arrangements for coverage were assured, the Rule limits meaningful access to the full range of contraception and will cause people living with chronic illnesses to face preventable harm in managing their health. Access to contraceptive methods and the ability to prevent pregnancies allow people living with chronic illnesses to better control their health and avoid preg- nancy-related detrimental health effects. Chronic con- ditions, such as hypertension or diabetes, can cause birth complications and pregnancy-related deaths. 3 3 Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System , Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, https:// www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/ maternal-mortality/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm (last updated Feb. 4, 2020) (\"Studies show that an increasing number of pregnant women in the United States have chronic health conditions such as hype rtension, diabetes, and chronic heart disease. These conditions may put a pregnant woman at higher risk of pregnancy complications . . . . When combined, car-diovascular conditions (i.e., card iomyopathy, other cardiovascular conditions, cerebrovascular acci dents) were responsible for greater than one-third of pregnancy-related deaths in 2011-2016.\") (citations omitted); see Jill M. Mhyre et al., Influence of Patient Comorbidities on the Risk of Near-miss Maternal Morbid- ity or Mortality , 115 Anesthesiology 963, 969 (2011) (\"[C]lose to 60% of near-miss maternal morbidity or mortality events are 8 Pregnancy can lead to diseas e progression in some chronic conditions, such as lupus and chronic kidney disease, by exacerbating existing symptoms. See, e.g., Alan Baer et al., Lupus and Pregnancy , 66 Obstetrical & Gynecological Surv. 639 (2011); Philip Webster et al., Pregnancy in Chronic Kidney Disease and Kidney Transplantation , 91 Kidney Int'l 1047 (2017). Meaning- ful access to contraception gives people the autonomy both to direct their reproductive futures and manage chronic illness. Without such access to contraception, people living with chronic illnesses would face barriers when managing their health and could face more dan- gerous health outcomes if they were to become pregnant. Eliminating and fragment ing access to the full range of contraceptive methods, as allowed in the new Rule, would harm people taking medications that com- promise the effectiveness of certain forms of birth con- trol. In these situations, people are advised to switch to a contraceptive method that is not affected by the drug. For example, rifampin, an antibiotic used to pre- vent and treat tuberculosis and other bacterial infec-tions, can accelerate the metabolism of certain drugs in the body and lower the effectiveness of hormone- based contraception (including \"birth control pills, patches, rings, implants, and injections\"). 4 Patients on rifampin are thus counseled to use non-hormonal concentrated in approximately 10% of women with medical or ob- stetric conditions known at the time of admission to the labor and delivery unit.\"). 4 Rifampin , MedlinePlus, https://med lineplus.gov/druginfo/ meds/a682403.html (last updated Apr. 2019). 9 contraceptive methods. Similar warnings are given for medications such as Prezista (indicated for HIV), Kaletra (indicated for HIV), Carbatrol (indicated for epilepsy and trigeminal neuralgia), and Provigil (indi-cated for narcolepsy). 5 Without access to the full range of contraceptive methods, people living with chronic illnesses may be unable to access a form of birth 5 Prezista (darunavir) Tablet [Janssen], DAILYMED, (\"Use PREZISTA may reduce the efcacy of combined hormonal contra-ceptives and the progestin only pill.

Advise patients using combined hormonal contraceptives to use an effec-tive alternative contraceptive method or an additional barrier method of use of Carbatrol(R) with hormonal contra-ceptive products (e.g., oral and levonorgestrel subdermal implant contraceptives) may render the co ntraceptives less effective be- cause the plasma concentrations of the hormones may be de-creased . . . .

The erosion of consistent and comprehensive ac- cess to contraception would also harm people living with chronic illness who take medications with terato- genic effects. Teratogenic medications can have severe impacts on fetal development resulting in signicant abnormalities. People on these medications and their partners need access to contraception that works for their medical and personal preferences in order to pre- vent pregnancies while at a higher risk for fetal de- fects. Food and Drug Administration labels for a number of medications contain warnings to use effec- tive contraception for a specic duration of time. These drugs include Rebetol (indicated for hepatitis C), Sori-atane (indicated for severe psoriasis), Topamax (indi- cated for epilepsy and migraines), Lipitor (indicated congestive heart failure and congenital heart dis-ease), and Coumadin (indicated for blood clots). 6 DAILYMED, (last updated Jan. black-box warn ing that, \"[e]ffective contracep- tion must be utilized during treatment (including in black-box warning that, \"SORI-ATANE also must not be used by females who may not use relia- ble contraception while undergoing treatment and for at least 3 years following discontinuation of treatment.\"); Lipitor (atorvas- tatin calcium) updated Dec. 2019) (\"Advise females of 11 with chronic illnesses who lose meaningful access to the full range of contraceptive methods are at risk for treatment delays, health deterioration, and a loss of control over the management of their health. III. The Rule creates a precedent so unteth ered to consideration of third parties that it will harm people who benet from other essen- tial, life-saving preventive care beyond con- traceptives. While the Rule is specic to requirements for con- traceptive coverage, the Mandate encompasses other services that are likely to gi ve rise to religious objec- tions. Thus, if employers and other entities are permit-ted to \"edit\" the mandated package of preventive services according to their own subjective religious code without any meaningful limiting principle, it will become more difficult for individuals to access other essential, life-saving preventive care beyond reproductive potential of the risk to a fetus, to use effective contra- ception during treatment and to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy . updated May 2019) (\"Women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy shou ld use effective contraception because of the risks of Dec. 2019) (\"Advise females of reproductive potentia l to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the nal dose of COUMADIN.\"). 12 contraceptives.7 Harm to third parties will intensify, licensing religious objectors to discriminate at will, without regard to the consequences of their decisions. Petitioners' persistent conflation of religious objec- tions to contraceptives and other potentially controver- sial health care services sounds the alarm. The preamble to the Rule, for example, cites 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 7631, \"protecting entities from being required to use HIV/AIDS funds contrary to their 'religious or moral objection,' \" as historical precedent. Religious Exemp- tions and Accommodations for Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 83 Fed. Reg. 57,536, 57,539 n.1 (Nov. 15, 2018). Similarly, Petitioners explicitly declined to distinguish HIV treatment and pre-exposure prophylaxis from other health care services in ano ther set of rules promul- gated to advance federal conscience laws. See Protect- ing Statutory Conscience Rights in Health Care; Delegations of Authority, 84 Fed. Reg. 23,170, 23,182 (May 21, 2019) (republished with immaterial correc- tion on June 7, 2019). In response to concerns about the impact of proposed protections for religious 7 There may be factual grounds to distinguish contraceptive coverage from coverage for other services. See Hobby Lobby Stores , 573 U.S. at 733 (\"Other coverage requirements, such as immunizations, may be supported by different interests . . . and may involve different arguments about the least restrictive means of providing them.\"). However, Petitioners' nding of an ongoing substantial burden on religious rights and the remedy they offer in response thereto\u2014that \"no measure short of an ex-emption would resolve all [religious] objections,\" Trump Pet. at 27\u2014are so unbalanced as to seemingly overwhelm or obliterate any countervailing interests. 13 objectors on people at risk for or living with HIV, the Department of Health and Human Services commented that, \"[i]n the event that the Department receives a complaint with respect to HIV treatment, pre-exposure prophylaxis . . . the Depa rtment would examine the facts and circumstances of the complaint to determine whether it falls within the scope of the statute in ques- tion and these regulations.\" Id. In creating a sweeping exemption from the Man- date untethered to adequate consideration of harm to third parties with respect to the contraceptive guar- antee, the Rule paves the way for similar exemptions regarding coverage for other services. A. The Mandate addresses other services used to prevent chronic conditions to which some religiously motivated actors object. The Mandate encompasses a broad array of pre- vention services. It ensure s access to screening for infectious diseases, such as HIV and viral hepatitis, and other conditions. 8 The Mandate ensures access 8 See Ctrs. for Medicare & Medicaid Servs., Preventive health services , HealthCare.gov, https://www .healthcare.gov/coverage/ preventive-care-benets/ (last visited Mar. 22, 2020) (providing up-to-date information on the full range of services required un-der the Mandate). The preventive services that are included un-der the Mandate fall into four broad categories: (1) evidence-based screening and counseling that receive an \"A\" or \"B\" grade by the United States Preventive Services Task Force, an independent, volunteer panel of national expe rts; (2) immunizations that are recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization 14 to a range of medications, such as HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and vaccinations, including vac- cination against hepatitis B and vaccination against the human papillomavirus (HPV).9 Several of these prevention-related services may conflict with religious beliefs and doctrine. Common sources of tension between preventive health care and religious beliefs include religious op- position to medical intervention, generally,10 and to specic technologies. For ex ample, some religious ad- herents are opposed to vaccinations because of their Practices, a committee of immuniza tion experts that is overseen by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; (3) preven-tive services for children and adolescents that are recommended by the federal government's Bright Futures Project; and (4) pre-ventive services targeting women's health that are recom-mended by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration.

It's a deeply consid-ered spiritual practice and way of life that has meant a lot to us over the years. So we've appreciated vaccination exemptions and sought to use them conscientiously and responsibly, when they have been granted.\"). 15 composition.11 Controversy is also fueled by moral judgment of specic activit ies\u2014such as certain sexual activity (e.g., homosexuality, premarital sex, and non- procreative sex)\u2014and an association between the ac-tivity and an illness. 12 In this context, the promotion of preventive services may be viewed as condoning or enabling improper behavior. The examples below are illustrative of this third construct. PrEP, a highly effective medication that a person who is HIV-negative can take to reduce their risk of acquisition, is a vital part of the Administration's Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America that launched in February 2019. 13 Consistent with the 11 See, e.g., Secretariat of Pro-Life Activities, Conscience Ex- emption for Vaccines based on Fetal Tissue from Abortions , United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, http://www.usccb.org/ beliefs-and-teachings/how-we-teach/catholic-education/upload/ Vaccines-Conscience-Exemption-u pdated-April-2015.pdf (last up- dated Apr. 2015) (\"The only vaccines readily available in the United States for some contagious diseases (e.g., rubella and Hep-atitis A) have been manufactured using fetal tissue from induced abortions.

The elimination of other controversial services from the gu arantees of the Mandate would erect significant barriers to care and cause pe ople to delay or forgo essential, life-saving services. The nature of the Mandate is such that any appli- cation of the Rule's sweeping veto power to additional statutorily-mandated preventive services would cause severe harm to third parties. As recognized by Con-gress in its enactment of the ACA, certain health care services are of such a signicant benet to individuals and society that they should be required to be covered uniformly at no additional cost. 22 The Mandate's preventive services reflect a broad range of public health interventions, including pri- mary prevention (interventions that inhibit disease occurrence) and secondary prevention (interventions that involve detecting disease at an early stage) strat- egies. 23 The services encompassed therein\u2014including those most vulnerable to religious objection\u2014are 22 The ACA was designed to address the public health crisis resulting from low levels of preventive services, in part by coordi-nating the removal of cost barriers to preventive services across insurers and across the public and private payer systems.

Following extensive review of available data in 2019, the United States Preventive Services Task Force concluded that PrEP is \"of substantial benet for decreasing the risk of HIV infection in persons at high risk of HIV infec-tion, either via sexual acquisition or through injection drug use\" and gave the preve ntive service its strongest level recommendation. USPSTF PrEP Recommen- dation Statement at 2204 . Chronic hepatitis C is a salient example of an in- stance in which the Mandate, through a secondary prevention strategy, creates an opportunity to detect and therefore treat disease. The Mandate will soon require coverage, without cost-sharing, for hepatitis C screening for all adults aged 18-79. 26 Chronic hepatitis C is a serious infection that causes liver disease and, in 2017 alone, was an underlying or contributing cause of death for over 17,000 Americans. 27 Transmitted 26 See U.S. Preventive Servs. Task Force, Screening for Hep- atitis C Virus Infection in Adolescents and Adults: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement , 323 JAMA 970 (2020) (issuing a \"B\" grade recommendation to hepatitis C screen-ing for all adults in March 2020). 27 Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, Viral Hepatitis Surveillance: United States, 2017 (2019), https://www.cdc.gov/ hepatitis/statistics/2017surveillance/pdfs/2017HepSurveillanceRpt.pdf.

It would be more difcult for people to know what types of screening, medication, or other preventive services to request, and more difcult for health care providers to know what to offer. 38 The burden of this additional ambiguity will be particu- larly signicant for people with low health literacy.39 Faced with these nancial and administrative bar- riers, the withholding of additional services encom- passed under the Mandate would inevitably cause individuals to delay or forg o essential, life-saving pre- ventive health care to which they are otherwise enti- tled. While this brief focuses primarily on the potential for direct harm to individuals, the potential for 38 See, e.g., Katie M.

In Jacobson v. Massachusetts , 197 U.S. 11 (1905), the Court recog- nized that the Government has an interest in uniformly mandating vaccines notwithstanding individual objec- tions.

But it is equally true that in every well- ordered society charged with the duty of con- serving the safety of its members the rights of the individual in respect of his liberty may at times, under the pressure of great dangers, be subjected to such restraint, to be enforced by reasonable regulations, as the safety of the general public may demand. Jacobson , 197 U.S. at 29. Considering the critical role the Mandate plays in ensuring access to a broad range of health care services to which religious actors may object, the Rule thus threatens severe harm to people at risk for and living with a broad range of conditions. While the Rule is spe- cic to and therefore poses particular harm to people for whom contraceptives are an essential part of health care, the burden on nonbene ciaries does not stop there. The Rule's justication under RFRA is so un- tethered to consideration of third-party harm as to open the door for similar exemptions from coverage for other controversial services. In so doing, the Rule will have far-reaching impacts. In light of this Court's recognition of third-party harm as a limiting principle to religious accommodation, the Rule cannot stand. --------------------------------- --------------------------------- 29 CONCLUSION The Court should uphold the judgment of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.
