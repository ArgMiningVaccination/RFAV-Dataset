Let's not waste our hard mahi. We still need to protect our whnau and communities from COVID-19. The Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is FREE. There will be enough vaccine for everyone aged 16 and over* to get the two doses they need to be protected against COVID-19. How does the COVID-19 vaccine help protect us? Getting vaccinated is a way to look after our whnau and community. It protects us by stopping the spread of the virus. If most of us are vaccinated, we can also reduce the risk of outbreaks which can lead to lockdowns and put our health system under pressure. When we get vaccinated, we can better protect those in our community who can't get immunised such as tamariki and rangatahi who are under 16*. The COVID-19 vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise and fight the virus. It can't give you the disease because it does not contain the virus, or a dead or inactivated virus, or anything that can affect our DNA. The vaccine is gone completely from your body within a few days, leaving your immune system ready for action if COVID-19 comes near you. How do we know it is safe for our whnau? In Aotearoa, vaccines are assessed by New Zealand's Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority (Medsafe). Medsafe is part of the Ministry of Health. Medsafe will only approve a vaccine for use in Aotearoa once it is confident it meets national and international standards for safety, effectiveness and quality.Medsafe is satisfied that the Pfizer vaccine is safe and effective to give to us. Choosing to be vaccinated It's your choice to get vaccinated. Getting two doses of the vaccine will give you and your whnau the best protection. The vaccine is especially important to safeguard our kuia and kaumtua, hap Mm and others who are more likely to get seriously ill from COVID-19. It will also help protect our tamariki and those who cannot yet be vaccinated against the virus. What to expect when you get the vaccine You will be asked to provide your details and to give consent. A fully trained vaccinator will give you the vaccine in your upper arm. You will need to stay for 20 minutes after being vaccinated. Some mild side effects are common and are a sign your body is learning to fight the virus. A second appointment will be booked for you. Be sure to make a note so you know when and where your second appointment is happening. PROTECTING WHNAU IS WHAT WE DODivders 2 COV 005 - May 2021Protection for our hap mm or while breastfeeding Based on how the vaccine works, experts believe it is as safe for hap Mm as it is for everyone else. This is because the Pfizer vaccine does not contain the live virus so it can't give you or ppi COVID-19. If a hap Mm doesn't have medical risks or high exposure to COVID-19, she and her doctor may decide to wait until after ppi is born before she has the vaccine. If so, it is important that those around her are vaccinated to help keep her safe. Breastfeeding Mm can receive COVID-19 vaccines. There are no expected safety concerns for breastfeeding whine or their ppi. If you are planning to be hap, you can still receive COVID-19 vaccines. If you have any questions about COVID-19 vaccines and pregnancy or breastfeeding, speak to your midwife or doctor. There are still many things we can do to help stop the spread of COVID-19 Stay home if you're sick Use the NZ COVID tracer app (including turning on Bluetooth) Wear a face covering on public transport Wash your hands regularly with soap and water Get tested for COVID-19 if you have symptoms Choosing to get vaccinated.Are there side effects from the vaccine? All vaccines can have some side effects. These side effects are usually mild and only last for a few days. Common side effects can include: pain at the injection site a headache feeling tired or fatigued muscle aches feeling generally unwell chills fever joint pain nausea. These are signs that the vaccine is working. Globally, millions of people have already received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with an extremely small number of serious reactions. If you have any questions or worries after your vaccinations, contact your doctor or health provider. For some of our whnau, it's best to check-in with your health provider before getting the vaccine Pregnant. T alk to your midwife or doctor. Taking any medications. T alk to your health provider first. Have a bleeding disorder. T alk to your health provider first. Had an allergic reaction to any vaccine or injection in the past.

OUR L OGO*At this stage, tamariki and rangatahi under 16 cannot get the Pfizer vaccine. The first trials of the vaccine focused on more vulnerable groups rather than younger people. Further trials are currently underway and when more data becomes available,that guidance will be updated.Divders 2 "}
