Homeopathy can be very effective in treating a person with mould allergies or mould sickness caused by black mould spores. According to U.K housing charity Shelter, there are 1 in 5 renters who are affected by damp and mould in Britain. In the U.S statistics say that about 70% of homes have mould, with 50% of building moulds being invisible. Genetic factor Around 28% of people are genetically susceptible to mould toxicity, which causes an auto-immune like response in the body. This is because mast cells, the white blood cells that trigger an inflammatory response, are very sensitive to mould toxins. Mast cells commonly release histamine, serotonin, or tryptase in response to toxic mould. People susceptible to this response have the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) gene and it prevents their body eliminating mould toxicity. This can lead to many severe symptoms which can go undiagnosed, especially if they are living in a home where the mould is hidden. Mould toxicity/sickness vs mould allergy symptoms The medical establishment appears to believe that severe mould toxicity or mould sickness is a myth and that black mould only triggers congestion and allergies. what I've seen in my homeopathic clinic and through further research strongly contests this. If your symptoms are more severe and continue after you have left the mouldy environment i.e moved house, then you probably have mould sickness which is due to CIRS (chronic inflammatory response syndrome).

Cause of mould toxicity Black mould contains mycotoxins. Mycotoxins are poisonous substances produced by fungi or mould. They can be toxic for humans when they are eaten, absorbed into the skin, or inhaled. A small amount of mycotoxin can be damaging to human or animal health and even cause death. Mould is harboured in the body and continues to release and produce mycotoxins, which contribute to ongoing chronic illness (CIRS). Sinuses are the favoured spot in the body for the mould and mycotoxins to live. Mould toxicity and the thyroid dysfunction Mycotoxins that are released from moulds can be particularly damaging to the [Thyroid gland.](http://HYPOTHYROIDISM. TREATING WITH HOMEOPATHY.) Mould affects the thyroid by encouraging an inflammatory response such as thyroiditis. Thyroid conditions can be reversed by detoxing the mould toxins as shown in the case below. Homeopathy for mould toxicity A recent patient of mine made a miraculous recovery after being severely affected by mould toxicity. Case study Maggie was exposed to invisible mould in her local Gym in Texas (50% of all moulds are hidden) and some in her home 3 years ago in 2019. Since then, she found it hard to gain weight, had Candida overgrowth and it even triggered [hypothyroidism.](http://HYPOTHYROIDISM-FRIENDS AND ENEMIES) She had pain in her hands and feet and her joints were stiff in cold weather. In the week leading up to her period she had cold sores around her mouth. If her weight dropped to under 117Ibs (8 stone 5ibs) which it was prone to do, she became so weak she could hardly walk. Her hair was thinning, especially on the crown area and her nails would break and peel easily. The week before her period would be particularly bad especially around her emotions when she became, angry, snappy, paranoid, and insecure from overthinking. She had cramping and burning pubic area and a very heavy flow. The mould had caused a chronic inflammatory response syndrome which resulted in her throat burning and swelling with a stabbing pain If she tried to sing (she was a singer) and cramping in the muscles in her legs. At one point her vision even went but was now left with shaky eyes and is prone to dizziness. She had tried detoxing with Bentonite clay and parasite cleanses, but nothing had worked. She complained that her body temperature was always cold even though she lived in a warm climate. Remedies One strange symptom was that she regularly dreamed that her teeth were falling out. This symptom when paired with all her physical symptoms bought me to the remedy Thuja. This is one of the main remedies for clearing vaccine damage, so I knew it had a detoxing action. I also gave her remedies to support her organs of detoxification such as the liver and kidneys plus thyroid support remedy combinations to help balance and support the thyroid. Progress From that first appointment she began to make progress. Gaining weight and energy and having a more balanced period both physically and emotionally. She showed signs of detoxification such as mild acne, and an increase in cold sores around her mouth which soon cleared. Over several months she continued to improve as the remedies were tweaked to address her change in symptoms. Homeopathy is like peeling an Onion. As symptoms are treated other new ones may become more prominent as they need addressing. Gradually she was able to begin singing and exercising again, her thyroid levels became in range and after exactly 6 months of treatment she became pregnant! She has now stopped all remedies and continues to enjoy a symptom free pregnancy and generally feels very well. Pregnancy can put such a strain on a women's body so the fact that she feels so well is a major indication of how far she has come. The power of homeopathy. Since researching mould toxicity and how it affects only people with the HLA gene has made me realise how incredible homeopathy is. As far as I am aware Maggie only tried a few therapies such as bentonite clay before she came to me for treatment. The tipping point being when her thyroid became affected adding to her long list of symptoms. Her system appears to be now free of all the toxins that her body was not previously able to expel due to her genetic makeup.
