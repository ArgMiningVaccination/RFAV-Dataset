Biomedical Innovations to Combat COVID-19 provides an updated overview on the development of vaccines, antiviral drugs and nanomaterials, and diagnostic methods for the fight against COVID-19. Perspectives on such technologies are identified, discussed, and enriched with figures for easy understanding and applicability. Furthermore, it contains basic aspects of virology, immunology, and antiviral drugs that are needed to fully appreciate these innovations. This book is split into four sections: introduction, presenting basic virologic and epidemiological aspects of COVID-19; vaccines against COVID-19, discussing their different types and applications used to develop them; diagnostic approaches for SARS-CoV-2, encompassing advanced sensing and microfluidic-based biosensors; and drug development and delivery, where antivirals based on nanomaterials or drugs are presented. It is a valuable source for virologists, biotechnologists, and members of biomedical field interested in learning more about how novel technologies can be applied to fasten the eradication of the COVID-19 and similar pandemics. 1.
