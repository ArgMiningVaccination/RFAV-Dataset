I have deep respect for the land and region in which I reside, and for the people who have lived here in the past, and continue to live here now. As a social worker for the past 28 years, I have worked in various settings: community agencies, hospitals, inpatient psychiatry, emergency services, outpatient clinics, behavioral health, and wellness centers. I enjoy living a healthy lifestyle in the countryside. Cooking with locally grown food and herbs from my organic garden is grounding for me. I engage in movement through hiking, biking, dancing, swimming and paddle boarding. I am grateful to be surrounded by wise friends, mentors and teachers who continue to help me grow.

Pour yourself a cup of tea and let's connect! I use an integrative somatic approach in working with you, which includes your whole body and being. This means that we will incorporate awareness of thought, emotion, sensation, movement, and energy in our sessions together. We will track nervous system regulation with the intention of expanding your capacity and resilience over time. We will also work slow enough to allow all parts of you to work toward balance, coherence and integration. Empowering your innate ability to heal is essential for creating sustainable well-being. We will find opportunities for growth that are supported by personal practices and healthy lifestyle choices for self-care. Making small changes in any area of your life begins to effect change in other areas. Building on your success, and learning new skills empowers you to have more capacity and resilience within your life. Collaboration with you, and the wisdom of your whole being, creates an integrated approach to your care. I am happy to provide referrals to appropriate community resources that promote an ongoing support system throughout your healing process, in addition to collaborating with your existing health care team.
