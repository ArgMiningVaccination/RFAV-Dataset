And here are some quick etiquette points: - Set aside this time to be fully present in the gathering. - When you join the gathering you will already be MUTED. Enter as if you are entering a meditation hall (you are), and hold the silence and space in your being as others enter. - When the time comes to speak, raise your hand to let the teacher know you want to talk, wait to be called on, and the teacher will UNMUTE you. - If possible use a headset - the microphones are very powerful and will pick up ambient noises easily - also headphones seem to eliminate most feedback. - If you are using a phone to call in - please find out how to identify yourself, so your name is showing up and not just your phone number - nice for us to know who is there. - Consider the lighting of your digital space so we can see you well. If you are backlit your face is not visible. - If you need to leave your spot for a moment for a bio-break etc. - please turn your video off - that way others don't detect movement on your screen or watch you go to the refrigerator etc. Refrain from using the CHAT function. Rest inside yourself. Laptops and iPad allow for a GALLERY VIEW (above) so all of the participants can be seen - this makes the field feel very present and intimate so if at all possible please have your video capability on. Thanks everyone - see "}
