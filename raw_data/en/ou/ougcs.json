Autism... suggestions? Ideas? Hello everyone, I was wondering if anyone's little one got diagnosed with autism? And what their first signs was. My little one 2.5 year old boy, born April 2021 does things and shows most signs but not all. doctors won't refer me to anyone, as his doctor said \" he can comprehend things but just can't use his words \".. My little one started at 12 months old, started with behaviors; and delayed speech, as he got older his signs progressed, and so has his behavior. he still barley speaks, he said \" hi, bye, mama . Dadda \". And nothing else . he does grunt and \" babble, and point to things vs talk, he flaps his arms , ( when excited, getting annoyed etc\".). he also, HATES ANY noises, ( car running , fans In the bathroom, ( forgot what they are called), dogs barking , vacuum, basically any noises ). he freaks out and screams like he's being murdered and covers his ears, not related but he also hates animals , ( not sure if it's because they are furry, or as big as him). if we have a change in schedule he gets mad he cannot handle change, he has no interest in playing with other kids , ( his older brother and sister 3&4 he don't really play with mainly hits them to make them move). He has a handful of emotional outbursts on a daily and it's hard to figure out what's wrong as he doesn't speak . He's always chewing on his hands , or other objects that shouldn't be chewed on . He gets over stimulated so easily. He has a lot more things: but can't think of all off the top of my head. Doctors say hes fine and just has delayed speech as his eating habits are fine; and he responds to his name and can understand simple things: as \" grab your shoes, or cup\" so won't refer me anywhere. Was wondering if any one else's little ones had these signs etc and have been diagnosed, I just want what's best for him, and I'm stuck on what to do as doctors won't press the matter. Recommendations, advice or any first signs, your child had before being diagnosed.

Your instincts tell you that something isn't right and you know best. Best of luck. Agree with previous poster... change your pediatrician if you feel they're not listening to this concern. You know your child, and if you feel like something could be going on where your son could benefit from services, he should at least be evaluated You don't need to wait for your dr to refer you to anyone. Your state or county should have early intervention services for your son. They usually will evaluate up 3 years old. After that check your school district. Ours evaluates and has an early intervention program for preschool. For free. Don't wait. The early he gets evaluated the sooner he can get help. And he may have sensory processing disorder. He may not be getting enough (the chewing) or too much (the noise). They can figure that out as well. Good luck. And you're doing a great job even asking the questions. I was thinking maybe her insurance required it and depends on what country. But I absolutely got my daughter into therapies at 4 with no referral and she was eventually diagnosed at 6. I'm very glad I didn't wait on my pediatrician to say we should take her. Besides, even if they are a good pediatrician, they only see your kid 1-2 times a year and aren't who I would rely on for that. Yeah I guess a different country would be different and I agree, drs only see our kids a few times a year. I am always under the mindset, if it feels weird or off, get it checked out. Can't hurt. And if they are diagnosed then being early is even better. And good for you for not waiting. It can take forever and drs can brush stuff off. my son was diagnosed before his 3rd birthday. Everything you mentioned was my son! Now he will not stop talking! He understands much more than we thought. He's obsessed with dinosaurs and can name a good amount. He's getting ABA,speech and Occupational therapy. Be. Your sons voice! Advocate for him! I'm an early childhood educator and I knew and saw the signs with my son. Early intervention is sooooooo important!!!! The sooner you tackle where he needs that extra help believe he will improve immediately!
