Researchers suspected these vitamins might affect how well children respond to the flu vaccine. But earlier studies by other scientists showed mixed results. A new St. Jude study may have the answer. Baseline vitamin levels are rarely studied in flu vaccine research. But scientists found that baseline vitamin A and D levels were linked to immune responses to the vaccine. A clinical trial studied the flu vaccine and vitamin supplements in children 2-8 years old. Children got two doses of the vaccine either with a vitamin A and D supplement or a placebo. \"Baseline vitamin A and D levels each influenced the flu vaccine-induced immune response and the effect of high-dose vitamin supplements,\" said [Julia L.
