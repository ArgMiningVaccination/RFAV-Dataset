But when fatigue becomes a chronic issue, then it is time to think about what may be wrong. Often it is the case that chronic fatigue is the result of the accumulation of toxins in your diet. A detox diet can help with this problem. Even if you do not live with chronic fatigue, an all-natural energy boost would be a healthy addition to life. Detox diets can boost energy simply by removing the toxins that slow us down. So many of the additives to foods, and even the nature of certain foods, can cause toxins to build up in the body. A healthy detox diet gives your body a break, and it allows your natural systems to rest. The liver and kidneys are the two main organ systems that remove toxins from the body. But when the toxic load becomes too much, even these natural systems cannot keep up. This is where a detox diet can help. Detox diets provide several health benefits. One of the most important benefits of a detox diet is a boost to your energy levels. This guide will explain how you can get a boost to your energy level from a healthy detox diet. What is a detox diet? A detox diet is most often a short-term dietary procedure designed to remove toxins from your diet and to assist your body in eliminating toxins from your body. Many detox diets include a period of fasting followed by a strict program of fruits and vegetables, juices from both fruits and vegetables, and water. Many detox diets also include teas, nut milk, and supplements designed to help natural processes like liver and excretory functions. There are a few detox diets and protocols that call for things like colon cleanses and enemas. The purposes of a detox diet are to remove toxins from the diet and the body and to stimulate natural physiological functions that cleanse the body. Specifically, a detox diet works to: Give your organs a break. Stimulate liver function. Facilitate elimination through urine, feces, and sweat. Improve circulation Boost nutrients in your body. Keep in mind that many things we eat that are meant to be healthy may still contain toxins that accumulate over time. Even if you maintain a healthy diet you still can benefit from a detox diet. Some of the benefits of a detox diet include improved digestion, alleviate inflammation, and may protection against many serious chronic diseases. Health benefits of a detox diet There are numerous health benefits from a detox diet. In addition to providing a natural boost to energy levels, a detox diet can also offer the following health benefits: Digestive Health Everything we eat has an impact on our digestive system. When we are consuming toxic and harmful chemicals, our digestive system is perhaps the first thing to suffer. Detox diet cleanses the digestive system while providing foods that are simple in molecular structure and therefore easy to breakdown. The benefits of digestion are two-fold: the system gets a rest, and the processes it needs to perform are vastly simplified. Control Cravings We see above that a detox diet can help you lose weight. In addition to the weight loss, a detox diet can help you stay fit by controlling cravings. By relying largely on the liquids that characterize much of a detox diet, your body becomes accustomed to lower intake and slower easier metabolic load. Over time, your cravings for foods will decrease. Increased Energy The toxins we take in every day create a burden for your liver. With the liver working too hard you will begin to feel fatigued. By decreasing the toxins you take in and simultaneously cleaning your body of built-up toxins, the liver begins to work more efficiently and this is passed on to your entire body in the form of more energy. Improved Mental Health Hormones are involved with all physiological functions. One of the primary ways hormones are regulated in our bodies is through our diet. One hormone specifically associated with stress is cortisol which increases our stress levels. A detox diet reduces the stress load on the liver which in turn allows the liver to process and eliminate cortisol. The net benefit is decreased stress and a profound decrease in the physiological effects of stress. What is more, the more egregious toxins like alcohol and caffeine are linked to things like fatigue and poor sleeping patterns. These harms our mental health. By eliminating these things through a detox diet and giving your body the added boost you need to process these toxins in the body, you will experience better sleep, more energy, and an overall better emotional state. How can a detox diet boost my energy? In addition to the above health benefits, detox diets can give you more energy by providing relief in some key areas of your health. These include: Fighting inflammation Inflammation is a natural physical response to injury and illness. This is a natural mechanism whereby the body helps to heal damaged tissue. But when inflammation becomes chronic and uncontrollable, it leads to a host of health problems. Chronic inflammation is one of the main causes of things like arthritis, autoimmune disease, depression, and heart disease. Chronic inflammation can also lead to chronic fatigue. One of the primary causes of chronic inflammation is accumulated toxicity in the body. Whether from poor diet or from the mass of environmental toxins that vex contemporary life, toxins that have built up in the body tend to cause chronic inflammation and this invariably leads to chronic fatigue. A sound period of a detox diet helps to flush these accumulated toxins from the body and ease inflammation that causes fatigue. Restoring balance to gut health Lack of balance in gut health can lead to everything from immune problems to skin problems. A great way to address gut health imbalance is by providing a break to your digestive system so it can restore balance. One of the main culprits for killing off healthy bacteria in the but are toxins found in foods. Some of these toxins are from unnatural additive sin foods, and some are simply from the foods themselves. By giving your body a planned period of fasting through a sound detox diet, you can allow healthy gut bacteria to return to normal levels. Simply removing the toxins from your diet through a detox diet can allow these natural and necessary bacteria to re-grow to healthy levels. Restoring quality sleep Insufficient sleep is one of those things people have come to simply accept in modern life. The problem is that proper sleep is one of the most essential factors for health. Without quality sleep, our health suffers on every front. Among the things that can interrupt quality sleep is an over-abundance of processed sugars. Unfortunately, these processed sugars are now found in so many foods it can be almost impossible to avoid them. Even things like whole-wheat bread often contain processed sugars that interrupt natural sleep cycles. A detox diet removes all sugars for a prescribed period. By eliminating sugars through a detox diet, you can allow the natural balance of sugar in your metabolism to return, and sleep cycles can get back to a healthy rhythm. Detecting and reducing food sensitivities The main driver of chronic fatigue is undetected food sensitivities. For many of us, we do not even know which foods may cause problems for us because we never take a break from the routines of how we eat. Detox diets eliminate all the foods from your ordinary routines and normal diet. By slowly adding things back into your diet, you can isolate the foods that cause sensitivities and thereby eliminate them. How do you prepare for a detox diet? As you get ready to begin your detox diet, there are some simple steps you can take to get your body ready for the process of detoxing. These are essentially the steps you take to get your body ready for the diet itself. Start your day with a warm glass of lemon or lime water. This kick-starts your digestive system and your metabolism and alkalizes your system which facilitates kidney and liver function. The extra vitamin C also helps boost your immune system. Increase the amount of water you drink to flush your system, particularly the kidneys and liver. You can also add things like nettle tea, dandelion root tea, and burdock root tea which are known to begin detox processes in your metabolism. Begin switching to simple foods like steamed or raw vegetables. Rely more on things like leafy greens and fresh herbs. This will start your body adjusting to a detox period. Increase your intake of whole grains. Things like brown rice, quinoa, and spelled will begin the process of removing glutens from the body that can lead to excess toxicity. Drink light vegetable broths and soups. Switch over to fresh organic fruits for breakfast. Start cutting down and eliminating caffeine from your diet.
