The company will supply enough doses to vaccinate 250,000 people each month through April, Gergely Guly\u00e1s said during a [briefing](https://www.facebook.com/kormanyzat/videos/434073654405378) Friday. The country completed a deal for the Chinese two-dose inactivated coronavirus vaccine in January. Hungary also received the first doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine this week, and Orb\u00e1n said earlier in the day that it plans to start using them as early as next week. The prime minister used the occasion to criticize the EU's vaccination strategy for \"progressing slowly\" and focusing on getting vaccines at low costs. \"It was important for the Brussels bureaucrats that we get vaccines as cheaply as possible, which is understandable, because they will be attacked \u2014 if there will be attacks \u2014 on whether they were prudent enough in their financial bargaining on vaccine procurement,\" Orb\u00e1n [told](http://www.miniszterelnok.hu/orban-viktor-a-kossuth-radio-jo-reggelt-magyarorszag-cimu-musoraban-34/) state-owned Kossuth R\u00e1di\u00f3. \"But for us, who are not Brussels bureaucrats but Hungarians ... the money is not irrelevant, but secondary compared to life,\" he continued. \"So if we have to choose [between] fewer vaccines more slowly and cheaply, or quickly and many but more expensively, then we choose the latter.\" \"And this perhaps is not as obvious in Brussels as it is here, in Budapest, in this studio,\" he added.This article is part of POLITICO's premium policy service: Pro Health Care.
