Its mission is to fight poverty for lasting results and to help people help themselves and their environment by providing resources, sharing knowledge, building capacity, and forging partnerships in the public and private sectors.THE WORLD BANK GROUP IEG: IMPROVING DEVELOPMENT RESULTS THROUGH EXCELLENCE IN EVALUATION The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) is an independent, three-part unit within the World Bank Group. IEG-World Bank is charged with evaluating the activities of the IBRD (the World Bank) and IDA, IEG-IFC focuses onassessment of IFC's work toward private sector development, and IEG-MIGA evaluates the contributions of MIGA guarantee projects and services. IEG reports directly to the Bank's Board of Directors through the Director-General,Evaluation. The goals of evaluation are to learn from experience, to provide an objective basis for assessing the results of the Bank Group's work, and to provide accountability in the achievement of its objectives. It also improves Bank Groupwork by identifying and disseminating the lessons learned from experience and by framing recommendations drawnfrom evaluation findings.THE INDEPENDENT EVALUATION GROUPImproving Effectiveness and Outcomes for the Poor in Health,Nutrition, and Population An Evaluation of World Bank Group Support Since 1997 2009 The World Bank Washington, D.C.http://www.worldbank.org/ieg http://www.ifc.org/ieghttp://www.miga.org/ieg\u00a92009 The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank 1818 H Street NWWashington DC 20433T elephone: 202-473-1000Internet: www.worldbank.orgE-mail: feedback@worldbank.org All rights reserved1 2 3 4 11 10 09 08This volume is a product of the staff of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank Group.

Over this period, key health andnutrition outcomes have improved in every de-veloping region, but many countries are off trackfor achieving the MDGs, and progress has beenwidely uneven among and within countries. Enor-mous challenges remain in reducing morbidityand mortality from infectious disease, high and ris-ing noncommunicable disease, and pervasive mal-nutrition, as well as in lowering high fertility. IEG's assessment of the efficacy of the World Bank Group's support for health, nutrition, and popu-lation (HNP) to developing countries since 1997aims to help improve results in the context of thenew aid architecture. The evaluation focuses on theBank's policy dialogue, analytic work, and lendingat the country level and the performance of IFC'shealth investments and Advisory Services. Theevaluation also draws lessons from Bank Group ex-perience in supporting several major approachesadopted by the international community\u2014sector-wide approaches (SWAps), communicable diseasecontrol, health reform, and multisectoral action forhealth outcomes. From 1997 to 2008 the World Bank provided $17 billion in country-level project financing, in addi-tion to policy advice and analytic work for health,nutrition, and population. Bank support has helpedbuild government capacity in the sector, and ana-lytic work has contributed to better performance.About two-thirds of the Bank's HNP lending has hadsatisfactory outcomes, often in difficult environ- ments. The record also tells us that the Bank needsto intensify efforts to improve substantially theperformance of the HNP portfolio. Factors that in-hibit stronger performance include the increasingcomplexity of HNP operations, particularly in Africa,but also in health reform in middle-income coun-tries; inadequate risk assessment and mitigation;and weak monitoring and evaluation. Over thesame period, IFC has made important strategicshifts, committing $873 million in private health andpharmaceutical investments. IFC performance inhealth investments, mainly in hospitals, improvedmarkedly from a weak start. The Corporation needsto invest more in activities that both make businesssense and are likely to yield broader benefits for thepoor. The accountability of Bank and IFC-financedHNP projects to ensure that results actually reachthe poor has been weak. Non-health sectors, suchas water supply and sanitation and transport, haveweak incentives to obtain and demonstrate healthbenefits from their investments. Though the Bank Group now funds a smaller share of the global financial support for HNP , it hasstepped up its worldwide involvement, includingits catalytic, lead, and support roles in many re-spects. The Group has a unique and substantialability to help improve HNP results and outcomesfor the poor. In delivering on this potential, theWorld Bank Group needs to strengthen its coun-try support, renew the commitment to resultsfor the poor, and give greater attention to re-ducing high fertility and malnutrition. Better re-sults also hinge on supporting capacity and bettergovernance for efficient health systems, enhanc-ing the contribution of other sectors to HNP out-comes, and boosting monitoring and evaluation.

Enormous chal-lenges remain in reducing morbidity and mortalityfrom infectious disease, the high and rising shareof noncommunicable disease, pervasive malnu-trition, and high fertility, with its consequences for maternal mortality, maternal and child health,and poverty. The World Bank Group's support for health, nu- trition, and population (HNP) has been sustainedsince 1997\u2014totaling $17 billion in country-levelsupport by the World Bank and $873 million in pri-vate health and pharmaceutical investments by theInternational Finance Corporation (IFC). Beyondcountry-level support, the World Bank Groupparticipates in nearly three dozen internationalpartnerships in HNP , with indirect benefits tocountries. This report evaluates the efficacy ofthe Bank Group's direct support for HNP to de-veloping countries since 1997 and draws lessonsto help improve the effectiveness of this supportin the context of the new aid architecture. Though the Bank Group now funds a smaller share of global HNP support than it did a decadeago, it still has substantial ability to add value if it can do a better job of helping countries deliver re-sults, especially for the poor. World Bank sup-port to countries in the form of lending, analyticwork, and policy dialogue has helped build gov-ernment capacity to manage the sector\u2014criti-cally important to improving aid effectiveness,given the increasing reliance of other donors ongovernment systems. About two-thirds of the World Bank's HNP lend- ing has had satisfactory outcomes, often in diffi-cult environments, but a third has not performedwell. Contributing factors have been the increas-ing complexity of HNP operations, particularlyin Africa but also in health-reform support tomiddle-income countries; inadequate risk as-sessment and mitigation; and weak monitoringand evaluation. The performance of IFC's health investments has improved markedly from a weak start, but thereremain important gaps in investing in activities thatboth make business sense and are likely to yieldbroader benefits for the poor. Accountability forresults in these projects has been weak\u2014the ac-countability of Bank and IFC-financed projectsto ensure that results actually reach the poor, The global aid architecture in health has changed over the past decade, with the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) anda major expansion of the levels and sources of development assistance, particularly for low-income countries. While key health outcomes such as in-fant survival and nutritional stunting have improved over the decade in everydeveloping region, nearly three-quarters of developing countries are eitheroff track or seriously off track for achieving the MDG for reducing under-fivemortality. Maternal mortality is declining at only 1 percent each year, a fifth ofthe rate needed to achieve the goal. and the accountability of projects in the Bank's non-health sectors, such as water supply and san-itation and transport, for demonstrating theirhealth benefits. For the Bank Group to achieve its objectives of improving health sector performance and HNPoutcomes among the poor, it needs to act in fiveareas: intensify efforts to improve the performanceof the portfolio; renew the commitment to de-livering results for the poor, including greater at-tention to reducing high fertility and malnutrition;build its own capacity to help countries to makehealth systems more efficient; enhance the con-tribution of other sectors to HNP outcomes; andboost evaluation to implement the results agendaand improve governance. By doing this, the BankGroup will contribute not only to meeting theMDGs but also to ensuring that the poor benefit,and that those benefits are sustained. Since the late 1990s, when the World Bank Group was the largest source of HNP finance to devel-oping countries, new aid donors and institutionshave emerged, and development assistance forHNP has more than doubled, from an annual av-erage of $6.7 billion in 1997/98 to about $16 bil-lion in 2006. The international community hasadopted global development targets, the mostprominent of which are the MDGs, with a newemphasis on aid effectiveness, results orienta-tion, donor harmonization, alignment, and coun-try leadership, reflected in the 2005 Paris Decla- ration on Aid Effectiveness and the 2008 Accra Agenda for Action . The World Bank Group, now one of many large players in international HNP support, accounts foronly about 6 percent of the total\u2014down from 18percent in the 1990s\u2014and is reassessing its com-parative advantage in the context of the new aidarchitecture. At the same time, a call for greaterengagement with the private health sector in de-veloping countries presents new opportunities forIFC to extend its support. The decline in its relative contribution aside, the World Bank Group commitment to HNP is stillsubstantial. Since 1997, the World Bank (Inter-national Bank for Reconstruction and Develop- ment and the International Development Asso-ciation) has committed nearly $17 billion to 605HNP projects in more than 120 countries, spon-sored analytic work, and offered policy advice. Thissupport aimed to improve health and nutrition sta-tus and reduce high fertility; improve the access,quality, efficiency, and equity of the health system;reform health systems through changes in healthfinance, support for health insurance, decentral-ization, engaging the private sector, and otherstructural changes; and strengthen institutionalcapacity and sector management. In addition, theBank has greatly expanded its participation inglobal partnerships for health; as of 2007, it wasparticipating financially in 19 global partnershipsand engaged in others ways in 15 more. IFC has financed 68 private investment projects in the health and pharmaceutical sectors of de-veloping countries\u2014amounting to $873 millionin total commitments\u2014and offered advisory ser-vices on health to the private sector, including sup-port for public-private partnerships. The World Bank's 2007 strategy, Healthy Devel- opment: The World Bank Strategy for Health,Nutrition, and Population Results, aims, among other things, to improve HNP outcomes on av-erage and among the poor; prevent poverty dueto illness; improve health system performance;and enhance governance, accountability, andtransparency in the sector. It points to severalstrategic directions or actions for the Bank toachieve the objectives, including: A renewed focus on HNP results Efforts to help countries improve the per- formance of health systems and to ensure synergy with priority disease interventions , particularly in low-income countries Strengthened Bank capacity to advise coun- tries on intersectoral approaches to improv- ing HNP results. The 2002 IFC health strategy defines the sector's goals as improving health outcomes, protectingthe population from the impoverishing effectsof ill health, and enhancing the performance of xivIMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATIONhealth services. The strategy has both business and developmental objectives, among them promot-ing efficiency and innovation in the health sector.It also calls broadly for increasing the social im-pact of IFC investments. The Scope of the Evaluation This evaluation aims to inform the implementationof the most recent World Bank and IFC HNPstrategies to enhance the effectiveness of futuresupport. It covers the period since fiscal year 1997and is based on desk reviews of the portfolio,background studies, and field visits. The evaluationof the HNP support of the World Bank focuses onthe effectiveness of policy dialogue, analytic work,and lending at the country level, while that of IFC focuses on the performance of health invest-ments and advisory services before and after its2002 health strategy. The themes it covers aredrawn from the two strategies and the approachesadopted by international donors in the pastdecade. IEG has previously evaluated several as-pects of the Bank's HNP support. IFC's support forthe health sector has never been fully evaluated. Bank Support to the Public Sector for HNP Over the past decade, the World Bank directly sup- ported HNP outcomes in countries through lend-ing and nonlending services. The largest sourceof lending was from projects managed within theBank's HNP sector units ($11.5 billion, 255 proj-ects). Almost all HNP-managed projects were in-vestment lending. Beyond this, about $5 billionin lending for HNP outcomes was managed byother sectors. In nonlending services, since fiscal2000 the Bank has spent $43 million of its ownbudget and trust funds on HNP-related economicand sector work (ESW). The number of profes-sional HNP staff grew by a quarter, as did theshare of health specialists among HNP staff. The World Bank's Role Although the World Bank finances a smallershare of country-level development assis-tance under the new international aid ar-chitecture, it still has significant potentialto add value. But the value of that support iscontext-specific and depends on the Bank'sability to help countries deliver results. The World Bank brings important institutional assetsto bear in helping countries make health systemswork better and ensuring that health benefitsreach the poor: long-term, sustained engagementin the sector; international experience; a his-tory of support for building country capacity toimplement programs; large-scale, sustained fi-nancing; strong links to finance ministries; and en-gagement with many sectors other than healthwith potential to contribute to HNP outcomes.The Bank's comparative advantage in a countryis context-specific, depending on health condi-tions, government priorities and resources, andthe activities of other development partners. T odeliver on its comparative advantages, the Bankneeds to improve the performance of its country-level support. The Evolution and Performance of World Bank Support While the overall level of HNP project ap- provals changed little, the composition ofthe lending portfolio saw some major shifts.The number of HNP-managed projects approvedannually rose slowly, but new commitments de-clined. The share of communicable disease proj-ects doubled over the decade, reaching about 40 percent of approvals in the second half of theperiod, as did the share of multisectoral projects,reaching half of all approvals. The share of AfricaRegion projects in the HNP lending portfolio alsoincreased. These three trends were due primar-ily to an increase in multisectoral projects ad-dressing acquired immune deficiency syndrome(AIDS). Projects supporting sectorwide approaches(SWAps) in health rose to a cumulative total of 28operations in 22 countries, about 13 percent of theproject portfolio. In contrast, the share of lend-ing with objectives to reform the health systemdropped by nearly half. Attention to population and malnutrition was low, and support for population nearlydisappeared. About 1 in 10 projects had an ob- jective to reduce malnutrition, which dispropor-tionately affects the poor, but the share of projectswith nutrition objectives dropped by half overthe decade. About two-thirds of nutrition projectsEXECUTIVE SUMMARY xvwere in countries with high levels of child stunting, but Bank nutrition support reached only about aquarter of all developing countries with high stunt-ing. Lending to reduce high fertility or improve ac-cess to family planning accounted for only 4 percentof the lending portfolio, dropping by two-thirds be-tween the first and second half of the decade, at atime when the need for such support remainedhigh. Population support was directed to onlyabout a quarter of the 35 countries the Bank iden-tified as having the highest fertility (with rates ofmore than five children per woman). Analytic workand staffing to support population and family plan-ning objectives nearly disappeared. Substantialanalysis of population and nutrition issues rarelyfigured in poverty assessments, even though bothissues are most acutely felt by the poor. Two-thirds of HNP projects have had satis- factory outcomes, and the portfolio's perfor-mance has stalled. The evaluation highlights examples of good performance based on fieldassessments. Support for reducing malaria inEritrea and schistosomiasis in the Arab Republicof Egypt, raising contraceptive use in pilot areasof Malawi, and reforming the health system inthe Kyrgyz Republic, for example, showed goodresults. However, roughly a third of the HNP lend-ing portfolio did not perform well, a share that hasremained steady, while performance in other sec-tors has improved. The performance of HNP sup-port in Africa was particularly weak, with only onein four projects achieving satisfactory outcomes.Complex projects\u2014multisectoral projects andSWAps\u2014in low-capacity environments were leastlikely to HNP objectives. However,health reform projects in middle-income coun-tries also performed less well and are complex andpolitically volatile. Poor-performing projects displayed common char- acteristics: inadequate risk analysis or technicaldesign, inadequate supervision, insufficient politi-cal or institutional analysis, lack of baseline dataon which to set realistic targets, overly complexdesigns in relation to local capacity, and negligi-ble monitoring and evaluation. These problemsare similar to those cited in IEG's 1999 evaluationof the HNP sector. The results of the recent De-tailed Implementation Review of HNP projects in India suggest that, even among projects thatachieve their objectives, field supervision needsto be intensified to ensure that civil works andequipment are delivered as specified, in workingorder, and functioning. Accountability of projects for delivering health results to the poor has been weak. Im- proving health outcomes among the poor isamong the foremost objectives of the 2007 HNPstrategy. Studies of the incidence of public ex-penditure have shown that in most countries,public health spending favors the non-poor; mereexpansion of services cannot be assumed to im-prove access of the poor relative to the non-poor.While many projects targeted HNP support togeographic areas with a high incidence of poverty(including rural areas) or financed services or ad-dressed problems thought to disproportionatelyaffect the poor, only 6 percent of all HNP projectscommitted to deliver better health or nutritionamong the poor in their statement of objectives,for which they were ultimately accountable. Athird of projects with objectives to improve gen-eral health status (such as maternal and childhealth) had no targeting mechanism for reachingthe poor. Among closed projects with objectivesto improve HNP outcomes among the poor, mostmeasured a change in average HNP status in proj-ect areas. Very few actually measured whetherthe poor (individuals or poor project areas) havebenefited in relation to the non-poor or in rela-tion to those in areas not reached by the project,and even fewer demonstrated that the poor had disproportionately benefited. In some cases, im-provements in HNP status were only measured atthe national level. The Bank delivered several high-profile analytic products on HNP and poverty over the pastdecade\u2014notably the Reaching the Poor with Health, Nutrition, and Population Services proj- ect and the World Development Report 2004: Making Services Work for Poor People . Never- theless, the share of country poverty assessmentswith substantial discussion of health has declined,from 80 percent in fiscal years 2000-03 to only 58 percent in 2004-06. Only 7 percent of poverty xviIMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATIONassessments had substantial discussion of popu- lation, and major discussion of nutrition declinedby more than half, from 28 to 12 percent. Abouta quarter to a third of Bank HNP analytic work\u2014both ESW and research\u2014was poverty-related,and this share has also declined in the decadesince 1997. Some aspects of monitoring have improved, but overall it remains weak, and evaluationis almost nonexistent, presenting a challengefor the HNP strategy's results orientationand commitment to better governance. Since 1997, an increasing number of projects have hadmonitoring indicators and baseline data whenthey were appraised. Yet, although nearly a thirdof projects supported pilot interventions or pro- grams, or intended to evaluate the impact of a spe-cific activity or program, few proposed evaluationdesigns in appraisal documents, and even fewerevaluations were actually conducted. Pilot projectsor components without an evaluation design de-scribed in the appraisal document were neverevaluated. Among the consequences of poor mon-itoring and evaluation and absence of baselinedata were irrelevant objectives and inappropriateproject designs, unrealistic targets\u2014either toohigh or below the baseline value\u2014inability to as-sess the effectiveness of activities, and lower effi-cacy and efficiency because of limited opportunitiesfor learning. These findings are of great concerngiven the emphasis of the 2007 HNP strategy onresults and good governance. Approaches for Improving HNP Outcomes The evaluation reviewed findings and lessons forthree prominent approaches to raising HNP out-comes over the past decade\u2014communicabledisease control, health reform, and sectorwide ap-proaches (SWAps). These approaches have beensupported by the Bank as well as the internationalcommunity and are not mutually exclusive. SWAps,for example, have included communicable diseasecontrol and health reform elements. Support for communicable disease control can improve the pro-poor focus of health sys-tems, but excessive earmarking of foreignaid for communicable diseases can distortallocations and reduce capacity in the rest of the health system. One of the strategic di- rections of the 2007 HNP strategy is to ensure syn-ergy between priority disease interventions andstrengthening the health system. The rationale forinvesting in infectious diseases is that they dis-proportionately affect the poor; their control haslarge, positive externalities; and control inter-ventions have been shown to be cost-effective inmany settings. Dedicated communicable diseaseprojects have dramatically increased as a share ofthe overall portfolio over the past decade, andBank support has directly built country capacityin national disease control programs. Supportfor communicable disease control, with the ex-ception of AIDS projects, has shown better out-comes in relation to objectives than the rest of theHNP portfolio. Both equity and cost-effectivenessare particularly important to address in HIV/AIDSprograms, given the huge commitments to thatdisease and that, unlike tuberculosis and malaria,HIV does not always disproportionately strikethe poor. Care must be taken that, as the Bank en-hances its support to systemwide reforms andSWAps, progress on communicable disease con-trol remains a priority. Since the initial increase in Bank-supported com- municable disease control in the early 2000s,mainly for AIDS, the international communityhas also generously expanded funding through theGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria andthe (U.S.) President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Re-lief (PEPFAR), other bilateral contributions, andprivate foundations. In some low-income coun-tries with high HIV prevalence, earmarked AIDSfunds from international partners account for30-40 percent or more of all public health fund-ing. In an environment of scarce human resourcecapacity within the health system, care must betaken to balance the allocation of resources acrosshealth programs and budget lines, to ensure thatlarge earmarked funds for specific diseases donot result in lower efficiencies or reduced careelsewhere in the health system. There is little ev-idence in recently approved Bank support forHIV/AIDS or the other high-priority diseases thatthis issue has been considered in funding deci-sions or in risk analysis. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY xviiHealth reforms promise to improve efficiency and governance, but they are politically con-tentious, often complex, and relatively risky.Health system reform is central to the emphasisof the 2007 HNP strategy on strengthening healthsystems. About a third of HNP projects have sup-ported reform or restructuring of the health sys-tem through changes in health finance, devel-opment of health insurance, decentralization ofhealth systems, and regulation or engagementof the private health sector. These objectives af-fect efficiency and governance, which are valid ob-jectives in their own right, even if they often donot directly affect health status in the short run.Reforms affecting health insurance help to preventthe impoverishing impacts of illness. Bank supportfor health system reforms has been mainly tomiddle-income countries, where health reformprojects represent about half of the portfolio. Many lessons have been learned over the past decade about the successes and pitfalls of supportfor health reform: First, the failure to assess fully the political economy of reform and to prepare a proactiveplan to address it can considerably diminishprospects for success. Political risks, the inter-ests of key stakeholders, and the risk of com-plexity\u2014issues the evaluation case studiesfound to be critical\u2014are often neglected inrisk analysis in project appraisal documentsfor health reform projects. Second, reforms based on careful prior analytic work hold a greater chance of success, but an-alytic work does not ensure success. Third, the sequencing of reforms can improve political feasibility, reduce complexity, ensurethat adequate capacity is in place, and facilitatelearning. When implementation is flagging, theBank can help preserve reform momentumwith complementary programmatic lendingthrough the Ministry of Finance, as it did in Peruand the Kyrgyz Republic. Finally, monitoring and evaluation are critical in health reform projects\u2014to demonstrate theimpact of pilot reforms to garner political sup-port, but also because many reforms cannotwork without a well-functioning management information system. SWAps have contributed to greater govern- ment leadership, capacity, coordination,and harmonization within the health sector,but not necessarily to improved efficiencyor better health results. Sectorwide approaches (SWAps) represent a reform in the way that gov-ernment and international donors work together(the approach) to support the achievement of national health objectives (the program). They support the 2007 HNP strategy's objective toimprove the organization, functioning, and sus-tainability of health systems. The approach pro- motes consensus around a common nationalstrategy, country leadership, better harmoniza-tion and alignment of partners based on theircomparative advantages, joint monitoring, thedevelopment and use of country systems, and, inmany cases, the pooling of donor and governmentfunds. The anticipated benefits include greatercountry sectoral leadership and capacity in man-aging health support, improved coordination andoversight of the inputs of all partners, reducedtransaction costs, more efficient use of develop-ment assistance, more reliable support for thehealth sector, and greater sustainability of healthprograms. The overwhelming focus of SWAps supported by the Bank has been on setting up and imple-menting the approach. Fieldwork found thatcountry capacity has been strengthened in theareas of sector planning, budgeting, and fiduciarysystems. However, weaknesses persist in the de-sign and use of country monitoring and evalua-tion systems; evidence that the approach hasimproved efficiency or lowered transaction costsis thin, because neither has been monitored. Ex-perience has shown that adopting the approachdoes not necessarily lead to better implementa-tion or efficacy of the government's health pro-grams: only a third of Bank projects that supportedhealth SWAps have performed satisfactorily onmeeting their health objectives. SWAps have oftensupported highly ambitious programs, involvingmany complex reforms and activities that exceed xviiiIMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATIONgovernment implementation capacity. An impor- tant lesson is that programs need to be realisticand prioritized and that the process of settingup the SWAp should take care not to distract theplayers from ensuring the implementation and ef-ficacy of the overall health program and a focuson results. SWAps have been most effective inpursuing health program objectives when thegovernment is in a leadership position with astrongly owned and prioritized strategy (as in theKyrgyz Republic). When this is not the case, thereis a risk that the health program implemented willbe less prioritized, reflecting the favored elementsof the diverse partners, weakening effectiveness(as in Ghana). The contribution of other sectors to HNP outcomes has been largely undocumented;the benefits of intersectoral coordinationand multisectoral approaches need to bebalanced with their costs in terms of in-creased complexity. Achieving the health MDGs will require complementary actions from sectorsother than health, an explicit activity proposedwithin the 2007 HNP strategy. The contribution ofother sectors to HNP outcomes has been cap-tured through multisectoral HNP projects (proj-ects that engage multiple sectors in a singleoperation with an objective to improve HNP out-comes) and parallel lending in projects managedby other sectors, in some cases with explicit healthobjectives. Multisectoral HNP operations haverisen from a quarter of all HNP lending to half,greatly increasing the complexity of the portfolio.Most of the increase stems from multisectoralAIDS projects. The large number of sectors in-volved, the lack of specificity in design docu-ments about the roles and responsibilities of eachparticipating sector, the relatively new institu-tions put in charge, and other factors affectinglower performance in Africa all contribute tolower outcomes for multisectoral AIDS projects.Other multisectoral HNP projects with fewer im-plementing agencies have maintained stronger in-tersectoral collaboration and better outcomes. Since 1997, the Bank has invested about $5 billion in smaller HNP components in 350 projects man-aged by other sectors, such as social protection, education, public sector management, water sup-ply, and transport. Both the 2007 HNP strategy andits predecessor foresaw Country Assistance Strate-gies as the instrument for coordinating intersec-toral action to improve HNP outcomes. However,this has not occured over the past decade. Lend-ing activities in diverse sectors such as watersupply and sanitation and education have beenpursued\u2014for the most part\u2014independently ofeach other and of HNP operations, although thisdoes not mean that they have not contributed tohealth outcomes. Lending programs in other sectors may contribute directly or indirectly to HNP outcomes, in somecases by including health objectives or healthcomponents in projects. For example, half of allwater supply and sanitation projects claim thathealth benefits will be generated, and 1 in 10 hasan objective to improve health outcomes. Butfewer water supply and sanitation projects includehealth objectives today than was the case 5-10years ago; in fiscal 2002-06, only 1 in 20 water sup-ply and sanitation projects had an objective toimprove health for which they were accountable.Interviews with water supply and sanitation staffsuggested that the sector has focused primarily on what is perceived to be \"their\" MDG, namelyincreased access to safe water . Yet research has shown that context matters; better access to safewater does not necessarily translate into betterhealth. In contrast, the health content of transportprojects has greatly increased, particularly in thefield of road safety and HIV/AIDS prevention.While trends in accident statistics are relativelywell documented for road safety components,there is very little in the way of documented out-puts or results for HIV/AIDS components. Water supply and sanitation and transport proj- ects with health components or objectives rarelyinvolved collaboration with Ministries of Healthor the Bank's HNP sector (for example, the RuralWater Supply and Sanitation Project in Nepal). De-livery of health results in these and other sectorshas been generally weak, except when an explicithealth objective was identified at project appraisal. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY xixThere were virtually no results reported for health activities that were retrofitted into active projects. IFC Support for Development of the Private Health Sector About three-quarters of health expenditures in low-income countries and half in middle-incomecountries are private, and half of private healthspending among the poor is for pharmaceuticals.IFC has made support to private investment inhealth one of its strategic priorities. Health is a rel-atively small and recent sector of IFC operationsand involves the activities of two departments:Health and Education and General Manufacturing(for pharmaceuticals). The performance of IFC's health invest- ments, mostly hospitals, has substantially im-proved, following a learning process. Before 1999, four-fifths of all health investments per-formed poorly, and a majority of failed project busi-nesses contributed to financial losses. The reasonsfor failure included the impact of financial crisesin certain regions, delays in obtaining regulatoryclearances from the authorities, and IFC's weak-nesses in screening and structuring health sectordeals owing to lack of sector-related experience.These experiences provided important lessonsabout hospital investments. More recent invest-ments have realized good financial returns andperformed better in achieving intended devel-opment outcomes. An evaluative framework forIFC's Advisory Services was only recently launched,so very few health projects have been evaluated,and their results should not be used to infer theperformance of the whole portfolio. However,the few health Advisory Services projects thathave been evaluated have performed lower thanthe IFC portfolio overall. IFC has not been able to diversify its health portfolio as quickly as anticipated. In 2002, the sector set objectives to diversify the portfo-lio beyond hospitals and to improve the social im-pact of IFC health operations. IFC has continuedto finance private hospitals; the share of phar-maceuticals and other life sciences investmentshas grown, though more slowly than envisionedin the strategy. IFC has also financed public-privatepartnerships in health and expanded health Ad- visory Services with a focus on Africa. Investmentnumbers and volume increased from 2005 on-ward. However, to date IFC has not succeeded infinancing any health insurance ventures and hasfinanced only one project in medical education. IFC's health interventions have had limited social impact, although efforts to broadenthose impacts are increasing. IFC's investments in hospitals have targeted middle- and upper-income groups. Linkages to public insuranceschemes will be necessary for IFC-supported hos-pitals to meet the health needs of a wider popula-tion. Expanded support to public-private partner-ships, jointly with the World Bank, such as a recentoutput-based aid project to improve maternal careamong some of Yemen's poorest people, andmore strategic deployment of Advisory Services,such as recent efforts to assist social enterprisesin Kenya and India, could lead to broadening ofthe social impact of investments in the health sec-tor. These investments are too recent to evaluate. Recent IFC health projects have had some positive results for efficiency, governance,and affordability. State-of-the-art facilities in some IFC-supported projects have attracted pro-fessionals with established, successful careers indeveloped countries. Many hospitals supportedby IFC have posted fees and introduced controlof doctors' side practices outside of the institu-tions. The majority of IFC-supported pharma-ceutical projects have resulted in significantdeclines in the prices of generic drugs, thus en-hancing affordability. The need to collaborate closely with the World Bank's HNP sector is recognized asimportant in both the IFC and World Bankstrategies to promote greater efficiency in thehealth sector through finance of privatehealth care. The evaluation found some World Bank-IFC interaction, particularly in middle-income countries, but there is no real model ofhow that collaboration should occur in a situationwhere IFC health activities are few and very smallin relation to the entire World Bank Group HNPsector in a given country. xxIMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATIONRecommendations The following recommendations for the World Bank and IFC are offered to help improve the im-plementation of their respective HNP strategiesand further the mandate to reduce poverty andpromote economic growth in the context of thenew aid architecture. 1. Intensify efforts to improve the per- formance of the World Bank's support forhealth, nutrition, and population. Match project design to country capacity and reduce the complexity of support inlow-capacity settings, particularly in Africa. Thoroughly and carefully assess the risks of proposed HNP support and strategiesfor mitigating those risks, particularly the po-litical risks and incentives of stakeholders. Phase health system reforms to maximize the probability of success. Undertake thorough institutional analysis as an input into more realistic project design. Support intensified supervision in the field by the Bank and the borrower to ensurethat civil works, equipment, and other out-puts have been delivered as specified, arefunctioning, and are being maintained. 2. Renew the commitment to health, nu- trition, and population outcomes amongthe poor. The World Bank should:Boost population, family planning and other support to reduce high fertility. Incorporate the poverty dimension into project objectives. Increase support to reduce malnutrition among the poor, whether from the HNPsector or other sectors. Monitor health, nutrition, and population outcomes among the poor. Bring the health and nutrition of the poor and the links between high fertility, poorhealth, and poverty back into povertyassessments.IFC should: Expand support for innovative approaches and viable business models that demonstrateprivate sector solutions to improve the healthof the poor, including expansion of invest-ments in low-cost generic drugs and tech-nologies that address problems of the poor. Assess the external and internal constraints in achieving broad social impacts in the sector. 3. Strengthen the World Bank Group's abil- ity to help countries to improve the ef-ficiency of health systems. The World Bank should:Better define the efficiency objectives of its support and how efficiency will be improvedand monitored. Carefully assess decisions to finance addi- tional freestanding communicable diseaseprograms in countries where other donorsare contributing large amounts of earmarkeddisease funding and additional earmarkedfunding may contribute to distortions inthe health system. Support improved health information sys- tems and more frequent and vigorous eval-uation of reforms. IFC should:Support public-private partnerships through Advisory Services to government and in-dustry and through its investments, and ex-pand investments in health insurance. Improve collaboration and joint sector work with the World Bank, leveraging Bank sec-tor dialogue on health regulatory frame-works to engage new private actors, andmore systematically coordinate with theBank's policy interventions regarding privatesector participation in health. 4. Enhance the contribution of support from other sectors to health, nutrition,and population outcomes.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY xxiThe World Bank should: When the benefits are potentially great in re- lation to the marginal costs, incorporatehealth objectives into relevant non-healthprojects for which they are accountable. Improve the complementarity of investment operations in health and other sectors toachieve health, nutrition, and populationoutcomes, particularly between health andwater supply and sanitation. Prioritize sectoral participation in multisec- toral HNP projects to reduce complexity. Identify new incentives for Bank staff to work across sectors to improve health, nu-trition, and population outcomes. Develop mechanisms to ensure that the im- plementation and results for small HNP com-ponents retrofitted into ongoing projectsare properly documented and evaluated. IFC should:Improve incentives and institutional mech- anisms for an integrated approach to healthissues across units in IFC dealing with health,including the way that health in IFC is organized. 5. Implement the results agenda and im- prove governance by boosting invest-ment in and incentives for evaluation. The World Bank should:Create new incentives for monitoring and evaluation for both the Bank and the bor-rower linked to the project approval processand the midterm review. This includes re-quirements for baseline data, evaluation de-signs for pilot activities in project appraisaldocuments, and periodic evaluation of mainproject activities as a management tool. IFC should: Enhance its results orientation by develop- ing clearly specified baseline indicators andan evaluation framework that adequatelymeasures IFC's health sector objectives andresults. xxiiIMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATIONxxiiiManagement Response Summary As a global development institution dedicated to supporting country and global efforts to achievethe better health outcomes that are central to re-ducing poverty and to achieve the 2015 Millen-nium Development Goals (MDGs), managementappreciates the findings of this evaluation andother internal and external efforts to improvethe World Bank Group's effectiveness in this keysector. (For the full-length Management Responseand the detailed World Bank Management ActionPlan, please see appendix J.) This IEG report is consistent with the findings of the World Bank's own self-assessment, whichprompted the Bank to adopt a new HNP strategyin mid-2007\u2014 Healthy Development: The World Bank Strategy for Health, Nutrition, and Popu-lation Results. In fact, IEG staff shared the pre- liminary results of their work with the strategyteam that designed the subsequent 2007 strategy. The new Strategy sharpened the Bank's focus on results on the ground; concentrated Bank con-tributions on health systems strengthening, healthfinancing, and economics; supported governmentleadership and international community programsto achieve these results; and focused on enhancedengagement with global partners. Early imple-mentation of the strategy has been promising.An example is the success of Rwanda's results-based approach to improving service delivery,with malaria incidence declining by 62 percent and child mortality decreasing by 30 percent. Main Findings and Recommendations The IEG evaluation covers a decade of Bank sup-port, starting in 1997. The specific performanceto date of the Bank's new strategy, adopted in mid-2007, is discussed in a separate Strategy ProgressReport (World Bank 2009). Bank managementhas taken many of the findings and recommen-dations into account in the Progress Report andthe Management Action Plan. While not detract-ing from the importance of the evaluation and itsusefulness for the Bank's future work in health,nutrition, and population, management has ob-servations on some of the findings. Quality of the Bank HNP Portfolio \u2014The principal finding of the IEG evaluation is that,while two-thirds of the Bank's HNP projects in theperiod 1997-2007 achieved their developmentobjectives, one third, mostly in African countries,did not, clearly warranting close scrutiny. Cur-rent data on risky projects and programs in theHNP portfolio show that problems continue to bemost acute in HIV/AIDS projects and in programsin the Africa Region. The HNP sector's perfor-mance in much of the rest of the world is now near the performance of other sectors, and theAfrica Region has developed new strategic ap-proaches to improving portfolio quality, includingWorld Bank Group management welcomes IEG's evaluation of World Bank Group work in the health, nutrition, and population sectorafter 10 years of implementation of the 1997 health, nutrition, and population (HNP) strategy.a focus on results and emphasis on health systems strengthening. IEG notes the underperformance of HIV/AIDS projects during the height of the epidemic insouthern Africa during the late 1990s, a periodcharacterized by regional conflict and instability,and the internal displacement of millions of refu-gees across borders in the Great Lakes Region ofthe continent. Current projects, focusing on high-risk groups, also constitute a disproportionatenumber of projects at risk in the current portfo-lio. In order to redress this situation, a compre-hensive approach has been adopted to improvethe quality of the Bank's HIV/AIDS operations, in-cluding an umbrella restructuring of the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Programs (MAPs). Investing in Health Systems \u2014The 2007 strat- egy underscores the need to focus on healthsystem strengthening to ensure better health out-comes, particularly for the poorest and the mostvulnerable. Over the past two years, projects witha primary focus on health systems have increasedtwofold. In line with the strategy, 67 percent of Bankprograms approved since fiscal year 2007 that fo-cused on priority disease areas also include strongcomponents on health system strengthening. AnAfrica-focused initiative started in 2008 will im-prove the Bank's capacity to provide rapid adviceand assistance on the ground, particularly in healthfinance, human resources, governance, supplychain management, and infrastructure planning. Doing More in Population and Reproduc- tive Health \u2014Bank management agrees with IEG that it should do more in this key area. TheProgress Report highlights plans for strengthen-ing support for population and reproductivehealth, using a health systems approach that is crit-ical to improving maternal and child survival rates. Investing in Nutrition Support \u2014We also agree with IEG's findings that the Bank needs to focusmore on nutrition. The need for action is even more important today in the context of the on-going crises in fuel, food, and fertilizers, as wellas the escalating effects of the financial crisis. Weare therefore investing significant resources inthe next few years to ramp up the Bank's analyt-ical and investment work and leverage resourcesfrom other donors. The agenda for scaling upnutrition is being catalyzed with additional budgetand external resources, starting in 2009 and con-tinuing for three years. Improving Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) \u2014As noted in the Strategy Progress Report, this is an important part of strategy implemen-tation, (including the work on retrofitting proj-ects and improving the design of new projects).Routine health monitoring systems (includingsurveillance, facility reporting, vital registration,census data, resource tracking, and householdsurveys) may first need to be strengthened toprovide the data and indicators that are needed.The Bank is working with partners, such as theWorld Health Organization, to develop betterways to monitor the health MDGs, including the estimation of trends in child and maternalmortality, for which updates have recently beenissued. The International Financial Corporation's HNP Footprint . IFC has considerably increased its footprint in HNP over the past decade and isprepared to intensify collaboration within theWorld Bank Group. There is a growing acknowl-edgement of the role of the private sector inhealth care in developing countries. The periodunder review has seen a marked increase in IFC'sactivity in health. During this time, many lessonshave been learned, specialist knowledge has deep-ened, and performance has improved by any mea-sure applied. As in other sectors, IFC continuesto strive for greater development impact, and wetherefore welcome all input that could help us todo better. xxivIMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATIONMANAGEMENT RESPONSE SUMMARY xxvManagement Action Record (a) Match project design to country context and capacity and reduce the complexity of projects in low-capacity settingsthrough greater selectivity, prioritization, and sequenc-ing of activities, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. (b) Thoroughly and carefully assess the risks of proposed HNP support and strategies to mitigate them, particularly thepolitical risks and the interests of different stakeholders,and how they will be addressed. (c) Phase reforms to maximize the probability of success. (d) Undertake thorough institutional analysis, including an assessment of alternatives, as an input into more real-istic project design. (e) Support intensified supervision in the field by the Bank and the borrower to ensure that civil works, equipment,and other outputs have been delivered as specified, arefunctioning, and are being maintained. WORLD BANK (a) Boost population and family planning support in the form of analytic work, policy dialogue, and financing to high-fertility countries and countries with pockets of highfertility.Management agrees that complexity can be at least partially addressed by adopting IEG recom- mendations, such as thorough technical preparation, including solid analytical underpinning, po-litical mapping, high quality at entry, including prioritizing interventions relative to the institutionalcontext, and establishing a good results framework, followed by in-depth supervision and par-allel policy dialogue with client and partners. However, HNP operations are rarely institutionally or technically simple, since the desired out- come depends on a complex and interacting set of social, cultural, and institutional factors. This isrecognized by donors and policy makers, whether in low-income, middle-income, or high-incomecountries. The inherent complexity of the sector may be attributable to the political economy ina multi-stakeholder environment, the need for extensive coordination and partnership with na-tional and international agencies and civil society organizations, and the often difficult techni-cal and social nature of the subject. The recent international recognition of the need to invest in(complex) health systems in order to ensure the success of vertical disease control programs inlow-income countriess is testimony to the fact that there are few easy ways to avoid systemiccomplexity. Investing in simple programs would not necessarily provide for lasting impact. Management agrees in principle to carry out political mapping exercises prior to investments in the sector where appropriate. As there are currently mandatory risk assessment and mitigationsteps built into the project cycle and approval process, we anticipate improved risk mitigationstrategies in newer HNP operations. These enable staff to identify major political and technicalrisks and devise with the client suitable risk-mitigation strategies. However, it is also evident thatdespite good assessments and risk-mitigation strategies, neither technical nor political risks canbe completely offset. Management agrees with this recommendation and would note that more projects are now tak- ing this approach. Management agrees with this recommendation. Management agrees in principle with this recommendation. Supervision requirements, both in terms of staffing mix and budgeting, are being reassessed Bank-wide within the context of theongoing review of investment lending. Given the inherent dispersed nature of many HNP in-vestments, care must be taken during project design to ensure that the client assumes respon-sibility for ensuring that civil works, equipment, and other outputs have been delivered asspecified, are functioning and being maintained, while the Bank audits/appraises/confirms thatsuch monitoring is taking place so that detailed supervision of projects can be properly conductedwithin likely budget norms. Management action: In response to the portfolio quality challenges, the HNP Sector Board has introduced a quarterly portfolio monitoring and benchmarking system, which is being used by theSector Board and regional management to improve portfolio performance . Management agrees with this recommendation for high-fertility countries and regions\u2014in par- ticular as those areas have received less attention from other development partners as well overthe past decade. Demand for stand-alone population (family planning) programs has declined overtime. The Bank should increase support for reproductive health programs, which are usually bet-ter implemented when they are fully embedded into public health/clinical services. We wouldRecommendations Management response 1. Intensify efforts to improve the performance of the World Bank's health, nutrition, and population support. 2. Renew the commitment to health, nutrition, and population outcomes among the poor.xxviIMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Management Action Record (continued) (b) Incorporate the poverty dimension into project objec- tives to increase accountability for health, nutrition, andpopulation outcomes among the poor. (c) Increase support to reduce malnutrition among the poor, whether originating in the HNP sector or other sectors. (d) Monitor health, nutrition, and population outcomes among the poor, however defined. generally not support a return to stand-alone vertical family planning projects. Moreover, AIDS control projects (or components) and the work through UNAIDS have substantially contributedto reproductive health\u2014and greatly expanded coverage of family planning for otherwise hard-to-reach population groups. In countries that are significantly advanced through the demographictransition, clients increasingly request advice and financing on financial protection, labor mar-kets, and long-term care needs to address the ongoing demographic and epidemiological shiftsresulting in an aging society. Finally, Development Grant Facility-financed programs such as theSpecial Program of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP),into which the Bank has substantial technical, financial, and managerial input, are contributingto the global reproductive health agenda. Management generally agrees with the need to ensure that project design responds to the pri- orities and needs of the poor, and to measure the full impact of improved health services for thepoor. Management will therefore seek to ensure that adequate attention is given to poverty di-mensions in project design and supervision. However, direct assessments, where feasible, maybe technically complex and expensive. The Bank publication Attacking Inequality in the Health Sector\u2014A Synthesis of Evidence and Tools (Yazbeck 2009) lays out a policy menu (pro-poor pol- icy reforms along six dimensions) and a list of the analytical tools for understanding the constraintsto pro-poor targeting of public health investments in poor countries. As opposed to specific income groups, disease control programs must focus on the prevailing epi- demiology (for example an AIDS program must focus on high-risk groups, irrespective of income).A malaria program focused solely on the poor would fail to eliminate malaria. Polio could only beeradicated from the Western Hemisphere by focusing on large, inclusive campaigns targeting allincome groups. Such investments in public health and control of communicable diseases areglobal public goods, generating positive externalities for society, irrespective of income status. Investments in health systems should result in increased access and better quality of services\u2014 also benefiting the poor. Investment in social security and social safety net systems prevents themiddle class from falling into poverty in case of a catastrophic health event. Management notes the substantive improvements over the past years in quantity and quality of HNP involvement in Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network (PREM)-led analyticalwork, and agrees that HNP must be fully included in all Poverty Assessments and fully examinedin the preparation of CASs. Management agrees with this recommendation. Particularly in the context of the global food cri- sis, the Bank needs to increase investments in nutrition, with a particular focus on maternal andinfant nutrition. Management is therefore investing significant resources in the next few yearsto ramp up the Bank's analytical and investment work and leverage resources from other donors.The agenda for scaling-up nutrition is being catalyzed with additional budget resources, startingin 2009 and continuing for three years. The increased allocations are being utilized principally in Africa and South Asia, two Regions where the malnutrition burden is highest. These funds willbe complemented by additional trust fund resources from Japan, and possibly from other donorsthat are currently engaged in discussions on this issue. Management agrees in principle with this recommendation, and will seek to ensure adequate provision for data collection, where technically feasible, during quality-at-entry and supervisionreviews, in particular as far as poverty targeting is concerned. In order to accomplish this in asustainable manner, management believes that the first priority in many poor countries is to es-tablish routine health monitoring systems (surveillance, facility reporting, vital registration, cen-sus data, resource tracking, household surveys, and the like). These data systems need to bestrengthened in parallel to investing in project-specific management information systems, in orderto provide data and indicators that are needed for program targeting and monitoring for (but notlimited to) the poor.Recommendations Management responseMANAGEMENT RESPONSE SUMMARY xxviiManagement Action Record (continued) (e) Bring the health and nutrition of the poor and the links between high fertility, poor health, and poverty backinto poverty assessments in countries where this has beenneglected. IFC (a) Expand support for innovative approaches and viable business models that demonstrate private sector solu-tions to improve the health of the poor, including ex-pansion of investments in low-cost generic drugs andtechnologies that address health problems of the poor. (b) Assess the external and internal constraints in achiev- ing broad social impacts in the sector. WORLD BANK (a) Better define the efficiency objectives of its support and how efficiency improvements will be improved andmonitored. (b) Carefully assess decisions to finance additional earmarked communicable disease activities in countries where otherManagement agrees. Substantial progress regarding this recommendation has been made in some regions over the past years, both in terms of the analytical underpinnings, the need for capacitybuilding, and investment needs. Management will seek to improve cross-sectoral collaborationwith the PREM Network at country level as a precondition to further improvements. Management action: Recent major analytical work for staff and policy makers prepared by the Human Development Network to improve effectiveness in reaching the poor includes: Reaching the Poor with Health, Nutrition and Population Services\u2014What Works, What Doesn't and Why (Gwatkin, Wagstaff, and Yazbeck 2005) and Attacking Inequality in the Health Sector\u2014A Syn- thesis of Evidence and Tools (Yazbeck 2009). It is expected that this work will help clients and staff achieve better results in reaching the poor with health services. Concerning nutrition, in addition to disseminating the new Nutrition Strategy ( Repositioning Nu- trition as Central to Development\u2014A Large Scale Action [World Bank 2006c]) the Regional Reprioritization Fund will allocate US$4 million over fiscal years 2009-11 to strengthen Bank ca-pacity to scale up nutrition support and leverage resources from other donors. Management agrees with working on innovative approaches and helping private providers to move down-market to serve lower-income groups and markets. IFC has several initiatives alreadyunder way to build on its work to date. Some examples include: Health in Africa initiative. Working with clients to invest expertise and capital from high-income to low- and lower-middle- income countries, e.g., Saudi-German Hospitals, based in Saudi Arabia, opened hospitals inYemen, Egypt, and Ethiopia with IFC finance, creating a South-South investment. Output-based aid projects in Yemen and Nigeria, in which poor people get subsidized care in IFC-financed private facilities that otherwise would not exist. Creating finance facilities for health care small and medium-size enterprises in low-income countries by use of structured finance, combined with technical assistance, that IFC pioneeredwith banks in Africa and elsewhere to finance education facilities, and building on that knowl-edge to apply it in health. Working with clients to move down-market within their country, e.g., working with Apollo Hos- pitals in India to create hospitals in secondary cities. A number of continually changing factors are enabling greater activity in the sector. Among oth- ers, the private sector partners with whom IFC must work are continually evolving and developingmore capacity and professionalism than was the case 10 years ago, due in part to IFC's involve-ment with them. Nevertheless, there is a lot still to be done and IFC needs more and larger part-ners with whom to work and is developing long-term partners and new approaches with a viewto greater scale and impact. IFC's recent Health in Africa initiative also analyzed constraints andways to address them across multiple countries in a particularly difficult region. This is indica-tive of the organization's evolving approach as both its knowledge and resources for addressingthis recently entered sector expand. Management generally agrees with this recommendation. The efficiency argument is a key ra- tionale, in particular for working with health systems in middle-income countries. Since nationalhealth expenditures rise with national income, improving sector efficiency makes an importantcontribution to fiscal sustainability. However, in the health sector there are important efficiency-equity trade-offs. This points to the fact that efficiency gains should not be the sole objective ofBank-financed health programs. Management agrees that it is necessary to carefully assess the need for additional finance where other donors are contributing substantial amounts. While fiscal space and potentialRecommendations Management response 3.

(c) Support improved health information systems and more frequent and vigorous evaluation of specific reforms orprogram innovations to provide timely information for im-proving efficiency and efficacy. IFC (a) Support public-private partnerships through Advisory Services to government and industry and through its in-vestments, and expand investments in health insurance. (b) Improve collaboration and joint sector work with the World Bank, leveraging Bank sector dialogue on regula-tory frameworks for health to engage new private actorswith value added to the sector, and more systematicallycoordinate with the Bank's policy interventions regard-ing private sector participation in health.budget substitution by ministries of finance should be closely monitored, the empirical evi- dence of distortionary effects of large vertical disease programs is scanty. Proposals for Bank sup-port for new disease-specific programs are closely coordinated with other donors and often fundcomplementary financing and institutional needs, for which financing was unavailable fromother donors. Management agrees partially with this recommendation: Technical support and financing for man- agement information systems as well as routine surveillance and vital statistics systems shouldbe ramped up. However, the outcomes of management information system investments may behard to evaluate fully within the timeframe of a project, and multiple determinants influence healthoutcomes. Management also notes that the Paris and Accra Declarations and the new OP 13.60emphasize the use of pooled funding and country-level M&E systems instead of ring-fenced fund-ing and stand-alone M&E systems. Hence, the standard should be that sufficient evidence on out-puts, intermediate outcomes, and outcomes should be collected to establish a credible story lineto assess the link between Bank-financed investments and overall sector progress, including ef-ficiency and efficacy gains. Management action: The Human Development Network and the Regions have carried out major analytical work that will help policy makers and Bank staff to better understand challenges andtrade-offs in health financing, risk pooling and insurance, the issue of fiscal space and exter-nal assistance ( Health Financing Revisited\u2014A Practitioner's Guide [Gottret and Schieber 2006]). Furthermore, the Bank is a lead sponsor of the International Health Partnership (IHP+). This is acountry-led and country-driven partnership that calls for all signatories to accelerate action toscale up coverage and use of health services and deliver improved outcomes against the health-related MDGs, while honoring commitments to improve universal access to health. IFC has supported pioneering health public-private partnerships (PPPs) in Romania and Lesotho and continues to work in this area. While health PPPs are a relatively recent development in emerg-ing markets, there is increasing interest in health PPPs as a means to expand and improve ser-vices for the public. The work in Lesotho is at the leading edge for emerging-country health PPPsin several aspects. From the investment aspect, partners in health PPPs to date have often beenconstruction companies rather than health providers and have not required capital from IFC. Insome of the few cases where it is truly health services, rather than construction and facilitiesmanagement, that have been provided by the private sector, IFC has financed providers of renaldialysis services and diagnostic services to public health systems. Many of IFC's clients who provide health services have prepayment schemes for health care in operation and this makes the most business sense. In some instances, by creating more low-costlocal capacity, IFC health-provider clients have made it possible for health insurers to offer newproducts with lower premiums. Experience to date has shown that the business case for directinvestment in stand-alone private health insurance does not exist to the extent envisaged whenthe 2002 IFC health strategy was devised. The few health insurance operations found to date thatactually needed capital have needed only very small amounts, too small to be viable transactions.This segment of the sector is intended to be addressed by the health-sector financing facilitiesnow being developed and in early implementation. For the balance, typically the health insureris one arm of a larger insurer that is well capitalized from its other operations such as life in-surance or is a subsidiary or joint venture of a well-capitalized foreign parent company. In some situations, such as the Health in Africa initiative and the Lesotho healthcare PPP , IFC and the World Bank are collaborating very closely. In practice, there are times when this is practicaland possible and times when it is not. The imbalance in the size of human resources working onhealth in the two organizations, with the World Bank having many more people dedicated to health,requires IFC to be judicious in how it allocates its resources to work with the Bank. Recommendations Management responseMANAGEMENT RESPONSE SUMMARY xxixManagement Action Record (continued) WORLD BANK (a) When the benefits are potentially great in relation to the marginal costs, incorporate health objectives into non-health projects, for which they are accountable. (b) Improve the complementarity of investment operations in health and other sectors to achieve health, nutrition,and population outcomes, particularly between health andwater supply and sanitation. (c) Prioritize sectoral participation in multisectoral HNP proj- ects according to the comparative advantages and in-stitutional mandates, to reduce complexity. (d) Identify new incentives for Bank staff to work cross- sectorally for improving HNP outcomes. (e) Develop mechanisms to ensure that the implementation and results for small health components retrofitted intoprojects are properly documented and evaluated. IFC (a) Improve incentives and institutional mechanisms for an integrated approach to health issues across units in IFCdealing with health, including the way IFC is organized.Management agrees in principle, but implementation can be challenging. For example, health is a secondary objective for many clients in water and sanitation operations and borrowers arereluctant to add potentially costly components. In addition, the current mandate, staffing, andbudget of the water sector does not allow the sector to be \"accountable for health benefits\" asIEG suggests. Under IDA 15 guidelines, it is mandatory to track \"safe and sustainable access towater and or sanitation services\" as an outcome, with health benefits classified as impacts, ratherthan outcomes. Because it is difficult and expensive to track health impacts, the number of waterprojects with a health objective has declined, and this trend is likely to continue absent changesin policy and/or additional resources. Management generally agrees that we need to support client countries to seek improved com- plementarity of water and sanitation programs with health projects, in particular as clients arereluctant to burden all water and sanitation operations with potentially small (albeit cost effec-tive) health impact objectives, and to demonstrate and document empirically such impact and out-comes in each case. Management agrees and notes that significant additional resources have been mobilized from fis- cal year 2009 on to better respond to client and partner requests for embedding Bank support inmultisector programs, or to provide just-in-time advice to countries and partners in development.Specifically, over US$3 million additional Bank budget will be allocated per year to ramp up Banksupport for the 14 IHP+ countries, mostly in Africa, including the establishment and staffing of tworegional technical support hubs in Africa. Additional resources are being provided by other donors. Management agrees, but notes that this is a concern across the institution that needs institutional analysis and solutions, including revisiting the incentives needed for improved cross-sectoral andcross-departmental collaboration. Management agrees, subject to the limitations mentioned previously related to M&E and attribution. Management action: the HNP sector continues to expand and deepen cross-sector engagement. Recent products include work on Social Safety Nets, Ageing and Demographic Change, Early Child-hood Development and Poverty, Environment and Health. Ongoing initiatives include work withWater and Sanitation, Transport, Poverty Reduction and Economic Management, Agricultureand Rural Development, and Operations Policy and Country Services on global challenges rang-ing from global infectious threats, climate change (part of the 2010 World Development Report ), road safety, and an Advanced Market Commitment to develop a pneumococcal vaccine suitablefor use in Africa. IFC is currently going through a period of reorganization aimed at achieving a number of goals. As part of this, industry clusters have been created and Health and Education are in the samecluster with Global Manufacturing and Services, which contains IFC's pharmaceutical activities.Communication and collaboration between teams working on health care and pharmaceuticalsare frequent and ongoing. The market reality is that it is rare for one organization to invest in bothhealth care provision and pharmaceutical manufacturing. The knowledge needed to work withthese clients is also very different. Information is also exchanged between the Infrastructure Advisory group, advising on health PPPs, and the Health and Education investment department. Care has to be exercised that such infor-mation is exchanged only at appropriate points in project life cycles to avoid conflicts of inter-est that could arise in being both advisor to a bidding process and financier of a winner of a bid.Integrating these two functions too closely would create a conflict for PPP work.Recommendations Management response 4. Enhance the contribution of support from other sectors to health, nutrition, and population outcomes.xxxIMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Management Action Record (continued) WORLD BANK (a) Create new incentives for monitoring and evaluation for both the Bank and the borrower linked to the project ap-proval process and the midterm review. This would includerequirements for baseline data, explicit evaluation designsfor pilot activities in project appraisal documents, and pe-riodic evaluation of main project activities as a man-agement tool. IFC (a) Enhance its results orientation by developing clearly specified baseline indicators and an evaluation frameworkthat adequately measures IFC's health sector objectivesand results.Management agrees. We face the challenge that countries may be unwilling to borrow for M&E, particularly for expensive impact evaluations. These large-scale evaluations may require exter-nal (grant) financing in most cases, which can be particularly difficult to obtain in a middle-incomecountry context. A second challenge is to ensure that data are readily available for public use.Some countries are not ready to fully share data and may be reluctant to include data in publicdocuments, such as PADs, and the like. This can delay the establishment of appropriate base-line data and results frameworks prior to project approval. Management action: The HNP Sector Board and the Human Development Network have made important progress to address M&E in the HNP portfolio: A number of Regions have carried outa complete portfolio review, including the retrofitting of all operations to assure an up-to-dateresults framework. Moreover, over US$2.8 million of Spanish Trust Fund (SIEF) resources are cur-rently under implementation, benefiting impact evaluations of 15 HNP projects in all Regions, fo-cusing on Pay for Performance in Health (5 projects, US$1.2m), Malaria Control (5 projects,US$600,000), HIV/AIDS Prevention (3 projects, US$750,000), and Innovations and \"quick wins\"(2 projects, US$300,000). At the project level, IFC has implemented the Development Outcome Tracking System toward the end of the period under review. Over time, this is expected to improve such results orientationand specifying of baseline indicators. IFC also agrees that where there is a sufficient critical mass of projects in the health sector in a specific country, it makes sense to try to asses IFC's development impact in the sector beyondaggregating project-level results. While recognizing that attributing sector development to IFC'sintervention is an issue that needs to be carefully addressed, IFC is looking into ways of mea-suring results beyond the project level. Among others, the work IFC is undertaking with the IDA-IFC Secretariat in reviewing the CAS results matrix could lead to the establishment of acountry-level sector development results framework that could be used in countries where IFChas a critical mass of projects in health. IFC is also exploring setting development impact andreach targets for investment departments, including health and education.Recommendations Management response 5. Implement the results agenda and improve governance by boosting investment in and incentives for evaluation.xxxiChairperson's Summary: Committee on Development Effectiveness (CODE) Background Following a self-assessment of its support in the health sector, the World Bank (the Bank) renewedits focus on the health sector in 2007 with an up-dated strategy, Healthy Development: The World Bank Strategy for Health, Nutrition, and Popu-lation Results. IFC outlined its health sector strat- egy in 2002. IEG Evaluation The report evaluated the efficacy, specifically thehealth, nutrition, and population (HNP) out-comes, of the World Bank Group (namely IBRD/IDA and IFC) country-level support since 1997 anddrew lessons from that experience. It includes, forthe first time, an evaluation of IFC's cumulativesupport for health. Based on the findings, theIEG made recommendations for the Bank and IFCgrouped under five broad areas, which include:intensify efforts to improve the performance of the Bank's support for HNP; renew the com-mitment to HNP outcomes among the poor;strengthen the World Bank Group's ability to help countries to improve the efficiency of healthsystems; enhance the contribution of supportfrom other sectors to HNP outcomes; and im-plement the results agenda and improve gover-nance by boosting investment in and incentives for evaluation. The Draft Management Response Management noted its agreement with many of thefindings and recommendations that confirmedthe Bank's own self-assessment, undertaken be-fore its health sector strategy was updated. At thesame time, it offered its views on several aspectsof the evaluation, including coverage of the eval-uation, targeting issues, the importance of notonly focusing on health outcomes for the poor butalso on preventing poverty due to financial costsfrom poor health, emerging issues such as theaging population in developing countries, chal-lenges with respect to monitoring and evaluation,and actions being taken to address some of the is-sues identified by IEG. Overall Conclusions The Committee welcomed the discussion, notingthe importance of the IEG evaluation findings. Italso remarked on the centrality of the health sec-tor to the Bank's mandate for poverty reductionand contribution to the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs), although the Bank's role has shiftedto become a smaller financier in the sector. Con-On January 28, 2009, the Committee considered the document Im- proving Effectiveness and Outcomes for the Poor in Health, Nutri-tion, and Population: An Evaluation of World Bank Group Support since 1997 prepared by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) and the Draft Management Response.cerns were expressed about the main IEG findings, including the under-performance of the HNP port-folio, particularly in the Africa Region; the weak ac-countability for ensuring that the results havereached the poor; and the continued weaknessesin monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Manage-ment was also asked to address the issue of ex-cessive complexity of health programs whilerecognizing its multisectoral dimension. Speakers raised questions and comments on a range of issues, including the need for more Banksupport for nutrition and population, the im-portance of addressing maternal health, HIV/AIDSmeasures in health system strengthening, andthe effectiveness of the sectorwide approaches(SWAps). They also remarked on the importanceof establishing realistic targets, project supervision,local capacity building, reliable data, and appro-priate staff skill mix and incentives to supportthe HNP strategy. Some speakers expressed in-terest in the development impact of IFC's healthsector projects, particularly the inclusion of thepoor. The Committee asked management to re-vise its response to address the various com-ments made at the meeting, including the requestfor an action plan to address the IEG recom-mendations. Several speakers also noted the needfor a sound communication strategy before thedisclosure of the IEG report. Next Steps The revised Management Response will be circu-lated for information to the Committee in ad-vance of the Board's informal meeting to considermanagement's first report on the implementationof the new health sector strategy\u2014 Health, Nu- trition, and Population Strategy Implementa-tion\u2014An Interim Report. The Committee will recommend to the Board that it consider the IEGevaluation report and the revised Management Re-sponse along with management's interim report,which is scheduled for an informal Board discus-sion on April 9, 2009. Management proposed toprovide informal updates in response to speak-ers' interest in regular reports on the World BankGroup support for the health sector.Main issues raised at the meeting were the following: World Bank Group's Role. Members remarked on the changing environment of the health sec-tor with an increase in institutions providing HNPsupport. In this regard, they emphasized qualityover quantity of World Bank Group support. Theyalso noted that the World Bank Group has an im-portant role in donor coordination, ensuring ef-ficient allocation and effective use of resources inthe sector, and introducing innovations and gen-erating knowledge to strengthen health systemsand service delivery. Remarking on the inherentcomplexity and high risk of health sector support,a member emphasized the World Bank Group'scontinued role in this sector and also noted thatthe risks should be taken into account in assess-ing performance, to avoid providing staff with dis-incentives to invest in valuable but risky projects. Bank's Portfolio Performance. The impor- tance of addressing the Bank's comparativelylower portfolio performance in the health sector,including the poor results in Africa Region, washighlighted. Considering the Bank's comparativeadvantage as providing policy advice, strength-ening health systems, and supporting institu-tional and human capacity building, severalnon-members queried about the growing shareof programs addressing communicable diseases.A few members emphasized the importance of po-litical analysis, which could be done during thepreparation of country assistance strategies orthrough policy notes; project supervision; andlearning, including for local implementation ca-pacity building. Questions were raised about en-suring an appropriate staff skills mix to deliver HNPprograms, especially in the Africa Region, takinginto consideration the global competition forsuch skills. Bank management elaborated on its review of all at-risk HNP projects, and workwith the Quality Assurance Group to determinewhat actions are needed. It described the chal-lenges and risks faced in the Africa Region andin the fragile states, and its efforts to improve per-formance in the Africa Region, including estab- xxxiiIMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATIONlishing two technical hubs and staffing them with additional experts in epidemiology, healtheconomics, and health management to supportanalytical work and project implementation.It said that it is scaling up technical assistanceand capacity building at the country level. A few speakers expressed interest in under- standing the Bank's HNP portfolio performanceacross time, as compared to other sectors, and inthe context of performance of other donor sup-port to HNP . One of them also sought informationon the Bank's HNP support against the principlesof the 2005 Paris Declaration. IEG responded that between fiscal years 1992 and 2001, the per-formance of both the HNP portfolio and other sec-tors had improved, but since fiscal 2002, theHNP portfolio performance has been flat, whilethat of other sectors has continued to improve.It referred to its evaluations of global programreviews in HNP , but noted that it did not have thesame level of data on the effectiveness of HNP sup-port by other donors. Reaching the Poor. Several speakers asked about the Bank's measures to strengthen thepoverty focus of HNP sector support. While agree-ing on the importance of reaching the poor, amember observed the greater challenges of as-sessing outcomes for the poor in the case of cer-tain initiatives such as for communicable diseases,where focus is on groups at the highest risk or in-vestment in vaccines. A few members expressedinterest in IFC's efforts to improve the inclusionof the poor in its health projects, and in this re-gard also requested IEG to elaborate on its rec-ommendation. Bank management commented on its renewed focus on results, including for thepoor, such as through the results-based financ-ing mechanism. It also explained that invest-ments in diseases of the poor, such as malaria,have a fully pro-poor targeted approach. IFC re-sponded that it is supporting smaller health careinstitutions providing services to the poor throughwholesaling or other arrangements with finan-cial partners. It is also providing Advisory Ser-vices to promote public-private partnerships toprovide services to the poor, as well as working with large-scale service providers to achieve costefficiencies and to make services more affordablefor the poor. IEG clarified that the impact ofWorld Bank Group support on the poor is largelyunknown, because outcomes among the poorhave not been monitored. It suggested that IFCcould improve the social impact of health ini-tiatives by supporting investments that havegreater benefits for the poor, such as supportingmanufacturing and distribution of lower-cost,higher-quality generic drugs and research anddevelopment to treat diseases that dispropor-tionately affect the poor. Project Design and Approach. A few members noted that the design of HNP projects could besimpler or phased, particularly in countries facinginstitutional and implementation capacity issues.At the same time, they also said the design shouldbe based on country context and achievableobjectives. Likewise, a member remarked that thelevel of multisectoral cooperation should besituation-specific, depending on capacity andavailability of resources. Bank management elaborated on how a health project with a seem-ingly simple objective and apparently easilymeasurable results (for example, providing mos-quito nets to counter malaria) can require acomplex solution, particularly in countries withlimited infrastructure and capacity, and offerchallenges in monitoring results. IEG empha-sized the importance of setting achievable ob-jectives and a clear results framework. It clarifiedthat there was no evidence in the evaluationthat simple health projects are less sustainable orthose with more complex designs are more sus-tainable. It also said that the World Bank Groupshould not avoid investing in worthwhile butrisky projects, but there is a substantial scopefor minimizing risks through better ex ante riskanalysis and mitigation measures. A few speak- ers expressed interest in more analysis of themixed results of the SWAps and IEG's recom-mendations for future use of this approach. IEG responded that the context is important; SWApswork better in some contexts than in others. It also CHAIRPERSON'S SUMMARY: COMMITTEE ON DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS (CODE) xxxiiisaid that while SWAps have given much attention to the process, there could be more focus on HNPoutcomes. Nutrition. A member welcomed the role of the Bank in emphasizing the importance of nutri-tion. Another member noted the importance ofincorporating food security concerns in health sec-tor projects. Population and Reproductive Health. Sev- eral speakers encouraged the Bank to strengthenits focus on population and reproductive health.A few members remarked on the developmentchallenge of high population growth from a globalperspective and in Sub-Saharan Africa. Othersurged the Bank to prioritize reproductive healthand identify maternal health as a key target in itshealth programs. In addition, some speakers notedthe importance of a gender-based approach to, andintegrating HIV/AIDS measures in, health systemsupport, particularly in the area of reproductivehealth. The need for adequate staffing and ana-lytical work to support initiatives addressing pop-ulation and reproductive health was emphasized.Bank management said that it is currently con-sidering how to strengthen the focus on popula-tion issues in its health system support and itintended to elaborate on this in the forthcomingHNP interim report to the Board in April. Monitoring and Evaluation. Members and non- members underlined the importance of improv-ing M&E to enable a better understanding of theBank's performance in the sector. They com-mented on the need for a clear results frameworkand M&E plan in all initiatives, for establishing andstrengthening country-based M&E systems, and forappropriate incentives within the World BankGroup as well as for promoting country ownership.The lack of reliable health data, challenges of datacollection, and reluctance of countries to sharedata were discussed. A member supported a prag-matic and realistic approach to M&E, taking into consideration the local capacity and financial re-source constraints. Bank management elabo- rated on the serious attention it is giving to M&E,noting that the Human Development Network hasthe biggest impact evaluation program in theBank. It described its work with other partnersto jointly strengthen data at the country leveland to strengthen the country's M&E systems.IFC said it is setting project-level baselines andmonitoring relevant development impact indi-cators through the Development Outcome Track-ing System. Response to the IEG Evaluation Report Members and non-members requested that man-agement revise its response to the IEG evaluationreport to address members' comments, includingthe requests for an action plan addressing IEG'srecommendations that may be monitored. IEG noted that the evaluation report would be dis-closed with the revised Management Response.Several speakers stressed the importance of com-municating, particularly to IDA donors, that man-agement's response will urgently and effectivelyaddress the evaluation findings and recommen-dations. In this context, the chairperson referredto another speaker's observation about the issueof timing of the IEG evaluation with respect to theBank's 2007 HNP strategy. It was widely felt thatthe IEG recommendations may be incorporatedin the interim report on health, nutrition, andpopulation strategy implementation, scheduled tobe discussed at the Board on April 9, 2009. In thisrespect, members and non-members requestedthat the Board consider the IEG evaluation reporttogether with the revised Management Response,alongside the management's paper on Health, Nutrition, and Population Strategy Implemen-tation\u2014An Interim Report. The general prefer- ence was to discuss the reports in one meeting. Giovanni Majnoni, Chairman xxxivIMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATIONxxxvAdvisory Panel Statement The external advisory group welcomes this re- port on World Bank Group support for health, nu-trition, and population outcomes since 1997. In anera when health has been very high on the inter-national agenda, it is vital that development agen-cies such as the World Bank Group rigorouslyscrutinize the effectiveness of what they do andlearn from such scrutiny to improve practices. From its involvement during the process of the eval- uation, the advisory group was satisfied that theprocesses were transparent, independent, con-structive, and evidence-based. The evaluation'sapproach and methods made the most of what ev-idence was available, and the overall analyses, con-clusions, and recommendations are sound. Belowwe highlight and comment on key findings. The decade has seen a remarkable increase in international assistance for health, and a markeddecline in the Bank's share of total assistance,from 18 percent in the 1990s to 6 percent. Whilewe echo the view of the evaluation that the Bankstill has a very important role to play, we weretaken aback by the extent to which the Bank fol-lowed the trend of increased support to commu-nicable disease control. At a time when disease-specific programs were getting greatly increasedsupport from elsewhere, we were surprised thatthe Bank did not provide a countervailing trend.Indeed, there was a fall of nearly half in the shareof projects with objectives to reform the healthsystem. We endorse the view in the report of theBank's comparative advantage\u2014that it can providelong-term, sustained engagement, a focus onbuilding country capacity in the sector, stronglinks to Ministries of Finance, and engagementacross many sectors\u2014and fully agree that its focusshould be on making health systems work betterand ensuring that benefits reach the poor.In this context, it is a source of considerable con- cern that the performance of the HNP portfoliooverall has been below average, and that withinthis the health sector reform type of projectshave tended to perform less well. The report pro-vides much food for thought in exploring why thismight have been the case. We strongly endorsethe recommendations that project design shouldbe matched to country context and capacity, thatcomplex projects should be avoided in low ca-pacity settings, and that thorough institutionalanalysis and exploration of political economy is-sues should be part of project design and imple-mentation. The strong preparatory analytical workthat the report calls for should help ensure thatprojects are relevant to country needs. Althoughthe advisory group agrees that it is important toseek to explore the determinants of project out-come ratings, the regression results summarizedin the text and presented in an appendix tableshould be interpreted with care. The evaluation did not undertake any extensive analysis of the past analytical work done in HNP .However, it is notable that 41 percent of the an-alytical work was on health system performance,and yet many projects in this area encountered dif-ficulties. Further exploration of the analyticalwork would be valuable, to assess the extent towhich it was relevant to country programs and tosee whether lessons can be learned in terms of en-suring that analytical work supports high-qualityproject design and implementation. Another area that would have benefited from greater attention is that of sustainability and build-ing country capacity. Although sustainability wasan objective in both the 1997 and 2007 HNP strate-gies, this aspect has not been sufficiently exploredin the report.

There are similarconsiderations with respect to health informationsystems and national monitoring and evaluationcapacity. No evidence is presented on the extentto which local capacity was used or built to ensure projects are sustained into the future, or on whether projects were managed in themost efficient way. If there are inadequate at-tempts to use or build internal capacity, it ishighly likely that the projects will not be effectivelysustained. The report comments that while half of all Water Supply and Sanitation projects cited potential forhealth benefits, only 10 percent had an objectiveto improve health. This is presented as a weakness,but it need not be: the projects can improve otherthings that have large effects on health, so failureof a project to state that it is improving health orits failure to do things that directly improve healthmay not be bad for health. For example, SWAPsencourage projects to do things that indirectly im-prove health. The report highlights a clear problem of ac- countability for results. Despite the Bank's man-date for poverty reduction, a very small share ofprojects had explicit objectives relating to im-proving HNP outcomes among the poor, and ofclosed projects with these objectives, very fewwere able to demonstrate improvements. Similarly,many projects were termed pilots , implying they were intended at least in part for learning, but fewprojects actually evaluated results. A widespreadweakness in monitoring and evaluation and inevaluation was identified. It is notable that these weaknesses have been identified in previous evaluations, and recom-mendations made to improve monitoring andevaluation. Improvements are noted\u2014for exam- ple, in terms of availability of baseline data\u2014butweaknesses remain. Failure to respond sufficientlyto previous recommendations suggests that thereare pervasive incentives in the Bank that workagainst investing sufficiently in monitoring andevaluation and evaluation. This is a vital area formanagement action to consider how to createstronger incentives. The issue of whether staffare drawing in the necessary expertise in evalua-tion research methods also needs consideration\u2014issues of appropriate research design and dataanalysis methods are complex. The World Bank Group has many strong assets, including its analytical and synthesis capacity, itsstrong relationship to country financial policymakers, its extensive networks at the countrylevel in all regions, its massive financial and socialcapital, and its skill in managing developmentfunds. These assets are extremely important inhelping the group successfully formulate, imple-ment, evaluate, and reformulate its HNP proj-ects. If applied properly and efficiently, theseassets will allow the World Bank Group to buildup sustainable capacity within developing coun-tries and support health systems developmentthat is more pro-poor, more efficient, and moresustainable. However, given the now highly com-plex aid environment in health, it is vital that theWorld Bank position itself clearly with respect towhat others are doing. T o address the problem of fragmentation within countries, it should alsoseek to support interagency coordination. Finally, there is a need to strengthen the IEG eval- uation team and resources. Insufficient human re-sources, financial support, and time inevitablylimited the work that could be done for the eval-uation report. The IEG staff have done their best,given limited resources, to come up with an ex-cellent assessment with much rich detail. Butmore could be done with better support.Chapter 1 Evaluation Highlights Because of fundamental changes in the global aid architecture, the WorldBank is no longer the largest exter-nal source of health finance. Health outcomes have improved in every region, but averages conceal dif-ferences across and within countries. The Bank has committed about $28.7 billion and IFC about $951 million toHNP since 1970. The 2007 HNP strategy, Healthy De- velopment, aims to strengthen health systems, prevent impoverishment dueto poor health, and improve the healthof the poor. This evaluation considers the effec- tiveness of both World Bank and IFCactivities in HNP over the past de-cade and points to lessons of thatexperience.Child being immunized in Liberia.

De-velopment assistance for HNP has risen from anannual average of $6.7 billion in 1997-99 to about$16 billion in 2006, most of it for low-incomecountries (Michaud 2003; World Bank 2008a).The international community has adopted globaldevelopment targets; the most prominent arethe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), setfor 2015. There is also a new international emphasis on aid effectiveness, results orientation, donor har-monization, alignment, and country leadership,reflected in the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Ef- fectiveness . Hence, the World Bank is now one of many large players in international HNP support,accounting for about 6 percent of the total in2006. 2The Bank is in the process of reassessing its comparative advantage in the context of thenew aid architecture, while a call for greaterengagement with the private health sector in de-veloping countries presents new opportunities forthe International Finance Corporation (IFC) to ex-tend its support. There have been improvements in some health outcomes over the past decade, butprogress is uneven and in many cases tooslow to meet the MDGs by the target dateof 2015. Key health outcomes, such as the infant mortality rate, have improved in every develop-ing region since 1990 (figure 1.1). The prevalenceof stunting among children under five has de-clined dramatically in Asia and Latin America since1980, though only modestly in Africa (Shekar,Heaver, and Lee 2006, p. 5). These improvementshave been attributed to rising average levels of in-come and education, coupled with improvementsin health technology and expanded public healthinterventions (see, for example, Jamison 2006; The past decade has seen fundamental changes in the global aid ar- chitecture in health, with potential implications for the World BankGroup's work and its comparative advantages relative to other sources of health, nutrition, and population (HNP) support. Figure 1.1: Infant Mortality Rates Have Declined in Every Region, but Disparities across Regions are Large 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 1990 1995 Sub-Saharan Africa South AsiaMiddle East and North Africa2000 2004Deaths per 1,000 live births 102 59 55 49 44 4442 37 32 2943 35 30 26111 111 105 67737989 343943 Europe and Central Asia East Asia and Pacific Latin America and the Caribbean Source: UNICEF 2006.Levine and others 2004). Despite this progress, nearly three-quarters of developing countries areeither off track or seriously off track for achievingthe MDG of reducing under-five mortality by two-thirds. Maternal mortality is declining by onlyabout 1 percent annually, a fifth of the rate neededto achieve the goal of reducing it by three-quarters by 2015 (World Bank 2008a). Further, average outcomes conceal impor- tant differences in progress across coun-tries, within regions, and within countries.Under-five mortality rates in 30 countries have stag-nated or increased since 1990; 3in some countries, high fertility rates have remained un-changed or even increased slightlysince the 1990s (Wagstaff and Claeson2004, p. 36). Despite some progressin Bangladesh and India, undernutri-tion remains very high in South Asia,while in 26 countries, primarily in Africa, malnutrition is increasing (Shekar, Heaver, and Lee2006, p. 3). Maternal mortality remains extremelyhigh in Africa, where the average woman faces anearly 1 percent risk of dying from pregnancyand childbirth, and very high fertility repeatedlyexposes women to these high risks. 4 Communicable diseases account for about a third(36 percent) of the disease burden in develop-ing countries (Jamison and others 2006b); withincountries, the burden of morbidity and mortal-ity is greatest among the poor (Gwatkin and Guil-lot 2000). In some countries, HNP outcomeshave improved disproportionately among thepoor, while in others they have improved pri-marily among the non-poor. The gaps betweenthe poor and non-poor, even when closing, oftenremain substantial, in part reflecting lower ac-cess of the poor to public services (Gwatkin,Wagstaff, and Yazbeck 2005; Filmer 2003). Theburden of disease is distributed differently withindeveloping Regions, with communicable disease and maternal, perinatal, and nutritionalconditions as a group predominatingin Africa, while in the remaining fivedeveloping Regions, the burden ofnon-communicable disease is equal orgreater (figure 1.2).Rationale for World Bank Group Investments in Health, Nutrition, and Population The mandate of the World Bank Group is to reduce poverty and promote economicgrowth. Poor health and malnutrition contribute to low productivity of the poor, so improvingHNP outcomes is seen as a major way of reduc-ing poverty. But poverty is also a prime cause ofpoor health, malnutrition, and high fertility. Thepoor have low access to preventive and curativecare (both physically and financially) and are morelikely to be malnourished, have unsafe water andsanitation, lack education, have large families andclosely spaced births, and engage in activities thatmay put them at heightened health risk. Within the World Bank Group, the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstructionand Development [IBRD] and the Interna-tional Development Association [IDA]) havecommitted about $28.7 billion to help gov-ernments improve HNP outcomes in 132countries since 1970 (figure 1.3). 5In addition, IFC has invested $951 million in the privatehealth and pharmaceutical sectors of de-veloping countries. 6The World Bank supports government HNP policies and programs. The World Development Report 1993: Investing inHealth (World Bank 1993c) highlighted the major rationales for a government role in the healthsector; many of these also apply to nutrition andpopulation: T o provide public goods and invest in HNP services with large positive externalities, whichthe private sector would have no incentive toprovide in adequate quantity T o enhance equity by ensuring provision of cost-effective HNP services to the poor, who areotherwise unlikely to gain adequate access toessential clinical services or insurance 7 T o address uncertainty and multiple market failures in health, including problems of ad-verse selection, moral hazard, and asymmetryin information between providers and patients. 8 IFC supports investments and Advisory Servicesto the private sector in health and pharmaceuti- 4IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Despite improvement in some key health outcomes since 1990, there are important differences across and within countries.

World Bank Group Strategies in Health, Nutrition, and Population This evaluation aims to inform the imple- mentation of the most recent HNP strategiesof the World Bank and IFC and to help en-hance the impact of future support. The World Bank's policies, strategies, and lending for HNP have evolved in phases (box 1.1). Its cur-rent strategy, Healthy Development: The World Bank Strategy for Health, Nutrition, and Popu-lation Results , was launched in 2007, with objec- tives to improve HNP outcomes on average andamong the poor and prevent the impoverishingimpact of illness by improving health system per-formance, including governance, and intersec-toral approaches (table 1.1). The strategy includesan increased emphasis on demonstrating out-comes by incorporating a detailed results frame-work for the entire sector. The goals of IFC'scurrent health strategy, Investing in Private HealthCare: Strategic Directions for IFC, adopted in 2002, are: improve health outcomes, protect thepopulation from the impoverishing effects of illhealth, and enhance the performance of health ser-vices (table 1.2) (IFC 2002, p. 3). These strategiesprovide a vision of the sector as a whole. Theextent to which their objectives are specificallyaddressed in a given country depends on theborrower's interest and the country context. Since 1997, IEG has issued three evalua- tions of the development effectiveness of theBank's support for HNP; it has never eval-uated IFC's cumulative support for thehealth sector. 9Investing in Health: Develop- ment Effectiveness in the Health, Nutrition, andPopulation Sector (IEG 1999) found that the Bank had been more success-ful in expanding health service deliverysystems (physical objectives) than inimproving service quality and efficiencyor achieving policy and institutionalchange. The lending portfolio hadgrown rapidly, and the most complexINTRODUCTION 5Figure 1.2: Communicable Diseases Remain a Significant Share of the Disease Burden in Most Developing Regions 100 80 60 40 20 0 High-income countriesEurope and Central AsiaLatin America and the CaribbeanEast Asia and Pacific RegionMiddle East and North AfricaSouth Asia Africa Percent Communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions Noncommunicable diseases Injuries Source: Jamison and others 2006b, table 4.1.

IEG's 2004 evaluation of the Bank's approach to global programs (IEG 2004a; Lele and others2004), including health programs, recommendedthat the Bank engage more selectively in globalprograms, favoring those that exploit the Bank'scomparative advantages and provide global publicgoods, and that the links between global pro- grams and the Bank's Regional and country op-erations be strengthened. IEG's 2005 evaluation of the Bank's support for the fight against HIV/AIDS (IEG 2005a) foundthat the Bank had contributed to raising politicalcommitment and improving access to services.However, evidence of results for health behaviorsand outcomes is thin because of a failure to mon-itor and evaluate. IEG recommended that theBank be more strategic and selective, focusing onINTRODUCTION 7Population lending, 1970-79 The Bank focused on improving access to family planning ser- vices because of concern about the adverse effects of rapidpopulation growth on economic growth and poverty reduction.A handful of nutrition projects was also approved following a 1973nutrition policy paper, and throughout the decade health com-ponents were included in agriculture, population, and educa-tion projects as important links between health, poverty, andeconomic progress were established. Primary health care, 1980-86 The 1980 Health Sector Policy Paper (World Bank 1980a) formally committed the Bank to direct lending in the health sector with theobjective of improving the health of the poor by improving accessto low-cost primary health care. The rationale for this policychange was contained in the World Development Report 1980: Poverty and Human Development (World Bank 1980b), which em- phasized that investment in human development complementsother poverty reduction programs and is economically justifiable.However, over this period systemic constraints were encoun-tered in providing access to efficient and equitable health services. Health reform, 1987-96 Following the release of Financing Health Services in Develop- ing Countries: An Agenda for Reform in 1987 (Akin, Birdsall, and De Ferranti 1987) , the Bank addressed two new objectives: to make health finance more equitable and efficient and to reformhealth systems to overcome systemic constraints. The messagewas further refined by the World Development Report 1993: In- vesting in Health (World Bank 1993c) , which highlighted the im-portance of household decisions in improving health, advocated directing government health spending to a cost-effective pack-age of preventive and basic curative services, and encouragedgreater diversity in health finance and service delivery. Health outcomes and health systems, 1997-2000 The 1997 Health, Nutrition, and Population Sector Strategy Paper (World Bank 1997b) focused on health outcomes of the poor andon protecting people from the impoverishing effects of illness, mal-nutrition, and high fertility. However, it continued to emphasizesupport for improved health system performance (in terms ofequity, affordability, efficiency, quality, and responsiveness toclients) and securing sustainable health financing. Global targets and partnerships, 2001-06 The Bank's objectives, rationale, and strategy remained un- changed, but major external events, the surging AIDS epidemic,and the Bank's commitments to specific targets and to workingin partnerships led to an increase in finance for single-diseaseor single-intervention programs, often within weak health systems. System strengthening for results, 2007-present In the context of changes in the global health architecture, Healthy Development: The World Bank Strategy for Health, Nu- trition, and Population Results (World Bank 2007a) emphasizes the need for the Bank to reposition itself, with a greater focus on itscomparative advantages, to more effectively support countriesto improve health outcomes. It adheres closely to the 1997 strat-egy's objectives and means for achieving them, with increasedemphasis on governance and demonstrating results.Box 1.1: Six Phases of World Bank Engagement in HNP Source: Fair 2008.efforts likely to have the largest impact for their cost; strengthen locally adapted institutions tomanage the long-term response; and invest heav-ily in M&E capacity and incentives as the basis forevidence-based decision making. Objectives and Scope of this Evaluation This report evaluates the efficacy, specifically the HNP outcomes, of World Bank Groupcountry-level support for HNP over the pastdecade and draws lessons from that expe-rience. The objectives of the evaluation of the World Bank are to assess the effectiveness of the Bank's support in improving HNP outcomesat the country level since 1997, particularly amongthe poor, and to identify lessons from that expe-rience that can be employed to improve the effi-cacy of the Bank's support in the next decade.Support to countries includes policy dialogue,analytic work, and lending. The evaluation fo-cuses on assessing the effectiveness of supportunder the supervision of the HNP sector, as wellas support with likely health benefits supervisedby the water supply and sanitation and the trans-port sectors. 10 The evaluation of the Bank addresses fourmain questions: What have been the objectives, effective- ness, and main outcomes of the WorldBank's country-level HNP support overthe past decade and what accounts for this performance? How effective has the Bank's support been in helping countries im-prove HNP outcomes, on average and amongthe poor? T o what extent has the Bank im-proved its M&E performance and used evalu-ation to improve the evidence base for decisionmaking in HNP? These findings are intended tocontribute to more effective implementation ofthe 2007 HNP strategy's objective of improvingHNP outcomes among the poor and of its re-sults focus. What lessons have been learned about the efficacy, advantages, and disadvantages ofthree approaches to improving HNP out-comes in different settings: control of com- municable diseases that disproportionatelyaffect the poor; programs to \"strengthen\" or \"re-form\" the health system; and sectorwide ap-proaches designed to improve ownership,reduce transaction costs, and improve the al-location of resources? These three approaches,which are not mutually exclusive, are closely re-lated to the HNP strategy's objectives of healthsystem strengthening and are relevant to the bal-ance between investments in communicablediseases and health systems. What has been the contribution of activ- ities in other, complementary sectors toimproving HNP outcomes? In particular, to what extent have Country Assistance Strate-gies been used as a vehicle to coordinate the 8IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Table 1.1: Objectives and Strategic Directions of Healthy Development, the 2007 World Bank HNP Strategy Objectives Strategic directions Source: World Bank 2007a, p. 7.

Have projects in non-HNP sectors with plausible health benefitsdelivered on them? How effective has multi-sectoral lending managed by the HNP sectorbeen at capitalizing on synergies between sec-tors in producing health outcomes? This ques-tion is intended to inform efforts of the recentstrategy to implement an effective multisectoralapproach and will also provide evidence on theextent to which the Bank has a comparative ad-vantage in multisectoral action. What have been the observed value added, comparative advantages, or contributionsof World Bank support for HNP in devel-oping countries over the past decade, andhow is that changing? Over the past decade, the World Bank increasingly has become involved in global partnerships. An ap-pendix to the 2007 HNP strategy lists 19 globalhealth initiatives and partnerships to which theBank contributes financially and another 15 inwhich the Bank participates with no financial con-tribution. 11While it is beyond the scope of this evaluation to assess the Bank's participation andcontribution to these activities in the aggregate,IEG has recently reviewed 2 of the 19 partnerships financed by the Bank\u2014theMedicines for Malaria Venture and thePopulation and Reproductive HealthCapacity Building Program, summa-rized in appendix I. The evaluation of IFC's health activities has three objectives : assess the relevance, effec- tiveness, and efficiency of IFC's health operationssince 1997; assess the design and implementationof IFC's 2002 health sector strategy; and identifylessons from that experience to improve the ef-ficacy of future IFC support to the health sector.Health operations in IFC include both lending and Advisory Services for health and investments,both in health services, managed by the Health andEducation Department, and pharmaceuticals, man-aged by the Global Manufacturing Department.

Thesamples of projects reviewed are described in ap-pendix B, and the World Bank HNP sector proj-ects and IFC health projects included in theportfolio review are listed in appendixes C and D. The evaluation also draws on findings and lessons from other IEG evaluations that are relevant to theWorld Bank Group's HNP support, in particular, eval-uations of (IEG 2002b), middle-incomecountries (IEG 2007b), public-sector reform (IEG2008f), economic and sector work (IEG 2008h), andan impact evaluation of maternal and child healthand nutrition in Bangladesh (IEG 2005b). Organization of the Report The evaluation results are presented in six chap-ters. Chapters 2-4 evaluate the World Bank's sup-port since 1997 with respect to the key evaluationthemes. Chapter 2 examines the evolution and out- comes of the portfolio of HNP lending and an-alytic work. Key issues include: trends in theobjectives, composition, and performance ofthe HNP portfolio; the poverty focus and out-comes for the poor of the Bank's investments;and whether M&E of HNP activities have im-proved the evidence base for decision making. Chapter 3 distills the performance and lessons from a decade of experience supporting threeapproaches that are closely related to the strate-gic actions to be taken in the 2007 HNP strategy:communicable disease control, health system re-form, and sectorwide approaches (SWAps) inhealth, which aim to improve the efficiency andeffectiveness of donor assistance in support ofdeveloping country health objectives. The 2007 HNP strategy maintains that multi- sectoral action to improve HNP outcomes is acomparative advantage of the World Bank. 12 Chapter 4 highlights the contribution of othersectors to HNP results: the extent to which 10IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION World Bank Review of strategy documents and construction of a timeline of World Bank HNP support and policies and internationalevents.

Development effectiveness is the extent to which a program has attained its major relevant objectives efficiently.Country Assistance Strategies (CASs) have been used as a vehicle for generating synergies acrosssectors to improve health outcomes; the re-sults from HNP lending operations that tried tocoordinate and bring to bear the actions of mul-tiple sectors on improving outcomes; and thehealth impact of investments in the water sup-ply and sanitation and transport sectors. Chapter 5 assesses IFC's health investments and Advisory Services since 1997, the implementa-tion of the 2002 health strategy, and the lessonslearned from IFC's health investments and Advi- sory Services. Health is a relatively new area of in-vestment for IFC, so the portfolio is small andrelatively young. Chapter 6 reflects on the value added of World Bank and IFC support for HNP outcomes, as re-vealed by the experience of the past decade, andoffers recommendations for improving the ef-fectiveness of both agencies of the World BankGroup.INTRODUCTION 11Chapter 2 Evaluation Highlights The Bank has committed nearly $17 billion to HNP since 1997; $11.5 billionwas managed by the HNP sector. Lending has shifted in favor of HIV/ AIDS, multisectoral, and Africa Re-gion projects. Support and staffing for population and nutrition have eroded. About two-thirds of HNP projects overall\u2014but only a quarter of HNPprojects in Africa\u2014have had satis-factory outcomes. Performance of HNP projects has stalled, while it has improved in othersectors; complexity and low qualityat entry have contributed. M&E remain weak, despite an in- crease in monitoring indicators andbaseline data. The portfolio has a generally pro- poor focus, but few projects couldshow improved outcomes for thepoor.Family health clinics such as these in the Kyrgyz Republic, which cater to men, women, and children, increasingly replaced inef ficient specialized care as part of the Manas health reform program supported by the World Bank and other donors.

T wo-thirds of HNP projects have had satisfactory outcomes, but the findings in this chapter pointto several challenges for the implementation of the2007 HNP strategy: the low performance of HNPsupport overall and in Sub-Saharan Africa, in partdue to the complexity of multisectoral operationsand sectorwide andcommitment to improve governance; and a lackof evidence that the Bank's HNP support is reallydelivering results to the poor. The Health, Nutrition, and Population Portfolio and Its Performance From 1997 through 2008, the portion of World Bank HNP commitments managedby the HNP sector has amounted to about $11.5 billion in 255 projects. The number of HNP projects approved annually has risen slowly,while new annual commitments have declined(figure 2.1). The projects managed by the HNP sec-tor are almost exclusively investment projects. 2 IEG conducted an in-depth review of the lendingportfolio managed by the HNP sector and ap-proved during the 10-year period from fiscal 1997through 2006, based on review of project ap-praisal documents (PADs), implementation com-pletion reports (ICRs) for those that had closed,and tabulation of key characteristics. During thatperiod, 220 HNP-managed projects were ap-proved, of which 110 had closed as of June 30,2008 (appendix C). This portfolio review formsmuch of the evidence base for the discussionhere, as well as in chapters 3 and 4. Improving health status was the most fre- quently cited objective of HNP projects, fol-lowed by improving the access, quality,efficiency, or equity of the health care sys-tem, collectively cited by more than half ofthe projects approved from fiscal 1997through 2006 (table 2.1). A third of projectsSince 1997, the World Bank has committed nearly $17 billion for HNP in 605 projects, about 6.5 percent of all Bank commitments over that pe-riod. This includes projects managed by the HNP sector\u2014about three- quarters of all HNP commitments\u2014and HNP components embedded inprojects managed by other sectors.16IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Figure 2.1: The Number of HNP-Managed Projects Has Risen Slowly, While Commitments Have Declined Commitments Projects1997 HNP sector strategy Board approves health lending 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 0US$ million50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 Number of projects 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Fiscal year Source: World Bank data. Note: The peaks in commitments in fiscal years 1996 and 1998 are due to a few projects in large countries\u2014in 1996, one project each i n Argentina, Brazil, India, Mexico, and Russia, and in 1998, five projects in Bangladesh, Egypt, India, and Mexico. In both years the projects in these large countries accounted for 70 percent of commitments.

Trends in the Level and Composition of Health, Nutrition, and Population Support, Fiscal 1997-2006 Although IDA and IBRD commitments fell, the number of IDA projects rose, resulting ina larger number of small projects in the port-folio by the end of the decade. IDA 's share of commitments remained about the same, ac-counting for 55 percent of total commitments inthe second period (figure 2.2A). The total numberof HNP projects approved increased from 99 to 121between fiscal 1997-2001 and 2002-06. All of thisincrease was created by IDA project approvals; thenumber of IBRD projects declined (figure 2.2B). 3 There were other major developments inthe composition of the HNP portfolio overthe decade. Africa's share of HNP project ap- provals increased from more than a quarter in fis-cal years 1997-2001 to more than a third in fiscal2002-06. The number of new HNP proj- ects in Africa rose by more than 60percent (from 28 to 45), and in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean by 30 per-cent (from 20 to 26). The share of com-municable disease and multisectoralHNP projects also increased dramatically. The increase in Africa Region, communicabledisease, and multisectoral projects reflecteda rise in HIV/AIDS project approvals; in thesecond half of the period, the HIV/AIDS proj-ects reached nearly 40 percent ofthe HNP portfolio. In line with inter- national efforts to improve donor har-monization and alignment, the shareof HNP projects financing SWAps inhealth also climbed. 4 Although more HNP projects were approvedduring the second half of the decade, boththe share and the absolute number of proj-ects financing health reform-type objec-tives declined (table 2.2, lower panel). 5This includes projects with objectives of reform, fi-nancing, insurance, decentralization, and gov-ernment actions with respect to the private healthEVOLUTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THE WORLD BANK'S COUNTRY SUPPORT 17While commitments declined over the period,the number of projectsincreased, as did theshare in Africa.

The share of projects with explicit objec- tives to improve the quality and efficiency ofhealth care also dropped. Lending to reduce fertility, population growth, or unwanted births remained lowand became scarcer, dropping from only 6percent of the portfolio to 2 percent (table 2.2, lower panel) .Over the decade, only 14 proj- ects were approved with objectives to lower fertilityor increase use of contraception, or with family plan-ning components. The Bank's population supportwas directed to only about a quarter of the 35countries identified by the strategy (World Bank2007g) as having a total fertility rate of 5 or higher(appendix E). Lending with objectives to improve nutri- tional status dropped by half , from 12 to 7 per- cent of the portfolio (table 2.2, lower panel).Bank support to reduce malnutrition was directedto only about a quarter of countries with childstunting of 30 percent or more; malnutrition is asignificant problem among the poor in manymore countries, though its causes are diverse(appendix F). Total staffing in the sector rose, particu- larly the number of health specialists. T otal professional staff 6affiliated with the HNP sector grew by a quarter, from 136 in fiscal 1997 to a peakof 185 in fiscal 2004, and then had declinedslightly, to 169, by fiscal 2007 (appendix H). Vir-tually all of this increase was among sector spe-cialists, who increased by about 40 percent; thenumber of economists remained about the sameand the number of operations officers declined(figure 2.3). While the overall number of sector special- ists rose, the count of specialists in nutritionand population declined . The number of pop- ulation specialists plummeted, from 24 in 1997 to7 in 2003, while the number of nutrition special-ists dwindled from 8 to 5 over the decade (ap-pendix H). 7 The increase in staff affiliated with the Re-gions was not in proportion to the increase 18IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Figure 2.3: The Number of Sector Specialists Rose over the Decade 100 Sector specialists Operations, program, and project officers Economists80 60 4020 0Number of HNP staff Fiscal year1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Source: Nankhuni and Modi 2008.Table 2.2: Key Developments in the HNP Portfolio Percent of the portfolio Development 1997-2001c2002-06c Share increased IDA projectsa62 74 Projects in Africa 28 37Multisectoral HNP projects 25 49Free-standing communicable disease projects 25 44 HIV/AIDS projectsb17 39 Projects supporting SWAps 9 15 Share decreased Projects with health reform/financing/insurance objectives 44 24 Projects with objective to improve health care quality 49 22 Projects with objective to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness of health care 37 20 Projects with nutrition objectives 12 7 Projects with population objectives 6 2 Number of projects approved 99 121 Source: IEG portfolio review. a.

The number of HNP projects in Africa increased by 60 percent from the first tothe second half of the decade, while the numberof HNP staff affiliated with the Region rose byonly about 12 percent (appendix H). The numberof HNP projects in the Latin America and Carib-bean Region rose by 30 percent, and HNP staff roseby half. The number of HNP staff affiliated withEurope and Central Asia more than doubled, yetthe number of HNP projects in the two periodsremained about the same. Performance of Health, Nutrition, and Population Support Over the past decade, about two-thirds of completed HNP-managed projects had sat-isfactory outcomes. The performance ofHNP projects has stagnated, while the out-comes of projects in other sectors have con-tinued to improve (figure 2.4). 8The growing gap between the performance of HNP and othersectors is notdue to underlying shifts in the com- position of the portfolio. The share of develop-ment policy loans relative to investment projectsover time within the HNP sector and other sectorswas stable. 9According to the 2008 Annual Review of Development Effectiveness (IEG 2008a) ,proj- ect outcomes in Africa trail those in other Re-gions across the board, not just in the HNP sector. 10 The share of Africa Region projects among clos-ing projects also does not explain the divergencein outcomes between HNP and other sectors: theshare of Africa Region projects in other sectors de-clined from 28 to 24 percent, but by an even larger percentage among exiting projects in theHNP sector, from 35 to 26 percent. 11If one com- pares the outcomes of HNP lending to lending inall other sectors\u2014excluding projects in Africafrom both\u2014the performance of the HNP portfo-lio declines from 78 to 74 percent satisfactory be-tween the first and second half of the period,while the performance of other sectors collec-tively rises from 78 to 81 percent satisfactory. 12 The quality of project preparation by the Bankand the borrower's overall performance in prepar-ing and executing the project strongly predict bet-ter outcomes. The Bank's performance, and to alesser extent the borrower's performance, alsoshows a widening gap between HNP and other sectors (appendix H). 13Mul- tivariate analysis of the outcomes ofHNP projects approved during fiscal1997-2006 14found that the perfor- mance of the borrower (which includesgovernment and the implementing agency), as well as the Bank's role in quality at entry, are strongly correlated with better outcomes(appendix H). Eighty-three percent ofprojects with satisfactory borrower per-formance ultimately achieve satisfac-tory outcomes, compared with only 7percent of projects with unsatisfactoryborrower performance. Seventy-six percent ofprojects with satisfactory quality at entry achievesatisfactory outcomes, compared with only 19percent of those with unsatisfactory quality atentry. Given the importance of quality at entry in determining outcomes, it is worri-some to note that both the costs andduration of project preparation droppedprecipitously over fiscal 1997-2001 andEVOLUTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THE WORLD BANK'S COUNTRY SUPPORT 19Figure 2.4: Performance of HNP Projects Has Stagnated, while Outcomes in Other Sectors Continue to Improve 100 80 60 40 20 0Percent of projects with outcomes rated moderately satisfactory or higher63677279 36647068 1992-96 1987-91 1997-2001 2002-06 Fiscal sectors HNP sector(n = 14) Source: World Bank data.

In contrast, av-erage annual supervision costs for HNPinvestment projects have been risingsince 2001, as have supervision costs forinvestment projects in other sectors, with HNP supervision costs exceeding those inother sectors in fiscal 2004-06 (appendix H). 15 Projects with unsatisfactory outcomes are morelikely to cite certain Bank performance factorsthan are projects with satisfactory outcomes: in-adequate risk analysis (relative risk for unsatis-factory projects = 10:1); 16inadequate technical design (8:1); inadequate supervision (5:1); inad-equate political or institutional analysis (3:1); lackof baseline data that can be used to set realistic targets (3:1); overly complex design(2:1); and an inadequate M&E frame-work or poor data quality (2:1, appen-dix H). In addition, 12 percent of unsat-isfactory projects cited inadequate prioranalytic work, while none of the satis-factory projects cited this factor. IEG'srecent evaluation of Bank-wide ana- lytic and advisory activities found that prior ana-lytic work led to higher project quality at entry(IEG 2008h). Fieldwork for this evaluation con-firmed the value added and influence of analyticwork in the case study countries (box 2.1). HNP projects in Africa do not have lower per- formance simply because of the concentrationof low-income countries in the Region. Only a quarter of the closed HNP projects in the AfricaRegion had satisfactory outcomes, compared withthree-quarters of the closed projects in other Re-gions. All closed projects in Africa were in low-income countries and were financed by IDA grantsor credits. However, HNP projects financed by IDA in other Regions managed to perform sub-stantially better, often as well as or better thanIBRD-financed HNP projects in middle-incomecountries (figure 2.5). The performance of AIDSprojects in Africa has been particularly weak\u2014only18 percent have had satisfactory outcomes. Buteven if AIDS projects are excluded, only 27 per-cent of HNP projects in the Africa Region have hadsatisfactory outcomes. 17 The complexity of HNP operations in Africaand among IDA recipients is contributing tolow outcomes. Multisectoral investment lend- ing, in which multiple sectors are involved inmanaging and/or implementing activities, is as-sociated with lower outcomes in IDA countries,but not in countries receiving IBRD support.SWAps 18are also associated with lower outcomes, and most of them have occurred in Africa. Thus,the problem of highly complex operations in low-capacity countries found in IEG's 1999 HNPevaluation continues. The review of Bank per-formance, cited above, showed that while projectcomplexity raises the risk of low outcomes, somecomplex projects dohave satisfactory results. Among the factors found not to affect HNP out- 20IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION The borrower's performance and the quality of project preparation strongly predict outcomes. Inadequacies in risk assessment, political analysis, technical design, and supervision are among the factors lowering outcomes. Analytic work sponsored by the Bank\u2014one of the major forms of country support in addition to policy dialogueand lending\u2014was highly influential in four of the coun-tries where IEG conducted in-depth fieldwork. In Nepal, a burden-of-disease analysis showing that 70 percent of life years lost were taken by preventablecommunicable diseases that disproportionately affectthe poor helped the government to improve the pro-poor allocation of public health expenditures.In Malawi, the 2005 health public expenditure review led to a more realistic assessment of the resourceneeds for the first SWAp in health. In Peru , Improving Health Care for the Poor (Cotlear 2000) provided the analytic framework and major rec-ommendations that guided health reforms in that coun-try and was valued highly by government. Five major pieces of influential analytic work were supported in preparation for the second health reformproject in the Kyrgyz Republic.Box 2.1: Analytic Work Supported Better Outcomes in Four Shaw forthcoming: Elmendorf and Nankhuni forthcoming; IEG 2009b, forthcoming.comes were the source of finance (IDA versus IBRD, when Region is controlled for), the size ofthe support, the borrower's population size, andthe year of approval (there was no time trendwhen other factors were controlled for). Although they comprised a small part of the overall portfolio, projects with popula-tion and nutrition objectives also had lower-than-average outcomes compared with therest of the portfolio. None of the projects with explicit fertility or population objectives achievedthem: modern contraceptive use and fertilitywere barely affected in Guinea, India, Kenya, andMali. In Bangladesh, Gambia, and Senegal, fertil-ity declined somewhat, but it is doubtful that theresults stem from population programs or Banksupport. 19Three projects with population and family planning components (but no populationobjective) partially achieved their objectives,showing that it is possible to raise contraceptiveuse in difficult environments when both demandand supply-side factors are addressed (box 2.2).Among the 15 nutrition projects that had closed,only 2\u2014the Indonesia Iodine Defi- ciency Control and Enhancement Projects\u2014were ableto substantially meet their objectivesand show a change in nutritional outcomes. Theperformance of the population and nutritionportfolios is discussed in greater depth in ap-pendixes E and F, respectively. Complex designs, the lack of up-front risk and institutional analysis, and the absorptionof these services into a basic package alongwith other health care were all implicatedin the low results. Project complexity was par- ticularly acute in the nutrition projects, cited ascontributing to shortcomings in more than half ofthe weak-performing projects. Nutrition projectstend to involve several sectors in implementationand are often managed outside the Ministry ofHealth, in some cases by new or inexperienced in-stitutions (as in Mauritania). In Uganda,the added complexity arose from ex-panded geographical coverage of whatwas supposed to be a pilot activity.EVOLUTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THE WORLD BANK'S COUNTRY SUPPORT 21Figure 2.5: IDA Project Outcomes in Africa Are Much Lower than in Other Regions 60 100 80 0 Africa n = 33 IDA n = 0 IBRD South Asia n = 14 IDA n = 0 IBRD Europe and Central Asia n = 9 IDA n = 9 IBRD East Asia and Pacific n = 5 IDA n = 5 IBRD Latin America and the Caribbean n = 3 IDA n = 16 IBRD Middle East and North Africa n = 0 IDA n = 3 IBRD 20 40 247178 67 75 100 6780 80 Percent of projects rated moderately satisfactory or higher IDA IBRD Source: IEG portfolio review. Note: Two projects that had blended operations are excluded. Total: IDA = 64, IBRD = 33. Project complexity in IDA countries has contributedto low outcomes.Population and nutrition projects often did notachieve their objectives.Support to Egypt and Malawi demonstrates that intensive efforts to raise contraceptive use and lower fertility in high-fertility ruralareas can show results. The Egypt Population Project (1996-2005) financed activities to increase the demand for smaller families and the supply ofcontraception in rural Upper Egypt. aCommunity development as- sociations designed and managed subprojects in 148 of the poor-est villages. The subprojects financed home visits, communityconferences on healthy behaviors, and microcredit and literacyclasses for women and promoted local maternal and childhealth/family planning services, in order to improve women's fam-ily planning and reproductive health knowledge, stimulate de-mand for smaller families, and raise modern contraceptive use.The project also improved the quality and supply of family plan-ning services offered in the health system in the project villages.The modern contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) rose from 40 to45 percent between 2000 and 2005, compared with an increasefrom 56 to 59 percent nationwide, while the total fertility rate (TFR)declined by 0.8 children, from 4.7 to 3.9, compared with a nationaldecline from 3.5 to 3.1. Attribution of these results to the projectis difficult because M&E was limited and other donors (mainly theUnited States and the European Union) were supporting similarinterventions in the same part of Egypt. It was found that the proj- ect contributed to the collective impact of these efforts and thatits design influenced other donors in adopting demand-sideinterventions. The Malawi Population and Family Planning Project (1999- 2004) aimed to demonstrate that a community-based distributionapproach to family planning could raise contraceptive use inthree high-fertility pilot areas in rural Malawi. Public sectorcommunity-based distribution agents (CBDA) provided familyplanning counseling and contraceptives and referred clients forlong-term or permanent methods. Information, education, andcommunication activities aimed to generate demand. The percentof contraceptive users with CBDAs as their source rose from 1to 24 percent and contraceptive use rose by twice as much in the pilot districts as in the three matched control districts (seefigure, below). While the evaluation demonstrated that thiscommunity-based approach, emphasizing both demand and sup-ply-side activities, could raise contraceptive use in high-fertilityrural areas, the model was not replicated more widely. Certainlessons were incorporated into the government program, but by2004, the government and donors were fully engaged in launch-ing a health SWAp.

Absorption of family planningprograms into basic packages of services sup-ported by SWAps and health reform projects alsomay have contributed; field visits in Egypt con-firmed the finding of a previous study that em-phasis on a basic package of services had oftenreduced the availability and quality of family plan-ning (appendix E). Results from a Detailed Implementation Re- view of five health projects in India suggestthat even projects that meet their objectivesmay be performing at substantially lower lev-els than their outcomes would suggest. 20The review found that the Bank often relies on the bor-rower's reporting systems to confirm the deliveryof such key outputs as civil works and equipment,without independent verification by the Bank of thequality of project goods and services and their de-livery. For example, more than half of the pieces ofequipment procured for the Food and Drug Ca-pacity Building Project were not delivered or not in-stalled, 21and \"severe construction deficiencies\" were found in the Orissa Health Systems Devel-opment Project in buildings that the constructionsupervisors had reported to be complete and per-forming according to specification. 22The review found that \"supervision generally did not involvecomprehensive site visits or physical inspections.\" 23 It is not known how representative these Indiaprojects are of the overall HNP portfolio, but thereis an important lesson here about the need to con-duct supervisory field visits to verify the imple-mentation data provided by the borrower. Bettersupervision has the potential to enhance the impactof Bank support on outcomes, if addressed. T o summarize, while the overall levels of lending in HNP have not changed much over the pastdecade, the composition of the portfolio hasshifted rather dramatically toward communicabledisease projects, particularly AIDS; projects inthe Africa Region; and, to a lesser extent, supportfor SWAps. Support for health reform (as mea-sured by the projects' stated objectives) has de-clined but is still significant, particu- larly in middle-income countries, whilesupport for population and nutrition,already low, has declined further. Per-formance of the lending portfolio hasstalled, with only about two-thirds of projectsshowing satisfactory outcomes. While some ofthe activities are inherently risky, several factorsthat can be addressed were implicated\u2014excessivecomplexity, particularly in low-capacity environ-ments; lack of institutional analysis and relevantanalytic work linked to lending; inadequate base-line data and M&E; and inadequate assessment ofthe risks and mitigation strategies. Monitoring, Evaluation, and the Results Agenda The 2007 HNP strategy highlights delivering results and improving governance, both ofwhich depend critically on strong M&E forsuccess. T wo previous IEG evaluations of HNP and HIV/AIDS support concluded that weak M&Ehad contributed to lower efficacy and less learn-ing. The 2007 HNP strategy acknowledges theseshortcomings and maintains that inadequate M&Eprecludes a thorough analysis of the efficacy ofBank support over the past decade. An increasing share of projects since 1997 has had monitoring in-dicators and baseline data at thetime they are appraised, in part be-cause of changes in the require-ments for PADs. Around the time that the 1997 HNP strategy was approved, a re-quired \"logical framework\" was added to thePAD. In fiscal 1997-98, all active projects wereretrofitted with performance indicators. Thus, itshould not be a surprise that HNP projects ap-proved in 2007 had more indicators and weremore likely to have baseline data than projects ap-proved in 1997 (table 2.3). 24 Despite these improvements, too few proj-ects have baseline data at appraisal. In fiscal 2007, the share of HNP projects that planned tocollect baseline data after the project was ap- proved was about the same as a decade earlier (40EVOLUTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THE WORLD BANK'S COUNTRY SUPPORT 23Bank supervision is missing some keyimplementationdeficiencies. An increasing share of projects since 1997 havemonitoring indicatorsand baseline data.versus 43 percent). A quarter of proj- ects approved in fiscal 2007 still had nobaseline values in the PAD, and onlyabout half had baseline values for alloutcome indicators. A recent analysisof 12 projects in South Asia found thatbaseline data were collected for only 39percent of indicators and that there was little evidence of improvement in M&E be-tween projects approved before and since 2001(Loevinsohn and Pande 2006). M&E of recently closed HNP projects\u2014al- most all of them approved since fiscal1997\u2014has been weak. Since mid-2006, IEG has been systematically rating the performance ofclosed projects on M&E, with a \"quality of M&E\"rating, based on M&E design, implementation, anduse of the data. It is rated on a four-point scale:negligible, modest, substantial, or high. The M&Eof 45 projects managed by the HNP sector has been reviewed since mid-2006; M&Ewas substantial or high for only 27 per-cent of the projects, slightly lower thanthe rate Bank-wide (35 percent), whichis also quite low (figure 2.6). 25Nearly half of the ICRs for these HNP proj-ects had no baseline data when the projects were approved, and baseline data werenever collected at all for five projects. Lack of M&E has had consequences for the design and efficacy of projects and for im-proved governance, an objective of the 2007HNP strategy. According to a review of ICRs of closed projects with low M&E ratings, the lack ofbaseline data has reduced the relevance and fea-sibility of projects' objectives and design. Unre-alistic targets were set\u2014either too high, or belowlevels later found to prevail at the start of theproject. Weak M&E not only makes it difficult toassess the effectiveness of activities, but also con-tributes directly to lower efficacy and efficiency be-cause it limits opportunities for learning andfine-tuning implementation for better results. The Bank has launched major initiatives in impact evaluation, and a significant numberof these address HNP themes. These include the Development Impact Evaluation Initiativefrom the Bank's Development Economics De-partment; the Spanish T rust Fund for Impact Eval-uation, which is dedicated to the evaluation ofinnovative programs to improve human devel-opment; and the Africa Impact Evaluation Initia-tive. In the databases for these initiatives, IEGidentified 101 ongoing or complete HNP impactevaluations\u2014most with an experimental design. 26 It is too early to assess the results and long-runimpact of the initiatives in institutionalizing orproviding greater incentives for evaluation.

Sixty-five projects\u2014 about 30 percent of the total HNP portfolio\u2014were labeled as pilot projects, had pilot inter-ventions or pilot regions, had an objective to testan approach or intervention, declared an intent toevaluate the impact of an intervention or pro-gram, or had an intent to conduct an impact eval-uation, according to the PAD. 27The objective was generally to test the effectiveness or acceptabilityof an activity, and on this basis improve or expandit. However, only 17 projects mentioned a controlgroup, 12 described an evaluation design in thePAD, 8 had baseline data in the PAD, and 7 iden-tified an explicit control group or planned an eco-nomic analysis (figure 2.7). 28All of the pilot and impact evalu-ations that were eventually con-ducted had an evaluation design inthe PAD. About half of the 65 approved projects with planned pilot or impactevaluations had closed. Only 7 of themhad a detailed design in the PAD, andonly 4 actually conducted the proposed eval-uation of a pilot (figure 2.7), including an impactevaluation of early childhood interventions in the Philippines (box 2.3). 29Among the 25 pilot and impact evaluation projects that did not have an evaluation design de-scribed in the PAD, none conducted the planned evaluation.

The objective of the Philippines Early Childhood Development (ECD) Project (fiscal 1998-2006) was to ensure the survival andpromote the physical and mental development of Filipino children,particularly the most vulnerable and disadvantaged. The projectimplemented expanded immunization, integrated management ofchildhood illness (IMCI), prevention and control of micronutrientmalnutrition, a service to inform parents on growth monitoring andECD, and a first grade early childhood education/development pro-gram in three regions. The project did not introduce new servicesbut sought to integrate and deliver existing ones through center-and home-based interventions. The impact evaluation conducted longitudinal surveys annu- ally from 2001 to 2003 on 6,693 children aged 0-4 in randomly se-lected households of two project experimental regions, and onecontrol region without the interventions. The design includedbaseline and endline surveys: a general population-based sam-ple survey of ECD status and services; nutrition surveys inte- grated into the National Nutrition Surveys; surveys of ECD-relatedknowledge, attitudes, and practice; and provincial-level surveysof ethnic groups. The end-project survey in 2003 repeated the 1998baseline survey in full. The evaluation found a significant improvement in the cogni- tive, social, motor, and language development and the short-term nutritional status of children residing in ECD program areascompared with those in nonprogram areas, particularly for chil-dren under four. The share of children under four with worms anddiarrhea was significantly lower in program areas than in non-program areas, but higher for older children. These results, as wellas other studies sponsored by the project, helped guide im-provement in ECD interventions, build capacity for evidence-based policymaking, and assured the continuation of the ECDprogram.

For ex-ample, the efficacy of training programs in chang-ing provider behavior can be measured. It is alsoimportant to collect, in parallel with the resultsframework, information on other key determi-nants of outcomes that are outside of the project. One of the main reasons for lack of M&E through- out operations is said to be a lack of incentives.The project appraisal and approval process is onesuch incentive that does seem to be operating\u2014projects that do not have evaluation designs forpilot projects in the PAD, or those that do not havebaseline data collected at the PAD stage, often donot implement them. Making project approvalcontingent on evaluation designs for specific el-ements of a program, and making baseline dataa requirement, should result in more frequentevaluation. T o summarize, logframes and results frameworks, such as the one in the 2007 HNP strategy, have cre-ated greater incentives for monitoring inputs,outputs, outcomes, and impacts and offer guid-ance to select the right indicators. However, theincentives are still not sufficient to ensure ade-quate incentives for baseline data and evalua- tion, which is key to understanding effectiveness and impact. Strengthening M&E is one of the keyelements of achieving the strategy's objective ofbetter governance in the sector. Is Health, Nutrition, and Population Support Reaching the Poor? In keeping with the Bank's mandate for poverty reduction, improving health out-comes among the poor is one of the majorobjectives in the 2007 HNP strategy, as it wasin the 1997 strategy. Numerous studies have shown that it would be dangerous to assume thatsimply expanding health services would extendbenefits primarily to the poor; instead, most havefound a strong bias in government health ex-penditure in favor of the non-poor (box 2.4).Over the past decade, most CASs and about halfof the health portfolio had a generally pro-poor focus, but evidence that thepoor actually benefited is weak. Thenumber of country strategies and proj-ects that set explicit objectives regard-ing the poor is small, and the evidencethat the poor have benefited absolutelyor relative to the non-poor is thin. Nearly three-quarters of CASs specifically dis- cussed health issues among the poor (Sinha and Gaubatz 2009). Attention to the poor in-creased slightly from the first to secondhalf of the period\u2014from 70 to 79 per-cent of CASs. However, only half artic-ulated a definition of the poor, andfewer than a quarter cited a method toreach them. Even among the subset of CASs thatemphasized health issues for the poor, only 15 per-cent set explicit targets for them. While this shareis low, it has increased over time, from 11 to 21percent. While two-thirds of HNP project support is for the poorest countries, only about half ofthe lending portfolio could be said to havea poverty focus within countries. This would include projects that explicitly target the poor intheir objectives, those that have an objective toimprove access to health services more generally,those that seek to prevent and control commu-nicable diseases known to dispropor-tionately affect the poor, 30and projects with objectives to improve health out-comes of the population but with a de-sign that favors poor geographic areasor services for the poor. Using this def-inition, about half of the portfolio (107 projects)could be said to have a pro-poor focus. This def-inition of poverty focus could be overly generous, as one could argue and it has been shown that in-creasing access to services often disproportion-ately benefits the non-poor (World Bank 2003b;Gwatkin, Wagstaff, and Yazbeck 2005). At the sametime, the PADs for almost all HNP lending oper-ations discuss the welfare of the poor or are linkedto poverty reduction, even if the project is not ex-EVOLUTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THE WORLD BANK'S COUNTRY SUPPORT 27Nearly three-quarters of CASs discussed healthissues among the poor.

A remarkably small share of projects had ob- jectives to improve health outcomes amongthe poor. Only one in eight projects (13 percent) had an objective to target health status, access, use,quality, or demand, or to provide health insur- ance specifically among the poor (table 2.4). 31 Beyond this, an additional 7 percent of projects had an objective to improve equity, most often ex-pressed in terms of equity in the distribution ofresources in the health system, in access to healthservices, or in health status. 32 28IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Assuring that the poor have access to health services is often an objective of government spending, but studies of the incidenceof government health expenditure in developing countries haveconsistently found that the wealthiest quintiles generally bene- fit the most from public health subsidies.a In Ecuador, for example, the poorest quintile received 8 per- cent of health subsidies compared with a 38 percent share for therichest quintile. bIn Uzbekistan the poor received 13 percent of health spending, while the rich got 39 percent.b A comparison of 11 Asian countries found a pro-rich bias in 9 countries and that the bias was particularly acute in the lowest-income countries. cIn most cases there was a strong pro-rich biasin the distribution of hospital care; there was less pro-rich bias in basic health services and in higher -income countries, where there are private alternatives and the rich can self-select out of thepublic sector. Aggregation of findings in countries across Regions suggest that the bias of public spending against the poor is most acutein some of the lowest -income Regions\u2014Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia\u2014while the bias is also strong in Europe andCentral Asia (see figure below). Even in Latin America, where gov-ernment health spending is pro-poor on average, there are coun-tries where this is not the case.Box 2.4: Is Public Health Spending Pro-Poor?

About 1 in 10 planned to reach the poor by providing ser-vices that the poor would use disproportionately(basic health package, nutrition, primary healthcare, communicable disease control), and 14 per-cent planned to target individual householdsusing administrative data. The remainder plannedto reach the poor by targeting specific populationgroups presumed to be poor or making healthcare more affordable. Surprisingly, 7 percent of theprojects with objectives targeting the poor advo-cated addressing the needs of the whole popu-lation\u2014that is, there were no plans to ensurethat the poor would be reached. Very few of the closed projects with pro-poor or equity objectives were able to demon-strate an improvement in HNP outcomesamong the poor. Among the 108 closed projects that have ICRs, 12 (11 percent) had objectives tar-geting the poor. 33Of these, only 2 projects col- lected outcome data in both the (poor) projectand control areas, and in both cases improve-ments in health were shown across the board. Inhalf of the cases, data were collected only in proj-ect areas, with no information on comparisonareas (or, in two cases, the comparison was na-tional data). In two cases, no outcome data werecollected at all. In a project in Bangladesh, wherethe targeting mechanism was expansion of an es-sential services package that would most benefitthe poor, all of the outcome targets improved atthe national level, but no data were collected torepresent access of the poor. Whenever healthoutcomes were measured, the results showed animprovement. However, the attribution to proj-ect outputs in these cases was weak. Without in-formation on what happened elsewhere, it isdifficult to attribute these improvements to theprograms supported by the Bank. Fieldwork for the evaluation revealed both success and challenges in reaching the poor.In Egypt, the Schistosomiasis Control Project suc-cessfully reached the poor because the diseasedisproportionately affects the rural poor in areas with limited water managementinfrastructure. The Population Projectnoted earlier targeted low-income ruralcommunities in Upper Egypt, where fer-tility rates were higher than the nationalaverage. The Eritrea HIV/AIDS, Malaria, SexuallyT ControlProject asserted that community-managed sub-projects would benefit the poor, but there was nospecific effort to monitor the incidence of bene-fits among the poor, and the TB control activities,thought to disproportionately benefit the poor,had the weakest performance. The Basic Healthand Nutrition and Health Reform Projects in Peruhad explicit objectives to improve the health ofpoor women and children over a decade. Healthinsurance was extended to the poor nationwide.Yet only average health outcomes could betracked, and these were not even forthe specific areas targeted by the proj-ects. The links between health reformprojects more generally and benefits forthe poor were complex and uncertain(box 2.5). About two-thirds of poverty assessments delivered over fiscal years 2000-07 featureda chapter or subchapter on health. An im- portant value added of Bank support for HNPanalytic work is in drawing the link between healthand poverty and policies to address both.

Very few poverty assessments ad- dress nutrition or population. Only 19 percent of poverty assessments hada nutrition chapter or subchapter, and this percentage declined by more than half overtime, from 28 percent in fiscal 2000-03 to 12 per-cent in fiscal 2004-07. The treatment of popula-tion was even lower: only 8 percent of povertyassessments had a chapter or subchapter on pop-ulation, fertility, or family planning. Of the 20poverty assessments conducted for countrieswith a total fertility rate of five or more, only onehad a subchapter on population (Mozambique,total fertility rate of 5.2). The inventory of analytic work as- sembled by IEG also shows a de-cline in the poverty-orientation ofHNP analytic work over the pastdecade. Overall, poverty-related analytic work accounted for a third of all analytic work duringfiscal 1997-2006 if multicountry studies are treatedas separate studies, and about a quarter if multi-country studies are treated as a single study (table2.5). 34Irrespective of the inclusion of multicoun- try studies, the share of poverty-related analyticwork declined. T o summarize, the Bank has supported HNP out- comes in developing countries over the pastdecade in an environment of shifting interna-tional priorities and approaches. Composition ofthe lending portfolio has shifted in favor ofHIV/AIDS and multisectoral projects, and a greatershare of projects in Africa. The shift of the Bank's lending for communica- ble diseases has added to a huge international in-flux of resources for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria.The share of projects with health system reformobjectives has shrunk both relatively and ab-solutely, though global resources for these ob-jectives do not seem to have increased nearly as 30IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION The first and second Health Reform Projects in the Kyrgyz Republic (1996-2006) improved the efficiency of the health system, butwere less successful in redistributing funds in favor of the pooror addressing their health needs. Primary care was strengthened,broadened, and made more available, with clear improvementsin access to care for the poorer populations. Copayments weremade more predictable, and the outpatient drug package madeprescription drugs more affordable. However, the guaranteedbenefits were not universally implemented because of a short-age of funds. The centralization of fragmented pooling arrange-ments should have enhanced opportunities for efficiency andcross-subsidization, but it is not clear that this actually benefitedthe poor. During the second project, anticipated redistribution ofresources from relatively rich and over-serviced Bishkek to thepoorer oblasts did not occur. Neither project tracked health out-comes among the poor. The Egypt Health Reform Program (1998-present) intended to improve the health of the poor, yet chose to concentrate initiallyon relatively affluent governorates to increase the chances of suc-cess. The poor within these areas would benefit by rationalizinghealth infrastructure investment with an emphasis on under-served neighborhoods. But fewer than 40 percent of facilities fol-lowed the pro-poor rationalization guidelines; positive gains wereundermined by enrollment and service fees without proper mech-anisms to exempt the poor. Public-sector health providers inter-viewed by IEG had a vision of a competitive market where potentialusers preferred other options (nongovernmental organizations orthe private sector) on quality grounds; they saw it as their roleto compete with these providers, as opposed to enrolling and serv-ing the poor. Concern for the failure to enroll the poor was notvoiced until 2004; tracking of the enrollment of the poor was notadded as an indicator for the project until late 2007. Box 2.5: Links Between Health Reform Projects and the Health of the Poor Were Complex and Uncertain Sources: IEG 2008d, Gonzalez-Rosetti forthcoming. About two-thirds of poverty assessments over fiscal 2000-07 had significant sections on health; few addressed nutrition or population, which greatly affect the poor. The poverty orientation of HNP analytic work has declined over the past decade.much. Attention to nutrition has remained rela- tively low; attention to population dropped fromlow to negligible, but appears to be reversing. About half of the lending portfolio is focused ex- plicitly or implicitly on improving health for thepoorest people within countries, yet accountabilityfor actually delivering health results is lacking.We know very little about the success of Bank sup-port in delivering on its institutional mandate ofpoverty reduction within the HNP sector. Atten-tion to HNP in poverty assessments appears to beslipping. Only two of every three HNP projects have satis- factory outcomes, and there has been no im-provement, in part because of the increasedcomplexity of projects in countries with low im-plementation capacity, as well as shortcomings ininstitutional and risk analysis. M&E remain weakand evaluation is scarce, even in projects withevaluation objectives or pilot activities that wereplanned for evaluation. The Bank's HNP support in many countries has had significant positive impacts, and additional ex-amples will be highlighted in the chapters that fol-low. Yet these findings for the portfolio at largepose major challenges to the sector in turning around performance and in pursuing the 2007HNP strategy, with its aim of delivering resultson health outcomes among the poor, health sys-tem performance, and better governance.EVOLUTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THE WORLD BANK'S COUNTRY SUPPORT 31Table 2.5: The Poverty Focus of HNP Analytic Work DeclinedFigure 2.8: The Share of Poverty Assessments with a Focus on HNP Declined 100 80 60 40 20 0 Health Nutrition PopulationPercent of poverty assessments Fiscal years 2000-03 (n = 50) Fiscal years 2004-07 (n = 72)80 28 758 12 7 Source: IEG review of analytic work.

Communicable Disease Control Eighty percent of the 15 million peoplewho die every year from communicablediseases live in developing countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates thatthere were 247 million cases of malaria world-wide in 2006 and 881,000 deaths, most of themamong African children (WHO 2008). T uberculosis(TB) kills 1.6 million people annually. As of theend of 2007, 33 million people worldwide wereliving with HIV/AIDS, more than 90 percent ofthem in developing countries (UNAIDS 2008).Three-quarters of the 2 million people who diedof AIDS in 2007 were living in Sub-Saharan Africa.Communicable diseases account for about a third (36 percent) of the disease burden in the devel-oping world (Jamison and others 2006b), butthe burden of morbidity and mortality is great-est among the poor (Gwatkin and Guillot 2000).The 1993 World Development Report: Investing in Health (World Bank 1993c) highlighted this burden and advocated investing in apackage of cost-effective, basic publichealth measures that included com-municable disease control. The WorldBank has long supported communi-cable disease control components aspart of health projects; freestandingdisease projects date back to 1988. 1 World Bank commitments for communica-ble disease control accounted for $3.5 bil-lion, or about a third of all HNP-managedcommitments approved during fiscal 1997-2006. 2The World Bank approved a total of 93 communicable disease projects, including 63 free-Since 1997, the Bank has supported a number of approaches to improve health status and health system performance that figure prominently inthe action plan of the 2007 HNP strategy. The rapid increase in support for communicable disease control was not only a strategy for improving health outcomes among the poor, but also has led to efforts in the action planto ensure synergy between infectious disease programs and health systems.Experience with health reforms and sectorwide approaches (SWAps) are at the heart of improving the performance of health systems, a second majortheme of the 2007 strategy. Commitments for communicable disease control were $3.5 billion\u2014about a third of all HNP-managed commitmentsover fiscal 1997-2006.standing single-disease projects, 11 projects ad- dressing multiple diseases, and 19 projects withcommunicable disease components. Communi-cable disease control was thus funded in at least42 percent of the HNP projects approved over theperiod. Freestanding AIDS projects accountedfor nearly 60 percent of all communicable dis-ease projects approved over the decade (figure3.1) and a quarter of all approved HNP projects. Between the first and second half of that decade, the share of communica-ble disease projects (including free-standing single- and multiple-diseaseprojects and components) among allapprovals rose from a third to half of allprojects and from 30 to 43 percent ofall HNP commitments. The most common rationales offered for sup- porting public communicable disease control in-volved the positive externalities and public-goodnature of disease control, the understanding thatmost communicable diseases disproportionatelyaffect the poor, and the cost-effectiveness of com-municable disease interventions. 3AIDS projects in Africa were largely launched in an emergencymode in light of exploding HIV transmission rates,the high mortality rate from AIDS, and the adverseeconomic and social impact of the disease in a verypoor Region. 4 The surge in Bank support for communi-cable disease control was in step with majornew international initiatives for commu-nicable disease control. In 2000, the G8 Summit in Japan committed to implement anambitious plan to prevent infectious disease, in-cluding AIDS, malaria, and TB, and the Bankagreed to triple IDA financing for those diseases. 5 Communicable disease control was consideredan international public good, and the interna-tional community rallied behind it. The UN Mil-lennium Development Goals were adopted witha goal for AIDS and malaria. Initiatives werelaunched to eradicate polio and guinea worm. Anoutbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome(SARS) and avian influenza reminded the worldof its vulnerability to new infectious agents. 6The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria wascreated in 2002; it has committed $15.0 billion anddisbursed $6.9 billion to date. 7The U.S. Presi- dent's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)committed $12.8 billion for AIDS from fiscal 2004to 2007. Support from bilateral aid agencies ex-panded, and major private foundations have be-come involved. Bank strategies on HIV/AIDS andon malaria have been developed, and the Bankcontinues to be involved in global internationalpartnerships such as Stop TB, Roll Back Malaria(RBM), and the Global Alliance for Vaccines andImmunization (GAVI), 8in addition to its role as a cosponsor the Joint United Nations Programon HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). Communicable diseasesfeature prominently in the Bank's global publicgood strategic theme, one of six identified in2007 by Bank President Zoellick. Efficacy of Support for Communicable Disease Control Evidence on the efficacy of Bank support for com- municable disease control can be gleaned from anin-depth portfolio review of the 93 approved proj-ects (Martin 2009), IEG Project Performance As- 36IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Figure 3.1: AIDS Accounted for More than Half of Communicable Disease Projects Approved in FiscalYears 1997-2006 Disease component 20% disease 3% Malaria 3% 57% n = 93 communicable disease projects approved Source: IEG portfolio review.

In 2005, IEG evaluated the development effectiveness ofthe entire HIV/AIDS portfolio. Support for communicable disease con- trol, both in freestanding projects and produced demonstrable resultsfor TB, malaria, schistosomiasis, and lep-rosy. In Bangladesh, the Fourth Population and Family Health Project supported the NationalLeprosy Elimination Program (IEG 2006b). Theprevalence of leprosy declined from 13.6 to lessthan 1 per 10,000 population. Bank supportthrough two projects contributed to dramaticresults in reducing malaria in Eritrea (box 3.1).Support for TB Control in India (1997-2006)expanded coverage of directly observed treat-ment short-course (DOTS) by training half a mil-lion government staff and enlisting the help of10,000 private practitioners, more than 1,600nongovernmental organizations, 100 privateenterprises, and a wide network of communityvolunteers. Information, education, and com-munication investments spread the word thatTB is curable and sought to reduce stigma. Morethan twice as many people were treated asplanned, the cure rate rose from 35 to 86 percent,and death rates in areas with DOTS were re-duced sevenfold relative to non-DOTS areas(World Bank 2006a). In Egypt, support for schis-tosomiasis control helped to reduce the preva-lence of S. mansoni (the cause of intestinal schistosomiasis in Lower Egypt) from 14.8 to 1.2percent, and of S. haematorbium (the cause of urinary schistosomiasis in Middle and UpperEgypt) from 6.6 to 1.2 percent over the period1993-2006 (IEG 2008c). In contrast, the performance of the HIV/ AIDS portion of the communicable diseaseportfolio, which was responsible for theenormous growth in communicable dis-ease projects over the decade, has beenmodest. Only 29 percent of the freestanding HIV/AIDS projects approved and completedduring fiscal years 1997-2006 had satisfactoryoutcomes, compared with 89 percent for thefreestanding projects for other diseases 10(figure 3.2).

The number of cases per 100,000 population nation-ally dropped from 7,546 to 568 between 1998 and 2006. While the earlypart of the response also corresponded to a period of declining rainfall,which would have contributed to these trends, malaria cases continuedto fall even when the rains resumed in 2003.

Other important sourcesof funding were the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID); the ItalianCooperation; and, since 2003, the Global Fund.Box 3.1: Successful Malaria Control in Eritreaects for other communicable diseases has been substantially higher.11AIDS projects in Africa\u2014where the crisis ismost acute\u2014have had particularlymodest performance: Only 18 percent of the projects in the Africa Multicountry AIDS Pro-gram (MAP) have had satisfactory outcomes. 12 The advantage of support for one or morecommunicable diseases is that the projectcan be less complex. Communicable disease support can have better defined boundaries; theobjective is easier to understand; the results chainleading from outputs to outcomes is straightfor-ward; and results can be seen in many cases in arelatively short period. Many communicable dis-ease programs have dedicated workers and facil-ities, although most still rely on the rest of thehealth system. All of the AIDS projects have facedthe challenge that the ultimate outcome for HIVprevention\u2014HIV incidence\u2014is difficult to ob-serve and rarely measured (though the behaviorsthat spread it can be). Success in stopping thespread of HIV also depends on reaching margin-alized, high-risk individuals, which can be tech-nically and politically difficult. While there are specific charac- teristics of HIV prevention andcontrol that present challenges,what sets the Africa Region AIDSprojects apart from the other com-municable disease projects is theirrelatively more complex design. As the findings of chapter 2 indicate, complexityof design in low-capacity settings is a strong pre-dictor of weak performance. The large number ofimplementers in both government and civil societymake the Africa MAP projects highly complex. Ademand-driven design with so many actors makesit more difficult to assess coverage and quality ofkey activities. Beyond this, while other commu-nicable disease programs are often run from long-existing directorates within the Ministry of Health, the Africa Region AIDS projects havegenerally relied on newly created andinexperienced institutions, separatefrom the Ministry. Finally, many wereprepared in an emergency mode; theinvestment in M&E and \"learning by doing\" in these projects (which was supposed to be 5-10percent of costs) has not been realized, and thelarge number of implementers would challengeany M&E system. Most of the completed AIDSprojects in Africa have been unable to establish aclear results chain linking outputs to outcomes orto address systematically the key drivers of the epi-demic, although the latter is a weakness of mostAIDS projects in other Regions. Simplifying the design of HIV/AIDS proj- ects is under the control of the Bank andborrowers. While it is difficult to change capac- ity in the short run, and some of the inherent dif-ficulties confronting HIV/AIDS cannot be fixed,HIV/AIDS programs do not require an overly com-plex design. The relatively more successful AIDSprojects in Argentina, Brazil, and India, in set-tings with greater capacity, still do not have proj-ect designs as complex as those in Africa. Findingsand lessons from Bank support for HIV/AIDS proj-ects were evaluated by IEG in 2005, with recom-mendations that remain relevant to support in allRegions (box 3.2). Notwithstanding the accomplishments ofmany of these communicable disease projects: M&E has been weaker than for other HNP projects, even though the resultschain is theoretically easier to constructthan for projects that address broadhealth issues. Only one in five closed com- municable disease projects had at least sub-stantial M&E, compared with a third in the restof the HNP portfolio. 13An example of this par- adox can be seen in malaria control. While thenumber of bednets distributed or treated withinsecticides is generally available, none of theseven completed projects supporting malariacontrol could provide data on actual bednetuse, and only one had data on bednet owner-ship (the endpoint only). The low capacity,weak institutions, and lack of M&E have led togovernance problems in a number of theseprojects, both in Africa and India. 14 There is little evidence to confirm that the poor\u2014however defined\u2014have dispro- 38IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION The performance of the HIV/AIDS portion of the portfolio has been modest.

Without data onthe socioeconomic distribution of benefits, itcannot be assumed that the incidence of diseasecontrol outcomes is pro-poor, particularly forHIV/AIDS, which in many developing countriesdoes not disproportionately affect the poor.There are equity dimensions to some of the pro-grams\u2014such as in the distribution of free bed-nets or malaria drugs and access to subsidizedantiretroviral treatment\u2014that are rarely studied. Very few Bank projects have attempted to calculate the actual costs or effective-ness of interventions as implemented in the field as a basis for improvingperformance. A case in point is the Egypt Schistosomiasis Control Project. One of theobjectives was to strengthen the capacity to pe-riodically assess the cost-effectiveness of theprogram and to adjust the strategy accordingly(IEG 2008c). However, most studies were notcarried out. Recent economic and sector workon AIDS treatment in Thailand and India pointsto tradeoffs in cost-effectiveness and sus-tainability of AIDS treatment programs undervarying assumptions (Over and others 2004; Re-venga and others 2006). Yet this key informa-tion is not available for low-income Africa,which has the greatest HIV burden and thefewest resources. Only two public expenditurereviews (PERs) issued in Africa since 2000 havediscussed the costs and sustainability of AIDSprograms, including the long-run cost of pro-viding antiretroviral therapy to patients. 15 Synergy Between Communicable Disease Programs and the Health System The 2007 HNP strategy calls for synergy between efforts to strengthen health systems and the focuson priority disease results in low-income countries,noting that a well-functioning health system isalso essential for the success of these programs. 16 This is clearly borne out in the experience ofsupport for communicable disease control: healthsystem problems with the procurement and dis- tribution of pharmaceuticals and the understaffingor low performance of fixed facilities for treatmentand immunizations also affect the efficacy of com-municable disease control programs. Yet it alsocould be said that a well-functioning health sys-tem depends on effective communicable diseasecontrol, because prevention of communicablediseases is often low cost and reduces demand formore expensive treatment, freeing resources forother conditions. In a number of countries, the Bank's sup- port has strengthened the health system bybuilding capacity in national disease controlprograms. In Cambodia, for example, the Disease Control and Health Development Project (1996-2002) strengthened health infrastructure anddecentralized health management,while financing complementary dis-ease control programs for malaria, TB,and HIV/AIDS. Prior to the project, in-ternational donors were operatingcommunicable disease interventionsoutside the framework of government,and capacity was weak. The project funded thegovernment communicable disease programs,enabling the Ministry of Health to fulfill its man-date, while integrating the disease control pro-grams into the health system at the provincialand district levels. Bank support for multiple dis-LESSONS FROM THREE APPROACHES TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES 39Committing to Results: Improving the Effectiveness of HIV/AIDS sup- port through mid-2004.

However, the monitoring systems for com- municable disease programs often exist inparallel to, and are not well linked to, gov-ernment management information systems(MIS). This can lead to duplication and inhibit sharing of data between agencies. However, weak-nesses in the overall health MIS can shake theconfidence of communicable disease control man- agers, who need timely informationfor a rapid response, and such weak-nesses can lead them to maintain sep-arate monitoring systems, as in Ghana(IEG 2007d). This creates, in turn, aheavy burden at the district and servicelevels, which are required to supplyinformation through multiple, over- lapping systems (IEG 2007d). The problem hasbeen overcome in Eritrea, where the NationalMalaria Control Program maintained a paralleldata collection system, and it was reported tothe MIS with little delay. As the Bank and donors enhance their sup- port to systemwide reforms and sectorwideapproaches, there is a risk that the capacitythat has been built in many disease control programs will be lost. The first health SWAp in Bangladesh included plans to integrate the National TB Program(NTP) into the approach, yet neglectedto include the TB indicatorsin 2006b). Supportfor Ghana's health SWAp provided dis-tricts with increased financing to carry out communicable disease activities. But the dis-tricts often did not prioritize communicable dis-ease interventions, assuming that central-levelunits would continue to support them (IEG 2007d).In Egypt, the success of investments in schistoso-miasis control has not been sustained by the HealthReform Project that supported these activities aspart of an integrated basic package (IEG 2008c).In Malawi, there is a concern that the much-neededemphasis on a functioning health system pursuedby the health SWAp maintain the technical strength of disease programs as an important element (El-mendorf and Nankhuni forthcoming). While the World Bank was among the first to step up to increase dramatically HIV/AIDSresources to Africa (fiscal 2001-02), there aresigns that the high level of earmarked dis-ease funds may be creating distortions in therest of the health system. Only about one in five freestanding AIDS projects is in a countrywith more than 50 million people; a third are forcountries with fewer than 5 million people, andhalf of those are for countries with populationsof less than 1 million. In many cases, the Bank isnot the only donor\u2014the Global Fund and PEPFAR,in addition to bilateral funds, are also often pro-viding earmarked funding to a specific disease(Martin 2009). In these cases, there is a risk of ahuge imbalance between investment in commu-nicable diseases (including AIDS and any other ear-marked program) and investment in the rest ofthe health system. A recent study calculated thatHIV/AIDS funding represented from 33 to 45 per-cent of total public and donor health expendi-tures in four African countries. 17The 2007 PER for Malawi reported that HIV/AIDS accounts for asmuch as 60 percent of health expenditures (WorldBank 2007f, p. 89). The problem of distortions created by earmark- ing of external assistance is unlikely to be exten-sive enough in the large countries receiving Banksupport for AIDS, TB, malaria, or other endemicdiseases (such as Bangladesh, Brazil, China, orIndia) to create such difficulties. But two problemsarise with relatively large shares of money ear-marked for disease in the context of a small coun-try. First, the large funds in a small program relativeto the needs of the rest of the system can pullscarce resources\u2014such as nurses or doctors, whoare in short supply\u2014from elsewhere in the healthsystem and reduce services elsewhere in the sys-tem. 18Second, as the availability of IDA money and Bank supervision resources are constrained, it isvery likely that there is competition between free-standing communicable disease projects and proj-ects that support the entire health system in smallcountries. A case in point is Malawi: because ofconstraints in the availability of Bank budget for 40IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION As support to systemwide reforms continues to expand, there is a risk that the capacity that has been built in disease control will be lost.

Despite these risks,the Bank has continued to approve new HIV/AIDSprojects in small countries that receive a lot ofother earmarked foreign aid. In sum, the past decade has seen an enormous increase in the share and absolute amount ofWorld Bank support for communicable diseasecontrol, most of which has been for HIV/AIDS.Communicable disease projects other than forAIDS are more likely to be in large countries, per-form better than the rest of the HNP portfolio, andare generally somewhat less complex. The HIV/AIDS projects are almost all multisectoral and in-volve multiple public sector entities and diversesegments of civil society, in addition to dealing witha highly stigmatized disease. Furthermore, mostare in Sub-Saharan Africa, and many are in smallercountries with a large donor presence. The com-plexity of the support and low capacity haveresulted in lower outcomes. M&E has been in-adequate for most communicable disease sup-port, there is little evidence that the poor havedisproportionately benefitted, and the actual cost-effectiveness of interventions as implementedhas rarely been calculated. There are signs that thehigh level of earmarked disease funds may becreating distortions in the health systems of somesmall countries. Reforming Health Systems There is no internationally accepted modelof how a health system should function;the specific activities or policy content ofhealth reform are context-specific. Generally, however, reform programs are about fundamen-tal changes in structure, incentives, and allocationof resources. Improved efficiency of health caredelivery, coupled with improvements in health sta-tus and reduction in inequities, is often at the coreof health reform programs. Health reform is thusdistinct from efforts to improve outcomes by in-creasing inputs\u2014money, training, salaries, facili-ties, and materials\u2014although increasing inputscan be, and has been, used to leverage and sup- port reforms. About a third of all World Bank HNP proj- ects approved from fiscal 1997 to 2006 hadan objective to reform or restructure thehealth system. These included objectives in- volving health finance, health insur-ance, decentralization, or regulationof or enhancing the role of the privatesector in service delivery. 19Implicitly if not explicitly, most of these projectsaimed to improve the efficiency of thehealth system. 20The share of approved projects with health reform objectives has de-clined by nearly half over time\u2014from 45 percentof approved projects during fiscal 1997-2001 toonly 26 percent in fiscal 2002-06 (figure 3.3). 21The share has declined in all Regions except South Asia,and in Latin America and the Caribbean and Africathe decline is statistically significant. 22 Health reform projects are concentrated inmiddle-income countries. Three-quarters of all health reform projects were in middle-incomecountries and half of all HNP projects in middle-income countries over the decade had healthreform objectives, compared with only18 percent of all projects in low-incomecountries. Health reform is an objectivein about half of the projects in lower-middle-income countries and in 63 percent of the projects in upper-middle-income countries. About two-thirds of theHNP portfolio in Europe and Central Asia and the Middle East and North Africa is comprised ofhealth reform projects, as is 43 percent of projectsin Latin America and the Caribbean. Health reform projects have some- what lower outcomes than do proj-ects without reform objectives inmiddle-income countries, althoughthis difference is not statisticallysignificant. Seventy-one percent of closed projects with health reform ob-jectives in middle-income countries had satisfac-tory outcomes, compared with 86 percent of HNPprojects with other objectives (table 3.1). Theborrower's performance is also slightly lower forhealth reform projects.LESSONS FROM THREE APPROACHES TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES 41About a third of Bank HNP projects had healthsystem reform orrestructuring as anobjective.

Thismeans that the efficacy of the support for the later-stage, more difficult activities is not yet tested inmany instances. However, the varying experi-ence of the countries where IEG has conductedin-depth fieldwork highlights some of the achieve-ments, shortcomings, and lessons to date. Healthreforms are often linked to more general civil ser-vice and administrative reforms across all sec-tors; the obstacles to public sector reforms arein many ways similar to those for health reforms(box 3.3). The Bank supported health system reforms in the Kyrgyz Republic, Peru, and Egypt thatshared some common elements, with dif-ferent outcomes. In all three countries, the re- form strategy called, first, for improving access toand quality of primary health care, which would disproportionately help the poorand reduce the demand for inpatientcare, and for setting up output-based re-imbursements, before attempting morepolitically controversial and technicallychallenging reforms, such as rational-izing hospitals and public sector contracting withthe private sector or reimbursements with the pri-vate sector to deliver services. Implementationand results on improved efficiency were uneven,although health status nevertheless continued toimprove in all three countries. Only in the KyrgyzRepublic, however, is there evidence of efficiencygains and any plausible link of health outcomes toany of the reforms. 28 In the Kyrgyz Republic, the Bank and other donors supported implementation of a home-grown reform agenda: Set up an institution to serve as a single payer for health insurance. Separate the financing of health care from health care delivery.LESSONS FROM THREE APPROACHES TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES 43Bank performance in health reform projects islower than for HNPprojects with otherobjectives. The obstacles to many health system reforms are similar to those blocking improvement in public administration more generally, asare the measures to overcome them. The recent IEG evaluation, Public Sector Reform: What Works and Why? (IEG 2008f) found that activities aimed at strengthened financial management andtax administration were far more effective than those focused oncivil service and administrative improvements. Ministries of fi-nance tended to strongly support this type of reform, which wasusually underpinned by extensive technical analysis, and oftengenerated quickly observable results, expressed in terms of clearpublic expenditure and financial accountability indicators. TheWorld Bank's expertise in these issues is widely recognized. In contrast, measures affecting personnel policies, including downsizing, pay decompression, and merit-based reforms wereparticularly unsuccessful. They often failed because of lack of po-litical commitment, discontinuities in leadership, politicians' re-sistance to measures diluting their control over patronage, andunion opposition. The World Bank's analytical tools are less de- veloped in these fields and, more fundamentally, there is a \"lackof consensus around the 'right' civil service model for developingcountries, or indeed for developed countries.\" (IEG 2008f, p. 54)Basic data are often lacking, and political leaders may not beable to identify tangible benefits. Almost identical language couldbe used to describe health sector reforms entailing changes in or-ganization and personnel policies. Public Sector Reform nevertheless identified six factors as- sociated with comparatively successful administrative reforms:good analysis and diagnosis; pragmatic opportunism in select-ing reforms; realistic expectations; appropriate lending pack-ages (usually including technical assistance); tangible indicatorsof success; and effective donor coordination. Successful majorhealth reform programs, as in the Kyrgyz Republic, feature sim-ilar characteristics.Box 3.3: Shared Themes: Public Sector and Health Systems Reform Source: IEG 2008f. Use output-based financing that pays for ser- vices delivered, rather than line budgets. Increase autonomy for health facilities in budget allocations. Reduce excess inpatient capacity. Adopt a guaranteed package of services. Create a new type of family practice that re- duces resort to specialists, provides more cost-effective primary health care on an outpatientbasis, and serves as a gatekeeper for referralsto higher and more specialized facilities. The share of the population covered by the Mandatory Health Insurance Fund rose from 25to 85 percent and excess inpatient capacity wassignificantly reduced (figure 3.4). Hospitals usedtheir remaining capacity more efficiently, and thequantity and quality of outpatient services in-creased. By 2005, almost 99 percent of the pop-ulation had access to primary health care, and theshare of government health spending on thatcare had risen from 11 to 25 percent. Hemor-rhagic insult among patients with high bloodpressure in one region dropped by three-quarters.Yet, despite Bank intervention and policy dia- logue at key moments, political opponents stillmanaged to block the restructuring of tertiaryhospitals in the two major cities. Private paymentsremained a significant share of health spending.The finance ministry reallocated the savings fromimproved health sector efficiency to other activ-ities, dampening the enthusiasm of health re-formers. Since then, the government has met allcommitments to increase public financing ofhealth. However, low pay scales have led to out-migration of family physicians, jeopardizing theachievements of the reforms. In Peru, the World Bank and Inter-American De- velopment Bank support to the government's re-form program saw a huge expansion in access to a package of basic services among the poorthrough the Integrated Health Insurance (SIS)program, despite significant political changes overthe period. 29Adopted nationwide in 2002, the SIS reimburses Ministry of Health care providers for thevariable costs of the use of services by its benefi-ciaries, increasing the incentives for efficiency. In 44IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Figure 3.4: Excess Inpatient Bed Capacity Declined across the Kyrgyz Republic 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004Hospital beds per 10,000 population 102030405060708090100 Kyrgyz ChuiJalad-Abad Osh Bishkek 2008d.addition, support was provided to expand and im- prove the quality of community-managed healthfacilities, organized under a quasi-private man-agement scheme in which the community partic-ipates. However, the SIS still does not reimburseprivate providers or other public providers andthere are no major new revenues for the system.The extent to which hospital costs have been re-duced is unclear, and ESSALUD, the entity providinginsurance to formal sector workers and their fam-ilies, 30has resisted reforms that would separate funding from service delivery and that would pro-vide better coordination with the Ministry of Health. In Egypt, the Bank, the U.S. Agency for Interna- tional Development (USAID), and the EuropeanCommission have supported a health reform pro-gram over the past decade, with uneven owner-ship by key government players. There has beenprogress in strengthening primary health careand family services and defining a basic packageof primary health care and public health servicesfor universal coverage. However, efforts to trans-form the Health Insurance Organization into asingle-payer plan and to separate finance fromhealth delivery have met opposition from the Min-istry of Health and Population and other entitiesthat want to retain control over finance. Rational-ization of hospitals has not occurred and the sys-tem remains highly fragmented, with nearly twodozen different public or parastatal entities pro-viding and financing health care, as well as over-use of and excess capacity in expensive tertiary care. The most pervasive lesson from the Bank's experience with health reform is that failureto fully assess the political economy of re-form and to prepare a proactive plan to ad-dress this issue can considerably diminishprospects for success. One source of political economy risk is that reforms with high-level sup-port will be abandoned with a change in govern-ment. Among the five countries that undertookhealth reform and were studied in-depth by IEG,four experienced changes in leadership with thepotential to affect the reform agenda (Bangladesh,Egypt, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Peru 31). Given the long period over which reforms to health sys-tems typically take place, the starting assumptionshould be that there will certainly be a change in government or in leadership of the sector that canaffect the ownership of and commitment to re-form. This underscores the importance of gen-erating evidence that reforms work, so they cantranscend a single administration, and of enlistingkey stakeholders in the system who are vested inthe reforms and likely to remain in place. The impact of reforms on the interests and incentives of key stakeholders also consti-tutes a significant political economy risk.Health reform projects create winners and losers;it is important that their interests be understoodfrom the outset. High-level commitment is noguarantee that key stakeholders in the healthsystem or the general public will go along with areform; stakeholders who have a role in imple-menting any reform can simply not cooperate.The general public may perceive that a reductionin excess hospital capacity is reducingtheir access to health care. Even withinan institution, the interests and incen-tives may vary according to whetherthe person is a manager or deliversservices. The Kyrgyz health reform ex-perience was an exception in this re-gard. It was based on a reform strategy that wastotally owned by a group of reformers in the Min-istry of Health and a considerable prior analysisand a strategy for navigating the winners and los-ers. Even then, Bishkek and Osh, the two wealth-iest regions, remain outside the reforms of tertiarycare. The experiences of Bangladesh, Egypt, andRussia are more typical (box 3.4). The political risks and the risk of complex- ity\u2014two of the issues found to be most crit-ical in the case studies\u2014are often missingin the risk analysis for health reform proj-ects. Review of the risk analysis of the appraisal documents for closed health reform projectsapproved since fiscal 1997 found that only 59 per-cent cited risks of a change in government com-mitment to reforms (following turnover in ministrystaff or elections of top leadership), and only 43percent pointed to the risk that specific stake-holders\u2014physicians, hospital managers, patients,managers of decentralized facilities\u2014would beLESSONS FROM THREE APPROACHES TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES 45Failure to assess the political economy ofreform and to plan toaddress it can diminishprospects for success.resistant to or undermine the reforms. The risk of excessive complexity wasmentioned in only 22 percent of theappraisal documents. Overall, only athird of projects with health reformobjectives were assessed at appraisal ashaving substantial or high risks. 32 To have a chance at success, both the po-litical economy risks and complexity needto be taken into account and planned for inhealth reform operations. The projects re- viewed for this evaluation have used a number ofstrategies to deal with these issues: Institutional and stakeholder analyses are essential during the design of the reformsand to inform decisions during implementationabout when to intervene and when not to.Stakeholder consultations can help to flag pos-sible resistance and solutions. Information and outreach to all stake- holders and the public to explain the reforms,the benefits, and how they will be affected.Sequencing of reforms , so that some con- stituencies win up front, before the more dif-ficult choices\u2014on hospital rationalization, forexample\u2014must be decided. Four of the fivecase studies on health reform followed a de-liberately sequenced approach, whereby thefirst step was to improve access to and qualityof outpatient and primary health care, while in most cases introducing changes in the pay-ment system. 33This is also a strategy for avoid- ing complexity, a big problem in health reformprojects. Piloting reforms in specific geographic areas to demonstrate their feasibility and efficacy be-fore they are expanded. The Issyk-Kul regionof the Kyrgyz Republic piloted most reforms,sponsored by USAID, generating interest inother regions. Creating new institutions , like the Manda- tory Health Insurance Fund in Kyrgyz and theSIS in Peru, can often result in less resistancethan attempting to reform existing ones\u2014suchas ESSALUD and the health care units of thearmed forces and the national police in Peru or 46IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION The Bangladesh Health and Population Program (1998-2005), which involved many donors in a sectorwide operation, soughtto merge the Health and Family Planning Directorates within theMinistry of Health and Family Welfare, starting from the subdis-trict level and moving downward, a reform to improve efficiency.While some family planning workers were pleased to become reg-ular public employees through this reform, mid-level workersfeared that their jobs would be abolished and took their case tothe Supreme Court. The government won the lawsuit, but the im-plementation of the reform had been delayed and unificationwas reversed by a new government. Other proposed reforms inthe project were tainted by association. In Egypt, there was high-level commitment and participatory analytic work from the Minister of Health and Population forhealth reforms in the mid-1990s, but the incentives of nearly twodozen other public and parastatal providers of health care werenot taken into account. The ministry would have lost control overfinancial resources with a single payer arrangement; it therefore welcomed investment in primary health care, but resisted re-forming the Health Insurance Organization. The insurance reformswere subsequently dropped from the Health Reform Project,while expansion of family health services continued. The Russia Health Reform Pilot Project (1997-2004) aimed to make changes in two regions. It was to introduce output-driven,cost-conscious provider payment mechanisms, accompanied byinformation-based quality assurance, and to reorient health careby strengthening primary and outpatient care, centered on a net-work of family physicians, and reducing inpatient care services.The new models were not uniformly implemented; where intro-duced, they coexisted with the old and had little staying power.Family practitioners were trained, their offices equipped, and astandard Russian family medicine curriculum developed, but ob-stetrics, gynecology, and maternal and child health were ex-cluded because of the influence of specialists in those fields.

Political risks and complexity are often missing in the risk analysis of health reform projects.the Health Insurance Organization in Egypt, which was eventually dropped from the project. Complementary programmatic lending with the finance ministry has helped some- times to maintain momentum when imple-mentation of reforms through health sectorinvestments has flagged, as in the Kyrgyz Re-public and Peru (box 3.5). The implementa-tion of health reform may be piecemeal, but theBank can help ensure support that extends be-yond a specific project. The Programmatic SocialReform Projects in Peru were effective in main-taining the reform agenda, despite the politicalcycle. Eliciting the participation of stakeholders can be important for ownership of reforms,but it is still necessary to prioritize. In Ban- gladesh, there was wide stakeholder partici-pation in defining the Essential Service Package,with the 1993 World Development Report as back- ground. However, the final package was a wish list that was not prioritized, was not technically and financially feasible, and was not based onBangladesh-specific data. 34The Russia Health Re- form Pilot project identified two pilot regionsbased on their indicated interests. This strength-ened ownership, but each region proposed manydifferent reform activities, increasing complexityand the likelihood of incomplete reforms. Further,the project involved multiple layers of governmentand a large number of separate health and healthpolicy challenges. 35Reforms based on careful prior analyticwork and evidence relevant to the countryin question hold a greater chance of success,but analytic work does not ensure success.The reform projects in Peru 36and the Kyrgyz Re- public37both benefited from extensive Bank- sponsored analytic work that helped to ensure thatthe reform agenda was technically sound and en-couraged ownership by the technical stakehold-ers. In Egypt, analytic work sponsored by the Bankand USAID included stakeholder and institutionalanalyses. However, in the case of Egypt, this couldnot compensate for the absence of a local reformteam with the willingness, technical capacity, andpolitical support to lead the process. 38 M&E are critical for implementing andmonitoring health reforms and for demon-strating impact, but the record of Bank-supported health reform projects in actuallyevaluating pilot activities is weak. There was no evaluation design for the activitiespiloted in the Russia Health ReformPilot Project; there was no basis for de-cisions for wider replication. Nor wasthere any evaluation design for thehealth reforms supported in specificregions of Peru. Strong and consistent M&E isimportant\u2014first, for understanding whether theproposed reforms will work, given that they involvechanging the incentives for both providers and pa-tients. Thus, most of the projects first launch re-forms in pilot regions.

Stakeholder participation can be important, but it is still necessary toprioritize.results, successful reforms can be expanded more broadly. Evaluation of pilot reforms and rapid dis-semination of results can also demonstrate toskeptics that the reforms are feasible, weakeningpolitical resistance. The lessons of USAID's pilotreform activities in the Issyk-Kul region of the Kyr-gyz Republic were fully incorporated into the de-sign of the first Health Reform Project, and thedemonstration effect of that region encouragedother regions to accelerate reforms. As discussed in chapter 2, however, the Bank's recordof ensuring that pilot and reform proj-ects include rigorous evaluation is weak. T o summarize, about a third of Bank projects sup- port health reform objectives, mainly in middle-income countries. The share of projects withhealth reform objectives has been in decline. Theoutcomes of health reform projects and the Bank'sperformance are lower than for other HNP proj-ects. This is an area with a lot of risk\u2014political andtechnical\u2014but nevertheless highly relevant. Manylessons have been learned. T wo of the most im-portant of these, which should affect future per-formance, are the need to carefully assess thepolitical risks beforehand\u2014including the interestsand incentives of key stakeholders\u2014and to try tominimize complexity. Sectorwide Approaches In 1995, the World Bank defined and pro-moted a new approach to lending to addresschronic problems in implementing healthprojects. These problems included insufficient local ownership and commitment; the lack of anynoticeable trickle-down effect from some proj-ects; low sustainability of benefits after initial im- plementation; confusion and dissipationof effort caused by the approaches sup-ported by different donors; excessive ex-patriate technical assistance personnel;the weakening of government capacityby the proliferation of donor-financedproject units; and unsatisfactory results from some adjustment operations in the allocationof public expenditure (Harrold and others 1995).The term sector investment program was coined, encompassing six principles of sound project de-velopment that supported a \"broad sector ap-proach to lending.\" A sector investment program had to be: Sectorwide in scope, covering all current and capital expenditures Based on a clear sector strategy and policy framework Run by local stakeholders, including govern- ment, direct beneficiaries, and representativesof the private sector Adopted and financed by all main donors Based in common implementation arrange- ments among all financiers Reliant on local capacity, rather than on tech- nical assistance, for implementation. Two years later this approach was relabeled a \"Sectorwide Approach,\" or SWAp, at ameeting of donor agencies (box 3.6), but the principles remained the same. 39The anticipated benefits from the approach included: greatercountry ownership and leadership in managinghealth support; improved coordination and over-sight of the technical and financial inputs of allpartners; strengthened country capacities andsystems for strategic sector management, fiduci-ary functions, and implementation arrangements; 48IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION The Sectorwide Approach, or SWAp, was developed between 1995 and 1997; the Bank was a major proponent.During the 1990s, the concept of a programwide ap- proach was discussed at a forum on health sector re-form chaired by WHO with the active participation of Ghana, Zambia, and other partners. This led to thefirst meeting of several countries and developmentpartners to discuss the approach in 1997. Cohosted by the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the World Bank, the meeting coined the term\"sectorwide approach\" and reached a consensuson two follow-up actions: (a) to commission a SWApguide for the health sector and (b) to create an Inter-Agency Group to foster learning and promotion ofSWAps, with WHO as the chair and with the activeparticipation of partners and developing countries. Source: Vaillancourt forthcoming.Box 3.6: of the Sectorwide Approach in An InternationalConsensus M&E are critical in health reform projects.reduced transaction costs; more efficient use of development assistance; more reliable support forthe health sector strategy; and greater sustain-ability of health programs. Ultimately, the ap-proach, through its support of national healthpolicies and programs, was to contribute to im-provements in health sector performance andsustained improvements in people's health. 40 The SWAp concept represented a fundamentalchange in the focus, relationship, and behavior ofdevelopment partners and government\u2014a re-form in the relationship between governmentand development partners and among the part-ners. The specific health policies and programssupported by this approach depend on the con-tent of the national sector strategy, which variesgreatly across countries. World Bank and otherdonor support for a SWAp can be financed in anumber of different ways\u2014through parallelproject-specific financing, 41pooled financing,42 general budget support to the finance ministry, ora combination of these. Between fiscal 1997 and 2006, the World Bank approved 28 HNP projects supportinghealth SWAps in 22 countries. 43Thus, in the decade following the launch of the approach,about 13 percent of all approved HNP projects sup-ported a SWAp. The World Bank project approvalscame in two spurts\u2014immediately after the 1997meeting, followed by a two-year pause, and thenmore projects approved in fiscal years 2003-06 (fig-ure 3.5). T wo-thirds of the projects that supportedhealth SWAps were in Sub-Saharan Africa. Supportfor health SWAps is mainly found in low-incomecountries, accounting for nearly a quarter of HNPprojects approved in those countries, comparedwith only 6 percent of those in lower-middle-income countries, and none in upper-middle-income countries. 44In 71 percent of the projects, Bank resources were pooled with those of gov-ernment and other donors. 45 The assessment of the Bank's support forhealth SWAps addresses three questions.First, were the benefits of the approach realized, in terms of better donor harmonization and co-ordination, reduced transaction costs, capacitybuilding, and so forth? Second, were the objectives of the health strategies supported by government and devel-opment partners achieved? Third, inwhat ways did channeling supportthrough a SWAp affect the efficacy ofthe Bank's support, including its ability to conductpolicy dialogue? A desk-based portfolio reviewof all Bank-supported SWAps approved in fiscal1997-2006, including 11 completed operations,and fieldwork in five countries (table 3.2) serveas a basis to answer these questions. Benefits of the Approach The objectives, anticipated benefits, and spe-cific mechanisms of the SWAp approach arenot clearly articulated and often not dis-cussed in the Bank's project ap-praisal documents. These documents usually deal with the substance of healthprograms and policies. There tend to bea lot of process indicators that implic-itly convey what the objectives of an-ticipated benefits were, and they aregenerally consistent with the SWAp fea-tures described in the literature.LESSONS FROM THREE APPROACHES TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES 49Over the period fiscal 1997-2006, the Bankapproved support for 28health SWAps in 22countries.Figure 3.5: After an Initial Spurt, Growth in World Bank Support for Health SWAps Resumed after 2002 400 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 350 250 200 150 100 50 0 1997 1998 1999 2000 Fiscal year approved 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 300 Commitments (US$ millions) Number of projects 140 29 0 0 0165 260 244 371 376 Commitments Number of projects Source: Vaillancourt forthcoming. The objectives, anticipated benefits, andspecific mechanisms ofthe SWAp approach arenot clearly articulatedand often are notdiscussed in appraisaldocuments.Country capacity has been strength- ened in the areas of sector plan-ning, budgeting, management, andfiduciary systems. Resources are used to finance an explicit Program ofWork linked to the national strategy; an- nual or semi-annual joint review meetings of na-tional and external partners are held for planning,programming, budgeting, resource allocation,and monitoring of progress in implementation andachievement of objectives. Governments havebeen enabled to exercise greater leadership in di-recting the use of development partner resourcesand conducting and coordinating the dialogue. In the Kyrgyz Republic , the SWAp has resulted in greater delegationof planning and decision making tostaff at the levels of department headand below within the central min-istry, and from central to decentral-ized levels. Fiduciary strengtheningin the health sector has begun toinfluence the overall governance ofthe country. 46 In Bangladesh , line directors prepare annual op- erational plans and budgets, and all funding is on budget, 47in contrast with the previous arrangement of disparate, multiple projectsmanaged by project directors who would bypassline managers. All national procurement is nowhandled by government, where previously it wasprovided by, among others, UN agencies. In Nepal, the SWAp has helped to consolidate and coordinate dispersed donor assistance.Budgeting and financial processes within theSWAp account for government, pooled, andnonpooled resources, but attempts to improvefinancial management under the SWAp have encountered some obstacles that are gov-ernmentwide and difficult to address (Shawforthcoming). Government capacity for procurement and financial management in Ghana was developed at central, regional, and district levels, enablingthe consolidated management of the publicbudget and pooled financing. However, spend-ing is not always consistent with sector priori-ties and the poverty focus articulated in theProgram of Work. Nor is spending routinelymonitored or allocations adjusted to achievegreatest impact. I n Malawi , however, health stewardship and governance is weak, aside from the structuredarrangements for cooperation with develop-ment partners. The use of government fiduci-ary systems in the health SWAp was ruled out;World Bank policies and procedures are fol-lowed for all pooled funding, and the Bankissues no-objections on the use of all pooledfunds. Donors have continued project financ-ing outside of the pool. 48In contrast, the HIV/AIDS SWAp enjoys a higher level of confi-dence of donors, due in part to the stronger ca-pacity of AIDS institutions, compared with theMinistry of Health\u2014a result of the ability of theHIV/AIDS SWAp to attract the best people, in-cluding those from the Ministry. Weaknesses persist in the design of M&E and in the use of country M&E systems. All of the countries supported have instituted peri-odic joint reviews of health-sector performanceusing a common set of indicators, with datagenerated increasingly from the countries' healthmanagement information systems. However, withthe exception of Kyrgyz, the national strategies and programs are not underpinned by a well-developed M&E framework. For the most part, theresults chain of the strategies and programs is notfully articulated. In Ghana, for example, the M&Eplan, strategy, methodology, roles, and responsi- 50IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Table 3.2: HNP Projects Supporting Health SWAps in IEG Country Cases or Project Evaluations The performance of SWAps in reducing transaction costs cannot be assessed because they have not been monitored.Country capacity in the health sector has been strengthened through the approach.Country Project Bangladesh Health and Population Program (1998-2005) HNP Sector Program (2005-10) Ghana Health Sector Support (1997-2002) Health Sector Support II (2003-07) Kyrgyz Republic Health and Social Protection (2005-11) Nepal Health Sector Program ( 2004-10)Malawi Multisectoral AIDS (2003-08) Health Sector Support (2004-08) Source: World Bank data.

In Senegal and other countries, baselinedata were outdated or missing. Duplication ofM&E and reporting has been reduced in Nepal andthe health management information system is ofgood quality and reliable, but information andsystems are scattered, making it difficult to as-semble a coherent picture of the evolution ofoutputs and how they relate to outcomes. 49 The performance of SWAps in reducingtransaction costs\u2014a major anticipated ben-efit of the approach\u2014cannot be assessedin any country because they have not beenmonitored. In fieldwork, IEG was unable to compile any data measuring transaction costs be-fore and after adoption of a SWAp, for the gov-ernment or for donors. Nor do there appear to beany studies of staff time allocations across tasksin government or by the development partnersbefore and after adoption of a SWAp. Efficiencygains were mentioned in interviews with publicsector officials, citing the reduction in the num-ber of individual donors, missions, and projects;the reduction in reporting requirements; and theconsolidation of M&E as good steps. However,high transaction costs were mentioned in asso-ciation with the time and expense of preparing forjoint review meetings. The allocation of time of development partner staff since the launch of the approach is not re-garded as entirely efficient. Some partners continueto micromanage, while in other cases there is a mis-match between the partner's skills (for example,generalists or health experts) and the needs of the SWAp (financial management, M&E, amongothers). World Bank supervision costs for theBangladesh SWAp were one-third of pre-SWAp lev-els because fewer Bank staff and more partnerswent on joint missions. In contrast, in the KyrgyzRepublic, Bank supervision costs are reported tobe very high because of the high transaction costsof collaborating and communicating with otherpartners, oversight of procurement and financialmanagement, and investments in capacity building.HNP Outcomes under Health SWAps There are countries where progress is being madeboth in achieving the objectives of the SWAp ap-proach and in improving HNP outcomes. TheT anzania health SWAp, supported by the HealthSector Development Project, was favorably eval-uated by a joint external evaluation financed bythe international donor community and had sat-isfactory outcomes (COWI, Gilroy, andEPOS 2007). Health outcomes con-tinue to improve in Nepal, although itis not clear whether they should be at-tributed to health policy, the SWAp,both, or neither. However, achieving the objectives of the approach has not always ensured betterhealth outcomes. The implementation andefficacy of the policies supported by theapproach are key. For example, during the 10 years of Ghana's health SWAp, despite the in-creased use of country systems and better har-monization and coordination of donors, therewere no improvements in health status indicators(figure 3.6), nor were there significant improve-ments in health sector performance, such asassisted deliveries, that might have con-tributed to better outcomes. Ineffi-ciencies in the health sector persistbecause of duplication and rivalrybetween the Ministry of Health andthe Ghana Health Service, an issue thatthe development partners and gov-ernment have not been able to resolve.Substantial investment in the SWApprocess, suboptimal allocation of resources, 50in- adequate flows of funds to the districts, and fail-ure to resolve key impediments to service deliverywere all factors affecting performance in Ghana.Only 4 of the 11 closed projects supporting healthSWAps had satisfactory outcomes in terms ofachieving their relevant program objectives. The approach can have adverse effects on outcomes in the short run: setting up aSWAp can be disruptive, diverting time andenergy from the achievement of results.There is evidence from Bangladesh, Ethiopia,Ghana, Mali, and Senegal that in the short run,LESSONS FROM THREE APPROACHES TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES 51There has been progress in achieving the objectives ofthe SWAp approach andimproving HNP outcomesin several countries. Achieving better health outcomes, however,depends on theimplementation andefficacy of the policiessupported by theapproach.the process can take priority over re- sults. In Bangladesh, despite the longhistory of working with a consortiumof donors, there was disruption withthe formal adoption of a SWAp. How-ever, in Kyrgyz there was a longstand- ing and productive working relationship amongexperts in government and between governmentexperts and the donors' trust, and the SWAp for-malized what was already happening. Beyondthe short-run disruption, it is difficult to tellwhether the improved coordination, ownership,and other reforms in foreign aid introduced by theSWAp have had any long-run impact on the qual-ity or efficacy of health programs. This remainsa hypothesis. SWAps have often supported overly ambitious programs of work, in-volving many complex reformsand activities that exceed govern-ment implementation capacity. Ex-amples of the types of activities found in the pro- grams of work of countries such as Ethiopia, Mau-ritania, Senegal, and T anzania include: delivery ofa basic package of essential health services; reor-ganization and decentralization of services; re-defining the role of the central Ministry of Health;contracting with the nongovernmental sectors;hospital reform; new supply- and demand-sideservice delivery mechanisms; health financing;and cost-sharing. All of these are in addition to the challenging capacity building and reforms indevelopment partner relationships inherent in aSWAp. Guidance for reasonable sequencing andimplementation that would make such reformsfeasible is often absent. The result is that noteverything gets done, the higher-priority inter-ventions are neglected, and outcomes are belowexpectations. Impact of the Approach on the Bank's Effectiveness In the operations that IEG studied, the Bank has often been instrumental in getting otherdevelopment partners to pool resources ; the donors who pool generally have a seat at the tablein the policy dialogue (Vaillancourt forthcoming).The Bank has played a crucial role in supportingnational capacities and systems for financial man-agement, procurement, and other fiduciary as-pects of the SWAps within the health sector. The Bank has not withdrawn from policy di- alogue under the SWAp, but there is a riskthat consensus decisions among develop-ment partners and government will inhibitstrategic choices and the setting of priori-ties, areas in which the Bank has often pro-vided valued support to improve the efficacyof health policy. The SWAp implies ceding lead- ership and decision making to government andreducing the bilateral relationship with govern-ment in favor of collaborative partnerships withdevelopment partners. But the partners collec-tively may not have the will to intervene. In Ghana,for example, the partners were unsuccessful inpressing the government to address duplicationof services between the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Health Services, although inaction in 52IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Setting up a SWAp can divert time and energies from delivering on substance. SWAPs often supported overly ambitious programs that exceeded the capacity of government to implement.Figure 3.6: Neither Mortality nor Fertility Declined during the 10 Years of Ghana's Health SWAp 200 Second Health and Population Project 1991-97Health Sector Support Program 1998-2002Health Sector Support Program 2003-07 150 100 50 0 1988 1993 1998 2003 2006 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Deaths per 1,000 live births Total fertility rate119 108 111 111 77 66 576471155 6.4 5.5 4.64.4 4.4 Under 5 IMR Fertility Sources for 1988-2003: Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys.

They may also merely continue to press for their own priorities within the SWAp. Aides-memoire for joint review meetings often repre-sent an amalgam of the priorities of each of theparticipating development partners. There is often not a clear understanding beforehand of the decision-making rules among individual development partnersand between the partners and the govern-ment, in the event that the government re-verses or does not act on agreed-upon policy.This leads to ambiguity with respect to how theBank should act. In the case of Bangladesh, thedevelopment partners were split on how to reactto the government's decision not to merge fam-ily planning and health services within the Min-istry of Health and Family Welfare in the face ofpolitical pressure. The partners were divided onthe appropriate response; the Bank, supported bysome of the partners, temporarily stopped dis-bursements, trying to force something that wasnot politically feasible, an action that was shortlyreversed. In contrast, in Nepal, a politically drivenpolicy decision was made to provide free basic careto all that would have serious repercussions onhealth finance. In response, the Bank and otherpartners are supporting analytical work to docu-ment the cost and equity implications of the newpolicy, as a contribution to the Ministry of Healthstrategy on sustainable financing. For most of the SWAps studied by this evaluation, the rules for resolving disagreements are still some-what ambiguous, which does have implications forthe efficacy of the Bank's support and its ability to engage government andthe partners on critical policy issuesthat have not achieved a consensus.Memoranda of understanding remaintoo general and have not provided the guidanceneeded during times of fundamental disagree-ment on policy. T o summarize, SWAps implicitly have two types of objectives\u2014those of the approach, and thoseof the program supported by the approach.Certain anticipated benefits of the approach sup-ported by the Bank are being realized\u2014strength-ened country sector capacity to plan budgeting,management, and fiduciary systems, and greatercountry leadership in setting the direction of thesector\u2014but weaknesses persist in M&E of theapproach and the programs. One majoranticipated benefit of the approach\u2014reduced transaction costs\u2014has notbeen systematically monitored, butfield visits suggest that transaction costsin some instances remain high. Therules for resolving differences amongdonors and between donors and gov-ernment are not well articulated and have led tofriction in some cases and a lack of prioritization.T o date, there is little evidence that the approachby itself has had additional positive impacts on theeffectiveness of the overall sectoral program andpolicies. Even while adopting these reforms inworking relationships, it is important for the pro-gram to support the right things, that it be prop-erly implemented, and that the focus on resultsbe maintained. LESSONS FROM THREE APPROACHES TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES 53Participation in SWAps has not meant awithdrawal from policydialogue. But there often is not a clear understanding ofthe decision-making rulesamong the partners andbetween the partners andthe government.Chapter 4 Evaluation Highlights The CAS has helped identify the key sectors that affect HNP , but has notbrought those other sectors to bear onHNP outcomes, nor has it documentedor monitored their contributions. The efficacy of multisectoral HNP projects hinges on prioritizing sectorsin the face of limited implementationcapacity and ensuring strong coor-dination of activities. The potential for Bank support for water supply and sanitation andtransport to contribute to health out-comes and the health MDGs is great,but the incentives to deliver health re-sults and a poverty focus are weak. Results are more likely when the health objectives are made explicitand when targets and monitorableindicators are included for retrofittedhealth components.Girls from Kuje village in Abuja, Nigeria, demonstrate how to wash hands with soap and clean water.

Second, what has been the experi-ence of multisectoral HNP lending operations\u2014that is, HNP projects multiple sectorsin a single operation\u2014in improving HNP out-comes? Finally, what has been the contribution oflending in other sectors\u2014in particular, water sup-ply and sanitation and transport\u2014in achievinghealth benefits? Intersectoral Approaches in Country Assistance Strategies The CAS is the business plan that guides World Bank Group activities in a member country en-gaged in borrowing or is receiving grant funding.Management and the Board use the CAS to reviewand guide the Bank Group's country programsand to judge the impact of its work. IEG reviewed137 CASs approved between fiscal 1997 and 2006with respect to their use as an instrument to en-sure that actions from other sectors are broughtto bear on HNP outcomes. 2Over the past decade, the CAS has fallenshort of its promise of coordinating andbringing to bear the actions of multiple sec-tors on HNP outcomes. Three-quarters of CASs acknowledged the contribution of other sectorsto HNP outcomes, and about half proposed amultisectoral lending strategy for HNP (figure4.1). 3Water supply and sanitation was the sector most often cited as having an impact on HNPoutcomes, followed by education and the envi-ronment. The two main multisectoral lendingstrategies to improve health outcomes involved,first, financing projects in sectors that are com-plementary to health (41 percent of CASs), and,second, financing multisectoral HNP projects thattied the actions of many sectors into a single lending operation (18 percent of CASs). 4Most of the CASs proposing multisectoral HNP projectsplanned a multisectoral HIV/AIDS project (12 per-cent of CASs). However, almost none of the CASsthat incorporated complementary lending byother sectors proposed any specific HNP targetsor common management arrangements, or ex-plained what form of coordination with the HNPsector was envisaged. 5Recognizing that it takes more than health services to improve HNP out- comes, the 2007 HNP strategy calls for leveraging interventions inother sectors to deliver results. 1One of the five strategic directions of the strategy is to strengthen Bank capacity to advise countries on an intersectoralapproach to HNP results. The proposed vehicle for coordinating sectors tomaximize impact on health outcomes is the CAS. There was little evidence in the CAS Completion Reports (CASCRs)that multisectoral collaborationor tracking of outcomes arosefrom the multisectoral approaches.Eighteen of the 19 completed CASsfor which a completion report hadbeen written had proposed a multi-sectoral approach to HNP outcomes. While in most cases the proposed lending waswholly or partly implemented, there was littlemention in the completion reports of the resultsof health components in the complementarylending, and in most of these the health com-ponents were dropped. Only in one CAS, forMali (fiscal 2004), were health indicators tracked\u2014in that case to assess the impact of safe water on cholera incidence. It was unclear in any of the CASCRs whether collaboration across sec-tors occurred to achieve HNP outcomes. Even inMali, the CASCR commented that sectoral staffworked independently, which was attributed toinsufficient incentives to work in cross-sectoralteams. This lack of intersectoral coordination in most of the CASs completed to date does notdetract from the fact that investments in other sectors can have important impacts onHNP outcomes, even without coordination.This was shown in IEG's evaluation of maternaland child health outcomes in Bangladesh (IEG2005b). That study concluded that improvementsin access to safe water accounted for a quarter ofthe decline in stunting, and that increased levelsof female secondary education supported by theBank had an impact on reducing infant and childmortality that was independent of health pro-grams. The 2007 HNP strategy points to the po-tential of better coordination and synergy throughthe CAS, beyond what might have been achievedwithout such coordination. Multisectoral Health, Nutrition, and Population Lending One strategy for bringing to bear the contribution of other sectors to HNP outcomes is through as-signing responsibility for those contributions ina single multisectoral lending operation. This sec-tion reviews in greater depth the rationale andperformance of the multisectoral part of the HNP-managed lending portfolio, drawing on the resultsfrom IEG's in-depth portfolio review of projectsapproved from fiscal 1997 to 2006. 58IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Figure 4.1: Multisectoral Approaches to HNP in Country Assistance Strategies 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Acknowledege multisectoral links to HNPPropose multisectoral lending strategy Propose lending other sectors Propose multisectoral HNP projects . . . of which HIV/AIDS projects Common targeting across sectors Common management of parallel operations Percent of CASs 75 49 18 12 2 1 41 Source: Sinha and Gaubatz 2009. Though three-quarters of CASs acknowledged the contribution of other sectors to HNP outcomes, almost none included coordinated, complementary lending by other sectors.More than a third of the HNP-managed proj- ects approved between fiscal 1997 and 2006(38 percent) were managed or implementedby more than one ministry or agency in theborrowing country. Nearly two-thirds of mul- tisectoral projects projects in nutrition,health (multisectoral components), water sup-ply and sanitation, early childhood developmentand multisectoral social sector lending, (figure4.2). Compared with the rest of the HNP portfo-lio, multisectoral projects were more likely tohave objectives to improve health or nutritionstatus or to change behavior. They were less likelyto have objectives of improving the access to orquality of health care, reforming or decentralizingthe health system, or to have poverty-targetedobjectives. The share of HNP multisectoral projects dou- bled in 10 years, from a quarter to nearly halfof all projects. This increase is attributable to a growing number of multisectoral HIV/AIDS proj-ects. The share of non-HIV multisectoral remained constant, at 14 percent, while theshare of multisectoral HIV projects tripled, from 11to 35 percent (figure 4.3). Multisectoral projects aremore common in low-income countries (45 per-cent of all HNP projects) than in middle- income countries (35 percent). Re-gionally, more than half of projects inAfrica, a third in East Asia and LatinAmerica, and a quarter in South Asiaare multisectoral (figure 4.4). Multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS projects comprised45 percent of all HNP projects approved in Africa,while about a third of all projects approved in EastAsia were non-AIDS multisectoral projects. The main rationale for involving several sectors in managing or implementing theseprojects is their complementarity in pro-ducing health outcomes. The choice of sectors is based on the perceived or demonstrated com-parative advantages in relation to the outcome inquestion. Early child development, for example,may involve both learning opportunities andproper health and nutrition. Nutrition objectivesmay require inputs from health, agriculture, oreven industry (in the case of salt iodization).There are many examples of collaboration be-tween the education and health ministries to pro-mote health education in the schools.

Some health sup-port is multisectoral because more thanone key ministry is involved in healthcare delivery or reform\u2014the Ministryof Health and the social security agency, for example. In these instances, there may ormay not be any implied synergy; the multisectoraloperation may simply be packaging activities forseparate entities, intending to work in parallel. There are two distinct justifications for multisec- toral design offered for HIV/AIDS projects. The firstis based on the notion of sectoral expertise andcomparative advantage to address an issue\u2014forexample, enlisting the Ministry of Defense forHIV/AIDS prevention in the military, the Ministryof Justice for HIV/AIDS in prisons, the Ministry ofEducation for HIV/AIDS education in the schools,and the Ministry of Social Welfare to care fororphans. This is similar to the argument for othermultisectoral projects, and achieving the objectivewould require generating working relationshipsand intersectoral collaboration between these agencies and the Ministry of Health. The secondrationale is essentially mobilization: becauseHIV/AIDS affects all sectors of the economy, all sec-tors must be involved in its prevention and miti-gation. 6This rationale leads to the involvement of large numbers of ministries and public agencies,irrespective of their sectoral mandate or expert-ise, with or without the collaboration of the Min-istry of Health. Most HIV/AIDS projects were managed by re- cently established multisectoral experience in cross-ministerialcoordination. projects not pertaining to HIV/AIDS are man-aged entirely or partly by the Ministry of Health,while two-thirds of multisectoral HIV/AIDS proj-ects are managed by an entity under the presidentor prime minister, or by the Ministries of Finance,Economy, or Planning (table 4.1). Only 36 percentof multisectoral AIDS projects rely on Ministrymanagement exclusively, or in collaboration withanother ministry.

Multisectoral projects are more demand- ing of institutions and require a greater de-gree of coordination. In 90 percent of the multisectoral projects, at least one implementingagency\u2014and as many as six\u2014was explicitly iden-tified, and in most cases the activities that the agen-cies were accountable for were clearly spelledout. 8The multisectoral HIV/AIDS projects had fewer assigned implementing agencies (1.3 agen-cies, on average) than did the other multisec-toral HNP projects (2.8 agencies, on average),but this is deceptive. More than half of multisectoral projects also had a demand-driven element at the ministerial level:ministries not explicitly identified beforehandcan submit funding proposals to achieve theproject's overall objectives. Some of the PADsestimate the total number of ministries or agen-cies that will likely be involved, with a range offrom 1 to 20. For eight HIV/AIDS projects, therewere no assigned implementation agencies; all multisectoral implemen-tation came from the demand-drivencomponent. T aking into account both the explicitly identified implementing agencies andthe anticipated number involved in de-mand-driven ministerial components,multisectoral HIV/AIDS projects hadtwice as many implementing agencies(about 6, ranging from 0 to 20), as did other mul-tisectoral HNP projects (about 3, ranging from 1to 6; figure 4.5). Yet even this is an understatement.A third of the HIV/ AIDS projects with demand-driven components did not set a maximum num-ber of implementing agencies; the ultimate num-ber and their activities are determined duringimplementation. The ability to deal with this complexity was often weak. Among the closed projects, inef- fective multisectoral coordination was cited as acontributing factor to low outcomes in 10 unsat-isfactory projects, while effective multisectoralcoordination was cited as contributing to 2 satis-THE CONTRIBUTION OF OTHER SECTORS TO HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION OUTCOMES 61Most non-AIDS multisectoral projects are managed by Distribution of Multisectoral by Management and Implementation Arrangements Total HIV/AIDS Non-AIDS Multisectoral management or implementation Number Percent Number Percent Number Percent Managed by an entity directly under the president or prime minister and implemented by the Ministry of Health and/or other sectors 31 (37) 30 (57) 1 (3) Managed by the Ministry of Health but implemented by other sectors 29 (35) 16 (30) 13 (42) Managed by the Ministry of Finance, Economy, or Planning but implemented by the Ministry of Health or other sectors 11 (13) 4 (8) 7 (23) Managed and implemented by more than one ministry (one of which is the Ministry of Health) 9 (11) 3 (6) 6 (19) Managed by another ministry, implemented by the Ministry of Health 4 (5) 0 (0) 4 (13) Total 84 (100) 53 (100) 31 (100) Source: IEG portfolio review.

Evidence from IEG field assess-ments of multisectoral projects in Eritrea andGhana contrasts a project design that encour-aged intersectoral collaboration with the Ministryof Health with one that mobilized a large numberof actors with less Ministry oversight and collab-oration (box 4.2). Multisectoral projects had lower outcomes than did other HNP proj-ects, but this is mainly because ofthe lower performance of HIV/AIDS projects. Fewer than half of the multisectoral projects approved andcompleted during fiscal 1997-2006 had satisfactory outcomes, compared with about two-thirds of single-sector projects (figure 4.6). 10Bank and borrower performance were also lower formultisectoral HNP projects, although the differ-ence for borrower performance is not statisti-cally significant. However, the performance of non-AIDS multisectoral projects was similar tothat of single-sector HNP projects, while the mul-tisectoral HIV/AIDS projects performed at muchlower level. Both types of multisectoral HNP proj- ects had lower institutional development impact(IDI) than other HNP projects: only 43 percent ofprojects had substantial or high IDI, comparedwith 61 percent for single-sector HNP projects. 11 In sum, multisectoral projects are inherently moredemanding, and their share in the HNP portfoliohas doubled, almost wholly due to the increasein HIV/AIDS project approvals. Multisectoral HNPprojects with objectives other than HIV/AIDS per-form at levels similar to projects in the rest of theHNP portfolio, but multisectoral HIV/AIDS proj-ects do not. The large number of sectors involved,the lack of specificity in design documents aboutthe roles and responsibilities of each participat-ing sector, the relatively new institutions asked tomanage the complex design, and the other factorsthat bring about lower performance in the AfricaRegion likely all contribute to lower outcomesfor these projects. 62IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION The lower performance of HIV/AIDS projects drove down the outcomes of multisectoral projects as a group.Figure 4.5: Distribution of Multisectoral HNP Projects by the Number of Assigned and Demand-Driven Implementing Agencies Number of projects10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 012345 Total number of assigned and demand-driven implementing agencies6 7 9 10 >10 Other multisectoral Multisectoral HIV Source: IEG portfolio review.In 2008, the Bank's Quality Assurance Group (QAG) issued an assessment of quality at entry of the lend- ing portfolio approved in fiscal 2006-07, highlightingresults for multisectoral projects.

Box 4.1: Quality-at-Entry for Multisectoral Projects Is WeakHealth in the Lending Portfolios of Other Sectors Since 1997, the World Bank has committed $5.0 billion in the form of 350 HNP compo-nents of projects managed by other sectors.In contrast to the part of the portfolio managed bythe HNP sector, which is relatively flat, approval ofprojects in other sectors with HNP components isgrowing, while the size of the components is rel-atively small\u2014amounting to only 30 percent of allHNP commitments since 1997 (figure 4.7). Thispart of the portfolio has grown steadily and steeplysince 1988 and reflects lending for social funds, 12 initiated in fiscal 1989, and of poverty reductionsupport credits (PRSCs), begun in fiscal 2001. Until2001, almost all projects with HNP componentswere investment projects; since then, the major-ity have been development policy lending. 13The efficacy of these HNP components is not easilyassessed unless they reflect explicit objectives forwhich the projects are accountable. IEG evalu-ated social funds in 2002, 14and an ongoing eval- uation of PRSCs will look at the adequacy of theseinstruments for achieving HNP results (box 4.3). This section examines in greater depth the extent to which lending in two key sectors\u2014water sup-ply and sanitation and transport\u2014has been used to improve HNP outcomes. The selection of thesetwo sectors for evaluation is illustrative, becausethere are many others with large, demonstratedTHE CONTRIBUTION OF OTHER SECTORS TO HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION OUTCOMES 63Experience from two communicable disease projects suggests that the complexity and efficacy of multisectoral projects can beimproved by enlisting a smaller number of priority sectors and bystronger collaboration with the Ministry of Health. In Eritrea, for example, the HIV/AIDS, Malaria, STD, and TB (HAMSET) Control Project engaged a limited group of priorityministries with a direct stake or comparative advantage in pre-venting and treating the HAMSET diseases\u2014health, education,defense, transport, and labor and human welfare\u2014under theleadership of the Ministry of Health and built on past collabora-tion. While the project nevertheless challenged the Ministry, by avoiding creation of new institutions, scarce human re-sources were conserved, duplication avoided, and complexity reduced. a In contrast, the Ghana AIDS Response Project (GARFUND) was managed by a newly formed Ghana AIDS Commission under thepresident and financed at least 16 non-health ministries and pub-lic agencies, in addition to research institutions, regional coor-dinating councils, district assemblies, parliamentarians, traditionalcouncils, and chiefs. The National AIDS Control Program (NACP)in the Ministry of Health retained responsibility only for imple-menting activities falling within a very narrow mandate. As a con-sequence, \"GARFUND subprojects continued to suffer from poortechnical quality and inadequate public health content.\" bBox 4.2: Greater Selectivity in Sectoral Participation Can Improve Multisectoral Performance Sources: IEG 2007c, 2009a. a.

Note: The commitment for the entire project is attributed to the fiscal year of approval. Since 2001 there has been a steady climb in approvals of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), which areprogrammatic development policy operations intendedto support certain IDA countries as they implement a na-tional Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). PRSCs mayinclude simultaneous policy actions in several sectorsaligned with the Strategy and do not necessarily seekto exploit cross-sectoral synergies to produce HNPoutcomes. They are typically implemented in a series ofthree to four single-tranche operations. As of the end of fiscal 2008, 87 individual PRSC op- erations had been approved, of which 83 percent hada health policy measure. According to an ongoing IEGevaluation of PRSCs to be delivered in 2009, the five topHNP issues addressed were: Improved access and utilization of health care Improved efficiency and accountability of resource use Improved health outcomes Enhanced service delivery Improved sectoral management and regulation. These are largely similar to the objectives of HNP- managed investment projects. PRSCs are sometimesused to address sectoral policy issues that require at-tention and support beyond a specific sector (for ex-ample, by the Ministry of Finance or prime minister)and can be used to enhance the dialogue between theline ministry and the Ministry of Finance. While HNP in-vestment project approvals are essentially flat, demandfor PRSCs has been growing. The forthcoming PRSC evaluation will assess, among other issues, the effectiveness of the PRSC in promotingsector dialogue and achieving results in sectors deliveringservices (HNP , education, and water supply) under vary-ing country conditions; the extent to which outputs andoutcomes are actually tracked; and the extent to whichthere have been sectoral investment or technical assis-tance projects working in tandem with PRSCs.Box 4.3: Poverty Reduction Support Credits: Multisectoral Development PolicyLending in Support of HNPimpacts on HNP outcomes, such as education and social protection, the latter being key to thesector's objective of reducing the impoverishingeffects of illness. The evidence base for this section is an in-depth review of all 117 water supply and sanitation proj-ects and 229 transport projects approved from fis-cal 1997 to 2006. The review examined the extentto which the projects cited potential health ben-efits (or risks, in the case of transport) in projectdesign documents; included explicit objectives toimprove health (or mitigate health risks); pro-posed and implemented environmental im-provements that could plausibly provide healthbenefits; and targeted services and health or be-havioral outcomes to the poor. 15For the closed projects\u201426 for water supply and sanitation and105 for transport\u2014it assessed the extent to whichexpected health benefits or objectives have beenmeasured, achieved, and can be attributed to theactivities implemented. Water Supply and Sanitation Extensive evidence has emerged supportingthe potential effectiveness of improvementsin water supply and sanitation infrastructureand hygiene behaviors on health outcomesin developing countries, particularly on theincidence of diarrheal and other water-related diseases. 16Diarrheal diseases accounted for an estimated 1.6-2.1 million deaths annuallybetween 1990 and 2000 and remain among the topfive preventable killers of children under five indeveloping countries (Keutsch and others 2006).There is a strong correlation between unhygienicconditions in poor households and communi-ties and the frequency and severity of diarrhealepisodes. Water supply and sanitation was thesector most frequently cited in CASs as having po-tential benefits for health. While water supply and sanitation inter- ventions canhave an impact on diarrheal and other water-related diseases, the re-search literature shows that these benefitscannot be assumed. The number of high- quality studies demonstrating impact is small,and meta-evaluations of impact studies of watersupply and sanitation interventions show high variability in the findings(Overbey 2008; IEG 2008i). For exam-ple, one synthesis of findings across10 relatively rigorous studies of the im-pact of improved hygiene found a me-dian reduction of 33 percent in diarrheaepisodes, but the reduction ranged from 11 to 89percent (Huttly and others 1997; see also studiesreviewed in IEG 2008i). The variability in impactsis brought about by variations in the technology;the extent to which interventions were actuallyimplemented; pre-intervention levels of patho-gens, sanitation, water quality and quantity, andhygiene behavior; and the socioeconomic statusand culture of the beneficiaries. In short, the ef-fectiveness of an intervention depends criticallyon contextual factors, local conditions andpathogens, and technology. There islittle conclusive evidence on the ex-tent to which water supply, sanitation,and hygiene interventions are com-plements or substitutes in producinghealth benefits; few studies have testedeach separately and in combination inthe same setting. Even when water supply and sanitation in- terventions generate health benefits on av- erage , the benefits do not necessarily reach the poor. Few studies measure the benefits of water supply and sanitationimprovements on the health of thepoorest beneficiaries; most measureaverage impacts. The handful of stud-ies that have examined the distribu-tion of health benefits show that onecannot assume that the poor arehelped. An analysis in rural India, for ex-ample, found a positive association be-tween expanding piped water and areduction in the prevalence and duration of di-arrhea in the lowest two quintiles only if there wasa woman with more than a primary education inthe household (Jalan and Ravallion 2003). Recognition by the Bank's water supply and sanitation sector of the potential contribu-tion of water and sanitation interventions toTHE CONTRIBUTION OF OTHER SECTORS TO HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION OUTCOMES 65Over the fiscal 1997-2006 period, the Bankcommitted $5 billion to350 HNP components inprojects managed byother sectors. Water supply and sanitation interventionscan have an impact onwaterborne diseases, butthose benefits cannot beassumed. Even when water supply and sanitationinterventions do generate health benefits,those benefits do notnecessarily reach thepoor.health outcomes dates back to 1993, when it introduced its first comprehensive strat-egy for water resources (box 4.4). Over the decade from fiscal 1997 to 2006, the World Bankcommitted more than $7.2 billion in resources to117 new water supply and sanitation projectsworldwide that were managed by the water sup-ply and sanitation sector. Eighty-nine percent of the 117 water supply and sanitation projects approved from fis-cal 1997 to 2006 financed infrastructurethat plausibly could improve health. These included interventions to improve water supply,sewerage, wastewater treatment, solid waste management and water quality and toconstruct latrines or toilets or hand-washing facilities (figure 4.8). Accord-ing to project design documents, only28 percent of these projects targeted in-frastructure to the poor. While half of all water supply and sanitation projects cited potentialhealth benefits to justify the investment, only 1 in 10 had an objective to improvehealth for which it was accountable. Even fewer\u2014only 3 percent of all approved projects\u2014had an objective to improve health outcomesamong the poor. Thus, the primary objectivesunderlying the water supply and sanitation lend-ing portfolio are expanding services, increasing the efficiency of utilities, and reducing economiccosts and the time it takes to fetch water\u2014not pro-ducing health benefits or ensuring that thosebenefits reach the poor. Accountability for health outcomes in the water supply and sanitation lending pro-gram appears to be declining. Projects ap- proved from fiscal 2002 to 2006 are less likely to have been justified by health benefits, to have ex-plicit health objectives, or to plan to collect healthindicators than projects approved in the pre-ceding five years (figure 4.9). They are also lesslikely to target behavior change, which is criticalin transforming water supply and sanitation in-frastructure improvements into sustainable health 66IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION The first World Bank water supply strategy to recognize health benefits of water supply and sanitation investments was the 1993policy paper, Water Resources Management: A World Bank Pol- icy Paper (World Bank 1993b) . It emphasized the potential health benefits of clean water supply and better hygiene, particularly inreducing the incidence of diarrheal diseases. It also advocatedpublic health education on the safe handling of water to changehygiene behaviors and improve health outcomes, especiallyamong the poor. The 1993 policy paper led to the Bank's involvement in an in- creasing number of international partnerships such as the GlobalWater Partnership and World Water Council, both formed in1996, and the World Bank-United Nations Development Pro-gram Water and Sanitation Partnership. However, the compre-hensive principles at the heart of the strategy, including those thatparticularly affect health outcomes, initially were not widelyadopted in Bank water-related projects (IEG 2002a). Initiativesspecifically related to sanitation, hygiene, and health becamemore common after 2000, following the World Water Forum and adoption of the MDGs. The World Bank Group's Program for Water Supply and San- itation was adopted in 2004 with objectives and priorities similar to those of the overarching water strategy issued 10 years ear-lier. It acknowledged the critical relationship between better san-itation and hygiene and improved health outcomes, noting that thehealth benefits from water supply and sanitation investmentsdepend on a \"three-pronged strategy: (i) access to sufficientquantities of (ii) sanitary disposal of excreta; and (iii) soundhygiene practices.\" Improving health outcomes was recognizedas one of five \"cross-cutting operational, policy, and institutionalpriorities\" requiring both investment in water supply and sanita-tion infrastructure and behavioral change. The strategy also ad-vocated targeting interventions to the poor as an institutionalpriority. The Sanitation, Hygiene and Wastewater Advisory Ser-vice was created in 2004, and a health specialist was hired for theprogram in 2005.Box 4.4: Health Has Been Featured in World Bank Water Supply and Sanitation Strategies Since 1993 Source: Overbey 2008. Though half of all water supply and sanitation projects cited potential health benefits as justification for the investment, only 10 percent had an objective to improve health.gains. Interviews with water supply and sanitation staff indicate that since 2000 the sector has fo-cused largely on the MDG of improving access tosafe water. The actual health benefits of water supply and sanitation investments as implementedremain obscure. Among the 26 projects ap- proved from fiscal 1997 to 2006 that have closedand for which there were completion reports,only four documented a change in health out-comes, all of them positive. Those with explicithealth objectives were more likely to collect healthoutcome data than were projects without the ob-jectives or indicators, though the sample is small. 17 Among the projects that showed improvement inhealth outcomes, there was no indication in proj-ect documents of specific collaboration withinthe country or the Bank between people in thewater supply and sanitation and HNP sectors.

The extent to which infra- structure improvements have been car-ried out is generally well documented.However, poor sanitation and hygienebehavior can wipe out any potentialhealth benefits. Few of the projects measured these behavioral indicators, whichwould offer greater confidence in interpretingthe outcomes. Further, the completion reports donot account for the effects of other factors\u2014such as rainfall, better health facilities, or suc-cessful health campaigns\u2014on healthoutcomes, a point made by the proj-ect staff in the case of Madagascar. None of the completed projects measured health outcomes separately for poor andnon-poor project beneficiaries. The Nepal Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project had an explicit health objective and was targeted torural areas, which are apt to be poor (box 4.5).However, the project primarily helped com-munities along or near main roads, while the re-ally poor tend to live in more remote areas. Thefollow-on project is now targeting those remoteareas.Transport Transport investments can produce impor-tant health benefits in terms of improved ac-cess to health care, including access toemergency obstetric care, and better dis-tribution of drugs, blood, and other medicalsupplies. Moreover, better access to markets can lead to greater household income and betternutrition and health. But the impact of better ac-cess to health care depends on context: it will notresult in better health if the health facility offersbad care, for example. Better transport can also have detrimental impacts on the environment and on humanhealth. Every year, 1.2 million people die in road accidents worldwide (over 3,000 per day), and asmany as 50 million more people are injured, somesuffering permanent disabilities (WHO 2004).Eighty percent of the deaths and 90 percent of the losses from road traffic injuries occur in low-and middle-income countries. 18While traffic ac- cidents, injuries, fatalities, and noise have longbeen considered negative externalities, recentevidence suggests that there are direct effects oftransport-induced air pollutants on mortality andrespiratory disease. WHO estimates that sus- 68IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION The actual delivery of health benefits by water supply and sanitation projects is unclear; only a few have documented positive health outcomes. Transport investments can have both positive and negative health impacts. The Nepal Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) Project (1996-2003) had an objective to \"deliver sustainable health andhygiene benefits to the rural population through improvement inwater supply and sanitation facilities.\" Building on a previous pilot, the project created a semi- autonomous RWSS Fund Development Board to finance infra-structure. Support from nongovernmental organizations helpedcommunities implement sustainable schemes. There was appar-ently no formal or informal collaboration between the schemeand the health sector\u2014either in Nepal or within the World Bank.The RWSS project built capacity in rural villages to maintain watersupply and sanitation investments, provided funds for infrastruc-ture that was cofinanced by communities, and extended hygieneeducation to improve health outcomes. Good sanitation practiceswere reinforced through community grants for latrines sufficient to cover 25 percent of the total beneficiary population at a rate of750 rupees per household. The community then on-lent this to in-dividual households at an agreed rate of interest for 6 to 12 months. Between 2000 and 2002, the share of residents in project areas who used tap stands rose from 18 to 91 percent, and the shareusing a latrine rose from 24 to 64 percent. aThe share of respon- dents (mostly women) who reported washing their hands afterdefecation rose from 65 to 88 percent, and the percent washinghands before cooking from 58 to 81 percent. However, there werefewer behavioral improvements in the most remote and poorerareas of western and far-western Nepal, and the impact of bet-ter hygiene on health status could not be confirmed except by areduction in self-reported water-related diseases.Box 4.5: Better Hygiene Behavior through Rural Water Supply and Sanitation in Nepal Source: IEG forthcoming. a. The project was implemented in four \"batches\" at different times. These results are from Batch III. Similar results were obse rved for Batch IV.pended particulate matter leads to the premature death of over 500,000 people each year (WHO2002). Other potential health risks of transport in-vestments include water pollution, disease trans-mission, and reduced physical activity, raising therisks of heart ailments, cancer, and diabetes. Several strategy documents have helped shape the Bank's approach to health in re-lation to the transport sector since 1996(box 4.6). From fiscal 1997 to 2006, the WorldBank committed nearly $28 billion to 229 newprojects managed by the transport sector. Themain health-related transport interventions in-cluded: elimination of hazardous locations by re-habilitation or upgrading; improvements in roadtraffic management, bus priority, and risk be-havior (such as traffic signals, lane markings,pedestrian crossings, traffic calming, seatbelt andhelmet usage); emissions controls; and publichealth interventions concerning the movement ofpeople along transport corridors or traveling by air (for HIV/AIDS and othercommunicable disease). About a quarter of transport sector- managed projects in the review periodhad an objective to improve health out-comes or mitigate a health risk. Aboutone in five projects had a road safety objective;other objectives having to do with institutional ca-pacity and reducing accidents and \"black spots\"(hazardous road locations) on roadways were re-lated to road safety (figure 4.10). Only a handfulhad objectives related to aviation or waterwaysafety, HIV/AIDS prevention, or improved air qual-ity. 19However, nearly half of the projects had a health component (46 percent); almost all of thecomponents were about transport safety (42 per-cent of all projects), with the next most commoncomponents for HIV/AIDS prevention (8 percent)and air quality (4 percent).THE CONTRIBUTION OF OTHER SECTORS TO HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION OUTCOMES 69About a quarter of transport projectsincluded an objective toimprove health outcomesor mitigate health risks,but about half had ahealth component.Sustainable Transport: Priorities for Policy Reform (1996) ac- corded a higher priority to moving people than vehicles, ensur-ing greater transport safety, and minimizing adverse health effects.It recommended benchmarked safety programs, adoption ofcleaner fuels, and systematic estimation of the impact of trans-port programs on safety and air pollution. It also highlighted threeareas where the Bank could improve its advice and reduce theaccident rate: the separation of motor vehicles from pedestriansand nonmotorized traffic; improvements in driver behavior throughbetter education, regulation, and enforcement; and introductionof geometric road designs that take into account the large num-ber of vulnerable road users in developing countries. Cities on the Move (2002) advocated the development of a na- tional road accident data collection and analysis capability. Itmaintained that accident frequency and severity can be reducedby improved road design and traffic management. It also recog-nized that poor people are the most vulnerable to the effects ofair pollution, and that little is known about the environmental im-pact of urban transport. A road safety specialist was appointedto the transport anchor, and collaborative work with WHO waslaunched. In 2004, WHO and the World Bank jointly published theWorld Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention (WHO and World Bank 2004), which highlighted the growing public health burdenof road deaths and injuries in low- and middle-income coun-tries. The World Bank contribution was a collaborative effort bystaff in the HNP and transport sectors. HIV/AIDS interventions are a priority for the transport sector because the risk of contracting and spreading HIV at transportconstruction sites is high, and because people engaged in trans-port are at high risk of spreading HIV along transport corridors. Intensifying Action against HIV/AIDS in Africa (1999) committed to mainstreaming HIV into other sectors, including transport. The2005 Global HIV/AIDS Program of Action committed to including HIV/ AIDS activities in all Bank-funded construction contracts, inall new transport projects in India and Africa, and in all ongoingAfrica transport projects at mid-term. This approach has been in-corporated into the recent Transport Business Strategy (2008),which is designed to strengthen transport sector capacity and in-stitutions engaged with HIV/AIDS prevention strategies. The 2008Business Strategy also commits to make roads safer, includingsupport for governments to develop and implement \"strategies,policies, institutions, infrastructure design, vehicle and driverregulations, and enforcement mechanisms.\"Box 4.6: Health and Transport in the World Bank's Sector Strategies Sources: Freeman and Mathur 2008; World Bank 2005c, 2008f.While the share of approved transport proj- ects with health objectives has been sta-ble, the share with health components has increased dramatically over time \u2014from 36 percent in 1997-2001 to 59 percent in 2002-06. Almost all of this increase can be attributed to transport safety(rising from 33 to 52 percent), and al-most all of that to road safety. Theshare of projects with HIV/AIDS com-ponents at appraisal also rose, from 3 to 15 percent. The increase in transport projectswith health components was particularly evidentin middle-income countries, South Asia, Europeand Central Asia, Latin America, and Africa (fig-ure 4.11). One in four transport projects planned to collect health outcome indicators, but only 5 percent planned to collect health output or behavioral indicators that would help to link the projects'activities with health outcomes.The road safety outcome indicators in-cluded the number of accidents, in-juries, and fatalities and accident, injury,and fatality rates. None of the projects proposed to collect health outcome data specifically for thepoor. Among the 105 closed transport projects, a quarter (28 projects) had explicit healthobjectives or financed components with po-tential health benefits. All of the planned road safety, waterway, and port safety componentswere at least partly implemented. However, moreHIV/AIDS components were implemented thanhad been planned at the time that the projectswere designed, which is consistent with the effortsby the health and transport sectors to \"retrofit\"HIV/AIDS components into ongoing transportprojects. Closed projects with explicit health objec- tives were far more likely to plan and to col-lect health indicators than were projectswith health components but no explicit ob-jective (figure 4.12). T wo-thirds or more of trans- port projects with explicit health objectivescollected health outcome data, compared withonly a fifth of projects without them. All 15 closedtransport projects that measured health outcomes 70IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Figure 4.10: The Majority of Health-Related Objectives in Transport Projects Are for Road Safety Percent of projects30 2025 10 515 0 Freeman and Mathur 2008.

Re-ductions in fatalities per 10,000 vehicles havebeen documented for projects in several countries(figure 4.13). None of the small number of closed transport projects with HIV/AIDS components collecteddata on health outcomes, so the effectivenessof these activities is unknown. 20A recent up- date on the implementation of the Bank's Global HIV/AIDS Program of Action notes that more than half of the projects in the active transport lend-ing portfolio include HIV/AIDS activities, most ofthem added after the project was approved. Theexperience in the rest of the transport portfolio sug-gests that health indicators are rarely collected inthe absence of an explicit objective. The link between transport safety improve- ments and project outputs was often weak.Outputs were not well documented, other factorsthat might have affected the accident rate were notconsidered, behavioral and other intermediatevariables (such as seatbelt use and accidents bycause) were not measured, and the health outcome data were often not specific to the areas coveredby project interventions. It is thus difficult to iden-tify the share of the reductions in fatalities and ac-THE CONTRIBUTION OF OTHER SECTORS TO HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION OUTCOMES 71Figure 4.11: The Share of Transport Projects with Health Components Has Increased Sharply Percent of projects90 80 70 60 5040 30 20 10 0 Lower-middle income (LMIC)Low-income (LIC) Country income RegionsUpper-middle income (UMIC)Middle East and North AfricaSouth Asia East Asia and PacificEurope and Central AsiaLatin America and the CaribbeanSub-Saharan 2002-06 Source: Freeman and Mathur 2008.

In summary, CASs invoke the language of syner- gies and health benefits to justify the lendingportfolio, but lending activities in complementarysectors generally proceed independently of eachother. While it is likely that investments in other sectors are contributing to HNP out-comes, these benefits are not well doc-umented, and attempts to coordinateor monitor the contribution of Banksupport for complementary sectors inproducing health outcomes are rare. 21 Multisectoral HNP projects can produce results if the degree of complexity can be minimized byprioritizing the sectors, keeping the numbermanageable in relation to country coordinatingcapacity, and ensuring that collaborating agen-cies have clearly defined roles and responsibilities. There is great potential for improving HNP out- comes by enlisting both the water supply andsanitation and transport sectors in a more sys- tematic and effective way. However, it is importantto remember that the main objectives of supportin these other sectors are not for health. It wouldmake sense to assess beforehand, case-by-case, the expected costs and benefits at the margin of incorporating explicit health objectives. Onecould argue, however, in the case of transport, thatthere are always potential negative externalitiesof road projects, so road safety objectives mightbe relevant in virtually all cases. In the case of watersupply and sanitation, it is important that the sec-tor recognize that its responsibility for achievingthe MDGs is not limited to improved access to safewater, but also includes contributing to the healthand nutrition goals. Incentives to deliver HNPoutcomes are improved in both water supply andsanitation and transport projects if the health ob-jectives are made explicit. There is virtually no ac-countability for the results of retrofitted healthcomponents\u2014this is something that needs to beaddressed. Attempts to ensure that the healthbenefits reach the poor are rare. 72IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION None of the projects with HIV/AIDS components collected data on health outcomes.Figure 4.13: Reduction in Fatalities per 10,000 Vehicles in Closed Transport Projects Fatalities per 10,000 vehicles80 60 40 20 076 60 52 39 19.9 8.412.110.5 9.25.87.6 6.6 1998 Bangladesh India Latvia Armenia Country and yearRomania Lithuania2005 1999 2003 1995 2000 1999 2004 1997 2003 1996 1999 Source: Freeman and Mathur 2008, table 5.12.The Romania Roads II Project had two health objectives\u2014to im- prove road safety and reduce lead emissions. Road safety ac-tivities included reducing accident \"black spots\" and launchinga 10-year Safety Action Plan, which involved public education todeter speeding; wear seat belts; use child restraint devices; andreduce driving under the influence of alcohol, medication, anddrugs. The modernizing, safer national vehicle fleet would alsolikely have contributed to fewer accidents. The accident ratenationally declined, even as the number of registered cars roseby a quarter (see figure, below). The road safety activities reachedtheir height in 2002-03 with the launch of a \"Year of Traffic Safety.\"Yet, the accident rate was already in decline even before the launch of the program. Engineering improvements to the first1,000 kilometers of roads under the previous project, Roads I, isa possible contributory factor; rising fuel prices and a difficult eco-nomic climate might also have led to less driving or driving shorterdistances, even as the vehicle fleet increased. The failure to ac-count for factors affecting the accident rate\u2014such as seatbeltuse, sales of child restraining devices, and the number of drugand alcohol-related accidents\u2014makes it difficult to understandthe contribution of road safety activities to the reduction in traf-fic fatalities.

The early projects did not perform well, but performance has improvedand lessons learned led to the 2002strategy. Support for public-private partnerships has expanded, especially throughAdvisory Services. Greater diversity in the portfolio would improve the social impact ofIFC's investments. Health sector activities and respon- sibilities in IFC are segmented andlinked to different departments, im-plying a need for internal coordination. Closer collaboration with the World Bank on regulatory issues would im-prove the climate for expanding IFCinvestments and Advisory Services.Woman receives a health exam in Beirut, Lebanon.

While it is possible to review thecharacteristics of the health investment portfoliosince 2002, most of the investments launchedsince then are not sufficiently mature to evaluatetheir efficacy. Evolution of IFC's Approach to Private Investment in Health Following adoption by the World Bank of its 1997 HNP strategy, IFC planted the seeds for devel-opment of a health strategy with the formationof a Health Care Best Practice Group in February1998 (figure 5.1). The Group was to analyze po-tential investments in health and to share andleverage knowledge about the health care in-dustry that was developing across IFC depart-ments (IFC 2002, p. 24). In 1999, the Health Care Best Practice Group issued \"Investing in Private Health Care: ANote on Strategic Directions for IFC,\" whichhighlighted the potential contribution of IFC health investments to improving healthoutcomes for people in developing countries,particularly among the poor (IFC HealthCare Best Practice Group 1999). First, such in- vestments were expected to provide private healthservices and finance to low- and middle-incomepatients in the event that public health systemsfailed to reach them with quality care. Second, incountries where private investment not only com-plements but also competes with public sectorhealth services, investment in private health carewas expected to alleviate the burden on over-stretched public resources and improve the effi-ciency of the health sector more generally. In thelong run, this was expected to enhance health carefor the entire population, including the poor.Third, private facilities were expected to set asidebeds and services for poor clients. IFC subsequently adopted a frontier country strategy to steer resources toward underserved sectors in high-risk or low-income countries (IFC1998). Health care, including investments in pri-vate clinics, hospitals, and health care manage-ment, was considered a frontier sector, and prioritywas assigned to the social sectors more generally.Health is a relatively new area to IFC. Until the early 1990s, it had only a few, sporadic health projects and no health department or specializedhealth staff. Between 1997 and 2007, IFC approved only 54 investment projects in the health sector, with total new commitments of about $580 mil-lion; health investments represented only 2 percent of total IFC projects andcommitments (appendix D). During the same period, Advisory Services proj-ects on health were approved for a total of $23.67 million.In April 2000, IFC established the Global Practice Group for the Social Sectors, which became IFC's Health and Education Department in Sep-tember 2001. The 2002 strategy \"Investing in Private Health Care: Strategic Directions for IFC\"was the first IFC health strategy presentedto the Board of Directors. The goals for the sector were broadly defined: to improve healthoutcomes, protect the population from the im-poverishing effects of ill health, and enhance per- formance of health services (IFC 2002,p. 3). The strategy had two sets of ob-jectives (see chapter 1, table 1.2). Thebusiness objectives were similar to those of any other IFC investment: \"fi-nancing should be provided in situa-tions where other investors are notprepared to invest; the investmentshould encourage private resource flows through a demonstration effect; invest-ments should be made only in financially viableoperations; and managerial and financial value added should be provided where necessary\" (IFC2002, p. 32). The developmental objectives sought to ensure that IFC investments would contribute to institutional and systemic capacity building andpromote efficiency and innovation within the sec-tor, while improving health security and expand-ing financial protection against the impoverishingeffects of ill health (IFC 2002, p. 4). Under the 2002 strategy, IFC planned to continue to invest in the hospital sector butto diversify its portfolio. Hence, it focused more on private health insurance to benefit thelower-middle and middle classes in countrieswithout universal risk pooling; support for sup-plementary insurance; investment in pharma-ceutical production, medical device manufacture,and biotechnology; and greater investments in theeducation and training of health workers (IFC2002 p. 7). The strategy proposed six follow-up ac-tions to implement the new investment strategy:develop instruments for small projects; increase 78IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Figure 5.1: Timeline of Health Sector-Related Events in IFC (1997-2007) World Bank HNP strategy (1997)presented to theBoard 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007IFC introducedfrontier countrystrategySocial sector designated asone of sector departmentalreorganization Health and Education Unitbecame adepartmentIFC Against AIDS initiated Global practice group for socialsector formed Investing in Health: Note on StrategicDirections for IFCHealth Care Best Practice Group formed Health and Education UnitestablishedWorld Bank HNP strategy (2007)presented to = World Bank Group; SME = small and medium enterprises.

The 2002 strategy took into account both the internal and external environments of thehealth sector. Internally, it considered the rel- ative newness of health investments to IFC.Externally, three issues were considered (IFC2002, pp. 6-19). First, demographics were chang-ing; health expenditures were increasing; therewere advances in medical technology and prac-tice, information, and biotechnology; and changesin consumer behavior and expectations were in-creasing inequity. Second, global trends pointedto a significant and expanding role for the privatesector, particularly as a partner with the public sec-tor in the provision of health care. Many govern-ments were rethinking the roles of public andprivate agents in the health sector and were be-ginning to turn to market instruments to enhancethe efficiency and quality of health care provi-sion. Third, the strategy acknowledged the WorldBank Group mission of reducing poverty andpromoting economic growth and the role of theprivate sector for growth and poverty reduction(IFC 2002, p. 21). The strategy subscribes to and supports the goals of the Bank's 1997 HNP strategy (IFC 2002, p. 20). The IFC strategy identifies the dif-ferent roles of the World Bank and IFC, recognizestheir potential complementarity, and advocatescloser collaboration. 1IFC clearly recognized that while it has the mandate, the growing staff capacity,and the instruments to address directly private sec-tor financing, the staff of the Bank's Human De-velopment Network have the relevant sectorknowledge and the mandate to inform and leadpolicy dialogue with country authorities and tosupport needed changes through the develop-ment and financing of public sector operations(IFC 2002, p. 41). Moreover, the strategy includesa specific subobjective that health investmentsshould support the Bank's health sector objec-tives. It mentions that discussions with Bank col-leagues through the appraisal process are vital and aim at deriving a mean-ingfully integrated approach betweenIFC and the Bank\u2014one that shouldmaximize the benefits to clients and toboth organizations (IFC 2002, p. 23). The strategy did not specify targets, esti- mate the resources needed for implemen-tation, or put in place M&E arrangements.Goals for the sector were defined broadly, and astrategic investment approach that would maxi-mize IFC's impact and role in the health sector wasnot defined. There was no estimate of the re-sources required to implement the strategy. Thestrategy proposed to refine the evalu-ation framework and to develop a setof baseline indicators that would ade-quately measure IFC's health sectorobjectives. However, the strategy itselfprovided no indicators. Since 2004, 2addressing the regulatory, fi- nancing, and implementation constraintsto private sector investment in infrastruc-ture, health, and education has been one ofIFC's five strategic priorities. For the health sector, IFC's corporate strategy aimed to: Facilitate public-private partnerships (PPPs). Provide input and advice on regulatory im- provements. Provide innovative financing, advice, and proj- ect development activities with local privateplayers, such as expanding the use of local cur-rency and taking new approaches to financingsmall health facilities. Develop cooperative programs with the World Bank (IBRD and IDA) to address sectorwideconstraints comprehensively. IFC's strategy in the health sector is con- tinuing to evolve. The Health and Education De- partment's strategy is moving away from top-tierbricks-and-mortar projects to focus on repeat in-vestments with strategic clients with broad reach,South-South investments in large, for-profit pro-viders, and in local clients' operating networks of hospitals. The Life Sciences strategy is to em-IFC'S HEALTH STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS 79The strategy supports the goals of the Bank's 1997HNP strategy.

IFC is ex-tending its partnership with private foundationsin the area of health. 3In 2007, IFC adopted a strategy to improve private financing and provi-sion of health services in Sub-Saharan Africa, part-nering with other institutions such as the Bill andMelinda Gates Foundation, with the objective ofmobilizing up to $1 billion over five years in in-vestment and Advisory Services to boost healthcare in the Region. Because this strategy has onlyrecently been launched, it is not a focus of thisanalysis. IFC's Investment Portfolio in Health Between fiscal 1997 and 2007, IFC approved54 investment projects in the health sec-tor, with total new commitments 4of about $580 million. The average investment in indi- vidual health projects was therefore small\u2014onlyabout $11 million. Health investments repre-sented only 2 percent of total IFC projects andcommitments for the period. The majority of the projects have been in hospitals, phar-maceuticals, and biotechnology (table5.1). IFC had only one project each inmedical equipment manufacture, med-ical equipment leasing, medical train-ing, and health payment processing. 5Trends in IFC Health Investments The health investment portfolio grew un-evenly over the fiscal 1997-2007 period.New investment commitments were stable be-tween 1997 and 2002, but after the establishmentof the Health and Education Department in 2001and introduction of the 2002 strategy, the numberof new projects and commitment volume actuallydropped. Investment growth then surged from2005 onward (figure 1.3, chapter 1). This is con-sistent with a pattern observed in the dynamics ofother industries in IFC where newly established de-partments first go through a consolidation phase,sorting out portfolio issues and developing strate-gies and standards for investments, before em-barking on an expansion phase. For the purposes of evaluation, IFC project ap- provals can be divided into three periods: (a)committed projects approved before fiscal 2000,prior to the issuance of any strategic documentsabout IFC and health; (b) committed projectsapproved from fiscal 2000 to 2002, when the De-partment of Health and Education was estab-lished and the Board was presented with a formalstrategy for the sector; and (c) committed proj-ects approved from fiscal 2003 onward. The analy-sis of the first period is only illustrative, since nostrategic directions were in place. The secondperiod is short, but it has been used to assesswhether any of the ideas of the 1999 Strategic Note 80IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Over fiscal 1997-2007, IFC approved 54 investments in the health sector with $580 million in commitments.

It is too early to assess the projects in the third period. Hospitals have continued to be the most significant type of investment, but the shareof hospital projects has decreased from al-most 80 percent in the first period to around50 percent in the later periods (table 5.1). 6 The notable increase in life science projects in the third period reflects the efforts of the specializedLife Sciences Group in 2005. Although the number of projects and net commitments expanded in life sciences,IFC did not expand operations in private in-surance as the strategy intended. 7T o date, IFC has not financed a freestanding insurance proj-ect, though it has invested in some prepaymentarrangements. The lack of proper regulatoryframeworks in countries, weak IFC focus and ex-perience in the subsector, and the lack of insti-tutional arrangements required to promote theseinvestments (such as regulatory regimes) con-tributed to the gap. Health projects have been concentrated in three Regions\u2014Asia, Latin America and theCaribbean, and Europe and Central Asia.These Regions account for 89 percent of the proj-ects in the sector. This distribution follows thegeneral pattern of IFC's portfolio as a whole.However, the distribution of commitments indi-cates that Asia has a much larger share in thehealth portfolio. Geographically, IFC health sector opera- tions did not experience increased diversi-fication until after fiscal 2002 (table 5.2). Before 1999, IFC's healthprojects were concentrated in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean. The onlyhealth-related operations in Africa werethose in the Africa Enterprise Fund(AEF). 8The distribution evened out across Regions from fiscal 2000 to 2002.Then, from fiscal 2003 to 2007, IFCcommitted to health projects in Africafor the first time and substantiallyexpanded its operations in Asia andEurope and Central Asia. The net com-mitment volume followed a similar geo-graphic distribution pattern. IFC's health investments are con- centrated in middle-income coun-tries. This, too, largely mirrors the pattern in IFC's overall investmentportfolio. But there is a larger concentration ofhealth investments in low-risk countries and aslightly larger concentration in nonfrontier coun-tries (middle-income countries not at high risk).These results could be explained by IFC's greaterexperience working in low-risk countries wherethe environment for business is favorable. How-ever, health itself was considered a frontier sec-tor in 1998 (IFC 1998) because the operationswere new and risky. Data for the corporation asa whole show a relatively more even distribution.

Although investment in life sciences expanded, itdid not grow in privateinsurance as the strategyintended. IFC investments did not diversify geographicallyuntil after 2002.Table 5.2: Geographic Distribution of IFC Projects by Period Europe and Latin America Middle East Period (fiscal years) Africa Asia Central Asia and Caribbean and North Africa 1997-99 0 2 3 6 0 2000-02 0 5 3 5 12003-07 2 13 8 4 2 Total 2 20 14 15 3 Source: IEG data.ment outcome, based on methodology consistent with the Multilateral Development Bank's GoodPractice Standards for Evaluation of Private Sec- tor Projects (MDB, ECG, and WGPSE2006, p. 2). The development outcomeof projects is based on four develop-ment dimensions\u2014project businesssuccess, economic sustainability, envi- ronmental and social effects, and private sectordevelopment impact\u2014relative to what wouldhave occurred without the project, and com-pared against established benchmarks as well asstated objectives. 10 IFC's health investment results between fis-cal years 1997 and 2002, including pharma-ceuticals, were highly unprofitable (table 5.3). The financial losses, minus 51 percent inprofitability for health in the first period andminus 13 percent for pharmaceuticals in the sec-ond period, indicate that these lines of businesswere a significant cost to IFC, a situation that wasnot sustainable. In the subsequent periods, IFCcontained its losses. More recently, pharmaceu-tical businesses have started to contribute to IFC'sbottom line, and the profitability of health oper-ations has been improving. The evaluation assessed the re- sults of projects that reached early operating maturity .This occurs when the project has been substan-tially completed and has generated atleast 18 months of operating revenuesfor the company, and when IFC has received at least one set of audited annual financial state-ments that cover at least 12 months of operatingrevenues (MDB, ECG, and WGPSE 2006, p. 2). Thisusually happens about five years after project ap-proval. Thus, only projects in the first and sec- ond periods meet early operating maturitycriteria and will be fully assessed below,while projects of the third, most recent, pe-riod will be included selectively, based onthe extent to which particular effects couldbe discerned at this stage. In the first period (fiscal years 1997-99), in- vestment and development outcomes wereboth low. Only 18 percent of health projects (2 out of 11) achieved both a high development rat-ing and high investment return (figure 5.2), com-pared with 48 percent for all IFC investments.About two-thirds of projects in the first periodwere referred to the Department of Special Op-erations\u2014a dedicated team that handles projectsin distress\u2014for workout, restructuring, resched-uling, and recovery. The reasons for these refer-rals included long delays in completing projects,negative influence of sponsors' other lines ofbusiness, difficulties in increasing the number ofnew patients served, the impact of financial crisesin certain regions, and delays in obtaining regu-latory clearances. The experience also reflectsIFC's weakness in screening and structuring healthsector deals owing to a lack of sector-related ex-perience during the period.

In many cases these early poor-performing op- erations resulted in: complete failure of the busi-ness and bankruptcy of the sponsor company,followed by sale of the project company to a thirdparty; early termination of investment funds, be-cause of poor ramp-up of the investment portfolio;abandonment of the project construction; or illi-quidity, when a company ran out of cash from op-erations in other countries. Other projects withlow development outcomes included hospitalswith large underutilization of facilities and heavyfinancial losses in early years. Although some ofthe businesses are still operational, the financialand economic returns were lower than the bench-marks. Pharmaceutical projects with low devel-opment outcomes failed to achieve export marketpenetration, which was the original project ob-jective and critical for their business growth. Theyalso encountered policy obstacles (price controls,collection problems with state health funds).Lessons from hospital projects in the first periodare summarized in box 5.1. The projects with lowdevelopment outcomes tended to confirm theperception of the health sector as high risk, andthus had negative demonstration effects. In contrast, nearly three-quarters of proj- ects approved in the second period (10 outof 14 projects, fiscal 2000-02) had high de-velopment outcomes and a high investmentreturn, substantially better than the rest ofIFC portfolio (figure 5.3). Only 4 projects were rated low in development outcome. One was acomplete business failure, and the company hasbeen liquidated. T wo were hospitals that had lower-than-expected patient admittance and struggledto ramp up revenues. Both are operational and ex-pect to be sustainable, though with a lower returnto financiers than anticipated. The fourth, a phar-maceutical project, decided to drop investmentsin research and development of new drugs fol-lowing pessimistic market views of blockbusterdrugs, 11and to cut back on employment. Although 3 of the 10 projects with high development out-comes showed business results below the benchmark, all met or exceededeconomic benefit benchmarks and con-tributed positively to private sectordevelopment. Between the first andsecond periods, performance improvedin all four dimensions of developmentand investment outcomes (figure 5.3).

Second, the projects may in-troduce services not previously available, increasecapacity, or improve hospital management. For ex-ample, a project in the Philippines was the firstmajor tertiary hospital built in the capital city in25 years. Third, projects supported by IFC oftenhave state-of-the-art technology and equipmentthat are out of the reach of governments. Managers of client medical institutions in Ar- gentina and the Philippines reported that state-of-the-art facilities in the country attracted doctorsthat had established successful careers in medicalinstitutions in Europe and the United States. Fourout of seven IFC projects appeared to attract doc-tors back to their native countries to practice.However, some facilities experienced difficultiesin retaining quality nurses. T raining for medical em- 84IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION 1. Sponsors of hospital projects may not be focused on the bottom line. Hospital projects sponsored by doctors are unique\u2014the sponsorsinvest in and work in the facilities they build, and trade-offs arealways necessary. Doctors may not expect financial returns (es-pecially from equities), but they may prioritize access to facilitiesfor more lucrative practices. Professional management in finan-cial control is necessary. IFC must insist that measures be put inplace to control expenditures during the construction phase aswell as during operations. 2. Just because people are sick, that does not mean they will go to a new hospital. Competitively positioning a health care project in the local mar-ket is difficult. To be successful, a project must establish that thequality of service provided justifies its higher cost. If a hospitalcharges too much, potential clients will find other options forcritical care. At the time of appraisal for a new health care proj-ect, IFC should carefully review the market plan.3. IFC should expect conflicting interests in health care projects among stakeholders and plan accordingly. Managing the relationships among doctors, sponsors, managers,contractors, technical partners, and others is complex, and con-flicts are bound to arise. IFC should review the procedures for dis-pute resolution at appraisal and monitor them during implementationand operation. It is particularly important that such proceduresinclude ways to deal with cash shortfalls. IFC has experienced dif-ficulty with different project structures, including 50-50 joint ven-tures, single sponsors, and multiple sponsors. The strengths andweaknesses of the proposed structure should be reviewed care-fully at appraisal, and weaknesses should be mitigated. 4. IFC should be cautious in providing loans denominated in foreign currencies. Because health care services usually generate revenues in localcurrency, providing foreign currency loans increases project risk.In countries vulnerable to capital flight, IFC should consider mech-anisms to provide local currency loans. If this is not possible, itshould consider either providing guarantees to local banks thatsupply local currency loans or establishing a hedging mechanismat secure, global banks.Box 5.1: Early Hospital Investments Provided Important Lessons Source: IEG analysis of ELRN data.

Furthermore,three of them have formal arrangements withuniversities or medical schools to accept intern-ships or continuing education for doctors in theirfacilities. Many hospitals supported by IFC have ad- dressed governance issues in the privatehealth sector. IFC projects in Eastern Europe in- troduced the posting of fees that doctors arecharging, with the objective of reducing infor-mal payments. Other projects have introducedsome control of doctors' side practices outside theinstitutions. More generally, IFC requires financialand environmental reporting that prompts clienthospitals to improve their management prac-tices, which in turn can bring forth better deci-sion making. IFC's Advisory Services in Health Trends in IFC Advisory Services for Health IFC's Advisory Services projects have workedto address the regulatory, financing, andimplementation constraints to private in-vestment in the health sector. 12Between fis- cal years 1997 and 2007, 36 advisory projects inhealth were approved for a total of $18.48 million,excluding HIV/AIDS projects. The largest numberof such projects was for studies related to investment project preparation andfollow-up (table 5.4). This is consis-tent with the need to address IFC'slack of knowledge about the best wayto do business in health. Advisory Services resources for public-private partnerships com-prise the largest share of total fund-ing and have shown the largestincrease over the study period (box 5.2). From fiscal 2003 onward, AdvisoryServices have increasingly worked withgovernments to encourage public-private partnerships in the form ofseminars and advice on design and im-plementation of IFC investment projects(table 5.4). Public-private partnershipscan be effective for expanding IFC'sreach, but they have been difficult to im-plement because it is the governmentthat decides which partnership modelwould be the most appropriate. Thedecision also depends on the government's ca-pacity to regulate and effectively control the qual-ity of health care delivery. This is important for thesuccess of the partnership, because after the agree-ment is signed, there are economic incentives toreduce the provision of services or their quality. Fur-IFC'S HEALTH STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS 85Managers of two client hospitals reported that upgraded facilitieshelped attract doctorswith successful careers in Europe and the United States.

Retail refers to IFC's direct assistance to nongovernmental organization/grassroots business entities through its Advisory Se rvices window. b. HIV/AIDS activities, carried out by IFC Against AIDS, were not recorded in the centralized database until recently, and histo rical project-specific data are not able to be mapped out against the other Advisory Services operations at this time.Projects for public-private partnerships make up thelargest share of AdvisoryServices funding andproject approvals.thermore, public consensus is needed because, in practice, opposition canarise over the fairness of privatizationand health care cost increases. The otherchallenge for IFC has been to find pri-vate investors willing to participate inthese partnerships. T o meet these chal-lenges, IFC emphasized Advisory Serviceoperations to governments. The Regional distribution of Advisory Ser- vices funds differs from that of investmentprojects. Africa accounted for 38 percent of the total funding, Europe and Central Asia for 28 per-cent, while Asia accounted for only 6 percent. The significance of IFC funding for Ad-visory Services in Africa is explainedby IFC Against AIDS , as well as by a $3.2 million study (almost 14 percentof total funding) to analyze opportu-nities for private health investments inAfrica, which also shaped the new IFCBusiness of Health in Africa initiative. IFC Against AIDS , a corporate initiative, was ini- tiated in 2000 as a response to the identificationof the HIV/AIDS epidemic as a critical obstacle forsustained competitiveness of enterprises (costincreases, productivity drops, and losses of ex- perienced personnel) in regions where the dis-ease is more prevalent. The aim of the initiativeis to get businesses involved in the fight againstHIV/AIDS through risk management and imple-mentation of workplace programs in countrieswhere IFC operates. The program is detailed andassessed in box 5.3. Efficacy of Advisory Services IFC is rolling out a new system for evaluat-ing its Advisory Services operations. Under this system, Project Completion Reports (PCRs) will beprepared by IFC staff, cleared by IFC management,and reviewed for quality of content by IEG. Thissystem assesses development effectiveness across five dimensions: strategic relevance, efficiency,outputs, outcomes, and impacts. It also rates Ad-visory Services on the role and contribution of IFC, which reflects the extent to which IFC brought ad-ditionality or some special contribution to theproject. The system has been implemented on apilot basis on 293 operations that closed in2004-06. Of these, 10 are in the health sector. Inferences about the performance of Advi- sory Services in health are constrained bythe small sample of evaluated health proj-ects and considerable data gaps. Among the small group of health Advisory Services that wasevaluated, ratings on some of the dimensionswere not available. For example, only 2 PCRs hadvalid judgments on the dimension of impactachievement (in both cases, negative), while theresults of the other 8 projects were either in-conclusive or it was too early to tell at the time ofproject completion (table 5.5). The overall de-velopment effectiveness for Advisory Servicehealth projects is based on only 6 projects. 13Proj- ects rated high include public-private partner-ships (see box 5.4 for a successful example) andstudies for the introduction of health insurance.The six Advisory Services projects in health thatwere rated on outcome achievement performedbelow those in the rest of IFC: only a third hadhigh outcome achievement (meeting expectedoutcomes or better), compared with 71 percentof projects in other IFC sectors. The cost-effec-tiveness of the health projects was also lower. 86IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION IFC Against AIDS was initiated to get businesses involved in the fight against the disease through risk management and workplace programs.A public-private partnership in health is any joint program or project that involves collaboration between the public and private sectors, includ-ing contracting between the public sector (government or developmentagencies) and private providers to offer health services and goodsand/or private financing to support health infrastructure. Governmentsworldwide are developing such partnerships in health to manage in-creased demand for health services and fiscal constraints. Private par-ticipation in public hospitals is sought to improve efficiency, reducecosts, and transfer operational risk. Public-private partnerships can take many forms with different de- grees of private sector responsibility and risk. They are differentiatedby whether the private sector manages medical services, owns orleases the facility, employs the staff, or finances and manages capitalinvestments.Box 5.2: What Are Public-Private Partnerships inHealth? A new system for evaluating IFC Advisory Services has been piloted, but only 10 advisory operations in the health sector have been evaluated.IFC has also started to assist social enter- prises that are directly serving rural andpoor people. Among these is the Sustainable Health Enterprise Foundation in Kenya, a micro-franchise network of outlets that extend afford-able health care and medicines to rural areas,which includes community pharmacies and community-based clinics that employ certifiednurses. IFC's Grassroots Business Initiative helpedthe network to become autonomous by provid-ing capital loans to partially support the organi-zation's efforts to improve its operational per- formance and franchise management. Anotherexample is GNRC community pharmacy outletsin northeast India. The Advisory Service projectwas to transform community \"medi-shops\" intoretail pharmacies delivering not just medicines, but also health planning and counsel-ing. This was done with a partner-ship between IFC and GNRC Hospital,with IFC providing advice on businessoperations.IFC'S HEALTH STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS 87IFC initiated its IFC Against AIDS program in 2000. Its mission is to protect people and profitability by being a risk-management part-ner, HIV/AIDS expert, and catalyst for action. The program hasthree objectives: to prevent new infections, to deal with or man-age existing infections, and to mitigate the effect of HIV on the com-pany itself. The biggest beneficiaries of the initiative have beencompanies in Africa, but IFC has been trying to expand to otherRegions and countries as well (China and Russia). Except for oneoperation conducted by the Private Enterprise Partnership forAfrica (PEP-Africa), all IFC Against AIDS work is directly related to IFC investments. Completion Reports have been issued for IFC Against AIDS pro- gram components, with the following findings: The program objective has been relevant and aligns with the strategic directions and priorities of IFC. It takes advantage ofIFC's position with private sector clients and links their corpo-rate risk management issues to the social agenda. By target-ing workers, IFC Against AIDS is able to work with the adult population, which is difficult to reach by traditional healthawareness campaigns (IFC 2006, p. 27). The program has developed products and services, tools, and publications to implement HIV/AIDS policies and training pro-grams in businesses. As of January 2008, the program hadreached 88,000 employees and over 628,000 people in nearbycommunities (IFC 2008). In Africa, the program engaged in ac-tivities ranging from large seminars to assisting individual firms(large companies and small and medium enterprises) as well asnongovernmental organizations. In India, it worked with fourclient companies (covering about 20 sites nationally) to pro-actively address HIV/AIDS in the workplace, clinical facilities,and communities at risk. IFC prepared and disseminated stud- ies on Occupational Health and HIV/AIDS Perceptions in Rus-sia and a briefing book on HIV/AIDS in China. IFC Against AIDS often relies on other departments/operations to reach potential clients. Since it is targeted to IFC clients, closecooperation across IFC was critical. However, in a joint projectwith the Africa Project Development Facility (APDF, predeces-sor of PEP-Africa), the training program lost momentum be-cause of IFC organizational changes and shifting strategicpriorities. Similarly, IFC Against AIDS encountered a problem about the selection criteria of the small and medium enter-prises, which were opportunistic and resulted in the inclusionof some businesses that were not linked to IFC activities. The project in China only delivered a handbook after nearly two years of implementation. Although the project seems to havebeen in support of business development aligned with IFC'svalue added on the AIDS agenda, IFC appears to have droppedthe project after the business development mission to the coun-try. IFC did not achieve the two goals\u2014increased involvementof private enterprises in the fight against HIV/AIDS by being arisk-management partner to clients, and being supportive of IFC'sbusiness development by providing value-added services andcontributing to IFC's brand. Since 2006, IFC Against AIDS has incorporated a broader ap- proach that also considers tuberculosis, malaria, and maternalhealth. Although it has been in operation for seven years, IFC Against AIDS has not been subject to a systematic outcome and impact assessment of the whole program. In December2007, IFC launched a comprehensive external evaluation of theprogram.Box 5.3: IFC Against AIDS: A Preliminary Assessment Source: IEG review of Project Completion Reports. IFC has started to assist social enterprises thatdirectly serve rural andpoor people.IFC's Institutional Arrangements for the Health Sector The activities and responsibilities in IFC re- lated to the health sector are fragmentedand linked to different departments, placinga premium on coordination across units. While health facilities and service providers are the responsibility of the Health and EducationDepartment, the industries related to the healthsector\u2014pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and 88IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Table 5.5: Percentage of Health and IFC Projects Rated High, PCR Pilots 1 and 2 Between 2003 and 2005, Romania privatized dialysis services. Previously, inpatient and outpatient dialysis services were pro-vided in about 40 public hospitals. Dialysis supplies were pur-chased by the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), and theequipment was purchased by the government and allocated to thehospitals. Funding difficulties and increasing demand for ser-vices had created a backlog of patients, and the facilities neededto be upgraded and expanded. IFC's Advisory Services helped the government: (i) revise and update national dialysis standards and practices and preparelegislation, including harmonization with European Union clinicalguidelines; (ii) establish regional survey reporting of dialysis costand prices; (iii) conduct cost analysis of dialysis; and (iv) createmodel tender documents. The partnership was structured as a contract for dialysis ser- vices between the government and private service providers,who became owners. The Ministry of Health set prices, and theprivate operators were required to re-equip the facilities andprovide about 200,000 outpatients a year with dialysis treatmentsat quality and service standards comparable to those of the Eu-ropean Union. The individual contracts, totaling \u20ac20 million per year, could be extended if the operator constructed a new facil-ity within 18 months. All public patients were to receive free treat-ment, and the operators were to be reimbursed by the NHIF underspecified fee schedules. The Advisory Services project introduced transparency into government procurement processes. In 2004, NHIF conductedsimultaneous tenders for eight dialysis centers, with strict pre-qualification criteria to ensure participation of experienced providers.Bidders were restricted to winning two centers to limit marketconcentration. Winning bidders were selected based on highest in-vestment commitments. The average investment commitment in acenter was $2 million, which was realized within 18 months afterawarding the contracts. NHIF did not have to finance the modern-ization from public funds and there were significant operational costsavings to NHIF (estimated at about $4 million). The project improvedpatient services at lower cost to the national health system. The qual-ity of services and patient satisfaction increased at lower cost be-cause of the new standards, improved equipment and facilities, andmore efficient organizational structure.

How-ever, that group also handles investments inproducts, such as biotechnology, cosmetics, andnutritional products. 14Advisory Services are the re- sult of the work of different units across IFC: theInfrastructure Advisory Department, Small andMedium Enterprise Department, and numerousRegional facilities, as well as Regional departmentsand the Health and Education Department. Be-yond this, other IFC units implement health-relatedprojects with varying degrees of specialization. IFC's organizational structure is broadly in line with the traditional organization of thehealth sector, but recent developments inthe sector pose challenges to this structure.Historically, there has been a clear separation inthe industry between the main players\u2014manu-facturers and health providers. However, thehealth care market is becoming more integrated.The boundaries between statutory and privatehealth insurance are becoming blurred; payers andproviders are coming together in integrated healthcare provision and e-health; and the industry andhealth insurance companies are developing jointbusiness models. 15These developments require more integrated approaches to business devel-opment and client service in IFC's health sector.Many of IFC's potential clients are operating inboth pharmaceutical and service provision, andthese two are complementary in addressing healthoutcomes. In IFC, groups dealing with health arepart of different departments, and incentives dif-fer and have inhibited response to business op-portunities and implementation of cross-sectoralinitiatives. The Health and Education Department is small\u2014until recently the smallest of IFC'sinvestment operations departments. The Department averaged 19 full-time/full-year pro-fessional staff between 2001 and 2005. 16The num- ber of staff increased by 42 percent, to 27, from2006 to 2007. Investment officers in the depart-ment are not specialized and cover both thehealth and education sectors. Between 2001 and2008, 56 percent of the department's staff time wasspent on health sector activities. Orig- inally, the Life Sciences Group withinthe Global Manufacturing and ServicesDepartment had a sector leader, five in-vestment officers, and two analysts. By2007, another investment officer and alife sciences specialist joined the group. IFC's activities have tended to complement World Bank Group operations, but efforts tocollaborate and pursue synergies have notbeen consistent. IFC's support to expand the production of vaccines and to improve access tomedicine for diseases such as malaria in EastAfrica had strong complementarities with WorldBank HNP strategies and operations. In a fewcases, IFC projects followed from the World Bank'ssupport in sector policy reform, with in-tensive collaboration between the twoinstitutions. For example, a hospitalinvestment in Argentina was developedin close collaboration with the WorldBank and sequenced with World Bankprojects. 17However, efforts to exploit synergies as outlined in the sectorstrategies have not been consistent. InJuly 2008, for example, IFC's Health and Educa-tion Department pointed out that \"one possiblebarrier to working together is a lack of knowledgeand understanding of the strategy and processesof the IBRD and IFC\" and called for a dialogue withits colleagues from the World Bank in order to\"begin a more focused dialogue.\" The institu-tional fragmentation of health across several unitsat IFC also inhibits greater collaboration withWorld Bank staff. Given that most of IFC's operations in the health sector are in middle-income coun-tries, coordination with the World Bank inthe health sector faces the same inhibitorsidentified by IEG's study on middle-incomecountries. These include incompatible timelines for projects, differences in organizational culture,and staff concerns that their time can neither beeasily allocated to cooperation nor recognizedin performance assessments (IEG 2007b, p. 63).This is further complicated for health by the asym-metry in the size of IFC interventions relative toIFC'S HEALTH STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS 89Health sector activities and responsibilities in IFCare segmented and linkedto different departments,implying a need forcoordination. IFC's health activities have tocomplement Bankoperations, but efforts tocollaborate and pursuesynergies have beeninconsistent.Bank operations. Although collaboration at the op- erational level turns out to be impractical, thereis recognition that collaboration to develop the ap-propriate environment (policy level) for privateinvestment would be beneficial. World Bank as-sistance in creating the regulatory environment forprivate sector operations could help to attractprivate investment by establishing appropriate in-centives to invest (eliminating the constraint of lagof regulation in the sector). Collaboration between the World Bank and IFC in health has been sit-uational rather than systematic.Currently, IFC's investment officers arecommunicating with the World Bank'shealth sector experts during project ap- praisal. Advisory Services for public-private part-nerships, which naturally involve governmententities, have active communication within theWorld Bank Group, but there is a limit because ofthe ethical guidelines concerning the actual andperceived conflicts of interest. However, those in-teractions depend on the initiative of particularpeople and are driven by transactions. There is no systematic avenue of collaboration between the two institutions in developingIFC strategies in health. Because of IFC's opportunistic approach in iden-tifying health investment in most coun-tries, its health sector operations rarelyfeature in the Bank-IFC joint CASs. 18 Social Impacts of IFC Health Investments The 2002 strategy did not specify approachesto address poverty, though it recognizedthe need to assess the potential for privateparticipation in health. IFC strategies for health investment have limited direct references topoverty. The 1999 Note on Strategic Directions,for example, highlighted the potential of IFChealth investments to improve health outcomesacross the entire population and among the poor(IFC Health Care Best Practice Group 1999). In theimplementation of the 2002 health strategy, IFCaimed to diversify its portfolio to indirectly pro-mote access to health care services for poor peo-ple by improving access to and quality of healthservices for the lower-middle and middle class (IFC2002, p. 39) and by working with not-for-profit institutions (IFC 2002, p. 5). Then, in a 2007 brief-ing to the Board of Directors, the Department ofHealth and Education stated that its projects androle were changing, and that it had begun tofocus on clients serving lower-income popula-tions (IFC 2007d, p. 18). The Life Science Group,for its part, has identified three strategic areaswhere it can contribute to the fight against diseasesthat disproportionately affect poor people in de-veloping countries (IFC 2007c): the productionof generic pharmaceuticals, innovation and re-search to help discover technologies or treat-ments for diseases that affect poor people, andneglected diseases that affect people in develop-ing countries. IFC's investments in health services, mainly hospitals, have benefited primarily upper-and middle-income people at and WRI 2007).Among the 12 hospitals in the third period forwhich information is available, 3 were mainly tar-geted to expatriates and 6 were aimed at high- andmiddle-income populations. Among the evalu-ated hospitals, only 1 had a confirmed linkage witha public insurance scheme that paid for treat-ment of complicated cases referred to public hos-pitals. In other cases, links to public insurancefunds helped private diagnostics and laboratoryservice providers to serve people's needs, irre-spective of income level, as observed in two eval-uated projects. Freestanding facilities can besuccessful and provide some desired develop-ment outcomes, but linkages to other institu-tional arrangements, such as insurance, arenecessary to meet the health needs of a wider pop-ulation. Among the evaluated projects in the firsttwo periods, only three had such features. All of IFC's clients in the hospital sector have some initiatives that directly targetunderserved populations . In addition, some clients provide free or reduced-price access tohealth care. Others target patients with healthinsurance coverage (often through employers),which allows hospitals to reach a much widerpopulation as well as the middle class. IFC's clienthospitals and clinics also typically have or con- 90IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Collaboration has been more situational than systematic; IFC's investments rarely feature in joint CASs. IFC's projects are small in scale and geographically scattered, limiting the overall impact.tribute to dedicated foundations for charitable activities and community programs that targetthe poor and disadvantaged. Contributions nor-mally account for 1 to 5 percent of their income.However, IFC's additionality in this area is verylimited\u2014many clients were involved in charitableactivities even before IFC investment. In June2008, IFC and the World Bank engaged in a proj-ect that seeks to help improve maternal careamong some of Yemen's poorest people. Thisproject uses output-based aid to reach the poor.New opportunities also are arising within the re-cent IFC Business of Health in Africa initiative. IFC's life sciences interventions, particu- larly in pharmaceuticals, have the potentialfor broader reach and for more direct ben-efits to the poor. Household surveys through- out the developing world have shown thatpharmaceuticals account for more than half of allhealth spending by people in the lowest incomegroups (Hammond and others 2007). Thus, in-vestments by IFC in pharmaceutical projects thatreduce the costs of drugs and improve quality con-trol have great potential for helping the poor. The majority of the pharmaceutical proj- ects financed by IFC have resulted in sig-nificant declines in the price of genericdrugs, enhancing affordability. Four of the six evaluated projects in pharmaceuticals involveproduction of generic drugs .The introduction of generic drugs in Mexico in 1999 resulted in a 30percent decline in prices, and in Brazil, genericproducts cost an average of 40 percent less thanbrand-name products (Homedes, Ugalde, andForns 2005, p. 695). Some projects, especially inChina and India, are concentrated on the do-mestic markets and use local inputs. Since IFCpromotes Good Manufacturing Practices and otherinternational standards necessary for many ex-port markets, some of the generic drugs are ex-ported to neighboring countries. Only one projecthad confirmed success in penetrating export markets with certification fromthe regulatory authority. One projecthad an objective to establish a researchand development facility in a pharma-ceutical company. However, as thesponsor company's business objectivesshifted away from proprietary drug pro-duction because of the competitivepressure from international producers as well asstrategic shifts toward generic drug production tothe U.S. market, the company reduced its researchand development functions, which resulted infewer jobs for local scientists and lab technicians.This demonstrates the high-risk nature of researchand development in drug production. In summary, the health sector is still relatively new to IFC, and the approach to investment hasremained largely a matter of seizing opportunitiesrather than developing them within a clear strate-gic framework. IFC's investments in the health sec-tor are still small and geographically scattered.There were marked improvements in the per-formance of the small health invest-ment portfolio, mainly in hospitals, andimportant lessons were learned leadingup to the 2002 strategy. The expansionof public-private partnerships sup-ported through Advisory Services hasbeen an important development withpotential to contribute to improved efficiency ofthe health sector of developing countries. Greaterdiversification of the portfolio, particularly towardpharmaceuticals and health insurance, would im-prove the social impact of the health investmentportfolio and bring it more in line with the ob-jectives of the 2002 strategy and the mandate ofthe World Bank Group. Closer collaboration withthe World Bank on private sector regulatory issueswith respect to the health and pharmaceuticalsectors would improve the climate for expandingIFC health investment and Advisory Services.

Poor health is both a causeand consequence of poverty and an impedimentto economic growth. This evaluation has pointedto some important accomplishments of the WorldBank's HNP support to countries, often in difficultsettings, and its contribution in helping build gov-ernment capacity to manage the sector. The latteris important for improving aid effectiveness moregenerally, given the increasing reliance of the in-ternational community on government systems.The evaluation has also found improving per-formance in IFC's health portfolio and importantlessons learned in this small but expanding sector. The fieldwork for this evaluation also points to areas where the World Bank and IFC con-tinue to add value (box 6.1). The results are a reminder that the value added by the World BankGroup is not measured solely by the magnitudeof its support, and that its actual comparative ad-vantage or that of any other development partnerdepends not only on its institutional assets, butalso on the country context, health needs, and theactivities of others. Looking forward, the developments in the international aid architecture for healthover the past decade and the increased lev- els of assistance from other sources presentboth opportunities and challenges for theWorld Bank Group. In the context of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness , the Bank has an opportunity to leverage its experience to helpgovernments strengthen their capacity to man-age effectively their own resources as well as thenew donor funding being channeled throughgovernment. While the Bank's resources are nowa smaller share of global development assistancefor health, the Bank nevertheless continues tobring key institutional assets to the table: long-term, sustained engagement in the sector; ex-perience in many countries with similar issues;a history of support for building country capac-ity for implementing social sector investments;sustained large-scale financing; strong links to theMinistry of Finance, which can be critically im-portant both in leveraging reforms and in im-proving the dialogue between the ministries ofhealth and finance; and a country approach inwhich HNP support is part of a portfolio of ac-tivities in many sectors, some of them with po-tential complementary contributions to healthoutcomes. These are assets that the Bank can con-tinue to bring to bear on making health systemswork better and to ensure that health benefitsreach the poor. The global aid architecture in health has changed over the past decade with the adoption of international goals and a major expansion of thelevels and sources of development assistance, particularly for low- income countries. The World Bank Group's support for health, nutrition,and population has been sustained over the decade, but it is now a smallershare of global HNP assistance.The evaluation has also revealed substantial challenges for the future. About a third of the Bank's HNP support is not performing well, andthere has been no sign of improvement. Con-tributing factors are the increasing complexity ofHNP operations, particularly in Africa but also insupport of health reform to middle-income coun-tries; inadequate risk assessment and mitigation;and weak M&E. The Bank has underinvested insupport to reduce high fertility and malnutritionamong the poor. The performance of IFC's health investments has improved markedly, but the pro-gram has been less successful in expanding in-vestment in activities that both make businesssense and are likely to yield broader benefits forthe poor. Accountability for results has beenweak\u2014both the accountability of Bank- and IFC-supported projects for ensuring that results haveactually reached the poor, and the accountabilityof the projects supported by the Bank's non- 96IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Field interviews for this evaluation point to major areas in which the World Bank's policy dialogue, analytic work, technical advice,and lending have added value to HNP in countries. In Peru , officials valued highly the Bank's ability to mobilize financial and human resources and connect technical assis-tance with financial services; its experience with health reformsin countries with similar conditions; its poverty focus, under-scored by highly effective analytic work providing an \"outsider's\"perspective; its long-term relationship, which has helped to main-tain a medium-term agenda and dialogue on health in the faceof high turnover in the sector; and its institutional culture, whichhas emphasized outcome-oriented projects, efficiency, and trans-parency in the allocation of resources. In the Kyrgyz Republic , the Bank played a leadership role, mediating conflicts among the donors and using its leverage tokeep health reform on the political agenda in the face of strongopposition. It built institutional capacity over time in the Ministryof Health, was able to intervene to work out implementation de-tails, and provided capacity-building inputs for public sector fi-duciary management. The country would have implemented healthreforms even without the Bank, but respondents felt that progresswould have been more limited geographically and institutionally,resources would have been used less efficiently, and there wouldhave been less focus on improving access for the poor. In Nepal , the Bank brought value added with its poverty focus, analytic work, and living standards surveys focusing on the healthof the poor. It helped to strengthen national capacity to lead andmanage donor funds and provided technical assistance for mon-itoring social sector expenditures and for financial managementin support of the SWAp. Without the Bank, there would havebeen less financing of civil works and training of village healthworkers, a weaker poverty focus, and less attention to public ex- penditures and expenditure frameworks. Other donors likely wouldnot have participated in the SWAp without the Bank's involvement. In Malawi, the Bank's value added took the form of leadership on procurement and financial management in support of thehealth SWAp and individual operations; increased knowledgethrough analytic work, exchange of experience, facilitating ac-cess to expertise, and an attempt to maintain the focus on out-comes; and its convening power and strong links with the sectoraland macro level. The proposed health interventions likely would have occurred in Eritrea even without the Bank's involvement, but not on the same scale. The Bank's engagement brought credibility and eventualsupport from others in the international community, built the in-stitutional capacity of the Ministry of Health, and highlighted theneed to focus both on the supply of health care and on commu-nity demands, and on both hardware and software. Respondents also expressed views on the \"additionality\" of IFC's health support. Often IFC was the only source of long-termfinance (loan and equity) where private investments in the healthsector were considered risky and local banks did not have ex-perience in financing the sector. A pharmaceutical business inChina emphasized that IFC's value added was not so much its fi-nancial contribution, but the value of its \"stamp of approval\" inenvironmental and social standards, which provides a level ofcomfort to the other investors. Another company said that IFC'sassociation with the World Bank Group, a public entity, facilitatedpublic-private partnerships with local authorities. A third clientvalued IFC's role as an honest broker between stakeholders, in-cluding government and regulatory agencies, to increase visibilityand bring strategic partners to the project.Box 6.1: Evolving Value Added of the World Bank Group HNP Sources: as water supply and sanita- tion and transport, for demonstrating the healthbenefits of their investments. The expansion of external assistance for health also featured a large increase in re-sources earmarked for specific infectiousdiseases or other programs within the healthsector. Many of these previously attracted in- sufficient attention. T o the extent that largeamounts of earmarked support have the poten-tial to adversely distort resources within the healthsystems of small countries to the detriment ofother critical services for the poor, the Bank needsto consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether ad-ditional earmarked funds of its own for some ofthe same programs are appropriate and cost-effective in improving health, nutrition, and pop-ulation outcomes, given possible alternative in-vestments elsewhere in the health system. In short, the new international aid archi- tecture has provided the World Bank Groupwith opportunities to improve health out-comes among the poor, to prevent povertydue to illness, and to improve the efficiencyand efficacy of health systems. By improv- ing their performance and maintaining focus onthese core objectives, the Bank Group has the po-tential to contribute not only to meeting the Mil-lennium Development Goals but also to ensuringthat the poor benefit and that the benefits will besustained. Recommendations The following recommendations for the WorldBank and IFC are offered to help improve the im-plementation and impact of their respective HNPstrategies and further the mandate of poverty re-duction and economic growth in the context ofthe new aid architecture. 1. Intensify efforts to improve the per- formance of the World Bank's health,nutrition, and population support. Match project design to country context and capacity and reduce the complexity ofprojects in low-capacity settings throughgreater selectivity, prioritization, and se- quencing of activities, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Thoroughly and carefully assess the risks of proposed HNP support and strategies tomitigate them, particularly the political risksand the interests of different stakeholders,and how they will be addressed. Phase reforms to maximize the probability of success. Undertake thorough institutional analysis, in- cluding an assessment of alternatives, as aninput into more realistic project design. Support intensified supervision in the field by the Bank and the borrower to ensurethat civil works, equipment, and other out-puts have been delivered as specified, arefunctioning, and are being maintained. 2. Renew the commitment to health, nu- trition, and population outcomes amongthe poor. The World Bank should: Boost population and family planning and other support in the form of analyticwork, policy dialogue, and financing to high-fertility countries and countries with pock-ets of high fertility. Incorporate the poverty dimension into project objectives to increase accountabilityfor health, nutrition, and population out-comes among the poor. Increase support to reduce malnutrition among the poor, whether originating in theHNP sector or other sectors. Monitor health, nutrition, and popula- tion outcomes among the poor, howeverdefined. Bring the health and nutrition of the poor and the links between high fertility, poorhealth, and poverty back into poverty as-sessments in countries where they havebeen neglected. IFC should: Expand support for innovative approaches and viable business models that demon-CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 97strate private sector solutions to improve the health of the poor, including expansion ofinvestments in low-cost generic drugs andtechnologies that address health problemsof the poor. Assess the external and internal constraints to achieving broad social impacts in thesector. 3. Strengthen the World Bank Group's abil- ity to help countries to improve the ef-ficiency of health systems. Improving the efficiency of health systems may only indi- rectly produce health benefits, but it is a validobjective in its own right, contributing to moresustainable financing and economic growth.Health reform projects address structural in-efficiencies, are inherently politicized, andthus are risky. However, they are neverthe-less worth pursuing if deemed relevant and ahigh priority of government. The World Bank should: Better define the efficiency objectives of its support and how efficiency improvementswill be improved and monitored. Carefully assess decisions to finance addi- tional earmarked communicable disease ac-tivities in countries where other donors arecontributing large amounts of earmarkeddisease funding and additional funds couldresult in distortions in allocations and inef-ficiencies in the rest of the health system. Support improved health information sys- tems and more frequent and vigorous eval-uation of specific reforms or program in-novations to provide timely information forimproving efficiency and efficacy. IFC should: Support public-private partnerships through Advisory Services to government and in-dustry and through its investments, and ex-pand investments in health insurance. Improve collaboration and joint sector work with the World Bank, leveraging Bank sec-tor dialogue on regulatory frameworks for health to engage new private actors withvalue added to the sector, and more sys-tematically coordinate with the Bank's pol-icy interventions regarding private sectorparticipation in health. 4. Enhance the contribution of support from other sectors to health, nutrition,and population outcomes. The World Bank should: When the benefits are potentially great in re- lation to the marginal costs, incorporatehealth objectives into nonhealth projects, forwhich they are accountable. Improve the complementarity of investment operations in health and other sectors toachieve health, nutrition, and populationoutcomes, particularly between health andwater supply and sanitation. Prioritize sectoral participation in multisec- toral HNP projects according to the com-parative advantages and institutional man-dates to reduce complexity. Identify new incentives for Bank staff to work cross-sectorally for improving health,nutrition, and population outcomes. Develop mechanisms to ensure that the im- plementation and results for small HNPcomponents retrofitted into projects areproperly documented and evaluated. IFC should: Improve incentives and institutional mech- anisms for an integrated approach to healthissues across units in IFC dealing with health,including the way that IFC is organized. 5. Implement the results agenda and im- prove governance by boosting invest-ment in and incentives for evaluation.Weak M&E is a constraint to achieving the re-sults focus and governance agenda of theBank's new HNP strategy and inhibits the re-sults orientation of IFC. 98IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATIONThe World Bank should: Create new incentives for M&E, for both the Bank and the borrower, linked to theproject approval process and the midtermreview. This would include requirementsfor baseline data, explicit evaluation designsfor pilot activities in project appraisal doc-uments, and periodic evaluation of mainproject activities as a management tool.IFC should: Enhance its results orientation by develop- ing clearly specified baseline indicators andan evaluation framework that adequatelymeasure IFC's health sector objectives andresults.CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 99AppendixesAn auxiliary nurse midwife speaking to slum dwellers about contraception and other sexual health matters in India.

HNPcommitments include the amounts committedunder sector codes JA (health), BK (compulsoryhealth finance), FB (noncompulsory health fi-nance) and other historic codes for HE, to HNP were calculated by tak- ing the total amount of each project allocated tothese codes. 1Because there is often more than one sector code, even for HNP-managed proj-ects, it means that less than 100 percent of the costof a loan or credit is actually being counted. Note,too, that for multisectoral Development PolicyLoans that are essentially direct budget supportto the government, the allocation across sectorcodes is entirely notional and does not reflectearmarked funds for any sector.

T ransportprojects managed by other sector boards were ex-cluded because the resources needed to trackdown the relatively small number of such projectswere not warranted. 2Thus, transport projects re- lated to improvements of air quality that fell eitherunder the Environment Sector Board or werefunded through the Global Environment Facility(GEF) have not been reviewed.World Bank HNP Staffing The analysis of HNP staffing in chapter 2 usesfour sets of data on World Bank staff in the HNPsector provided by the Bank's Human ResourcesDepartment: 1.Master dataset of HNP staff. This is a mas- ter dataset of all Bank staff at levels GF andhigher as of the end of every fiscal year (June30), from fiscal 1997 to 2007, who were mappedto the HNP sector. Staff members below levelGF are not systematically mapped to a sector,so are excluded from the analysis. The datasetsincluded the following data for each individual:fiscal year; UPI (staff identification) number; pri-mary managing unit Bank; years in the PMU; whether postedat in field; duty 3pro- gram name; whethera former Young Professional.

As of June 25, 2007.APPENDIX B: DEFINITION OF THE SAMPLES USED FOR PORTFOLIO REVIEWS AND WORLD BANK HNP STAFF ANALYSIS 125was provided separately for each fiscal year and merged by IEG. This provided the basis fora master panel dataset from which it is possi-ble to track the movement of staff into and outof the sector, using the UPI number as theidentifier. 2.Hub dataset. This is a dataset of all Bank staff and consultants level GE and higher assignedto the \"hub\" or \"anchor,\" for the period fiscal1997-2007. The \"hub\" was defined as includ-ing the units HDDHE and its successor HDNHE(the HNP hub), and HDNGA (the central unitfor the AIDS program, established in 2004).The data and variables assembled for hub stafflevels GF and higher are identical to those forthe master HNP staff dataset. However, thisdataset also includes staff at level GE and inother categories, such as junior professional as-sociates, junior professional officers, cotermi-nous staff, and special assignments, who wereworking in those units. 3.New hires. A dataset of all new hires of indi- viduals directly into the World Bank HNP sec-tor. The variables available included all of thevariables in the master HNP staff dataset, plusthe effective date of the hire. 4.Exits. A dataset of all terminations of individ- uals from the World Bank who were mappedto the HNP sector at the time that they left. Thisincludes, for example, resignations, retirements,and deaths of HNP staff. The variables avail-able for analysis included all of the variables in the master HNP staff dataset, plus the effec-tive date that of the hire and the reason fortermination. Only a few corrections were made to the original data for the analysis. First, the original data in-cluded several individuals mapped to units in IFCwho were dropped. No other individuals weredropped, though in a number of instances the unitcodes did not seem to pertain to health (for ex-ample, the Board, Staff Association, External Af-fairs, Commodity Risk Group). Second, in thenew hire and exit datasets there were often du-plicates associated with conversions from onetype of assignment to another\u2014for example, theperson appears as a new hire, then an exit, thena new hire shortly thereafter in another assign-ment type. In those instances, the first time that the individual appears was used for the purposesof counting the number of new hires and their age,and in the exit dataset instances were excludedof those who had been converted to a new as-signment type. The last observation was used ifthere was more than one appearance and theperson was no longer at the Bank (or at least nolonger in the HNP sector at the Bank). Country Assistance Strategies The desk review of CASs included a sample of the211 CASs approved from fiscal 1997 to 2006. Inlight of the large number of countries in three Re-gions, the study reviewed: (a) all CASs for East Asia,the Middle East and North Africa, and South Asia;and (b) a random sample consisting of roughly halfof all CASs for Europe and Central Asia, LatinAmerica and the Caribbean, and Africa (table B.4).The results reported in chapters 2 and 4 havebeen weighted to take the stratification of thesample into account. A list of the CASs actually re-viewed can be found in Sinha and Gaubatz 2009. IFC Portfolio of Investment Projects and Advisory Services The portfolio of 52 IFC health projects reviewed in chapter 5 includes 35 active and 17 closed proj-ects approved from fiscal 1997 to 2007 (appendixD). Active projects are those for which IFC has fi-nancial exposure; closed projects are those withwhich IFC no longer has a financial relationship.Health sector projects included those with thehealth and pharmaceuticals sector code and ad-ditional projects with business objectives relatedto health (for example, a medical training projectwith an education sector code). Dropped projects,cancellations, rights issues, reschedulings, re-structurings, supplementary investments made inthe context of previously approved projects, in-vestments through the Africa Enterprise Fundand Small Enterprise Fund, and individual in-vestments under agency lines were excluded. 4 Chapter 5 assesses the performance of IFC proj-ects that reached \"early operating maturity.\" 5The performance of mature projects was assessedthrough either detailed Expanded Project Super-vision Reports (XPSRs) prepared by the investment126IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION departments and validated by IEG, or by IEG's desk review of project information for those not cov-ered by an Expanded Project Supervision Report.For projects that had not yet reached early oper-ating maturity, IEG gathered information abouteach project's characteristics and design, as wellas information on implementation status in the su-pervision reports. Field visits supplemented theinformation gathered by the desk review. The ob-jective of the field visits was to conduct in-depthvalidation and interviews linked to ongoing andcompleted investments and Advisory Services.The five countries visited were selected to achieveRegional balance, to have more than one currentor past IFC health investment, to include invest-ments in different time periods, and to include dif-ferent types of investments (for example, hospitalsand pharmaceuticals). During field visits, IFC clients, government agency officials, health-related professional and business associations,relevant multilateral and/or bilateral developmentorganizations with private sector portfolios, andother stakeholders were interviewed. For Advisory Service projects, the monitoring and evaluation system was still in a pilot phase. IEGreviewed all health projects covered by the pre-vious rounds of project completion report (PCR)pilots, as well as desk review of approval and su-pervision documents for projects not covered bythe PCR. Interviews were conducted with IFCand World Bank managers, sector specialists, in-vestment officers, and project task managers.Table B.4: Country Assistance Strategies Issued in Fiscal Years 1997-2006, by Region and Year, and the IEG Sample for Review Reviewed Region 1997-2001 2002-06 Total sample Sub-Saharan Africa 29 26 55 31 Europe and Central Asia 31 29 60 29Latin America and the Caribbean 20 20 40 21East Asia & Pacific 12 11 23 23Middle East and North Africa 9 10 19 19 South Asia 7 7 14 14 Total 108 103 211 137127APPENDIX C: WORLD BANK HNP SECTOR PROJECTS APPROVED IN FISCAL YEARS 1997-2007 Appendix C: World Bank HNP Sector Projects Approved in Fiscal Years 1997-2007 HNP commitment ($US millions) Fiscal year Project Total Total approved ID Project name Country IBRD IDA HNP commitment 1997 P006059 Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition II Argentina 95.0 0.0 95.0 100.0 1997 P043418 AIDS and STD Control Argentina 11.9 0.0 11.9 15.01997 Essential Hospital Services Bosnia-Herzegovina 0.0 14.4 14.4 15.01997 P004034 Disease Control and Health Development Cambodia 0.0 27.7 27.7 30.41997 P010473 Tuberculosis Control India 0.0 129.6 129.6 142.41997 P010511 Malaria Control India 0.0 159.9 India 0.0 223.5 223.5 Iodine Deficiency Control Indonesia 19.1 0.0 19.1 28.51997 P001999 Health Sector Development Program Niger 0.0 37.6 37.6 40.01997 P007927 Maternal Health/Child Development Paraguay 19.2 0.0 19.2 21.81997 P008814 Health Reform Pilot Russian Federation 66.0 0.0 66.0 P041567 Endemic Disease Senegal 0.0 13.9 13.9 14.91997 P010526 Health Services Sri Lanka 0.0 17.5 17.5 18.81997 P009095 Primary Health Care Services Turkey 13.3 0.0 13.3 14.51998 P045312 Health Recovery Albania 0.0 13.9 13.9 17.01998 P050140 Health Armenia 0.0 8.4 8.4 10.01998 P037857 Health and Population Program Bangladesh 0.0 242.5 242.5 Health Comoros 0.0 6.7 Services Dominican Republic 28.2 0.0 28.2 30.01998 P039084 Health Services Modernization Ecuador 40.5 0.0 40.5 45.01998 P045175 Health Sector Egypt, Arab Rep. of 0.0 90.0 90.0 90.01998 P043124 Health Eritrea 0.0 17.2 HNP Gambia 0.0 17.8 17.8 18.01998 P000949 Health Sector Support Ghana 0.0 33.6 33.6 35.01998 P035688 National Health Development Program Guinea-Bissau 0.0 10.8 10.8 11.71998 P010496 Orissa Health Systems India P036956 Safe Motherhood Indonesia 41.2 0.0 41.2 42.5 (Table continues next page)128IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Appendix C: World Bank HNP Sector Projects Approved in Fiscal Years 1997-2007 (continued) HNP commitment ($US millions) Fiscal year Project Total Total approved ID Project name Country IBRD IDA HNP commitment 1998 P001568 Community Nutrition II Madagascar 0.0 19.3 19.3 27.6 1998 P035689 Health Sector Investment Program Mauritania 0.0 23.8 23.8 24.01998 P007720 Health System Reform -

However, the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairoshifted the focus of population programs awayfrom fertility reduction and family planning andtoward women's health, economic and social fac-tors affecting the demand for children, and theright to reproductive health care (Robinson andRoss 2007). Shortly thereafter, the internationalcommunity's attention was drawn to addressingthe rising threat of HIV/AIDS; sectorwide ap-proaches in health; and, following the recom-mendations of the World Development Report 1993, delivery of a package of basic or essential health services for the poor. The Bank's 1999 population strategy (World Bank 1999c) committed to assist countries to link pop-ulation to poverty reduction and human devel-opment; advocate for cost-effective policies thatreflect country context; build on analysis and di-alogue; provide sustained support; and strengthenskills and partnerships. A year later, the MDGswere adopted with no explicit family planning orreproductive health goal, even though both arekey to achieving many of the other MDGs. The focus of the Bank's support for reducing fertility and population growth declined overthe decade, and family planning became oneof many components of an essential package of health or reproductive health services.Over the period fiscal 1997 to 2006, the Bank ap-proved only 14 population projects, defined for thepurposes of the review as those with populationin the title and/or including an objective to reducefertility, or with a population or family planning com-ponent or subcomponent. 2Population projects thus defined represented about 6 percent of theHNP lending portfolio, declining from 11 to 2 per-cent of the portfolio over the decade. The popu-lation projects approved in three-quarters of thecountries were preceded by population projects.Those in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Kenyarepresented the last in a long series stretchingback to the 1970s. However, the series ended dur-ing the period under review, replaced by operationsfocusing on reproductive health or sectorwideactivities. The Bank's population support was directed to only about a quarter of the 35 countrieswith high fertility. Among the 13 countries that received Bank support, 8 had a total fertility rateof 5.0 or greater. Only one freestanding popula-tion project was approved\u2014the Population andFamily Planning Learning and Innovation Loanin Malawi, which implemented community-baseddistribution of family planning in rural areas on apilot basis. T wo of the projects packaged popu-lation and AIDS activities, three were linked to ma-ternal and child health or reproductive health, andeight were part of a health or HNP sector project.The main activities financed by these projects in-cluded: training health workers; information, ed-ucation, and communication on family planningand the benefits smaller contraceptives,including social activitiesAPPENDIX E: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR POPULATIONfor women and youth. Almost all of the support was to low-income countries. None of the projects with explicit fertility or population objectives achieved them. Thethree projects with population or familyplanning components but no explicit fertilityobjective 3at least partially achieved their ob- jectives. Eleven of the population projects ap- proved from fiscal 1997 to 2006 have closed; only3 had satisfactory outcomes. In Guinea, India,Kenya, and Mali, modern contraceptive use andfertility were scarcely affected. 4In Russia, the abortion rate declined in project areas at thesame rate as in nonproject areas, while moderncontraceptive use was stagnant. In Bangladesh,Gambia, and Senegal, fertility declined some-what, but there is significant doubt about links tothe support of the Bank, other donors, or publicpolicy more generally. 5Bangladesh had experi- enced a spectacular decline in fertility\u2014from 7children per woman in the 1970s to 3.3 by 1999\u2014in large part because of a highly successful fam-ily planning program supported by the Bank andother donors (IEG 2005b). From 1999 to 2004, fer-tility continued to decline to 3.0 and the contra-ceptive prevalence rate rose from about 50 to 60percent, but it is unlikely that this is primarily at-tributable to the family planning program sup-ported by the Health and Population SectorProgram, given the disruption in service deliverycaused by the controversy in attempting (withoutsuccess) to absorb the vertical family planningprogram into other health services. Shortcomings in project preparation con- tributed to poor outcomes. 6According to com- pletion reports and IEG fieldwork, project designswere often excessively complex, driven by partic-ipatory or sectorwide approaches. This often re-sulted in a failure to prioritize activities, whichreduced the project's feasibility and ultimate im-pact in the face of low implementation capacity.Also frequently noted was a lack of up-front riskanalysis, risk mitigation actions, and institutionalanalysis. An IEG field evaluation of the VietnamPopulation and Family Health Project (1996-2003)(IEG 2006d), for example, found very little in-crease in oral contraceptive use, partly because theexisting incentives for two-child families within the family planning delivery structure were nottaken into account. This is something that insti-tutional analysis in advance of the project shouldhave been able to anticipate. The absorption of population and family planning into sectorwide programs\u2014be theySWAps or health reform projects\u2014may havecontributed to the lack of results. There were significant improvements in the modern contra-ceptive prevalence rate and a reduction in the totalfertility rate during Ghana's Second Populationand Family Health Project (1991-97). However,under the subsequent Health Sector SupportProject (1998-2002), which supported a sector-wide approach, there was no progress on eitherof these outcomes (IEG 2005b, 2007d). A similarsituation occurred in Bangladesh, between theFourth Population and Health Project (1991-98)and the subsequent Health and Family PlanningProgram (1998-2005) (IEG 2006b). In both cases,the transition to a SWAp increased the emphasison process, but did not ensure the achievementof health-service performance and output tar-gets, including those for population (IEG 2007d).Field visits in Egypt underscored the findings of a recent study that family planning and repro-ductive health services are diluted within thebasic package of services delivered through newfamily health facilities supported by the Health Re-form Project (1998-present) (IEG 2008b). Clientsreport that there are no longer special rooms infacilities for family planning clients; female physi-cians or specialists to discuss the topic are notavailable; and family physicians have less special-ized training and less time to devote to the clients(Zaky and others 2007 as reported in IEG 2008b). Nevertheless, there were some important successes in raising contraceptive use andsupport for fertility decline in high-fertilityenvironments, particularly with respect touse of family planning. The Egypt Population Project (1996-2005) contributed to raising con-traceptive use and lowering fertility in rural UpperEgypt, while the Malawi Population and FamilyPlanning Project was able to raise modern con-traceptive use in rural areas through community- 138IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATIONbased distributors. Both of these projects in- cluded important demand-generation activities.The Madagascar Second Health Program SupportProject financed training and contraceptives, witha particular focus on a new, long-duration im-plantable contraceptive that is easily inserted andespecially convenient in rural and remote areas.The number of locations offering family planningservices increased by 45 percent from 2003 to2007, and the contraceptive prevalence rate rosefrom 9.7 to 24 percent (World Bank 2008e). Un-fortunately, the successful investment in pilotfamily planning activities in Malawi was not repli-cated nationally, and contraceptive use remainslow, with little change (figure E.1). There hasbeen virtually no improvement in Ghana despitesupport by the Bank and other donors for a healthSWAp over the past decade, and there has beenmodest improvement in Bangladesh, despite thedisruption in family planning services by theunpopular and ultimately failed attempt to unifythe delivery of health and family planning services. The problems of high fertility and rapid population growth have regained promi-nence internationally and in the Bank'spopulation strategy. There is greater recogni- tion that lowering fertility and population growththrough demand-side activities alone will take avery long time, while simply providing familyplanning as part of a package of basic services isunlikely to raise contraceptive prevalence dra-matically in high-fertility countries or to lowerfertility among the very poor. Both demand- andsupply-side activities are important. Universalaccess to reproductive health was added as an MDG in 2007. 7The Bank's 2007 population strat- egy (World Bank 2007g) differentiates between re-productive, maternal, and sexual health and theservices that address them and factors that affectdemographic outcomes. It links population, eco-nomic growth, and poverty reduction and advo-cates targeting assistance to the 35 countries withtotal fertility rates exceeding 5.0, many of whichare also among the poorest countries in the world.APPENDIX E: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR POPULATION 139Figure E.1: Trends in Modern Contraceptive Use Rates, Case Study Countries 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 0Modern (1996-2004) Vietnam (1997-2002)45 degree line Peru (1996-2004) Modern contraception rate in latest survey Source: Nankhuni forthcoming, based on demographic and health survey reports (www.measuredhs.com) Note: Solid circle indicates that the change is statistically significant at 5 or 10 percent level, hollow circle indicates that the change is not statistically significant, and solid triangle indicates that it was not possibleto determine statistical significance.

About a third of children in de- veloping countries are underweight (low weightfor age) or stunted (low height for age), andabout 30 percent of the population of those coun-tries suffers from deficiencies in micronutrientssuch as vitamin A, iodine, or iron. 1Women and children are particularly affected, and nutritionaldeficiencies in children while they are still in thewomb and up to age 2 can have lifelong conse-quences. Malnutrition among children is highestin South Asia and is high and increasing in Sub-Saharan Africa. It affects both the poor and thenon-poor, but is greater among the poor: in 39 outof 46 countries with recent household surveys,more than half of children are stunted, and stunt-ing is as much as eight times higher among thepoorest wealth quintile than among the richest. 2 Tackling malnutrition not only contributesto the MDG of halving the share of peoplewho suffer from hunger, but also to otherMDGs that deal with reducing child mor-tality, improving maternal health, raisingschool achievement, and reducing incomepoverty. The causes of malnutrition are diverse and in- clude inadequate breastfeeding, poor child feed-ing practices, diarrheal disease and other illness,intestinal parasites, frequent and closely spacedchildbearing, inadequate diet, low access to healthcare, unsafe water, poor sanitation, low purchas-ing power, and in some cases inadequate food pro-duction. However, the fact that the non-poor alsohave significant levels of malnutrition indicates that knowledge and behavior are often key. World Bank support is in countries with high malnutrition, but coverage of the worst-affected countries is low. IEG undertook an in- depth desk review of the 21 projects approvedfrom fiscal 1997 to 2006 with nutrition objectives(10 percent of the HNP lending portfolio), 3plus 6 additional projects with nutrition in the title ornutrition components or subcomponents, for atotal of 27 projects, henceforth called \"nutritionprojects.\" 4About half of them are general health or HNP projects, five are freestanding nutritionprojects, four are mother and/or child health proj-ects, and the remaining five are emergency ormultisectoral programmatic lending. 5While about two-thirds of the nutrition projects were in coun-tries with average child stunting of 30 percent ormore, only about a quarter of countries with suchhigh levels of malnutrition were receiving WorldBank nutrition support. 6T wo-thirds of nutrition projects were in low-income countries. WhileAfrica had the largest number of nutrition projects(9), South Asia had the highest share of nutritionprojects relative to the rest of the Regional port-folio (29 percent). 7The share of projects with nutrition objectives declined from 12 to 7 percentbetween the first and second half of the decade. The types of interventions supported by these op- erations included growth monitoring and nutri-tional surveillance (100 percent), micronutrientsupplements (52 percent), behavior change (nu-trition education, promotion of growth moni-toring, breastfeeding, specific dietary changes,and hygiene, 48 percent), and feeding supple-ments or rehabilitation of malnourished children(41 percent). The projects also supported ca-APPENDIX F: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR NUTRITIONpacity building in the form of nutrition policy de- velopment, training, and data collection. However,4 of the 27 projects had an explicit objective to im-prove nutrition, with no nutrition components orsubcomponents in the appraisal document. 8 The diverse causes of malnutrition madenutrition projects organizationally com-plex \u2014about half were multisectoral and in half of the multisectoral projects,the executing agency was outside of the Ministryof Health. The projects were managed by theMinistry of Health or by the Ministry of Finance/Economy/ Plan (four projects each); jointly exe-cuted by multiple ministries, one of which was theMinistry of Health (three projects); by a non-health ministry (two projects); or by the Office ofthe President or Prime Minister (one project).The number of implementing agencies was oftengreater, with six projects relying on three imple-menting ministries and two projects on four im-plementing agencies. Several of the case study countries suffered from high levels of child malnutrition, overall andamong the poor, and in most cases there was lit-tle improvement (figure F.1). A 2005 IEG impactevaluation found that, although nutritional statusin Bangladesh has improved over time, the linkbetween the interventions and outcomes wasweak (box F.1). Although the interventions pro-duced some modest improvements, most nutri-tion improvements over the period were broughtabout by better food availability and lower priceslinked to the increase in rice yields since the late1990s. The case study teams pointed to malnu-trition as particularly neglected in the Bank's sup-port over the past decade in Nepal, Peru, and (atleast until recently) Malawi. The observed im-provements in rural Nepal could also have beenaffected through interventions in other sectors,such as water supply and sanitation. 9Ghana has had no specific nutrition support from the Bank,but experienced an increase in rural stunting over the course of sectorwide Bank support. The overall performance of the nutrition projects was weak. Fifteen of the nutrition proj- ects had closed and been reviewed by IEG; 64percent had satisfactory outcomes\u2014about thesame as the rest of the portfolio. But this statisticis deceptive, since nutrition is often only one of sev-eral objectives, and in some cases only a smallcomponent of a larger project. 10Only two proj- ects\u2014Indonesia Iodine Deficiency Control andSenegal Nutrition\u2014demonstrated substantial ef-ficacy in meeting their objectives, with resultingchanges in nutritional outcomes. In Indonesia, in-creased consumption of iodized salt and targeteddistribution of iodine capsules helped reduce thetotal goiter rate by 35 percent in highly endemicprovinces and by more than 50 percent in a fewothers. 11The Senegal project surpassed almost all of its targets in terms of outputs (training, chil-dren and mothers reached, health posts equipped)and demonstrated improvements in some nutri-tion indicators (exclusive breastfeeding), thoughfor a few indicators, only by slightly more than incontrol areas (World Bank 2007c). Among the re-maining 12 projects, the completion reports for 4suggested little or no impact, 12and for 8 projects 142IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Figure F.1: Trends in Stunting in the Rural Areas of Case Study Countries, 1995-2006 80 7060 50 40 3020 20 30 40 Percent stunted in latest survey50 60 70 80Percent stunted in earliest survey45 degree line (2000-2004) Nepal (1996-2001) Source: Nankhuni forthcoming, based on demographic and health survey reports.

Countries above the 45-degree line experienced reductions in stunting levels, those below the line experienced increases, and those along the line experienced no change.the impact was unclear, often due to the failure to collect data or report on nutrition outcomes. Complexity was cited as contributing to the shortcomings in more than half of the weak-performing projects. Projects in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nicaragua, and Sri Lanka had to bescaled back and the efforts prioritized to includefewer activities or a smaller geographic area. TheFood Security and Social Mobilization Project inMauritania suffered from the inexperience andinstitutional weaknesses of the Executive StateSecretariat for Promotion of Women, in additionto high project complexity. The Uganda Nutritionand Child Development Project was designed asa pilot intended for only a few districts; expansionof its geographical coverage without additionalresources greatly increased its complexity. M&E were particularly weak for both proj- ects with nutrition components and thefreestanding nutrition projects. Nutrition out- comes are affected by many factors beyond theinterventions in these projects; it is thus very im-portant to attempt to monitor other important fac-tors that could be affecting outcomes, a lesson of the project in Senegal. However, these projectsfailed even to collect basic data on nutrition out-comes, such as micronutrient consumption (Gam-bia, Mauritania, Sri Lanka) or the projects' mainoutputs (Sri Lanka). The Bangladesh project didnot collect baseline data until two years before theend of the project; the Indonesia project pro-duced baseline and final data from different groupsof people; the India Women and Child Develop-ment Project collected data on children aged 0-3when the target group was aged 0-6. The com-pletion report for the Nicaragua project reportedno outcomes at all. This experience nevertheless presents some important lessons for future nutrition proj-ects. Several projects reported success in the use of community volunteers to mobilize com-munities or deliver services (Gambia, Senegal,Nicaragua), while one of the reasons for poorperformance in Mauritania was the limited ca-pacity of communities to undertake growth-pro-motion activities. The experience also highlightedthe importance of demand generation for nutri-APPENDIX F: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR NUTRITION 143The Bank has supported improved nutrition in Bangladesh through two freestanding nutrition projects\u2014the Bangla-desh Integrated Nutrition Project (BINP Project (2000-07)\u2014and as part oftwo projects supporting sectorwide approaches in HNP .In 2005, IEG evaluated the impact of the BINP , whichwas based on a community-based approach that providednutrition counseling to bring about behavior change andsupplementary feeding for pregnant women and youngchildren. The evaluation found that coverage of the interven- tion was high in project areas in general, but that thecausal link between the interventions and nutrition out-comes was weakened by targeting deficiencies; largeshares of mothers and children receiving supplementalfeeding but no counseling; and the focus of behaviorchange almost exclusively on mothers, who are often not the main decision makers on nutrition-related practices(both husbands and mothers-in-law have an important in-fluence). Supplementary feeding had some impact amongthe most malnourished, but was a costly part of the pro-gram and not sustainable in the long run. The follow-on National Nutrition Program revised the targeting criteria and attempted to reach out to men withbehavior-change messages. The program was delayedand scaled back, but was able to maintain the achieve-ments of micronutrient coverage and to promote adop-tion of new behaviors. It was unable to demonstratesustainable improvements in birth weights and nutritionstatus of vulnerable groups; however, the baseline wascollected only two years before the end of the project andmonitoring data were not collected.

Mul-tisectoral coordination and the engagement ofsectors outside of health was lacking in India andMauritania. T wo early child development proj-ects pointed to the need for better targeting ofchildren in a more appropriate age range (Uganda)or with more education and counseling (India).Finally, a number of projects cited the need to de-velop simpler indicators for use by grassrootsgroups, to adopt more realistic and measurabletargets (Bangladesh), and to identify monitoring indicators for improved supervision (Sri Lanka). T o summarize, the need to address malnutrition in client countries is great, and the coverage ofBank support for the hardest-hit countries is low.However, the multidimensional determinants ofnutrition tend to lead to complex projects thatinvolve multiple sectors. While there have beendemonstrable results in a few cases, the overall re-sults for the HNP-managed nutrition portfoliowere thin. 144IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION145The Bank's analytic work in HNP includes both the products of the lending part of the institutionand research products and other publications ofBank staff. Official economic and sector work(ESW) financed directly from the Bank budget forcountry, Regional, or global-level HNP analysis istracked in an internal database. 1 Between fiscal 2000 and 2008 the Bankspent $43 million of its own budget andtrust funds on a total of 218 ESW tasks that generated reports, policy notes, conferences,workshops, consultations, and country dialogueon HNP . 2This amounts to about 4 percent of ESW Bank-wide for those years, whether measuredin costs or number of activities. However, the true amount of HNP analytic work undertaken by the Bank far exceedswhat is in the official database. The tracking system excludes the work of the Bank's ResearchDepartment and major undertakings, such asthe World Development Report 2004: Making Services Work for the Poor and the multiyear re- search on Reaching the Poor with Health, Nu- trition, and Population Services (World Bank 2005a). 3An exhaustive search for all individual ar- ticles, working papers, studies, toolkits, reports,and research published by the Bank or Bank staffon HNP topics counted a total of 1,457 pieces is-sued over fiscal 1997-2006\u2014six tim es more than implied by the official ESW database. 4 ESW on HNP tripled over fiscal 2001-05,then dropped to half its previous levels infiscal 2006-08 (figure G.1). About two-thirds of these activities were conducted at the countrylevel, about a quarter at the Regional level, and 7percent at the global level. 5The largest shares of these ESW activities were country-level HNP sec-tor studies (42 percent), studies of health finance(33 percent), HIV/AIDS studies (31 percent), orhealth strategies or policies (29 percent). The in-crease in ESW in fiscal 2002 and 2004-05 is mostlyattributable to an increase in country-level sectorstudies or reviews in those years; there followeda large drop in fiscal 2007-08. Prominent among the country-level studies was a series of more than a dozen HNP Country Sta- tus Reports launched by the Africa Region in 2003, with the purpose of informing the HNP discussionin Poverty Reduction Strategies. Most used the an-alytic framework proposed in the HNP chapter ofthe Sourcebook for Poverty Reduction Strategies (Claeson and others 2002), linking health out-comes, household and community characteristicsand behaviors, health care delivery and financing,and other sectors affecting health. All focused onthe relationship between health and poverty to dif-fering degrees and included a chapter on publicexpenditures in health and health financing. Nearly two-thirds of all ESW tasks since 2002 that stated an objective were intendedto inform government policy, while onlyhalf aimed to inform lending. 6Other main ob- jectives of the HNP ESW portfolio were to informpublic debate (42 percent), inform the devel-opment community (32 percent), and build ca-pacity (25 percent). Not surprisingly, country andRegional ESW were more likely intended to informgovernment policy, and country-level ESW was themost likely to have an objective to inform lend-ing (55 percent), while all\u2014or nearly all\u2014globalHNP ESW intended to inform public debate or theAPPENDIX G: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR ANALYTIC WORK ON HNPdevelopment community. IEG's recent evalua- tion of Bank-wide ESW found that it led to higherproject quality at entry (IEG 2008h). The broader inventory of analytic work conducted for this evaluation found that health system per-formance was the most common topic, treated in41 percent of all analytic work (table G.1). HIV/AIDSwas the second-most common topic, while only1 in 10 publications addressed child health. Health is also frequently analyzed in pub- lic expenditure reviews (PERs), a categoryof formal ESW usually conducted by staff inother sectors, and thus not included in thestatistics for the HNP sector. 7PERs are often the basis for discussion with the Ministry ofFinance about sectoral budget allocations, andabout allocations within sectors. Thus, they are animportant input into discussions of efficiency andsustainability of finance. However, about a third of PERs delivered from fiscal 2000 to 2007 had no chapter or subchapter on health. The health focus of PERs has declined over time: between fis-cal 2000-03 and 2004-07, the share with healthchapters or subchapters declined from 71 to 59percent. Only 3 percent of PERs had a chapter orsubchapter on nutrition or on population, fer-tility, or family planning. Of the five PERs with a population chapter or subchapter, only one(Ethiopia) was in a high-fertility country. Given theclose relationship between rapid populationgrowth, the dependency ratio, and sustainabilityof public expenditure, it is particularly surprisingthat population is not more widely discussed. 146IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION Figure G.1: Trend in Official HNP ESW Tasks, Fiscal Years 2000-08 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0Number of ESW activities delivered141329 2435 21 211942 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 Fiscal year2005 2006 2007 2008 All ESW Country-level Regional Global Source: World Bank data.

TheMMV has been highly successful at achieving itsinitial objectives\u2014to establish and manage aportfolio of antimalarial drug candidates\u2014andthe public sector target price of a full course of treatment of a dollar or less appears withinreach. The MMV's mandate has been expanded to in- clude improving access and delivery of antimalarialdrugs. It is less clear whether MMV has the orga-nizational arrangement and institutional rela-tionships (notably with countries) to deliver onthe highly demanding downstream access anddelivery activities and whether it will be able to rec-oncile its private sector entrepreneurial style withthe public sector requirements for resolution ofpolicy and institutional issues in access and de-livery (IEG 2007e). The Population and Reproductive Health Capacity Building Program (PRHCBP), estab- lished in 1999, is a merger of three programs:Population and Reproductive Health, Safe Mother-hood, and the Program to Reduce the Practice ofFemale Genital Mutilation and Improve AdolescentHealth. Its objective is to build the capacity of civil society organizations to develop and imple-ment culturally appropriate interventions in pop-ulation and reproductive health. It does this byproviding grants to international intermediaries,which then make grants to grassroots groups, andsupporting operations research and technologyand information transfer. It is financed entirely by the Bank's Development Grant Facility, man-aged within the Bank structure, and with no steer-ing committee or other structure that wouldenable actors external to the Bank to participatein decision making and oversight. T o date, theBank has allocated $18.3 million of DevelopmentGrant Facility funding to the PRHCBP . The evalu-ation found that the objectives of the programwere highly relevant, but that both efficacy and ef-ficiency were difficult to assess because there wasno systematic measurement of the achievementof the program's stated objectives. Grant deci-sion making by the Review Committee was a veryinformal process. It was only in 2006 that publicsolicitation of proposals became practice, and in2007 that criteria for evaluating proposals wereestablished. For almost a quarter of all grantsawarded through fiscal 2007, there was no writ-ten record of review decisions. Under the opera-tions research component, PRHCBP has supportedthe International Partnership for Microbicides todevelop new technologies to prevent HIV/AIDSand unwanted pregnancy. The consolidation of thethree programs did not lead to clear objectives andthe links to country-level Bank operations wereweak (IEG 2008e).

Management has some general com-ments on the changing context for its support,followed by comments on the evaluation's mainfindings and recommendations. Lastly, the Re-sponse cites the International Finance Corpo-ration's (IFC) evolving role in the sector. TheManagement Action Record (attached to the Man-agement Response Summary at the front of thisvolume) provides a Bank Group response to IEG'srecommendations. As noted below, the 2007Health Strategy (World Bank 2007a) found issuessimilar to those raised by IEG, not surprising be-cause there was regular interaction between HNPstaff and the IEG team in the process of prepar-ing the new strategy. The recent health StrategyProgress Report (World Bank 2009) lays out theBank's actions to strengthen its support, includ-ing taking into account all of the major IEG analy-sis and recommendations. Annex 2 of the ProgressReport, the Management Action Plan, summa-rizes how the actions being taken correspond toIEG's recommendations, including assigning re-sponsibilities and setting benchmarks for mea-suring progress. For reference it is appended tothis response. Changing Context for WBG Support The context in which the Bank Group providessupport in this sector has changed dramaticallyduring the last decade. That context affects howthe World Bank Group works.A Changing Global Environment Requires More from the Bank. The last 10 years have seen the creation of new international health in-stitutions and foundations, as well as the emer-gence of many different innovative health fund-ing mechanisms. 2The welcome result has been sharply increased global funding for HNP . TheBank's role has undergone a similar paradigmshift. Although lending investment remains sig-nificant, we now play a much more nuanced role,working with and through partners and new in-ternational institutions. 3This changing role, an- chored in the Paris and Accra Declarations, isdesirable from a development perspective, but italso imposes significant additional challenges inattributing development outcomes to Bank fi-nance or technical contributions. The sector isconstantly adapting to this rapidly evolving envi-ronment, using the full spectrum of the Bank'scomparative advantages beyond traditional lend-ing and economic and sector work (ESW). Thebenefits are clear, as are the risks of working in acomplex development area, investing in complexhealth systems while respecting the multiplicityof synergies necessary for a continuum of care andservice delivery, essential for public health and dis-ease control, and in some instances relying onpartners to deliver results. A Mandate to Achieve Health Outcomes through Health in All Policies. The interna- tional health community and the World BankGroup have recognized that, in addition to stand-alone interventions and sector-specific policies, wemust focus on more comprehensive \"health in allpolicies.\" Given how the Bank Group is organized,this is our comparative advantage\u2014and the HNPsector has been moving in this direction over thepast years. The 2007 HNP strategy (World Bank156IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION 2007a) included a critical self-assessment of the sector's performance since 1997. The IEG evalu-ation reconfirms much of this self-assessment,and many of IEG's recommendations are helpfulin achieving greater effectiveness and impact. Main Findings and Recommendations Management agrees with many of the findings, andappreciates the recommendations. Managementhas taken them into account in the Progress Report and the Plan of Action (see the attachedAction Plan). While not detracting from the im-portance that it gives to the evaluation and its use-fulness for the Strategy Progress Report, manage-ment has a set of observations on some of the findings. Health Status Has More than One Devel- opment Dimension. Management considers better health a development outcome in and ofitself, irrespective of its contributions to othergoals. In addition to improving health status, theHNP sector aims to cushion the financial shocksof health costs, which can be substantial in manyclient countries, where out-of-pocket paymentsdominate. Thus, while we agree that investmentsshould focus on health outcomes for the poor, itis also vital to protect those above the poverty linefrom financial shocks from poor health that pushfamilies into poverty. The World Bank Group's Global HNP En- gagements Go Beyond Projects and ESW.The evaluation emphasizes lending, with someattention to policy dialogue and analytic work.But the HNP sector has expanded the paradigmover the past decade. The World Bank Group usesa range of engagement instruments, such as ana-lytic and advisory activities (including IFC AdvisoryServices), 4just-in-time policy advice, policy-based lending led by other sectors, subnational lendingwithout a sovereign guarantee (through IFC), andworking through international networks and part-nerships, such as the Global Alliance for VaccinesInitiative (GAVI), the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,T uberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), and the Euro-pean Union (EU) Observatory. Working with part-ners through pooled funding, country systemsand joint strategies and supervision (as opposedto ring-fenced Bank operations) is also anchored in international commitments and agreementssuch as the Paris and Accra Declarations. The suc-cess of the Joint United Nations Program onHIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), GFATM, GAVI, Roll BackMalaria, EU Observatory and other major inter-national partnerships is also the shared success ofthe Bank Group's HNP work, as we exercise sub-stantial technical and financial influence in thesenetworks and partnerships. Over the past decade,we have also enhanced internal collaborations toimprove the Bank Group's impact on global health:Examples include work across units (notably withConcessional Finance and Global Partnerships,Operations Policy and Country Services, and T rea-sury for innovative financing mechanisms\u2014theInternational Finance Facility for Immunization, Ad-vance Market Commitment, and T reasury services)and partnershi ps Bank's broader de- velopment expertise has significantly impactedthe structure of the global health architecture, inaddition to saving millions of lives. The Evaluation Framework Does Not Assess the World Bank Group's Non-TraditionalContributions to Global Health and ClientSupport. The evaluation's review of four ap- proaches misses much of the work carried out insupport of global public health, including keyanalytical pieces, the global work on core publichealth functions, water and sanitation, surveil-lance and vital statistics, indoor air pollution,avian and human influenza, and so forth. Theevaluation does not evaluate performance-basedapproaches, which we believe have delivered im-pressive results. Regarding SWAPs, we note thatbefore reaching any conclusions on their effec-tiveness we need to take into account elementsbeyond the evaluation that reflect the Bank's sup-port for greater donor coordination and the useof country systems as enshrined in the Paris andAccra Declarations. Coverage of Analytic Work. Much of the non- traditional analytical work has a potentially largeor larger impact than the Bank's lending, especiallysince Bank financing is usually a small share ofoverall health spending in middle-income coun-APPENDIX J: MANAGEMENT RESPONSE 157tries.5Knowledge-product tasks are often pre- ferred to ESW to get findings out more quickly orprovide just-in-time advice to clients and part-ners. The evaluation does not sufficiently accountfor the role of analytic and advisory activities inengaging clients and advancing policy dialogue,either as a stand-alone tool to support the client(in particular in middle-income countries) or asa parallel track dialogue to investment and policy-based lending. The evaluation could also havetaken greater account of other knowledge prod-ucts, such as a large portfolio of Japan Policy andHuman Resources Development Fund (PHRD)grant-financed analytic and advisory activities insupport of project preparation, as well as non-formal ESW and technical assistance. Improving Poverty Targeting .Management agrees with the need to ensure that project designresponds to the priorities and needs of the poor,and to measure the full impact of improved healthservices for the poor. Indeed, the 2007 HNP strat-egy explicitly recognizes the need to focus notonly on levels of HNP outcomes but also on theirdistribution, especially among the poor. This fo-cus in the strategy drew heavily on HNP's path-breaking Reaching the Poor Program, active since2001. Reaching the Poor has delivered global lead-ership in the measurement of disparities in HNPhealth-service coverage and outcome indicatorsamong the poor versus the non-poor, as well as ofthe financial burden on households from seekingcare. In 2005, Reaching the Poor published a re-view of interventions and programs that had beensuccessful in reaching the poor (Gwatkin, Wagstaff,and Yazbeck 2005). A new report (Yazbeck 2009)has been produced in the period since the adop-tion of the 2007 HNP strategy and was launchedin January 2009. This volume lays out a policymenu emphasizing pro-poor policy reform alongsix dimensions, and a list of the analytical tools tobetter understand the constraints to pro-poor tar-geting of public health investments. 6Management will use these findings to ensure a better pro-poorfocus in future lending operations. Disease Control Programs and Targeting. As opposed to specific income groups, disease con-trol programs must focus on the prevailing epi-demiology. For example, an AIDS program must focus on high-risk groups\u2014irrespective of income.A malaria program focused solely on the poorwould fail to eliminate malaria. Polio could only beeradicated from the Western Hemisphere by fo-cusing on large, inclusive campaigns targeting allincome groups. Such investments in public healthand control of communicable diseases are globalpublic goods, generating positive externalities forsociety, irrespective of income status. Investments in Health Systems. The 2007 HNP strategy underscores the need to focus on healthsystems for delivering improved HNP results, par-ticularly for the poorest and the most vulnerable,and the Bank has emerged as a strategic leader inadvancing health systems strengthening for im-proved HNP results. Over the past two years, proj-ects with a primary focus on health systems haveincreased twofold. In line with the strategy, 67percent of Bank programs approved since fiscalyear 2007 that focus on priority disease areas alsoinclude strong components on health systemsstrengthening. A new Health Systems for theHealth MDGs initiative was launched in 2008 tobring together the resources and efforts to fundand implement coherent, country-led health sec-tor programs in Africa and selected countries inAsia. 7This program will improve the Bank's abil- ity to rapidly assist and advise HNP operations onthe ground, particularly in the areas of health fi-nance and risk pooling mechanisms, human re-sources for health, governance, supply chainmanagement, as well as infrastructure planning. HNP in Poverty Assessments and CASs. Man- agement notes the substantive improvementsover the past years in quantity and quality of HNPinvolvement in the Poverty Reduction and Eco-nomic Management Network-led analytical work,and agrees that HNP must be fully included in allPoverty Assessments and fully examined in thepreparation of CASs. Cross-Sector Work. Management welcomes the suggestion to expand cooperation and cross-sector work with the T ransport , Water and Sani- tation sectors. More will be done to harness cross-sectoral results along the notion of \"health in all158IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION policies.\" The 2007 HNP strategy is a good con- duit to foster improved collaboration across sec-tors in support of health outcomes. We note therecommendation that \"when the benefits are po-tentially great in relation to the marginal costs,\"health objectives should be incorporated intonon-health projects, but also note that clients un-dertake such operations largely for non-healthobjectives and it would be unrealistic within cur-rent resources to burden all such projects with po-tentially small (albeit cost effective) health impactobjectives, or to demonstrate and document em-pirically such impact and outcomes in each case. The Quality of the Bank HNP Portfolio. Man- agement appreciates the concern for the qualityof the Bank HNP portfolio\u2014in particular in Africa.The current data on riskiness of the HNP port-folio confirms the fact that the problems are most acute in the Africa Region, and that HNP'sperformance across most other Regions is ap-proaching other sectors' performance. An addi-tional area of concern is the underperformanceof projects that have a significant HIV/AIDS com-ponent, a high percentage of which have receivedunsatisfactory ratings from IEG 8,9(with a rela- tively high disconnect\u2014as management ratedthe outcomes of several of these operations as sat-isfactory) and which also constitute a dispropor-tionate number of projects at risk in the currentportfolio. The HNP Action Plan for the Portfolio. As out- lined in the Strategy Progress Report, the HNP sec-tor is making major efforts to improve the qualityof the existing portfolio and ensure the quality ofnew operations entering the portfolio. These ef-forts include increasing candor in reporting toclose the realism gap and improving other port-folio indicators. The Africa Region has imple-mented several changes aimed at improving HNP'sportfolio in the Region. In March 2008, the Qual-ity Assurance Group (QAG) was asked to reviewthe performance of HNP projects that were cat-egorized as being at risk. The QAG panel indicatedimportant areas for urgent attention: strength-ening sector management reviewingcurrent for preparation/supervision;and addressing two key weaknesses: monitoringand evaluation (M&E) and institutional analysis. A detailed Portfolio Improvement Action Planthat includes all at-risk projects, as well as proj-ects needing additional management oversight toavoid falling into at-risk status, has been developedand is being monitored on a quarterly basis by theHNP Sector Board. 10The Portfolio Improvement Action Plan addresses some of the key concernsraised by the various reviews, namely, intensify-ing management oversight, targeting of resourcesto projects most in need, strengthening projectimplementation to focus on monitoring and eval-uation, and matching project interventions to thecountry's institutional capacity. A comprehensiveapproach has also been adopted to improve thequality of HIV/AIDS projects, and this included an umbrella restructuring package of 11 Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Programs (MAP) for Africaprojects in fiscal year 2007. Additional technicalsupport is being provided to improve imple-mentation, develop impact evaluation capacity,and strengthen governance and accountabilitywithin national AIDS programs. Doing More in Population and Reproduc- tive Health. The Strategy Progress Report high- lights plans for strengthening support for pop-ulation and reproductive health in a health systemsapproach. That strengthening is critical to im-proving maternal and child survival rates. Investing in Nutrition Support. We also agree with the evaluation's findings that nutrition hasplayed a less prominent role within HNP overthe past 10 years. The need for action is evenmore important today in the context of the af-termath of the crises in fuel, food, and fertilizers,as well as the escalating effects of the financial cri-sis. Management is therefore investing significantresources in the next few years to ramp up theBank's analytical and investment work and lever-age resources from other donors. The agendafor scaling-up nutrition is being catalyzed withadditional budget resources starting in 2009, andcontinuing for three years. The increased alloca-tions are being utilized principally in Africa andSouth Asia, two Regions where the malnutritionburden is highest. These funds will be comple-mented by additional trust fund resources fromAPPENDIX J: MANAGEMENT RESPONSE 159Japan, and possibly from other donors that are cur- rently engaged in discussions on this issue. Needed Improvement in Monitoring and Evaluation. Management agrees that M&E needs to be improved, and it is an important part ofStrategy implementation, as noted in the Strat-egy Progress Report (including the work on retro-fitting projects and improving the design of newprojects). The evaluation proposes a focus onstrengthening health information systems. How-ever, in some cases, routine health monitoringsystems (including surveillance, facility reporting,vital registration, census data, resource tracking,and household surveys) first need to be strength-ened to provide the data and indicators that areneeded. The Bank has deepened its collaborationwith the Health Metrics Network, a global part-nership aimed at building statistical capacity incountries to improve the collection and use ofhealth information. The Bank has produced atoolkit on measuring health system governance tobetter monitor accountability in the sector, and thisis being piloted in five countries with support ofthe Governance and Anti-Corruption T rust Fund.One of the largest impact evaluation trust funds atthe Bank, the Spanish T rust Fund for Impact Eval-uation, is housed in the human development sec-tor. The trust fund, which was initiated in 2007 andwill continue until 2010, finances rigorous impactevaluations of interventions aimed at enhancinghuman development as well as learning and dis-semination activities to help promote knowledgeand awareness of \"what works\" in the human de-velopment Sector. The Bank is also working withpartners, such as WHO, to develop better ways tomonitor the health MDGs, including the estima-tion of trends in child and maternal mortality forwhich updates have recently been issued. The Problem of Attribution. The evaluation ar- gues for a better attribution of health outcomesto inputs financed by the World Bank Group.Health outcomes are hard to evaluate within thetimeframe of a project and are influenced by mul-tiple determinants. Also, the Paris and Accra De-clarations emphasize the greater developmentimpact of pooled funding, use country sys-tems, and country-based M&E. The Bank's policyon use of country-level M&E systems. Strictly speaking,attribution is only possible in a tightly designedrandomized trial, which will rarely be feasible inBank-supported investment projects or sectorsupport. The standard should be that sufficient ev-idence on outputs, intermediate outcomes, andoutcomes should be collected to establish a cred-ible results chain regarding the link betweenBank-financed investments and sector progress. Cost of M&E. Borrowing countries have many de- velopment and poverty-reduction priorities andworry about the opportunity cost of complexM&E systems, especially those that are separatefrom country systems. They see that large-scaleevaluations have an important global public goodaspect, justifying external (grant) financing inmost cases. This may delay the establishment ofappropriate baseline data and results frameworksprior to project approval, notably with regard toimpact evaluations. Operational Complexity. Management agrees that we need to strive to reduce complexity inBank-financed HNP operations. However, HNPoperations can rarely be institutionally or techni-cally simple, since the desired outcome usually de-pends on a complex and interacting set of social,cultural, and institutional factors. Investing in sim-ple programs would not necessarily provide for last-ing impact. Management acknowledges, however,that complexity can be at least partially addressedby some of the recommendations of the evaluation,such as thorough technical preparation, includingsolid analytical underpinning, political mapping,high quality at entry including a good results frame-work, and finally in-depth supervision and paral-lel policy dialogue with client and partners. The 2007 Health Sector Strategy and IEG Recommendations. The 2007 strategy actually cited findings that were similar to the IEG findings,as would be expected since IEG staff worked withthe strategy team to share preliminary results oftheir work. Annex 2 of the Progress Report sum-marizes how the overall actions being taken tostrengthen the Bank's HNP support correspondto IEG's recommendations (see attached).160IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION IFC's HNP Footprint IFC has considerably increased its footprint in HNP over the past decade and is prepared to in-tensify collaboration within the World Bank Group.During the period under review, much has oc-curred, both in IFC's health activities and in theprivate health sector in developing countries.There is a growing acknowledgement of the roleof the private sector in health care in developingcountries. Indeed, in many low-income coun-tries, the private sector pays for a far larger partof health care than the public one, and in manymore, it is at least of equal size. Furthermore,joint research by the World Bank, IFC, and the U.S.Agency for International Development (USAID)conducted in Africa showed that very poor peo-ple often obtain health care in the private sectorand that the public sector often subsidizes healthcare for the rich. These findings have led to theBank and its partners designing innovativeconsumer-focused approaches to addressingmajor health financing challenges; such as theAMFm (Affordable Medicines Facility for Malaria),which will reduce the price of Artemisinin-basedCombination Therapy (ACT), and therefore out-of-pocket payments.In a world of growing, aging populations in de- veloping countries that are likely to \"get old be-fore they get rich,\" both public and private sectorresources are needed to tackle the health needsof the population, as neither has the resources byitself. Indeed, all countries' health systems are fi-nanced by both sectors; it is only the propor-tions that vary. IFC therefore has taken up the challenge to grow its work to support the private health sector indeveloping countries to complement the larger,more established work done with the public sec-tor by the World Bank. The period under reviewhas seen a marked increase in IFC's activity inhealth, the creation of a dedicated Health andEducation Department, and a specific focus onpharmaceutical and life sciences activities withinIFC's Global Manufacturing and Services De-partment. During this time, many lessons havebeen learned, specialist knowledge has deep-ened, and performance has improved by anymeasure applied. As in other sectors, IFC con-tinues to strive for greater development impact,and we therefore welcome all input that couldhelp us to do better.IEG Recommendation Actions to Be Taken How Much & by When By WhomAPPENDIX J: MANAGEMENT RESPONSE 161World Bank Management Action Plan (a) Match project design to country context and capacity and reducethe complexity of projects in low-capacity settings through greaterselectivity, prioritization, and se-quencing of activities, particularlyin Sub-Saharan Africa.

Before 2006, IEG-World Bank was known as the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).10. A forthcoming IEG evaluation will evaluate sup- port for HNP outcomes through multisectoral devel-opment policy lending in the form of Poverty ReductionSupport Credits (PRSC). That support is not assessedhere. 11. Improving the selectivity and strategic engage- ment of the Bank in global programs is one of the fivestrategic directions in the 2007 HNP strategy. 12. This was also maintained in the preceding strat- egy, from 1997. Chapter 2 1. The trends in formal ESW are described in ap- pendix G, as well as the results of an inventory of HNPanalytic work undertaken by IEG. 2. Investment operations provide funding in the form of IBRD loans or IDA credits and grants to gov-ernments to cover specific expenditures related toeconomic and social development projects. Develop-ment Policy Loans provide untied, direct budget sup-port to governments for policy and institutional reformsaimed at achieving a set of specific development results.They may be freestanding operations or, more often,part of a programmatic series of operations. Of the220 HNP-managed projects approved over fiscal years1997-2006, only 6 were Development Policy Loans. 3. The number of IDA projects increased by 46 per- cent, while the number of IBRD projects declined by20 percent. 4. The results, findings, and lessons from lending for communicable diseases and SWAps are discussed inchapter 3; results for multisectoral HNP projects aretaken up in chapter 4. 5. The absolute number of projects with these types of formal objectives declined from 44 in fiscal 1997-2001to 29 in 2002-06. There may be other projects in theportfolio that include financing, health insurance, andactivities with the private sector for which these are notexpressed as objectives. They are not included in thetable. 6. Staff at level GF+ or higher mapped to the HNP sector (Nankhuni and Modi 2008).7. As explained in appendix B, the analysis of staff specialties is based on job titles only; there was noknown reliable data source that would have allowedtracking by actual staff expertise over the period. Theextent to which the job titles accurately reflect staff ex-pertise is unclear. 8. IEG evaluates projects by assessing their results in relation to their stated objectives. The outcome rat- ing is based on: (a) the relevance of the project's ob- jectives and design in relation to country needs andinstitutional priorities; (b) efficacy , which is the extent to which the project's objectives have been (or are ex-pected to be) achieved; and (c) efficiency , which is the extent to which the objectives have been (or are ex-pected to be) achieved without using more resourcesthan necessary. Outcome is rated on a six-point scale:highly satisfactory, satisfactory, moderately satisfactory,moderately unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory, and highlyunsatisfactory. For ease of comparison, this report usesthe percentage of ratings that are moderately satisfac-tory or higher in making comparisons across projectgroupings. 9. The share of project exits in other sectors that were Development Policy Loans remained a constant15-16 percent between the two periods. 10. The share of Africa Region projects with satis- factory outcomes rose from 60 to 67 percent amongprojects exiting in fiscal 1998-2001 and fiscal 2003-07,compared with an increase from 73 to 78 percent Bank-wide. Outcome ratings for African HNP projects are thusconsiderably lower than the Regional average across allsectors. 11. However, it is important to note that there was a large increase in HNP project approvals in the AfricaRegion in fiscal 2002-06 and they will constitute amuch larger share of exits in the HNP portfolio over thenext five years. 12. While Africa Region projects performed less well on average in other sectors than did the other Re-gions combined (64 percent satisfactory in Africa, 79 per-cent in other Regions over the 10-year period), theoutcome ratings of Africa Region projects increased ata faster rate (from 58 to 72 percent satisfactory over thetwo periods). When Africa Region projects are ex-cluded, the ratings for other Regions and sectors com-bined are higher, but the amount of increase is lower(rising only from 78 to 81 percent satisfactory, as op-posed to 72 to 79 percent satisfactory if Africa isincluded).13. Ratings on institutional development impact of HNP-managed projects (a rating that was discontin-ued in fiscal 2006) are as low as those for other sectors. 14. Of the 220 projects approved from fiscal 1997 to 2006 that were subjected to in-depth review, 110 hadclosed and 99 had been rated by IEG as of Septem-ber 30, 2008. Fifty-eight percent of the HNP projectsapproved from 1997 to 2006 that had closed had sat-isfactory outcomes, while about two-thirds had satis-factory Bank and borrower performance. The outcomeratings for the sample in the portfolio review (58 per-cent satisfactory) are different from those in figure 2.4 (68 percent satisfactory) because they apply to a dif-ferent group of projects. Figure 2.4 shows the out-comes for all projects that closed in a given fiscal year,irrespective of when they were approved, while the IEGsample is of 220 projects approved from fiscal 1997 to2006, only half of which have closed to date. Most ofthe projects that have closed were approved in fiscal1997-2001, but a few approved in fiscal 2002-06 (forexample, Development Policy Loans) are also included.The performance of most of the projects approvedmore recently is unknown. 15. While there are several possible explanations for the overall increase in supervision costs across all sec-tors, examination of the supervision cost data by Re-gion reveals no pattern that would explain why averageHNP supervision costs for three years were so muchgreater than for the rest of the Bank. 16. The ratio of the percent of unsatisfactory proj- ects with this characteristic relative to the percent ofsatisfactory projects with the characteristic. 17. Projects in Africa are also largely responsible for lower outcomes for IDA projects. Half of IDA-financedHNP projects had satisfactory outcomes, compared toabout three-quarters of IBRD projects. However, thisrises to 77 percent if IDA projects in Africa are excluded. 18. For a fuller definition and discussion of sector- wide approaches (SWAps), see chapter 3. 19. See appendix F for more on the performance of these projects. 20. World Bank Group 2007. The Detailed Imple- mentation Review (DIR) was conducted by the De-partment of Institutional Integrity. 21. World Bank Group 2007, p. 11. The DIR team vis- ited all 15 food and drug laboratories and 2 offices thatreceived equipment from the project (p. 67). 22. World Bank Group 2007, p. 12. The DIR team visited 55 hospitals in 23 districts, representing 35 per- 166IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATIONcent of project sites. They were selected based on di- versity in size and geographic areas, including remoteareas and sites visited and not visited previously byBank supervision missions (p. 191). 23. World Bank Group 2007, p. 22. For example, in the case of the Orissa project, it noted that it was notuntil after 6 years of implementation and two projectextensions that the Bank began to \"extensively\" visit andreport on project sites (p. 186). In response, the SouthAsia Region developed an action plan that includedstronger supervision structured around the projectsupply chain and vulnerable points, use of multipleinformation sources, more use of community and third-party mechanisms, and dedicated consultants to con-duct random visits. 24. The average length of the M&E section of the PAD has also increased between the two years, from 445to 1,272 words. 25. This reflects results for HNP projects reviewed through October 31, 2008. These 45 projects were ap-proved roughly between 1998 and 2000. There havebeen substantial additional efforts to improve the mon-itoring of results since then, partly by incorporatinglogframes or results frameworks that try to measure allof the different links in the results chain. However,these improvements cannot yet be evaluated. 26. The HNP impact evaluations addressed the fol- lowing types of interventions: nutrition (20 percent),HIV/AIDS (17 percent), malaria (13 percent), health in-surance (9 percent), other health financing and per-formance-based contracting (9 percent), de-worming(6 percent), PROGRESA conditional cash transfers (5percent), health reform (2 percent), and other (21percent). 27. This is probably an understatement of the true number of intended evaluations of pilot activities or im-pact evaluations, as some may not be mentioned in thePAD but rather in the detailed project implementationplans. Impact evaluations that were retrofitted intoprojects after they were approved are also not included. 28. In a similar vein, Loevinsohn and Pande (2006) found that a typical HNP project in South Asia averagesabout two innovations, neither of which are typicallyevaluated. 29. One additional project\u2014the Bangladesh Na- tional Nutrition Program (fiscal 2000)\u2014had an impactevaluation conducted by an external entity, as reportedin the completion report. 30. TB, malaria, schistosomiasis, leprosy, and polio. 31. For the purpose of this analysis, projects were flagged if they had any mention of \"the poor\" or \"poorregions\" in their objectives. T o the extent that the proj-ects selected poor regions of the country for imple-mentation and this is not reflected in the objectives, thepoverty focus of the portfolio is understated by the ob-jectives. IEG reviewed the design documents for the 47projects with objectives to improve general health sta-tus, to identify projects that targeted poor areas, evenif this was not explicit in the objectives. If one were toinclude projects that had poverty targeting in their de-sign but not in the objectives, the overall share of proj-ects targeting health outcomes among the poor woulddouble, from 8 to 16 percent. 32. A third or more of projects expressed a non- specific objective to improve equity in health servicesor in the health system, without specifying whether theintent was access to or use of services, distribution ofresources, or health status of the population. 33. T wo of the 14 projects were cancelled before they were implemented, so it is not possible to assesswhether they achieved their objectives. Both of the can-celled operations involved extending health insuranceto the poor. 34. Six major studies, all in the first five years cov- ered by the inventory, generated a large number ofcountry reports linked to a single program and ac-count for a total of 184 pieces of analytic work. Theywere all related to poverty and equity. Chapter 3 1. The Zaire National AIDS Control Project and the Brazil Amazon Basin Malaria Control Project were bothapproved in fiscal 1989. 2. For freestanding projects, the full project cost is included, for projects with components, only the costof the communicable disease component is included(Martin 2009). This is likely an understatement, sincemany HNP projects finance childhood immunization asan activity, even when it does not appear as a formalcomponent. A search of \"immunization\" and \"vaccine\"in project appraisal documents identified 13 additionalprojects with either immunization subcomponents ormention of immunization as an activity. However, thereis often insufficient information available in projectcompletion documents to assess the efficacy of sub-components in a desk study. 3. Seven regional AIDS projects were approved, cov- ering parts of Africa, the Caribbean, Central America, andENDNOTES 167Central Asia. The two main rationales for regional proj- ects, according to design documents, are: (a) to addressexternalities that individual country programs may not be able to address and (b) to achieve economies ofscale and where investments by individual countries willlikely result in duplication. The first rationale wouldcover the projects that dealt with truckers, migrants, andother mobile populations that cross international bor-ders, like the Abidjan-Lagos T ransport Corridor Project.The second rationale would cover projects like the Cen-tral Asia AIDS Control Project, which aims to strengthenregional laboratory services and disease surveillance.However, several are operating in countries where thereis also a freestanding AIDS project. IEG has yet to con-duct an in-depth field evaluation of these projects; onlyone has closed to date. 4. The Bank approved the first of two umbrella commitments for the Africa Multicountry AIDS Pro-gram in 2001, together totaling $1 billion. 5. \"G8 Summit Communiqu\u00e9,\" Okinawa, Japan, July 23, 2000. 6.

Communicable disease projects here are de- fined as projects with a communicable disease objec-tive, title, or component. 11. Only half of projects with communicable disease components had satisfactory outcomes, although theratings apply to the overall objectives of the projects,which may include more than communicable diseasecontrol. 12. Neither of the two completed Africa MAP proj- ects that received satisfactory outcome ratings arecountry-level freestanding AIDS projects. The EritreaHAMSET Project was a multiple disease project (AIDS,malaria, TB, STDs) that was rated moderately satisfac-tory based on the strong performance of the malariaactivities, highlighted in box 3.1. The Abidjan-Lagos T ransport Corridor Project aimed at high-risk groupsand risk areas along border crossings; it was rated sat-isfactory. There is also a group of Caribbean MAPprojects, but none had been rated by IEG as of Sep-tember 30, 2008. 13. Martin 2009. The M&E rating is a rating launched on an informal and experimental basis by IEG in 2006.The rating measures M&E design, implementation ofM&E, and use of the data. 14. Problems were noted in the India AIDS II Proj- ect by the Detailed Implementation Report of healthprojects in India prepared by the Bank's Integrity De-partment. Among the African MAP projects, issues con-cerning corruption were noted in project completionreports for Kenya and Cameroon. In Sierra Leone, theNational AIDS Commission forwarded irregularities toa local investigative body that then published the namesof illicit nongovernmental organizations and barredthem from participation. 15. Malawi (fiscal 2007) and Mozambique (fiscal 2003).16. The 2007 strategy refers to synergy 32 times, in the context of synergy between disease-specific inter-ventions and health-systems strengthening, and theneed for synergy underpins 1 of 5 strategic directionsarticulated in the HNP strategy. However, nowhere inthe strategy is synergy defined. 17. The countries are Malawi (43.5 percent), Mozam- bique (33.2 percent), Rwanda (45.0 percent), andUganda (42.0 percent) (Zaky and others 2008). 18. Of course, the severity of any distortion is related to what is actually being financed. 19. IEG defined health-reform projects based on stated objectives and the project title. However, therewere a number of projects with neither characteristicthat had components that clearly indicated reform ac-tivities\u2014for example, the Bangladesh Health and Pop-ulation Control Program, the Panama Health Pilot, theMoldova Health Investment Fund, the Ghana HealthSector Program II, and the Nepal Health Sector Program.Many of these projects adopted overall objectives to im-prove health outcomes or to improve efficiency, with-out mention of reform. 20. Overall, 28 percent of the projects approved from fiscal 1997 to 2006 had objectives to improve ef-ficiency, and nearly half of health reform projects as de-fined above (48 percent) had an explicit objective toimprove efficiency or cost-effectiveness. Most projectswith efficiency objectives that are not in health reform 168IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATIONhave titles that indicate that they are health-system projects (15/24 projects with efficiency objectives butnot health reform). The share of projects with effi-ciency objectives has also been in decline\u2014from 37 per-cent of projects approved in fiscal 1997-2001 to 20percent of projects approved in fiscal 2002-06. 21. Even when additional projects known to have health reform content but without explicit objectivesor a title are included, the share with health reform de-clines from 48 to 28 percent over the period. 22. In the case of low-income Africa, this decline reflects a large increase in the share of communicabledisease projects. See the earlier discussion of commu-nicable disease projects. 23.

There were probably also efficiency gains in Peru since there was increased utilization of public fa-cilities nationwide and no significant expansion inhuman resources. However, these efficiencies are notwell documented. 29. Although initially the funding for insurance was to be financed from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, the government of Perudecided to fully finance that component. However, in-surance remained part of the PARSALUD project andthe Bank provided continuous technical and analyticalsupport. 30. ESSALUD is funded by employers, who pay monthly the equivalent of 9 percent of a worker'ssalary. 31. The Peru Health Reform Project was launched during the administration of President Fujimori, wholater resigned. The new leadership distrusted pro-grams from the previous administration and was not in-terested in pursuing comprehensive reforms that somestakeholders would object to. Yet the principle of extending insurance endured, based on previous analytic work. The part of the reforms that extendedcoverage was politically popular; the new leadershipconsolidated the existing insurance programs into theSIS and expanded it nationwide, ahead of schedule, evenwhile resistance to more ambitious reforms of otherpublic sector insurers persists. The Bank addressedneeded expansion of community-managed health facilitynetworks, which the new administration was lukewarmto, through conditions in the four Programmatic SocialReform Loans, particularly the first two. 32. Only 3 of the 37 were given a risk rating of high, and one of these projects was so risky that it never be-came effective (Argentina Health Insurance for thePoor). 33. In the Kyrgyz Republic and Russia, capacity build- ing in primary care through family medicine reformswas a precondition for hospital rationalization and es-tablished a quality alternative to hospital care. Financ-ing and service delivery reforms made possible thelater benefits package and copayment schemes; changesin revenue collection and pooling were prerequisitesto introduction of new purchasing arrangements. How-ever, in Bangladesh, too many reforms were packed intoa single project: unification of health and family plan-ning, decentralization, a new tier of service delivery atthe community level, in addition to the launching of asectorwide approach. Community clinics were launchedbefore staff were available. 34. \"[T]his resulted in considerable inertia in the types of service being provided, but did provide a plat-form to attempt to shift the focus from costly curativecare.\" IEG 2006b, p. 8. 35. The team tried to reduce the complexity by re- ducing the number of regions from three to two, buteach still entailed multiple reforms and links to a na-tional component. 36. Peru: Poverty Assessment and Social Policies and Programs for the Poor (1993, before the Basic Health and Nutrition Project); Peru: Improving Health Care for the Poor (1999, before PARSALUD); A New So- cial Contract in Peru and An Opportunity for a Different Peru (2006, before the current election cycle). The 1999 piece recommended: (i) allocating funds with a sharperfocus on the needs of the poor; (ii) reinforce pro-poorfocus among Ministry of Health providers by targeting,increase access of the poor to hospitals, more commu-nity participation; (iii) create new insurance mecha-ENDNOTES 169nisms to finance health care for the poor; (iv) improve Ministry of Health's information and management sys-tems; (v) refine human resource skill requirements andincentives to better serve poverty-oriented programs.These were all issues addressed in PARSALUD. 37. Analytic work prior to the first Health Reform Project included analyses of: the sexually transmittedinfection (STI) program (1994); the TB situation (1995);maternal and perinatal health (1995); acute respira-tory infection and diarrhea control; and health spend-ing (1995). A detailed burden of disease analysis wasused to identify areas where health status could bepromoted through ambulatory care in the most cost-effective manner. Significant analytic work was under-taken for the second project as well: health expendituresin the Kyrgyz Republic (1999); Who Is Paying for Health Care in Eastern Europe and Central Asia? (Lewis 2000); \"Analysis of Kyrgyz Health Expenditures\" (Kutzin 1999); Informal Health Payments in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (Lewis 2002); Review of the Sanitary Epidemiological Services in Kyrgyz Republic (Kyrgyz Ministry of Health and others 2000); and a social ex-penditure review (World Bank 2001b). 38. Its technical strength, comprehensiveness, and consistency were not enough to ensure ownership(Gonzalez-Rosetti forthcoming, p. 37). 39. The official World Bank definition of a SWAp is \"an approach to support a locally-owned program fora coherent sector in a comprehensive and coordinatedmanner, moving toward the use of country systems\"(World Bank Operations Policy and Country Services). 40. The broad international consensus that country- led management of aid was more likely to promote de-velopment was evident by the endorsement of over 100countries and donor organizations of the Paris Decla- ration on Aid Effectiveness in 2005. 41. Parallel funding is earmarked for project financ- ing that supports implementation of the national healthplan. 42. Pooled funding is the pooling of Bank support together with the financial resources of other devel-opment partners for the purpose of supporting the im-plementation of national health plans and programs.These funds, allocated and managed by the govern-ment, can be channeled through the budget or in a sep-arate account that is a supplement to the health budget.In all of the examples analyzed for this review, thepooled funds remained separate from the rest of thegovernment budget, as a supplement to the health sector. 43. These 28 projects were defined as having the following characteristics in their design documents:(a) explicitly reference support of a sectorwide ap-proach; (b) appear to support a program or sectorwideapproach, even without explicit reference to a SWAp;or (c) provide for the pooling and joint managementof donor funding. Among that list of projects, those wereretained that had: (d) mechanisms for coordination be-tween the government and donors, and among donors;and (e) a common M&E framework for measuring pro-gram performance used by most donors and govern-ment and a mechanism for joint reviews of programperformance. Support of a sector policy and programis another fundamental characteristic of a SWAp, but isalso a common feature of non-SWAp Bank support, sowas not used as a defining criterion. 44. The portfolio review understates the extent of World Bank support for health SWAps to the extent thatoperations outside of the HNP sector that also supporthealth SWAps are excluded. T wo examples are thehealth SWAps in Rwanda and Uganda, which are sup-ported by Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC). 45. The countries in which Bank support was not pooled included: Mauritania (2 projects), Ethiopia,Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Sri Lanka, and Lesotho.The Bank's decision not to pool appears to be linkedto weak country systems and capacities for the alloca-tion and management of pooled funds and, as a con-sequence, a decision to undertake a more gradualapproach both to build country capacity and to nurtureand encourage other partners to move in this direction. 46. Other sectors are discussing adopting interna- tionally accepted procedures for procurement, financialmanagement, and audit. The Ministry of Finance hasnoted its appreciation for the fiduciary rigor of the SWApprocedures, as it insulates the sector from corruption. 47. This is in contrast to pre-SWAp arrangements, in which donor financing did not appear routinely inthe government health budget and thus could not beused for purposes of government planning. 48. Malawi also lacks a sound public expenditure framework. 49. Use of country M&E systems still does not ab- solve the responsibility of the development partners andgovernment to physically verify that implementation istaking place. 170IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION50. For example, the underfunding of malaria control in Ghana; this was also the case with the SWAp in Malawi. Chapter 4 1. The 2007 HNP strategy proposes a new line of ESW called the Multisectoral Constraints Assessment, tohelp country teams identify the investments and sec-tor work most likely to result in improved health out-comes, especially among the poor, in the preparationof CASs. Such analysis might result in either multisec-toral operations or strategically complementary sectorallending. The specifics of this new analytic instrumenthave yet to be elaborated. There has been no system-atic review of the extent to which the Bank's CASsover the past decade have already addressed health ina multisectoral way, and the lessons learned. 2. The sample of CASs reviewed included all those approved from fiscal 1997 to 2006 from South Asia, EastAsia and the Pacific, and the Middle East and NorthAfrica, and a 50 percent random sample of the CASsfrom the other three larger Regions (Latin Americaand Caribbean, Europe and Central Asia, and Africa).This amounted to 65 percent of all CASs issued over theperiod. In addition, all 30 CAS Completion Report Re-views to date were reviewed to assess the extent towhich planned multisectoral action actually occurred.Unless otherwise noted, the results cited in the text areweighted to take into account the stratification of thesample. See Sinha and Gaubatz 2008. 3. Only 18 percent of CASs acknowledged the impact of HNP outcomes on other sectors. The most com-monly cited linkage was environmental\u2014the impactof population growth on natural resources (6 percent).All of these were in low-income countries and almostall were in Africa. Only 5 percent of CASs acknowl- edged the impact of HNP status on poverty reduction . 4. This includes 9 percent that had both multisec- toral and complementary lending. 5. There was one example in each of three regions where there were some linkages between the HNP sec-tor and sectors proposed for complementary lending\u2014child and maternal health objectives in a water supplyand sanitation project in Ghana, indicator for increasednumber of trips to health clinics for transport projectin Laos, and health care centers as an indicator for in-frastructure in Sri Lanka. The lack of coordination acrosssectoral lending programs does not imply that each ofthe sectoral programs individually has not produced ben-efits for HNP outcomes indirectly, but rather that the closer coordination and synergies envisioned in thestrategy have not really been attempted. 6. In fact, implementing a multisectoral response was itself an objective in many of these projects. A case inpoint is the Ghana AIDS Response Project (GARFUND),for which the first objective was \"to intensify multi-sectoral activities designed to combat the spread ofHIV/AIDS.\" 7. The main challenge of these projects has to do with the number of actors and the need to generateintersectoral collaboration, not the number of com-ponents. Multisectoral projects had a mean of 3.7 com-ponents (3.9 for HIV/AIDS projects and 3.3 for othermultisectoral HNP projects), compared with 3.6 com-ponents for HNP projects that were not multisectoral. 8. The most frequently cited implementing agencies were the ministries of health (91 percent); education(25 percent); labor, social security, or employment (12percent); social welfare, social affairs, or gender (11 per-cent); agriculture (7 percent); justice or prisons (6 per-cent); economy, finance, or planning (5 percent); andinformation (5 percent). 9. Indonesia Iodine Deficiency Control, Senegal Nutrition Enhancement Program. 10. Outcome ratings can also be compared for mul- tisectoral projects according to the executing agencyarrangements: managed by the Ministry of Health (9projects, 44 percent satisfactory); managed by unitunder the office of the president or prime minister (8projects, none satisfactory); managed by finance orother ministries (8 projects, 75 percent satisfactory);managed by multiple ministries (3 projects, 67 per-cent satisfactory). However, all of the projects managedby multisectoral commissions had other commondesign features that could have influenced outcomesindependently of the management structure. The bor-rower's performance for that subset of multisectoralprojects was 63 percent satisfactory, but the Bank'sperformance was only 35 percent satisfactory. 11. IDI and sustainability ratings have been dis- continued, so not all closed projects have them. Four-teen multisectoral projects had closed that had IDIratings, of which 4 were HIV/AIDS projects and 10were other multisectoral HNP projects; 41 single-sectorHNP projects had closed and received IDI ratings. Thepercent of projects with IDI ratings of substantial orhigher was: all multisectoral (43 percent), and single-sector HNP projects (61 percent).There were no significant differences in the sustain-ability ratings across these four categories\u2014in all cases,70 percent or more of the projects got ratings of likelyor higher on sustainability. 12. Social funds are multisectoral programs that provide financing (usually grants) for small-scale pub-lic investments targeted at meeting the needs of thepoor and vulnerable communities, and at contributingto social capital and development at the local level. 13. In fact, although in the Bank's internal financial system certain percentages of Development PolicyLoans (including PRSCs) are notionally attributed to thesector, these funds are not earmarked to the health sec-tor, nor can they even be linked to higher spending inthe health sector. (See note 2 in chapter 2 for a defi-nition of DPL.) 14. Social Funds: Assessing Effectiveness found that social fund projects, many of which have invested inhealth infrastructure, have been highly effective in de-livering small-scale infrastructure, but less so in achiev-ing consistently positive and significant improvementsin outcomes and welfare impacts. While they have de-livered slightly more than proportional benefits to thepoor and the poorest, there have also been a significantnumber of non-poor beneficiaries. Most social fundbeneficiaries are satisfied with the subprojects, but thegreatest community problems have not necessarilybeen addressed and there is no assurance that the se-lected subprojects ensure the highest net benefits tothe community. While social fund facilities are gener-ally operating and equipped, they have not been im-mune to staffing and equipment shortages. Social fundagencies have developed capacity as effective and in-novative organizations; wider impacts on existing in-stitutions have been much more limited. 15. For the full portfolio reviews, see Overbey 2008 for water supply and sanitation and Freeman andMathur 2008 for transport. The transport review in-cluded only projects linked to the T ransport SectorBoard, with commitments under sector codes TA (roadsand highways), TP (ports, waterways, and shipping), TV(aviation), TW (railways), and TZ (general transporta-tion, including urban transport). 16.

Water-related diseases include waterborne diseases, water-washed (or water scarce) diseases that are transmittedbecause of a lack of water for hygiene, water-relatedvector-borne diseases, transmitted by insects that breedin water or bite near water, like dengue, malaria, andtrypanosomiasis; and water-based diseases that trans-mit via an aquatic intermediate host, such as schisto-somiasis and guinea worm. 17. Three of the closed projects had explicit health objectives and planned to collect health outcome data,but only two actually did so\u2014the Morocco and NepalRural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects. Among the23 closed water supply and sanitation projects withouta health objective, 3 nevertheless planned to collecthealth data, but only the Kazakhstan Atryau Pilot WaterSupply and Sanitation Project did so, documenting adecline in dysentery, typhoid, intestinal infections, andhepatitis A from 1999 to 2002. A fourth project withouthealth objectives and that did not plan to collect healthdata nevertheless did\u2014the Madagascar Rural WaterSupply and Sanitation Pilot, documenting a decline inwater-borne diseases (cholera, bilharzias, and diar-rhea) from 2002 to 2004. 18. WHO 2004. Losses were measured in terms of disability-adjusted life years. 19. The review included only projects under the re- sponsibility of the T ransport Sector Board; projectswith air quality objectives and that fell either under theEnvironment Sector Board or that were funded throughthe Global Environment Facility (GEF) are therefore notin the sample. 20. The lack of data on outcomes of HIV/AIDS com- ponents of transport projects mirrors the experienceof transport components in HIV/AIDS projects. Amongfive recently completed HIV/AIDS projects managed bythe health sector with activities aimed at transportworkers or Ministry of T ransport civil service, none re-ported baseline or end-point data on risk behavior orcondom use among transport workers. None of the ICRsprovided information on the impact of the transportsector interventions. 21. This is not meant to imply that coordination across the complementary sectors is necessary to con-tribute to HNP outcomes; it is possible that investmentsin complementary sectors, even if not coordinated, aresufficient. However, the outputs and outcomes of in- 172IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATIONvestments in complementary sectors are integral to the results chain contributing to HNP outcomes and wouldwarrant monitoring. Chapter 5 1. \"[O]ne of our key objectives is to complement the World Bank's work in areas of policy advice and dia-logue, lending, and analysis in the health sector. Thus,we believe it is essential that the process feature the clos-est collaboration possible with the HNP anchor and re-gional staff in the Bank.\" IFC 2002, p. 3. 2. IFC Strategic Directions, March 23, 2004, pp. 5-16. IFC produces a Strategic Directions paperevery year. This refers 2004 corporate strategy. 3. In September 2006, IFC and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation partnered on a research project thatinvestigated the best private health care business mod-els in Africa, conducted by McKinsey and Companyand published as \" The Business of Health in Africa: Part- nering with the Private Sector to Improve People'sLives \" (IFC 2007a). Based on that report, IFC established its Africa Health Initiatives with the objective of mobi-lizing up to $1 billion over five years to boost health carein the Region. The Gates Foundation also committedto cofinance technical assistance activities related to theimplementation of the said initiative. 4. The commitment amount (net of cancellations) represents IFC's legally binding potential financialexposure to the client. It is the standard measurementof IFC's financial exposure in its Annual Report andfinancial statements, as well as the standard referenceof multilateral development bank activities in the \"GoodPractice Standards for Evaluation of Private Sector In-vestment Operations\" (MDB/ ECG/WGPSE 2006, p. 2). 5. IFC invested in small hospitals and clinics through special promotional facilities such as Africa EnterpriseFund (AEF) and Small Enterprise Fund (SEF). These ini-tiatives are for IFC to make direct investments in smalland medium-size enterprises where local intermediarieswere not providing sufficient financing to viable proj-ects. IEG evaluated the AEF program as a whole andfound mixed results. While most projects had positivefeatures, only about half were successful. The programhas been costly and required a $5 million fund injec-tion for operating costs. The hospital investments sharethis feature. IFC committed 15 projects (average in-vestment amount was $0.9 million) from 1997 until2001, when the programs were restructured and ef-fectively limited its operations. More than half of the projects failed to generate sufficient revenue to repayloans or provide any returns on equity. Half of the proj-ects experienced some write-off of IFC investment;IFC investments were fully written off for a third. Theyare not featured in this study because, in line with themultilateral development banks' best practice on pri-vate sector evaluation, they were promotional activitieswith their own investment criteria outside of conven-tional IFC operations, and only used selectively. 6. The hospital projects approved after fiscal 2002 are focused on modern urban hospitals, but they havestarted to incorporate new features to enhance their po-tential development impact. For example, one projectin Sub-Saharan Africa has a link with output-based aidthat provides health insurance to the poor, enabling thehospital to provide services to underserved segmentsof the population. This is consistent with the approachproposed in the 2002 strategy for the Bank Group.Moreover, IFC emphasizes repeat investment with thesame clients and investment that moves downmarket,that is, into local markets and out of those dominatedby foreigners. Still, it is too soon to evaluate the outreachto local patients. Since 2005, IFC has invested in newareas, such as distance medical education in China.The client company provides distance education fornurses and other medical professions through public-private partnership between local medial universities,local public hospitals, and doctors' associations. 7. Life science projects are also increasing in variety, as they relate not only to generic drug production (fiveof them) but also to vaccine production, drug distri-bution, and research and development. All of the proj-ects have focused on research and development. Outof 11 life science projects in the third period, 3 haveactivities related to antimalaria drugs/vaccines; 1 hasfocused its research and development on country-specific diseases. 8. The AEF was established in 1988 to make direct investment in small- and medium-size enterprises inSub-Saharan Africa. It was established because of ashortage of suitable private sector intermediaries in theRegion willing and capable of providing long-term fi-nance to such enterprises. 9. IFC's investment outcome rating is an assessment of the gross profit contribution quality of an IFC loanand/or equity investment, i.e., without taking into ac-count transaction costs or the cost of IFC equity capi- ENDNOTES 173tal. Loans are rated satisfactory provided they are ex- pected to be repaid in full with interest and fees asscheduled (or are prepaid or rescheduled withoutloss). Equities are rated satisfactory if they yield an ap-propriate premium on the return on a loan to thesame company (a nominal U.S. dollar internal rate ofreturn greater than or equal to the fixed loan interestrate plus 5 percent). 10. For real sector projects, like those in health, project business success is assessed according to whether they generated a project financial rate of re-turn at least equal to the company's cost of capital(with a 350 basis-point spread to its equity investors over its lenders' nominal yield). Economic sustain- ability is assessed according to whether the project gen- erated an economic rate of return of at least 10 percent(in cases in which it can be assessed). Environmental and social effects are measured by whether environ- mental performance meets IFC's requirements and bythe projects' net beneficial impact in terms of pollutionloads, conservation of biodiversity and natural re-sources, social, cultural and community health aspects,as well as labor and working conditions and workers'health and safety. Private sector development impacts measure impacts beyond the project company, demon-strating effects in creating a sustainable enterprise ca-pable of attracting finance, increasing competition,and establishing linkages with other firms. 11. A blockbuster drug is a drug generating more than $1 billion of revenue for its owner each year. 12. Advisory Services specifically refers to a service product category in IFC. These services cover a broadrange of activities including technical assistance to IFCclient companies, fee-based advice to governments onprivatization, and feasibility and market studies. SomeAdvisory Services projects are funded by trust funds andothers by IFC's own account. 13. According to the rating methodology for Advi- sory Services, development effectiveness can be ratedfor projects even if the impact dimension cannot be de-termined (because of lack of information, for example).This explains why six projects could be rated overall ondevelopment effectiveness, even though only two hada rating on the impact dimension. 14. The 2002 health strategy mentions that an entry strategy was under development to identify the mostpromising investment opportunities in the biotech-nology industry. It envisioned that IFC would initiallyemphasize opportunities with significant downstreampotential (product development and commercializa- tion), rather than upstream basic research. IFC 2002,p. 38. 15. For example, see Roland Berger's research at http://www.rolandberger.com/expertise/industries/healthcare. 16. Full-time/full-year staff refers to staff that worked for more than 2,040 hours in a given year in the Healthand Education Department (CHE). 17. The Health Insurance Reform Project (fiscal 1996, opening competition among the social insur-ance funds), the Provincial Health Sector Develop-ment Project (fiscal 1996), the Second Provincial ReformProject (fiscal 1998) and the Second Maternal and ChildHealth and Nutrition Project (fiscal 1997, basic healthservices). Based on IEG's field visit, this collaborationbetween the World Bank and IFC was effective until theArgentina financial crisis in 2001, after which commu-nication and collaboration were reduced as the Bankand IFC took wider actions to avoid actual and perceivedconflicts of interest within the World Bank Group.These actions resulted in increased barriers in sharinginformation. 18. As of end of fiscal 2008, about one-third of ac- tive CASs were done jointly by the World Bank and IFC.IFC's engagement in the World Bank Group CAS hasbeen ad hoc and uneven. For much detailed assessmentof IFC's involvement in the CAS in general, see IEG's\"Biennial Report on Operations Evaluation in IFC 2008\"(August 2008). Appendix B 1. For the two projects managed by the HNP sector that had no HNP sector code\u2014the HIV/AIDS GreatLakes Initiative (fiscal 2005) and the Indonesia WSSLICIII (fiscal 2006)\u2014design documents were reviewedand the projects were manually coded to accurately re-flect the projects' true allocation to health. 2. According to the IEG review of the transport sec- tor (IEG 2007a), only 16 percent of all transport proj-ects were managed under sector boards other thantransport. 3. A coterminous appointment is a term (maximum of 4 years) or open-ended appointment of indefiniteduration funded 100 percent from sources other thanthe Bank's budget. 4. A rights issue is the additional purchase of a com- pany's equities in the event of a new issue and exercisingshareholders' rights to avoid dilution of its position. 174IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATIONRescheduling of a project often involves a new project ID, but there is no new investment; for evaluation pur-poses, it is bundled with the original project. These ex-clusions are consistent with the Expanded ProjectSupervision Report sampling methodology, as well asthe Good Practice Standards. 5. The projects meet early operating maturity and are subject of performance assessment when: (a) theproject has been substantially completed; (b) it hasgenerated at least 18 months of operating revenuesfor the company; and (c) IFC has received at least oneset of audited annual financial statements covering atleast 12 months of operating revenues generated by theproject. Appendix E 1. This appendix draws on the background paper by Fair (forthcoming). 2. These projects were studied in greater depth be- cause they had a population or family planning focus.They understate the extent of Bank support for familyplanning, which is often financed as part of maternaland child health, safe motherhood, reproductive health,or general health investments. Eight of the projects hadexplicit objectives to reduce fertility or populationgrowth, three had objectives to improve the distribu-tion or quality of family planning, two aimed to improvereproductive health outcomes, and one supportedbetter access to an essential health package that in-cluded family planning. This discussion is based onthe background paper by Fair (forthcoming). 3. Malawi Population and Family Planning, Indone- sia Safe Motherhood, and Madagascar Health SectorSupport Program II. 4. According to demographic and health survey data, the total fertility rate in Guinea increased from 5.5 to 5.7 over 1999-2005 and modern contraceptiveuse rose only from 4.9 to 6.8. 5. The total fertility rate declined in Gambia from about 6.0 to 5.1, which could be attributable in part tohigher female education and delays in marriage ofyounger cohorts of women or to social marketing andgreater availability of family planning services sup-ported under the project. The total fertility rate inSenegal declined from 5.7 to 5.3 over the period1997-2004. However, the modern contraceptive preva-lence rose only from 9 to 10.3 percent, and only halfof women who wanted more children had access tocontraception.6. The quality at entry was unsatisfactory for six of the eight projects with unsatisfactory outcome ratings;for all eight projects with unsatisfactory outcome rat-ings, the quality of Bank supervision was also in the un-satisfactory range. 7. T arget 5b is to achieve, by 2015, universal access to reproductive health. The main indicators are the con-traceptive prevalence rate, the adolescent birth rate, an-tenatal care coverage (at least one visit and at leastfour visits), and unmet need for family planning. Appendix F 1. Shekar, Heaver, and Lee 2006, pp. 3-4. Over- nutrition, or obesity, is an increasing problem con-tributing to morbidity and mortality in developingcountries, and is often found in the same householdsas undernutrition. 2. Ergo, Shekar, and Gwatkin 2008, pp. 7-8. greatest inequality in stunting is in Latin America andthe Caribbean, while the greatest average levels arefound in South Asia (more than 50 percent of childrenare stunted in all four countries), followed by Sub-Saharan Africa (average of 41 percent stunted across 26countries with recent household surveys). 3. Three-quarters of these projects had an objective of improving nutritional status, including child growthand reducing nutrient deficiencies, and about one infive aimed to increase the access to or quality of nu-trition services. One project aimed to mitigate the im-pact of malnutrition. 4. This understates the Bank's support for nutrition to the extent that nutrition activities are often includedin the basic health care packages, yet not mentionedin the PAD. In addition, it is likely that projects in othersectors make major contributions to nutritional status(such as agriculture). 5. Seven of the projects were sectorwide approaches in health (Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Mau-ritania, Niger, Sri Lanka) that had either an explicit nu-trition objective or component. 6. The 27 projects were approved in 20 countries; 12 of these countries had child stunting (height for age)of at least 30 percent, compared with a total of 47 de-veloping countries overall with this average level ofstunting (Shekar, Heaver, and Lee 2006, appendix 5.6). 7. Only 3 percent of projects in Europe and Central Asia were nutrition projects. For the remaining Re-gions, nutrition projects accounted for 12-14 percentof the HNP portfolio.ENDNOTES 1758.

See, in particular, chapter 4 for a discussion of the health effects of water supply and sanitation interven-tions in Nepal. 10. The Bank's performance was rated satisfactory for 57 percent of the closed projects, and the bor-rower's performance only slightly better (64 percent). 11. World Bank 2004b. Note, however, that these figures are based on a comparison of a baseline totalgoiter rate among both schoolchildren and pregnantwomen and a follow-up measurement of schoolchil-dren only. This is an example of the very weak M&E inmost of the nutrition portfolio. A 2001 study by IEGcompared the performance of this project with twoother iodine deficiency projects that promoted pro-duction, distribution, and consumption of iodized saltin China and Madagascar (Goh 2001). The study pointedto the extreme difficulty of getting results in Indone-sia because of the large number of small salt produc-ers that are difficult to regulate (70 percent of saltproduction comes from small salt farmers). In con-trast, salt production and distribution is centrally con-trolled in China, while about six large producers inMadagascar produce 80 percent of the salt. That studyfound four key factors affecting the success of projectspromoting iodized salt to combat iodine-deficiencydisorders (IDD): (a) information and behavior changecommunication concerning IDD to raise the demandfor iodized salt; (b) easy access; (c) industry compliance,through persuasion and alignment of incentives withthe self-interests of the salt industry and consumers; and (d) quality control, since consumers cannot tell theextent of iodization. 12. In the Sri Lanka Health Services Development Project, low birthweight declined marginally, and anevaluation of one year of work by the nongovernmen-tal organizations showed minimal impact; other indi-cators like the consumption of iodized salt were notmeasured. The Mauritania Nutrition, Food Security and Social Mobilization Project \u2014a Learning and In- novation Loan that was supposed to test two differentapproaches to improved nutrition\u2014did not do so; mal-nutrition was reduced 16 percent in two urban areas(though the data being compared are from a lean monthand a normal season, so this may be exaggerated) andincreased in rural areas by 6-8 percent; anemia amongpregnant women and consumption of iodized sale were not measured. (Mauritania also experienced a majordrought and locust infestation during project imple-mentation.) The Bangladesh National Nutrition Pro- gram did not collect baseline data until two years before the project closed, and found that some of the targetsthat had been set were already achieved at baseline; proj-ect monitoring data suggest a decline in severe protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) from 24 to 16 percent from2004 to 2006, and moderate PEM from 30 to 25 percent.There was substantial evidence of increased knowledgeand change in some behaviors, however. Finally, therewas no discernable improvement in malnutrition indi-cators in Andhra Pradesh, India, during the Economic Restructuring Projec t. (Source: Implementation Com- pletion Reports.) Appendix G 1. ESW is an activity that \"(a) involves analytic effort; (b) is undertaken with the intent of influencing an ex-ternal client's policies and/or programs; and (c) rep-resents the views of the Bank (that is, not attributed toindividual authors).\" (IEG 2008h, p. 1) 2. Of this amount, $27.7 million was from the Bank budget and $15.1 million was financed from trust funds.Fiscal 2000 is the starting point for this review, becausebefore that date ESW was not systematically tracked inthe Bank's internal information systems. 3. The Reaching the Poor with HNP Services Project was partly financed by the Bank's research supportbudget, partly as knowledge management through theWorld Bank Institute and the HNP anchor, in additionto the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the gov-ernments of Netherlands and Sweden. The only partof the exercise captured as official ESW were a few dis-semination activities. 4. This total excludes obvious duplicates (for exam- ple, when a research working paper was also publishedas a book chapter). See the discussion in appendix H.One reason for the difference is that ESW for fiscal1997-99 is not in the official database. However, becauseof the elapsed time, analytic work from those years wasalso more difficult to locate, despite an exhaustivesearch conducted by IEG. 5. The distribution of HNP ESW is slightly more skewed toward regional ESW and less to the countrylevel, compared to the distribution for all sectors com-bined (country-level, 78 percent; regional, 17 percent;global, 5 percent) (IEG 2008h). 176IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE POOR IN HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION6. The results tracking framework for ESW was in- troduced in 2004; all ESW with a budget > $50,000 hadto include a statement of objectives as of fiscal 2004,and in 2005, this was expanded to include all ESW .While the share of HNP ESW with an objective of in-forming lending may seem low (51 percent), it is actuallygreater than for ESW Bank-wide (41 percent with an ob-jective of informing lending) (IEG 2008h). 7. While most PERs are managed outside the HNP sector, in some cases PERs have been sponsored by theHNP sector. Appendix J 1. The 1997 HNP Strategy, Health, Nutrition, and Population Sector Strategy Paper (World Bank 1997b), July 3, 1997, called for (a) improving health, nutrition,and population outcomes for the poor; (b) enhancingthe performance of health care systems; and (c) se-curing sustainable health care financing. This was to beachieved through (i) sharpening strategic directions;(ii) achieving greater impact; (iii) empowering HNP staff;and (iv) building partnerships. 2. For example, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, T u- berculosis and Malaria (GFATM), the Global Alliance forVaccines and Immunization (GAVI), the Bill and MelindaGates Foundation, and the U.S. President's EmergencyPlan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). 3. For example, the International Health Partner- ship, for which the Bank, jointly with the World HealthOrganization (WHO), provides the secretariat. 4. See, for example, the investigative study cited in endnote 6. 5. Even in low-income countries, total official de- velopment assistance for health is less than 30 per-cent of total expenditures. 6. An example of a country application of the Reaching the Poor work is the investigative study of uti-lization of health services and patient satisfaction for the poor in selected states in India, which has led to arange of reforms including management training, newstaffing and service patterns, provision of essentialdrugs, and repair of equipment and facilities. This pro-gram resulted in increased utilization of all types ofhealth facilities (improving absolute levels of utilizationamong the poorest 40 percent of the population) andimproved patient satisfaction at lower-level project fa-cilities (as opposed to hospitals) for the poor. 7. The establishment of two regional hubs in Africa (in Dakar and Nairobi) and recruitment of 10 high-level experts with a strong health systems focus will becompleted by the end of fiscal year 2009. 8. Management notes, however, that during a 2005 Board discussion of the report from the Committee onDevelopment Effectiveness, Committing to Results: Improving the Effectiveness of HIV/AIDS Assistanceand Draft Management Response , questions were raised about the IEG's [formerly Operations and Eval-uation Department's] evaluation methodology of theBank's HIV/AIDS assistance, and concerns were raisedabout IEG's tone. 9. IEG would like to clarify that the recent results for HIV/AIDS projects highlighted in the HNP evaluationpost-date the 2005 HIV/AIDS evaluation, which coveredresults only through mid-2004 and did not include anycompleted projects from the Multi-Country HIV/AIDSProgram. Further, IEG and management use the sameharmonized criteria for rating projects in all sectors, in-cluding HIV/AIDS. 10. The Portfolio Improvement Action Plan includes an analysis of the critical obstacles to project im-provement, changes needed to upgrade projects, andmeasures to restructure or cancel if needed. Additionalfinancial and/or technical support to achieve these im-provements is an explicit part of the plan.ENDNOTES 177Koh Toch Health Center in Kampot Province, Cambodia.
