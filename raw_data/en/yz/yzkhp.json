Cultures around the world have harnessed the power of herbal medicine and aromatherapy for millennia, and these practices are at the very root of modern medicine. But somewhere along the way, we've lost touch with the earth, turning instead to a medicine cabinet to mend whatever ails us. MasterPeace is a call to return to Mother Nature and remember her mighty medicine, too. MasterPeace Body Therapy is made with pure plant extracts and natural mineral ingredients. You will not find any harmful fillers, preservatives or chemicals added. Each blend is uniquely formulated by selecting the perfect ingredients to stimulate the senses and enact the healing powers of each aromatic compound. These remarkable salves nourish your skin and offer intoxicating fragrances inviting you to experience a range of emotions - from energized to calm. Each blend of herbs is carefully curated by my own hands. Over the years, crafting these blends has helped me maintain a state of grounded peace no matter what chaos or dysfunction may be happening in the world. MasterPeace is my humble offering to you to help you find peace, calm, joy and rejuvenation so you can create good, clean energetic space for yourself. For years, I've been gathering insight into how people process energy and challenges, and I've poured all of that experience into MasterPeace Body Therapy to create an amazing, specially crafted line of holistic bath and body products designed to relax your mind, pamper your body, and rejuvenate your spirit. Each herbal tincture is a deeply personal endeavor to me. They were born of my desire to unite my community and better the world. They embody my beloved Gemmia and continue her legacy. They are my gift to a world that's often brimming with anxiety, self-doubt, and suffering. My grandmother, Rissie Harris, was a master herbalist. She knew the uses for each one and understood how to combine herbs to create internal and external remedies. The exact details of how she gained this knowledge have been lost to time, but Rissie passed her wisdom down to my father, and he generously shared it with me. I studied at his feet, fascinated by the power that seemingly simple plants held in their bellies. I've always believed that when you do what you love, it blesses not only you but everyone around you. I delight in the process of researching the best ingredients for each blend and testing them on my loved ones and friends. I'm ever-grateful for this opportunity to honor my beloved daughter and be a vessel for her work. Thank you for believing in me... GEMMIA VANZANT Sunrise: May 12, 1972 Sunset: December 25, 2003 My beloved Gemmia began formulating products to support people in clearing their energy as they cleansed their bodies. Though she was my daughter, I was often her student. I marveled at her love of scents, and I cheered her on as she pursued formal studies in aromatherapy. She learned that combinations of natural aromas could have a powerful impact on all aspects of being human (mind, emotions, physical body, and spirit), while most herbs affected only one facet of our being. Through careful study and calculation, Gemmia created MasterPeace products to shift and elevate both physical and metaphysical energy. Gemmia ultimately left this world in God's time, but far sooner than I desired. An avid writer, I summoned the courage to crawl into her bed and read her journals a few months after her death. One passage- in particular - struck me: \"Father, I know that you have great things ordained for me. I even know that some of the things you have planned for me, I will not be able to do in this body. This body is just physical. The greatness you have for me is of a spiritual nature, a nature that I may never find in this body.\" Gemmia passed just a few months after penning those words, transitioning on Christmas morning, 2003. Reading her words and exploring her formulas lay at the center of my healing process. I soon discovered that I could easily connect with Gemma's energy as I worked, and that was a source of tremendous comfort for me. Gemmia is an exquisite spirit, a shining soul, and my bright light. Her energy continues through the creation of each MasterPeace Body Therapy product, and it is through them that I celebrate her life and carry her legacy forward for her daughter. Whenever I'm formulating a new product or spreading the message of MasterPeace, I feel her presence, and I know that she is pleased that her "}
