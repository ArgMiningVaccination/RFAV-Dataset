[Sarah Cobey](https://eegraduate.uchicago.edu/program/faculty/sarah-cobey) Sarah Cobey's group will perform computational modeling of the immune responses to influenza vaccines to understand factors affecting the durability and magnitude of responses. [Bruce Innis](https://www.path.org/leadership/bruce-l-innis/)The PATH team will provide expertise and help in influenza vaccine design, discovery, and development, adjuvant development, and their knowledge of regulatory guidelines and submission processes for clinical testing of candidate vaccines. Dr. Wang's team will be characterizing functional antibody responses elicited by experimental vaccines and adjuvants. Dr. Iwasaki's contribution to CIVIC is to examine the ability of various adjuvants to induce systemic and mucosal antibody and T cell immunity by vaccine antigens identified by CIVIC against influenza virus challenge in mice, and to dissect the innate immune signaling pathways that leads to protective immunity by the candidate vaccines. [Ian Wilson](https://wilson.scripps.edu/) & [Andrew Ward](https://ward.scripps.edu/) The structural biology component of this project comprises of two interrelated components, X-ray crystallography in the Wilson laboratory and electron microscopy (EM) in the Ward laboratory, coupled with other biophysical analyses. Together, we perform all structural biology studies in the CIVIC project to determine the binding and three-dimensional structure of influenza HA and NA antigens (from influenza A and B viruses) in complex with neutralizing antibodies whether elicited through natural infection or vaccine-induced, and also designed immunogens also in complex with antibodies. That information will be used to help design and characterize immunogens as universal vaccine candidates. These immunogens will then be tested in vivo and in vitro in the other components of the CIVIC in iterative cycles of structure, design and functional studies. The structural methods include X-ray crystallography, negative-stain electron microscopy, cryo-electron microscopy and microscopy polyclonal epitope mapping (EMPEM) on serum samples from patients enrolled in vaccine trials. biophysical methods, including Bio-Layer Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), will also be used to characterize influenza HA and NA antigens (from influenza A and B viruses), vaccine candidates, and their complexes with neutralizing antibodies. [Peter Palese](https://icahn.mssm.edu/profiles/peter-palese)The Palese laboratory focuses on generating mosaic HA vaccine constructs, including H1, H3 and B HAs, as well as characterizing their immunogenicity in mice. The immunodominant, sequence-variable antigenic sites of the mosaic HAs (mHA) are silenced by mutating them to corresponding sequences of avian HA proteins to yield the \"mosaic\" phenotype. These constructs will be used in sequential vaccination regimes with constructs having a conserved \"framework\" and different grafted antigenic sites at each immunization. We hypothesize that this vaccination approach will focus antibody responses to the subdominant, conserved epitopes in both the head and stalk domains, thereby generating broad and long-lasting immunity. [Jeffrey V. Ravetch](https://www.rockefeller.edu/our-scientists/heads-of-laboratories/889-jeffrey-v-ravetch/) Dr. Jeffrey V. Ravetch is the Theresa and Eugene M. Lang Professor at the Rockefeller University and Head of the Leonard Wagner Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Immunology. Dr. Ravetch has made ground-breaking discoveries on the mechanisms by which antibodies mediate protective responses in vivo. These studies have established the general foundation of antibody-mediated therapy by demonstrating the essential role of Fc interactions with distinct Fc receptors, resulting in the development and approval of novel antibody therapeutics. In recent studies, Dr. Ravetch has demonstrated a critical role for Fc receptor pathways in modulating vaccine efficacy, as well as in contributing to the in vivo protective activity of antibodies against infectious pathogens, including influenza virus, anthrax, Ebola virus, and HIV-1. As part of the CIVIC consortium, Dr. Ravetch aims to study the Fc effector function of vaccine-elicited IgG responses, determining the role of Fc-FcR interactions in the in vivo activity of protective anti-influenza antibodies. These studies will be performed in novel mouse strains, previously developed and characterized by the Ravetch laboratory. Such strains faithfully recapitulate the unique complexity of human FcR biology, serving as a robust platform for the evaluation of human antibody function in vivo. [Aubree Gordon](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/gordon-aubree.html) Aubree Gordon's group will work on correlates of protection as well as correlates of long-lived immunity. This work will include examining correlates in observational epidemiological studies of natural infections in humans, in animal studies, and in next-generation and universal influenza virus vaccine trials. [Ali Ellebedy](http://www.ellebedylab.org/) The Ellebedy lab interrogates the dynamics and specificity of germinal center and memory B cell responses to universal influenza vaccine candidates in both pre-clinical models and clinical specimens. [Patrick C. Wilson](http://wilsonlab.uchicago.edu/news/) The ultimate goal of most - if not all - human vaccines currently in use is to generate antigen-specific memory B cells (MBCs) and long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). Both of these subsets provide the host with a persistent source of protective antibodies and are therefore needed to maintain durable immune protection following vaccination. Thus, understanding how B cells are initially recruited and stimulated by vaccines and the specificity and functional capacity of antibodies encoded by these cells is a central component to the candidate vaccines' development and evaluation. The laboratory of Patrick Wilson will work in the characterization of B cell and monoclonal antibody responses in detail. Also the Wilson laboratory has accumulated an extensive collection of monoclonal antibody reagents against influenza virus produced in similar studies that will be of value in templating and evaluating novel vaccine candidates and for iterative vaccine design. [Yoshihiro Kawaoka](https://www.vetmed.wisc.edu/people/kawaokay/) Together with the Garc\u00eda-Sastre group at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, the Kawaoka group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison will assess influenza vaccine candidates in different animal models. Specifically, the Kawaoka group will test the immunogenicity, virulence, transmissibility, and/or protective efficacy of vaccine candidates in mice, guinea pigs, and/or ferrets. Moreover, the Kawaoka group will establish pre-immunization animal models to test vaccine efficacy in animals with prior exposure to influenza viruses, similar to the situation in humans (with the exception of infants). [Rama Rao Amara](http://vaccines.emory.edu/faculty-evc/primary-faculty/amara_rama.html) Dr. Amara's laboratory at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center of Emory University is developing vaccines for HIV, TB and other infectious diseases using the non-human primate (NHP) model. His laboratory developed the state of the art T cell and B cell assays for NHP experiments. As part of this CIVIC, his laboratory will be responsible for studying the longevity of humoral and cellular immune responses induced by various vaccine delivery systems including proteins, DNA and RNA. Protein vaccinations will also test the influence of different adjuvants. One of the primary goals of these experiments will be to identify molecular and immunological mechanisms that are associated with induction of long-lived immunity against influenza proteins in NHPs that can be tested/compared eventually with vaccinations in humans. [Shane Crotty](https://www.lji.org/faculty-research/labs/crotty/#overview) The Crotty laboratory has expertise in T follicular helper (Tfh) cells (Immunity 2019), germinal center biology, and human and non-human primate vaccine immunology (Cell 2019, Science 2019). We will apply this expertise in the context of the CIVIC to assess candidate universal influenza vaccine approaches to understand the CD4 T cell and B cell immunological challenges that need to be overcome for the development of effective, broad, protective immunity to influenza. [David Weiner](https://wistar.org/our-scientists/david-weiner) & [Daniel Kulp (Wistar)](https://wistar.org/our-scientists/daniel-kulp) The overall goal of the CIVIC project at the Wistar Institute is to design and evaluate improved Synthetic DNA (SynDNA)-encoded seasonal influenza vaccines. Two integrative approaches will be employed with a focus first on developing improved seasonal vaccines that generate both humoral protection and drive T cell immunity, an important focus for influenza vaccines in older populations. First, we are studying the design and development of micro consensus antigens based on phylogenetic analyses of past and circulating influenza strains and the study of their immune potency. Second, we are generating in vivo assembled nanoparticulate vaccines through protein engineering to scaffold multiple copies of hemagglutinin antigens. These technologies are designed for use with an enhanced SynDNA/electroporation delivery technology for direct in vivo production of the final vaccines. The goal is to facilitate their potential translation into clinical evaluations. [David Masopust](https://www.immunology.umn.edu/bio/center-for-immunology/david-masopust) & [Ryan A. Langlois](https://med.umn.edu/bio/microbiology/ryan-langlois) Clinical data, recapitulated in animal models, demonstrate that CD8 T cells are highly cross-reactive between different influenza strains and contribute to heterosubtypic immunity. Vaccine-elicited influenza-specific CD8 T cell responses will be evaluated, with an emphasis on the establishment of mucosal and resident memory that provide the best protection. Moreover, mechanisms and biomarkers will be assessed for the induction of long-lived memory T cells that maintain respiratory immunity via recirculation through the lung or residence in lung draining lymph nodes. [Rafi Ahmed](http://vaccines.emory.edu/faculty-evc/primary-faculty/ahmed_rafi.html) Dr. Ahmed is co-PI of the CIVIC program, Director of the Emory Vaccine Center, and Professor at Emory's Department of Microbiology and Immunology. He is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine. Dr. Ahmed is an eminent immunologist and has published seminal work on T- and B-cell biology. A main focus of the CIVIC studies undertaken by his group will be to use nonhuman primate (NHP) studies to determine which candidate universal influenza virus vaccines induce long term memory, and to understand the factors controlling the establishment and persistence of long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow after vaccination. An additional important goal will be to assess the persistence of resident memory T cell populations in respiratory tissues in these animals. The NHP model is the most reliable animal model for determining which candidate vaccines and which adjuvants are most likely to generate long term immunity in humans. In complementary studies the Ahmed group will also evaluate the persistence of influenza-specific B cell lineages in humans enrolled in clinical trials of vaccine candidates using a proteomics-based approach to identify the antibody lineages which persist in the serum one year after vaccination. Another focus of the Ahmed group will be to use murine models to evaluate influenza-specific CD8 T cell responses to the various DNA and RNA influenza vaccine formulations. Harnessing the immune system early after infection to limit productive viral replication and cell-to-cell spread would decrease morbidity and mortality and also reduce transmission. CD8 T cells have a defined role in heterosubtypic immunity which to date have not been optimally leveraged in influenza vaccines. Unlike neutralizing Abs, which primarily recognize conformational epitopes on the viral surface, CD8 T cell memory is highly cross-reactive between different influenza virus subtypes. A vaccine induced CD8 T cell response targeting conserved antigens, from both influenza A and B viruses, could contribute to universal protection against influenza.
