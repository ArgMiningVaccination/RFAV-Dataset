Absolute Health is a comprehensive medical center that offers health care and rehabilitation services based on integrative medicine principles and combining innovative treatments from a variety of medical sciences. We focus on preventing disease and promoting holistic healthcare by balancing hormones, vitamins, and minerals, restoring and treating chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, aortic stenosis, and degenerative problems such as dementia, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, osteoarthritis, spinal degeneration, and more. In contrast to hospital treatments, which are primarily symptomatic, our team of medical experts promotes long-term wellbeing and treatment from the root cause. It is highly recommended that one sees our doctors before opting for a treatment. Patients or relatives can bring their medical records and history of illness into consultation. This is because doctors need to have a physical examination and have sufficient patient information to plan and finalize their treatment. Together with the physician's assistant, they will calculate the overall cost of the treatment package. At this stage, the patient consultant can make an informed decision before starting treatment. The initial consultation cost is 1,000 baht. An Energy Feedback Scan is an analysis of all of the body's systems with the help of energy waves. It assesses the body's different functions and the deteriorating state of each organ, including the integrity of hormones, vitamins, nutrients, inflammation, and levels of toxic residues in the body. This allows the treating doctors to know which systems in the body are weak or abnormal, as well as analyze the risks or trends of possible future disease. From the results, treating physicians can focus on adjusting behaviors that affect the risk of developing diseases as well as enhance the effectiveness of preemptive or prophylactic treatments. It is suitable for those who have already experienced abnormalities in their bodies but have not yet been able to determine the root cause and take immediate action. It is also ideal for those who do not have any illnesses. It can be used as a guideline for preventive healthcare to avoid any future illness. This diagnostic method is convenient, and patients can undergo testing without the need to fast. During the examination, patients are required to put on head, wrist, and ankle straps and lie comfortably on the bed while the medical specialist carries out the painless procedure. Our doctor will then discuss the results thoroughly during the consultation and, together with the patient, decide if a more in-depth diagnosis is needed. An MRI scan is a medical tool that creates electromagnetic imaging of the organs and other structures within the body. It is used as a diagnostic tool, which can help practitioners create treatment plans and follow-up treatment management for patients. MRI will not be able to detect abnormalities in all organs in the body, but will examine one organ system according to the doctor's opinion, such as the brain. Once selected, it will only show the images of brain tissue. However, no other organs will be tested if not ordered by the physicians. The Biofeedback Scan is an analysis of all systems with energy waves to detect the energy of cells in the body plus abnormalities in organs. It uses in-depth electrical signal response of cells in the body to indicate degeneration and the likelihood of diseases that may occur in the future. This allows both patients themselves and their managing physicians to take steps before the disease occurs. Bio Feedback Scans can accurately assess energy balance and send the necessary information for the body to adjust to balance and find the root cause of the disease. Colon Detox has two systems: - The closed intestinal cleansing systemwas developed in Germany in accordance with international standards. A nurse controls the water pressure and quantity to ensure safety. With this method, the water can reach the cecum. It cleanses the entire colon system without peristaltic waves. During the colon detoxification procedure, the nurse will massage the abdomen. This method cleanses the colon better than the open system. But due to the presence of the nurse, this procedure is more for patients who require assistance or someone who is not troubled by privacy. This procedure takes a total of 45 minutes. Branches serving Colon Detox closed systems are: - Bangkok Branch Tel. 02-651-5988, 092-646-4464 - Chiang Mai Branch Tel. 053 - 223 - 023, 095 - 626 - 4522 - The open intestinalpurification system uses controlled water pressure. The colon is cleansed with 25 liters of water mixed with herbal powder or coffee powder. - First, the colon is cleansed with herbal or mineral water. - Second, the colon is cleansed again with water mixed with coffee powder. After 10 cycles, the colon is cleansed with herbal or mineral water to rinse away any coffee stains. The water pressure is controlled by the lever movement and the height of the water container. The water can reach the descending colon but not reach the cecum, where food wastes remain. The patient can control the lever by him/herself without the assistance of a nurse, therefore making the session more private. This procedure is done without the presence of a nurse and takes approximately 45-60 minutes to complete. The branches that serve Colon Detox open systems are: - Absolute Health, Pattaya Branch Call 038-423-213, 081-755 Absolute Health, Absolute Health, Branch - Absolute Health, Korat Branch Tel. 044-756-489, 093-651-5164 Ozone Therapy is the use of medical ozone to treat infectious diseases, which has been researched and used for over 150 years. The results have been proven to be effective and safe with few side effects. Which is why Absolute Health Integrative Medical Center uses ozone to treat patients with diseases such as: - Diseases from infections caused by bacteria and viruses such as flu, intestinal infections or other form of infections in the boy system. - Autoimmune diseases such as allergies, this treatment helps reduce inflammation, stimulate the autoimmune system and help balance immunity. - Circulatory diseases, such as angina, Ozone stimulates red blood cells to have more energy. It helps feed oxygen into tissues better. Ozone therapy can also be use in multi-prong treatment models. It can also be used to treat the whole body and also specific locations to reduce inflammation. For example, the treatment can target the joints of the body, such as shoulder joints, as well as skin infections and diabetic wounds that is normally hard to heal. Hematogenous Oxidation Therapy, or H.O.T, is one of the Ozone Therapy treatments that stimulates the body.\" Oxidation stimulates the activity of leukocytes, red blood cells and platelets causing higher oxygen in tissues. This treatment reduces the risk of inflammation in the body caused by oxidative stress which can result in a narrowing of the blood vessels and pose a risk of cardiovascular disease. Oxidation Therapy can be extremely useful in people with chronic infectious diseases such as hepatitis arthritis, Coxsackie Virus, Herpes, Influenza, tuberculosis, pneumonia. It helps with capillary blood flow, helps to reduce inflammation, has an anti-infection effect, improves the immune system, and acts as a form of cellular detox. We can detect toxins in the body by a blood test called Toxic Metals Profile in Blood . This diagnostic program detects nine types of heavy metal toxins in the body: - Cr - Chrome - Co - Cobalt - Mn - Manganese - Ni - Nickel - Hg - Mercury - Pb - Lead - Cd - Cadmium - As - Arsenic - Al - Aluminum The above blood test that requires fasting and results will be processed within 7-10 days. Toxins in the body can result in chronic inflammation and cellular degeneration in different systems of the body. This can cause chronic diseases to occur. Treating physicians' first call of duty is to get rid of the toxins by a treatment called Chelation Therapy. It is a special mixture that assist the body to absorb the toxins and the toxins will be excreted through urinary of chelation agents are; EDTA, DMSA, or DMPS. They have the ability to reduce the residue of heavy metal toxins in the body. In addition, we at Absolute have a special matrix mix of vitamins and minerals as part of the treatment. This will help restore health, balance the body. 3 recommended Chelation treatment route: - Intravenous saline form - suppository - oral The choice of route and the chelation cycles will be determined by the treating physician which is according to patient's medical history, laboratory tests results and the level and type of toxins determined during the test. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or NAD in short is a coenzyme found in the body that is fundamental to metabolism. NAD+ however contains not just NAD but also vitamin B3 which assists our body to produce energy. When a person consumes food, whether starch, sugar, glucose, fat, or protein, our body then converts them to energy. The process of producing energy requires the assistance of NAD+. As we grow older, NAD+ slowly decreases. Therefore, adding NAD+ can restore and enhance more than 500 body cell functions. Benefits of NAD+ - Helps slow down cell aging, anti-aging, prolong life. - Helps restore nervous system function and muscle strength. - Fights fatigue and increase energy levels. - Corrects metabolic defects that affect diseases such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease. - Reduces risk of vascular and neurodegenerative diseases At Absolute Health, our NAD+ treatment is highly customized by the treating doctor. The treatment route is intravenous just like saline and takes approximately 2-3 hours. Pain Management is a treatment for pain using physiotherapy tools in combination with matrix injections at specific points on the body. This treatment can help alleviate both acute and chronic pain. Examples of chronic pain are such as back pain, knee pain, office syndrome, bone marrow compression, bruising, orthopedic cushions, nerve pressure pain, and more. Example of acute pain includes, muscular pain, tendinitis, tendonitis, injuries caused by accidents, injuries from exercise or other causes. Some of the treatment tools used are as follows: - Magnetic stimulation machine helps to reduce pain among people with nerve problems. It stimulates the nerves to reduce and extremely helpful for those with pain in the arms and legs, those experiencing office syndrome, neck pain, shoulder, back pain and more. - Shockwave therapy reduces chronic pain, improves mobility and stimulates repair of chronic injured tissues such as bruising and muscle tension. - High Power Laser Therapy helps treat pain and inflammation in acute stages, such as sports or accident injuries. Each treatment takes approximately 30 minutes, with the physiotherapist assessing the symptoms of the treatment. In some cases, depending on the patient's condition, all 3 machines may be used during the therapy sessions for optimal results. Prolotherapy is a form of low risk, non-surgical and non-steroidal treatment for degenerative bones, joints and ligaments. It is an injection of hypertonic dextrose solution at the affected areas, such as knee joints, cervical spine and spinal cord. Prolotherapy Prolotherapy induces mild inflammation to initially activate the self-healing process. After the triggered inflammation, the process of tissues repair will gradually start until the wound becomes healed or when the joint comes back to normal. The mechanism of action is different from an anti-inflammatory injection or when taking a pain relieve medication which only treats the symptoms. They do not actually address the root cause of the problem. Prolotherapy is suitable for patients with mild pain in bones, joints or ligaments: - Injured athletes - Patients with degenerative knee joint - Patients with herniated disc - Patients with degenerative cervical spine - Patients with tennis elbow - Patients with ankle pain or chronic Achilles' tendinitis - Patients who do not want long term medication intake or surgical solutions Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) is a medical procedure found to significantly enhance the healing process. PRP is the platelet mixture extracted from the patient's own blood and reinjected into the targeted area. The platelets release growth factor to draw cells, including stem cells, to repair degenerative or injured tissues at the targeted area. Growth factor is produced by the patient's own body, and therefore, causes no harm, side effects or allergy. PRP injection can be used to treat shoulder pain caused by rotator cuff tears, for Achilles tendon ruptures and for other soft-tissue injuries. This treatment method has also been demonstrated to improve function and reduce pain in people who have tendonitis or chronic tendinosis conditions such as tennis elbow or golfer's elbow. Benefits of PRP Some of the key advantages of PRP injections are that they can reduce the need for anti-inflammatories or stronger medications like opioids. Other advantages are as follows: - To repair the degenerative or injured bones, joints, or ligaments. - To rejuvenate the degenerative skin. PRP revitalizes the facial skin. Wrinkles, marks and acne scars are reduced. Pores are tightened and skin becomes firm and youthful. Tissue-healing starts from platelets - When skin is opened, the platelets start the self-healing process to stop bleeding. - Secondly, platelets release growth factor to draw cells and stem cells to repair the targeted area, creating new capillaries, collagen and skin tissues. - Thirdly, new tissues are further created until the repair is completed in the fourth step. Absolute Health NEW 4X PRP is an increase in strength of the Platelet Special Factors concentration by 4 times. This treatment is highly effective in repairing the bones and joints. Other benefits are as follow: - Improves the efficiency in reducing pain. - Helps prevent the body from deterioration. - Assist in rehabilitation from accidents or sports injuries. - Repair injury to the bones, tendons and joints. Zero Cancer Screening Test is an in-depth screening test for cancer. This test is painless, safe and most importantly non-invasive. Commonly, during annual health check-ups, cancer screening is done typically through a blood test. At times, it is also done in conjunction with the ultrasound or x-ray examination. In many cases, abnormalities are found only after the cancer is in the progressive stages. However, the Zero Cancer Screening Test (RV Test) is different from the general test. It is a technique that can detect the risk of cancer from the pre-disease stage. The Zero Cancer Screening Test has the ability to deeply examine the mechanisms of the metabolic system of cancer cells in combination with the body's immunity that is specific to cancer. By using only 3ml of blood sample, the test can trace and monitor the changes in the amount of two proteins within the macrophage white blood cells TKTL1 and Apo10, which are important indicators of cancer. Zero Cancer Screening Test suitable for? - People with a family history of cancer. - People with a history or behavior that is of high cancer risk, such as: - having a history of infection with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, genital warts, or genital herpes - drink alcohol - smoking - work stress, restless, poor nutrition, have a hasty lifestyle that is lack of care and balanced - in regular contact with toxins, chemicals, radiation - Cancer patients who have undergone treatment and want to monitor condition to prevent possible recurrence. - Elderly people or people with weak immunity. ONDAMED uses pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF) to balance the body. It encourages the body to repair itself, which solves health issues that cause an increase in the energy of the cells. The therapy is painless, non-invasive, and without the use of any medications or chemicals. Above all, the therapy does not cause any side-effects. The principles of operation or mechanism of action of ONDAMED are as follows: Medical research studies have shown that the human body consists of millions of different cells. Each of these cells is transmitted throughout the body with communication capabilities that assist with the control of the body's functions in normality. However, when an illness occurs, there will be abnormalities in the cells. ONDAMED detects these abnormalities and sends out signals that, at the same time, send weak electromagnetic waves. ONDAMED taps into the appropriate frequency at the affected cell area where the abnormality was detected to treat and repair the organs in question. The ONDAMED treatment procedure consists of four main stages: - Scan : To find out where there are energy leaks in our body and rectify the problem. - Program Treatment: Type of programs that suits the patient. There are 174 programs for different purposes such as, programs for irritable hormones, reducing stress, and more. - Microorganism : It is an examination of what kind of pathogens are present in the body. After that, the machine simulates the spectrum of the most harmful pathogens the body will recognize the pathogens and stimulates the body's immune system through the spectrum that the ONDAMED machine simulants sends. - Nutritional Balance : The system examines the nutrients in the body and optimize its efficacy. ONDAMED is a medical instrument that is widely accepted around the world. Research and clinical results have proven that ONDAMED is a useful tool at restoring health and great for those who want good health. The food IgG intolerance test can analyze the body's reaction to 216 types of foods which also cover commonly-consumed foods. The patients do not need to fast before the test. A small sample of blood will be taken for analysis. The results will be divided into 4 allergy level: - Red: Severe allergy. Patients should refrain from foods that are detected as allergens for 3-6 months as a minimum. - Orange: Moderate allergy. Patients should reduce the amount of intake to once a month. - Yellow: Low allergy. Patients should reduce intake of highlighted foods and refrain from them for 3 months as a minimum to avoid any allergic reactions. - Green: No allergy detected and therefore no restrictions are necessary. Who should take the food intolerance test? - Persons who suffer from allergies, autoimmune disease, or SLE - Persons who suffer from leaky gut syndrome which is associated with other diseases - Persons who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), dysfunctional digestive system, dysfunctional excretory system, frequent abdominal bloating or flatulence. Food intolerance test indicates the types of food that causes allergies. Together with your doctor's advice, this will help you make better choices on the types of food you eat and help you avoid unnecessary reactions. This in turn can be a great benefit to your health in the long run. Fibroblasts are cells that make up two types of proteins, collagen and elastin. They are very important for the skin as they have the ability to keep the skin moist, which helps to maintain the strength and flexibility of the skin. Therefore, at the age of 25-30 years old, the fibroblast level will gradually decrease, and will have a poorer ability to create new collagen and elastin, which in the end may cause permanent damage to one's skin. How can fibroblast help skin care? Today, with the help of advanced medical science and technology, we have many other options with regards to helping the skin stimulate the production of collagen. There are also several ways to increase elastin. Fibroblasts are an important factor in the formation of collagen and elastin. The use of fillers in turn, involves injecting filling agents to adjust a person's face shape proportionally at specific points, such as wrinkles under the eyes, cheek grooves, cheekbones, chin ends, and more. However, unlike fibroblast, it only fixes the external appearance but does not amend the root causes, which are collagen and skin elasticity. "}
