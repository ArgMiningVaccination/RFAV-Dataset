But, on the other hand, when a disease is severe or, in advance stage, and when, the surgery remains the only option, then, it is only Allopathic treatment which works and remaining therapies fail. Hence, it is imperative to compare both Allopathy vs Alternate therapy with their merits & demerits. I do not mean to criticize any particular therapeutic system or ask you to leave a particular system of medicines. All scientific systems have their own merits and demerits. Allopathy Vs Alternative Therapy Principles of different therapies: Allopathy: \"contraria contrariis curentur\" the opposite. Homeopathy: \"similia similibus curentur\" Like cures like. A medicine, causing a particular symptom in a normal body, will cure the sick patient, having that particular symptom. Biochemic system of medicine: A deficiency of any of the vital tissue salt causes a dysfunction in the body which give rise to a disease. In simplest terms, biochemistry supplies such deficiencies, in minute quantities, to allow the cells to absorbe the salt and get metabolism to normalcy. Ayurveda: \"Science of Life\". It is a holistic science. Our unique body is comprised of 5 primary elements -Air, Water, Fire, Earth & Space. There are 3 Doshas in our body, namely Vata, Pitta & Kapha and imbalance of these doshas causes diseases. The Vata is dry, cold, light, mobile, clear, rough & subtle. The Pitta Slightly oily, hot, intense, light, fluid, free flowing & foul smelling. Kapha is oily, cold, heavy, stable, viscid, smooth & soft. CURE BY ALLOPATHIC MEDICINES Hippocrates (460bc - 375bc, Greece, Father of modern Medicine) \"Declare the past, Diagnose the present, Foretell the future\" Allopathic doctors strongly rely on medicines, manufactured by pharmaceutical companies. These medicines are based on bio-chemistry and most of them are man-made. Generally, allopathic practitioners tend to deal with the diseases in particular part of the body, affected and its probable agent, may be a Virus or Bacteria. This is a disease based therapy. Here, the high potency dose means having high quantity of medicine. Most of the medicines are prophylaxis type of which normally do not cure the cause of disease from root level, just subsidize effects temporarily. These medicines possesses many side effects and further secondary side effects as well. The latter are most of the times found to rather provoke that disease for which, that particular medicine is prescribed. However, in the event of any disease being in advance stage and/or surgery is needed, then, the only option left is getting Allopathic treatment because at that stage no any alternative therapy works properly. CURE BY HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINES Samuel Hahnemann, Originator of Homeopathy (1796) \"Like cures like & similia similibus curentur\" The Homeopathic doctors focus mainly on symptoms in body and they believe that emotional and psychological stresses cause the body to become more prone to a disease. Here, only smallest one dose of medicine is enough to cure the disease. Rather, high potency dose means having very very low quantity of medicine. A 'Medicine' is derived from the Latin words ars medicina meaning \"the art of healing\". Some homeopaths use so-called \"nosodes\" which are made from diseased or pathological products such as fecal, urinary, and respiratory discharges, blood, and tissue. Conversely, preparations made from \"healthy\" specimens are called \"sarcodes\". Homeopathic medicines are available in form of Ointments, Pills, Mother Tincture & Tablets. The Homeopathic remedies function upon three main principles : 1. Like cures like means that a perfect remedy to a disease would be a \"poison\" that causes the very same symptoms. So basically saying the homeopathic remedy would cause a healthy person suffer the symptoms that an ill person suffers, but at the same time it is able to cure the ill person. 2. Minimal dose the cure is taken in the minimal quantity, so by itself it is not dangerous for the patient but at the same time it neutralizes the causes of the disease. 3. The single remedy there is only one cure for a given set of symptoms. A patient does not have to take numerous drugs for each of the symptoms he has but only one homeopathic remedy to influence and cure the whole set and that is the beauty of Homeopathy. It is important to remember that homeopathies do not \"fight the germs\" but do intensify the immune system to fight the reasons of the disease. Aside from strengthening the immune system, homeopathies strengthen the psychological and psychical condition of a patient, which sometimes can play a vital part in the recovery process. Homeopathic medicines can by prescribed to people of any age including pregnant women and infants. The only minus that makes many people turn away from homeopathy is that it takes a long time to select the correct remedy that will help the organism to cope with the disease, while the majority of people seek for instant relief not thinking about the further complications. There are mainly 2 books for practising homeopathy, namely \"Materia Medica\" that lists the substances used in homeopathy along with detailed indications for their application. The information in a materia medica is compiled from provings and clinical observations and \"Repertory\" that contains extensive lists of symptoms and the remedies that have been found helpful for those symptoms. A repertory is used to determine which remedies may be helpful for the symptoms presented and observed in a particular case. CURE BY BIOCHEMIC MEDICINES Dr. Wilhelm Heinrich Schuessler of Oldenburg, Germany (1837) is the originator of Biochemic system of Medicines. \"SIMPLICITY IS THE MARK OF TRUTH\" Dr. Schussler was a homeopath who propounded the theory that \"disease is caused by the insufficiency of organic salts in the tissues/cells of the body and that the supply of these deficient salt(s) cures diseases\". It is also called Tissue remedies. Dr. Schuessler studied on the ashes of many dead and burnt human bodies and found that every body is composed of twelve (12) inorganic salts. After many years of intensive investigation and experiments, he found out this complete and comprehensive system of medicine for the treatment of all diseases.This system is known as Biochemistry. Bios means life and Biochemistry means chemistry of life. The human body is composed of Water, Organic matter (non-essential parts) and Inorganic elements (essential parts). The organic constituents are sugar , fats and albuminous substances. The inorganic constituents are water and certain minerals, called salts such as Iron, Calcium, Potassium, Sodium & Magnesium etc. These cell salts constitute only 1/12 parts of human body and the remaining 11/12 parts are composed of water and organic matter. The cell salts (inorganic), being although very little in quantity, but, they are real vital elements and active workers in building process of human body cells. Water and organic substances are simply inert matter and are used by the inorganic salts in building up the cells of body. In absence of cell salts, the organic substances are not only inert & useless but, also, sort of hazard to the organism. When there is lack of one or, more essential salts, the abnormal condition is the result which is known as disease. The health and strength can be well maintained so long as the system is properly supplied with these cell salts. The blood carrying inorganic and organic constituents for every tissue and cell, supplies nutrition to every cell of every organ , enabling it to perform individual function. The blood supplies every possible physiological want in human body. The cell proliferation (metamorphosis) is a continuous process by which old cells die out and replaced by the new cells and in doing so, necessary material is abstracted from the blood. This action is disturbed if the blood lacks necessary quantity of essential / inorganic cell salts. If the blood is nourished with the required vital cell salt(s), the rebuilding process of cells is again restored. This is the core theory on which Biochemic therapy is based. The HEALTH may be characterized by normal cell metamorphosis, DISEASE may characterized by the abnormal cell metamorphosis and CURE / THERAPY consist of restoration of equilibrium of molecular motion by providing minimum dose of same inorganic salt, filling the gap in chain of molecules of affected cells. A symptom, in Biochemic system, is merely indicative of deficiency of one or, more cell salts. It is the reason why, in Biochemic treatment, the question whether this or that disease is or is not dependent on existence of Fungai, Germs, Bacilli etc are of no importance because here, the remedies are used according to symptoms. The Biochemistry is a science and not merely experimentation. The main features of Biochemic therapy are simplicity of logic of Biochemic theory, simplicity of preparing the Biochemic medicines & simplicity of administering these medicines. The therapeutic range of these 12 salts is quite sufficient to cover the entire range of diseases that a human body may be subjected to. The Biochemic medicines are pleasant & entirely free from any poisonous or adverse drug effects. It is the most simplified art of healing and no further way is more simplified than this theory. It is a system of treatment in which cure is definite, gentle, permanent and rapid. I am sure that any one who can carefully handle this healing art, will certainly get success beyond expectation and with much ease and rapidity. Biochemic theory in Brief : Our body contains twelve (12) inorganic salts which are essential for normal cell metamorphosis. The deficiency of one or more salts disturbes normal cell function and causes a disease. Symptoms are the guide or signal to identify which salt(s) is(are) lacking and by supplying the deficient salt in a potentized form in correct doses for correct period of time, normal health may be restored. Detail of 12 salts : Each salt has got its own significant role in different potencies. - Calcaria Fluoricum (Calcium Fluoride): It helps in Cracks (skin), in loss of elasticity of Arteries and Veins including dilated blood vessels such as with haemorrhoids, enlarged and varicose veins, Piles, Sluggish blood circulation, Loose teeth etc. The CF is also found in the enamel of teeth and on bone surfaces. It also helps in muscular strain and injured ligaments. It helps to strengthen the blood vessels, bones and teeth. Calcaria Phosphoricum (Calcium Phosphate): It is helpful in anemic stage of young girls, blood coagulation problems, Bone weakness, Rickets, Digestion / Assimilation, Constitutional weakness etc. The CP is one of the main salts of bone cells and is also present in teeth . It helps during teething, puberty, convalescence and in later years. It also aids the prevention of muscular cramps and pain during menstruation. Calcaria Sulphuricum (Calcium Sulphate): Useful for Pimples, sore throat, cold, all conditions arising from impurities in the blood. It is one of the main constituents of connective tissue, mucous membranes and skin. The CS helps in clearing of accumulations of non-functional decaying matter. This material may otherwise lay dormant or slowly decay and damage surrounding tissue. Calcium Sulphate is beneficial for slow wound healing, during the last stage of suppuration, for pimples, boils, carbuncles, ulcers, abscesses, etc. Ferrum Phosphoricum (Phosphate of Iron): Useful for Congestion, inflammatory pain, high temperature, quickened pulse, and lack of RBC. It is regarded as the \"Oxygen Carrier\". The FP is useful for any inflammatory or feverish condition, ailments arising from disturbed blood circulation like heat, pains, redness, throbbing, or quickened pulse. It is beneficial during the first stage of acute diseases, common cold, bronchitis, respiratory infection, acute rheumatism, etc., as the Iron assists in maintaining normal body resistance to disease. Kali Muraticum (Potassium Chloride): Useful for Sore throat, Sluggish conditions, Glandular swelling, White colored tongue, Light colored stools, Coughs, and Colds. The KM helps in temporary relief of minor respiratory disorders, such as wheeziness. It also aids the reduction of mucus congestion curing colds and sinusitis. It is also beneficial for the lymphatic glands and in problems assoociated with thick white or greyish skin discharges, or where there is glandular swelling. It is used in Tonsilitis, Catarrhal infection of the middle ear. Kali Phosphoricum (Potassium Phosphate): Useful for Nervous headaches, skin ailments, sleeplessness, depression, timidity, and tantrums. A constituent of nerve and brain cells, The KP is a useful nerve tonic. This tissue salt is indicated in cases where there is stress and tension and nervous symptoms appear. Particularly valuable for emotional irritability, depression, nervousness, children\u00b4s tantrums. Kali Sulphuricum (Potassium Sulphate): Useful for Intestinal disorders, stomach catarrh, inflammatory conditions, eruptions on skin and scalp with scaling, shifting pains. The KS works in conjuction with FP, known as an oxygen carrier, to have more beneficial effect on respiratory and circulatory functions. It gives relief from dandruff, chicken pox, catarrhal problems associated with yellowish or greenish nasal or, vaginal discharges. Often used towards the end of a cold, when the discharge is profuse and frequent. Sometimes beneficial for shifting acute rheumatic pains. It opens the pores of the skin, brings blood to the surface and promotes perspiration. For this reason it is often beneficial in alternation with Ferrum Phos. for fever, when the temperature rises in the evening. Magnesia Phosphoricum (Magnesium Phosphate): Given in Menstrual neuralgia, sciatica, headaches with darting stabs of pain, muscular twitching. The MP is found in bones, teeth, brain, nerves, blood and muscle cells and useful for treatment of muscular cramps, spasmodic coughs / pains, minor nerve problems, colic pain, palpitations, toothache, neuralgia & general acute pains. Natrum Muraticum (Sodium Chloride): Given for headaches with constipation, heartburn, tooth ache, hay fever, craving for salt and salty foods, weak eyes. The NM also helps to control moisture in the tissues and it is beneficial for temporary relief of cold (runny nose and eye watering symptoms). Natrum Phosphoricum (Sodium Phosphate): Useful for Stiffness and swelling of joints, acidic blood conditions, rheumatism, lumbago, worms, golden-yellow coating at root of tongue. NP helps maintain the alkalinity of the blood, emulsifies fatty acids and keeps uric acid soluble in the blood. It also aids the temporary relief of gastric indigestion, dyspepsia, heartburn, intestinal worms, and mild rheumatic tendencies. Natrum Sulphuricum (Sodium Sulphate): Useful for Influenza, humid asthma, malaria, liver ailments, brownish green coating of the tongue, bitter taste in mouth. NS helps to balance the amount of water in the tissues and if necessary, eliminates excess fluid. It is a Biochemic aid for the liver, spleen and kidneys. It aids the temporary relief of biliousness, liver troubles, digestive upsets and symptoms of influenza. Silicea (Silicon Oxide): It is given in Smelly feet and arm pits, pus formation, abscesses, boils, tonsillitis, brittle nails, stomach pains. A Biochemic Cleanser and elminator, Silicon oxide is part of all connective tissue cells. It promotes the discharge of wastes, thereby initiating the healing process by dispersing potentially harmful accumulates such as with skin eruptions and toxic blood conditions, abscesses, boils, etc. In first stage of any swelling, Ferr Phos. and Kali Mur should be given, but, should these tissue salts fail to check the process, Silicea should be taken to ripen abscess and promote it\u00b4s discharge. Silicea is also beneficial for the normal health and strength of hair and nails. BIOCHEMIC PHOSPHATES (ALL 5 PHOSPHATES): Great combination for supporting those over used nerves. With so much stimulation happening to our senses combined with the lack of down time people take, ends up over taxing our nervous system. This is a great combination for exam time, overtime, or anytime your schedule takes you beyond the limit, especially when mental clearness is important COMBINATION 12: In this special combination all 12 essential cell salts are available in each preparation in accordance with the British and US Pharmacopoeia, and based on Dr Schuessler`s biochemic system of medicine. These are beneficial for helping the balance of mineral salts throughout the body, for general good health. This remedy is great for daily support yet it is important to remember to emphasis using one of the single tissue salts if specific symptoms still arise (i.e cramping, use Mag Phos or Calc Phos to help restore mineral balance and the cramping) This natural form of medicine is about - diagnosing which mineral salt(s) are lacking in the organism - establishing the cause - thereby being able to temporarily supplement the required Mineral Salt in order to stimulate the cell system, increasing the organisms own natural defence mechanisms, assisting in the prevention of illness. Furthermore, it is a natural and inexpensive remedy which can be an excellent complimentary treatment and moreover is compatible with Allopathic medicine. CURE BY AYURVEDIC MEDICINES Acharya Charak (300 BC), Father of Ayurveda \"Charak Samhita\" Ayurveda is one of the world's oldest holistic (whole-body) healing systems. It was developed thousands of years ago in India. It is based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the Mind, Body, and Spirit. The primary focus of Ayurvedic medicine is to promote good health, rather than fight disease. But treatments may be recommended for specific health problems. In the U.S, the Ayurveda is considered as Contemporary Ayurvedic Medicines (CAM). According to Ayurvedic theory, everything in the universe, may be living or not, is connected. Good health is achieved when your mind, body, and spirit are in harmony with the universe. A disruption of this harmony can lead to poor health and sickness. For followers of Ayurveda, anything that affects your physical, spiritual, or emotional well-being can cause you to be out of balance with the universe. Some things that can cause a disruption include: Genetic or Birth defects, injuries, Climatic and seasonal changes, Age & Emotions. Our body is a combination of five components of universe viz: Space, Air, Fire, Water & Earth. These elements combine to form 3 life forces or energies, called Doshas. They control how your body works. The three doshas are Vata dosha (space and air), Pitta dosha (fire and water) & Kapha dosha (water and earth). Everyone inherits a unique mix of the three doshas. One dosha is usually more dominant. Each dosha controls a different body function. It is believed that your chances of getting sick are linked to the balance of these Doshas. Vata Dosha is the most powerful of all three doshas. It controls very basic body functions, such as how cells divide. It also controls Mind, Breathing, Blood, Heart function and abilit to get rid of body waste through intestines. Things that can disrupt this dosha are Eating dry fruits, Eating too soon after a previous meal, Fear, Grief & staying upto late night. If vata dosha is our main life force, we are more likely to develop Anxiety, Asthma, Heart disease, Nervous system related disorders, Rheumatoid arthritis & Skin problems. Pitta Dosha controls Digestion, Ability to breakdown foods (Metabolism) & Certain hormones linked appetite. Things that can disrupt this dosha are Eating sour foods, Eating spicy foods & Fatigue & Spending too much time in the sun. If pitta dosha is our main life force, we are more likely to develop Anger and negative emotions, Crohn's disease, Heart disease, Heart burn a few hours of eating, High Blood pressure & Infections. Kapha Dosha controls Muscle growth, Body strength and stability, Weight & Immune system. Things that can disrupt this dosha are Daytime sleeping, Eating after your stomach is full, Eating or drinking items that have too much salt or water, Eating too many sweet foods & its Greed. If kapha dosha is our main life force, we are more likely to develop Asthma, Cancer, Diabetes, Nausea after eating & "}
