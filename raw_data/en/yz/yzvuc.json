{"title": "The Benefits of Integrative Medicine for Pain Management in Oncology: A Narrative Review of the Current Evidence", "author": "Victoria Carvalho; Shahid B Rangrej; Rajni Rathore", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "The aim of this evidence-based study is to narrate and evaluate the current evidence on recommendations for practicing physicians and other healthcare providers regarding integrative approaches to managing pain in patients with cancer. This review will assess the guideline recommendations and analyze the role of integrative medicine in addressing cancer pain in patients. The literature search highlights relevant studies that will inform evidence-based recommendations for practicing physicians, highlighting their relevance and weaknesses. Acupuncture, massage, and hypnosis have intermediate-strength evidence quality and are moderately recommended for various types of cancer pain. Most of the evidence points to acupuncture being recommended for aromatase inhibitor-related joint pain, hypnosis for procedural pain, and massage for palliative care pain. Other practices with lower-quality evidence include yoga and guided imagery with progressive muscle relaxation, mostly recommended for general cancer pain or musculoskeletal pain. Additionally, music therapy is recommended for procedural or surgical pain. Low-quality or inconclusive evidence was found for other mind-body interventions or natural products. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to provide recommendations for pediatric patients. Further research is required to enhance our understanding of the role of integrative medicine interventions in caring for cancer patients.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-06-30", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
