Most babies don't have any side effects. The most common side effects are at the place where the injection was given. These include: swelling; redness; and a small hard lump. These usually only last a couple of days and you don't need to do anything about them. After vaccination, young children may sometimes become unsettled for a day or two and may develop a fever. Older children may also have a fever, tiredness, muscle aches, headache or loss of appetite for a day or two. This leaflet tells you about the common side effects of vaccinations that might happen in babies and children up to five years of age. Only use this information as a guide. You should always get advice from a doctor, health visitor or nurse if you are worried, or call NHS 111 Wales on 0845 46 47 or 111 if available in your area. You can find leaflets with more information about vaccinations at: 111.wales.nhs.uk/livewell/ vaccinations/Leaflets Vaccination Saves Lives 3 2 Vaccination Saves LivesHow to treat a fever A fever is a body temperature over 38\u00b0C. Fevers are quite common in young children but are usually mild. If your child's face feels hot to the touch and they look red or flushed, they may have a fever. You can check their temperature with a thermometer. As fevers are usually mild, you only need to give your child paracetamol if they seem uncomfortable or unwell. Read the instructions on the bottle very carefully to make sure you are giving the correct dose. Call the doctor immediately if your child has a temperature of 39\u00b0C or above or if they have a fit. If the surgery is closed and you can't contact your doctor, trust your instincts and go to the nearest hospital with an emergency department.Keep your child cool by... making sure they don't have too many layers of clothes or blankets on giving them plenty of cool drinks (if you are breastfeeding, your child may feed more often) Don't put them in the bathDon't sponge them down Don't put a fan on them Remember: never give medicines that contain aspirin to children under 16. Vaccination Saves Lives 4 5 Vaccination Saves LivesNote For very premature babies (born before 32 weeks) or very small babies (weighing less than 3 kg), your GP should prescribe paracetamol according to the baby's weight at the time of their vaccination. You should check with your GP and follow the instructions on the prescription. You should measure the 2.5ml/60mg dose and give it either using a syringe or with a 2.5ml spoon. This advice on the use of paracetamol only applies if your baby has had the MenB vaccine with the other routine vaccines at 2 and 4 months. If your baby has a fever at any other time you should follow the instructions and dose advice on the product packaging and patient leaflet. Fever is much less common when the MenB booster is given at 12 to 13 months, so your baby won't need paracetamol then. However, if your baby does develop a fever or is irritable or unwell, you can give them the correct dose of infant paracetamol if you want to. If you do not have any infant paracetamol liquid at home you should get some in time for your baby's first vaccination. It is available from pharmacies and supermarkets.After vaccination with MenB (meningitis B) Fever can happen after any vaccination, but is very common when the MenB vaccine is given with the other routine vaccines at two and four months. That is why it is recommended that your baby has infant paracetamol to prevent and treat a fever. Your baby should have a total of three doses of infant paracetamol at the time of each of their first two MenB vaccinations. You should space out the doses as follows. Baby's age: 2 and 4 months Paracetamol One 2.5 ml (60 mg) dose to be given just after their vaccinations (see note below)Dose 1 Paracetamol One 2.5 ml (60 mg) dose 4 to 6 hours after dose 2Dose 3 Paracetamol One 2.5 ml (60 mg) dose 4 to 6 hours after dose 1Dose 2 Vaccination Saves Lives 6 Vaccination Saves Lives 7 After vaccination with rotavirus vaccine Babies who have had the rotavirus vaccine can become unsettled (as with most other vaccinations) but some may also develop mild diarrhoea. In very rare cases (about 2 in every 100,000 babies vaccinated), the vaccine can affect the baby's lower gut. They may vomit or develop pain in their tummy, and sometimes they may pass what looks like red jelly in their nappy, usually within seven days of the vaccination. If this happens or you're worried about your child, speak to your GP immediately, call NHS Direct Wales on 0845 46 47 or 111 if available in your area or go to the emergency department of your nearest hospital. After vaccination with MMR vaccine The vaccine contains weakened types of live measles, mumps and rubella viruses. Because the viruses are weakened, people who have had the vaccine cannot catch the diseases from the vaccines or infect other people. The three different viruses in the vaccine act at different times and may produce the following side effects. After 6 to 10 days the measles vaccine starts to work and may cause a fever, a measles-like rash and a loss of appetite. Around 2 to 3 weeks after the injection the mumps vaccine may cause mumps-like symptoms (fever and swollen glands). The rubella vaccine may cause a brief rash and possibly a slightly raised temperature, usually around 12 to 14 days after the injection. Your child may also get a rash up to six weeks later (but this is rare). Vaccination Saves Lives 8 9 Vaccination Saves LivesAfter vaccination with the nasal-spray vaccine The side effects linked with the nasal-spray flu vaccine are almost always mild and short-lived. Some children may get a runny or blocked nose for a few days. Other less common effects include a slight temperature, feeling unwell, loss of appetite and a headache. Very rare allergic reactions Very rarely, an immediate allergic reaction can happen following vaccination. This is called an anaphylactic reaction. It can cause breathing difficulties, rashes and swelling that usually start a few minutes after vaccination and may cause a child to collapse. Information from the UK shows that these reactions happen in less than one in a million routine childhood vaccinations. The staff who give vaccinations are trained to deal with anaphylactic reactions and people generally recover completely with treatment.Checking on vaccine safety Before vaccines are introduced, they have to be licensed by the Medical and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, which assesses their safety and whether they are effective. Once the vaccines have been introduced into the programme, their safety continues to be constantly monitored so that any new side effects are quickly noticed and investigated. If you would like more information on the safety of vaccines, go to www.mhra.gov.uk . Members of the public can report suspected side effects of vaccines and medicines through the Yellow Card scheme. You can do this at yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk or by calling the Yellow Card hotline on 0800 731 6789 (available Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm). If, after having read this leaflet, you are still not happy with your child's reaction to any vaccination, speak to your practice nurse, health visitor or GP.
