Of course, it is not primarily gender that matters, but rather the individual body and mind of a person. There are a few small aspects, however, that only affect the male body and can be influenced by Ayurvedic methods. Ayurveda Resort Sonnhof have kindly summarised \" [Ayurveda for men](https://www.healingholidays.com/retreats/ayurveda-retreats)\" below. What Does Ayurveda Do? In Ayurveda, it is assumed that every person has a certain type of constitution. The three doshas - Kapha, Pitta and Vata - are different in each of us. Regardless, the life of a man should be divided into three energy phases: The youth is characterized by Kapha, in middle age Pitta prevails and in old age is Vata time. Of course, this development does not have to be as linear as it sounds. As a man, however, you can promote your physical and mental health by adapting your lifestyle to your dosha. At this point, it is important to point out once again that the conscious life according to the Ayurvedic teachings is of course no more \"men's business\" than \"women's business\". Stress, worries of everyday life, tension etc .: Among all these factors, both men and women suffer. What Does \"Ayurveda For Men\" Mean? Maybe you wonder now, where is the big difference? Quite simple: First and foremost in a physical aspect, because the male prostate can be positively influenced by Ayurveda. In order for men to stay healthy in all phases of their lives, so that they can balance body and mind, the following points are of great importance: - Movement to a reasonable extent - A diet that focuses on your own dosha - Enough liquid - Enough sleep - Awareness of the health of the prostate The prostate is a pitta organ. Its fiery constitution wants to be soothed, for example through yoga exercises for improved lymphatic flow and nutrition. An Ayurvedic way of life makes an important contribution to the well-being of men by preventing, among other things, prostate problems. These can arise when the metabolism does not work well and the digestive Agni is significantly weakened. So what can a man do to be fully at ease and healthy at any age? Nutrition Even men do well to follow the basic principles of Ayurveda nutrition. Specifically, this means three (warm) meals a day and longer breaks between them without snacks, so that the Agni can be fully active during the main meal times . In addition, a nutritional concept is important, which is adapted to the own dosha and additionally promotes the digestive fire. Of course, it is equally important to make sure you drink enough. Better than cold drinks are those with lukewarm or warm temperature. The range of Ayurveda drinks is great, how about a glass of ginger or rice water, for example? As a man, you can support the Agni digestive fire by avoiding very hot, hot, salty or sour foods. For foods such as grapefruit, garlic, onions, sour cream or buttermilk stimulate Pitta. And the more active the Pitta, the more \"fiery\" the spirit becomes. In other words, you get irritated and stressed. On the other hand, pitta can be calmed with foods such as coconut oil, pumpkin seeds and flaxseed. Personal Hygiene If you regularly take a little time for personal hygiene and thus consciously do something for yourself, it feels better. Caring and relaxing measures are also part of Ayurveda for men. Such a relaxation measure may be, for example, an (oil) massage. Of course, this can be done by a trained expert, but in principle, each of us can easily take care of a short break in between. For this, only a little liquid oil is needed, such as coconut or olive oil. Massage the oil into the temples and scalp with slow, circular movements and under gentle pressure. If the oil is allowed to work overnight, it is especially soothing to the scalp and hair follicles, so that the hair gets important nutrients and can help prevent hair loss which is a problem that plagues many men as they age. Physical and mental health We can only do well if we take care of physical as well as mental health. For example, be sure to give your body enough sleep to regenerate. It's best to develop a routine by getting up early and going to bed before 10pm. Incidentally, it is also very important to put the smartphone away in good time. As far as the movement factor is concerned, it does not necessarily mean that you are outsmarting yourself every day. Because constant overwork means stress for heart and muscles. How about a few minutes of yoga instead? Contrary to common prejudice, this meditation technique is definitely not only a great way for women to consciously take a little break from everyday life. Incidentally, silent meditation and pranayama breathing exercises such as abdominal breathing also have a calming effect. Place the flat hand on the stomach and consciously breathe into this hand. It feels very different from the superficial chest breathing we tend to do otherwise. If you integrate relaxation techniques like these into your daily routine and your diet a bit - or maybe a little more? You will soon realize that you can actively do something against stress and bad feelings. After all, the Ayurvedic way of life is not just a \"medicine\" that you can apply to a particular ailment. Rather, it brings inner balance and health on many levels - whether you're male or female. If this blog has got you interested in finding out more about "}
