And with increased vaccination rates, we're getting a glimpse of the light at the end of the tunnel in regard to COVID-19. World's largest nutrition study and a U.S. counterpart Determining the role of nutrition in health and avoiding disease is exceedingly difficult. The majority of people have diets that vary greatly, and that's before you add in factors such as prior health issues, lifestyle, environmental factors and genetics. The 12-year-old NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 study, the world's largest and longest-running nutritional study, attempts to overcome many of these factors by gathering as much data as possible. Currently collecting data from 171,000 people in France and Belgium, the study set out to investigate the relationship between nutrition, health, lifestyle factors and mortality; and examine the factors that influence dietary patterns. The study and data results have spawned numerous papers over the years regarding the danger of ultra-processed foods, the merits of organic foods, and how COVID-19 has impacted diets. Now a large U.S. counterpart will attempt to study nutrition in an attempt to determine the best diet for an individual's genes and gut microbiome. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) in February announced what will be a five-year, $156 million effort involving 10,000 American subjects to study \"precision nutrition\" with data ranging from blood glucose levels to microbes in a person's gut, according to Science magazine. The study \"has the potential to truly transform the field of nutrition science,\" generating new tools, methods and \"a wealth of data to fuel discovery science for years to come,\" said Griffin Rodgers, director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Study participants will wear various monitors, and some for two-week periods will live at clinical centers eating controlled diets. It is a new focus for the NIH, which had its Office of Nutritional Research restored in January of this year after a demotion under the U.S.'s previous political administration.\"There's so much excitement,\" said nutrition scientist Elizabeth Parks of the University of Missouri of the study that will look to begin accepting volunteers in January 2023. In this issue The gut-brain connection has become all the rage. New televi - sion commercials tout biotics that will improve your mood via gut health, but science is revealing how gut health impacts the entire body. In our feature story we take a look at nutrition and supplements that impact the gut-brain and gut-body connection. Patients with too much \"bad\" bacteria are more likely to develop Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), among other ailments. Gut bacteria is being linked in studies as possibly causing heart disease via cholesterol buildup, in addition to kidney disease, contributing to obesity with mixed messages from the brain, and weakening immunity. What supplements do DCs and DCs who specialize in nutrition take on a daily basis? Take a look inside at our feature article and compare your morning pill regimen to those of fellow experts who counsel their patients on supplementation. Other topics in this issue include helping your patients with COVID-19 deal with disease symptoms and aftereffects, proven diets for patients' health, concrete steps to raising your revenue, opportunities to act as your own media outlet/ PR firm, and more. If you're considering offering additional wellness and supplementation offerings in your practice, consider this issue as your primer.

The study, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, showed that about 3 million used masks can be recycled into material to construct the base layer of one kilometer of two-lane highway. The material is a blend of shredded masks and processed rubble.

Documentation 2021 New TikTok stars Chiropractor Jordan Estrada has become a TikTok star, leveraging the social media app for millions of views to his video posts that remix pop songs while passing on tips for treating back, neck and knee pain, according to Insider.com. The Houston-based DC says, \"I finally found my niche,\" after a lifelong interest in music that included performing in school bands. \"One day it clicked. I was listening to remixes of 'Savage' and thought, why don't I make my own? I could combine my passions to make music and make it informational.\" That video now has more than 16 million views and has inspired other DCs on social media. Brian Meenan is another chiropractor who has become famous on TikTok. Meenan dubbed over a popular tune with his own words while showing viewers how to do a simple stretch for easing back pain. Soon, the number of views started to grow exponentially, even earning him around 12,000 followers in one night. When asked what made that video so appealing to so many people, Meenan shared that \"it was a catchy tune.\" He now has more than 270,000 followers on TikTok. Since the TikTok platform has a high base of younger users, Meenan says many of his new patients who have seen his videos are in this age range. \"The youngest is about 20,\" Meenan says, \"and the oldest is about 32.\" For more social media articles and tips, visit the \"Business Tips\" section of chiroeco.com.Each month we'll ask a new question on our Facebook page.

CUKC achieved \"Gold Level Healthy KC Certified\" status for its continuing efforts to promote health and wellness among students, faculty, staff and administration. The certification was awarded to the University by the KC Workplace Wellness Action Team, a division of the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce. The action team worked with its partner, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City, to review the applications submitted by CUKC and other entities seeking recognition for their good health initiatives. The applications were then reviewed for efforts across the five pillars of health: nutrition, physical activity, tobacco cessation, work- life integration, and design and built environment. Dale Marrant, vice president of human resources and organizational development at CUKC, leads the movement for positive health among employees at the university. \"We are thrilled to have been recognized as one of Kansas City's healthiest workplaces again in 2020,\" Marrant said. \"The hard work of our Wellness C.R.E.W., and the healthy behaviors of CUKC students and employees have helped us more fully realize our vision of being recognized and respected as a leader in health promotion.\" CUKC has been Healthy KC certified every year since 2016. For more information, visit cleveland.edu. Ending a 10-year court battle, started when the Texas Medical Association sued the Texas Board of Chiropractic Examiners in 2011, the Texas Supreme Court has ruled that nerve and related testing as it pertains to the musculoskeletal system is within the lawful scope of practice for Texas chiropractors. The Texas Medical Association's original suit argued that nerve and related testing diagnoses exceeded a chiropractor's licensed scope of practice. \"On behalf of the Texas Board of Chiropractic Examiners, I extend our sincere thanks and appreciation to everyone whose efforts resulted in the Texas Supreme Court's decision,\" wrote Mark R. Bronson, DC, FIANM, and board president for the Texas Board of Chiropractic Examiners. \"The decision properly affirmed the validity of the board's scope of practice rule, which the court clearly said does not exceed our statutory scope of chiropractic practice ... This decision, which recognizes the common sense and long-standing inclusion of associated nerves in chiropractic diagnosis and treatment, preserves and strengthens the essence of chiropractic. Thanks to the court's decision, our licensees can now fulfill their duties as vital portal-of-entry health care providers in Texas without fear.\" To view the Texas Board of Chiropractic Examiners statement, go to tbce.state.tx.us/Documents/Supreme- Court-Decision.pdf. 14 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MARCH 28, 2021 CHIROECO.COM\"AT THE END OF EVERY YEAR, I ALWAYS GET A BLOOD TEST TO SEE WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE OF MY BODY.

The brand's Campus XL Backpack\u00ae were approved following an evaluation by a review board of ACA chiropractors, who acknowledged their smart functionality as well as body-healthy features. \"Chiropractors are often asked to recommend products that support musculoskeletal health, so it's a pleasure to find companies such as Vera Bradley that design their products to promote proper fit and enhance the wearer's comfort,\" said ACA President Robert C. Jones, DC. The independent review included hands-on evaluation of the backpacks over a 30-day period. The backpacks were assessed for their quality, durability, ease of use and comfort. All received high marks for features such as durable, lightweight fabric; padded shoulder straps shaped for optimal comfort; padded back panels; padded laptop compartments; and ample pockets and storage areas to distribute contents evenly. In addition, the Campus Backpack\u00ae features more padding than before and a new shape that is specifically designed to accommodate a woman's body.

For patients, restoring a disrupted gut-brain axis quickly is key to resolving immediate health issues and preventing cognitive impairment. MODULATING THE GUT-BRAIN AXIS WITH SUPPLEMENTS Five top supplements to support gut and brain health BY ROBERT G. SILVERMAN, DC, DACBN, THE GUT-BRAIN AXIS IS THE BIDIRECTIONAL LINK between the central nervous system (CNS) and the enteric nervous system (ENS). Also known as the body's \"second brain,\" the enteric nervous system is the extensive network of 100 million nerve cells that line the full length of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the main role of the ENS is digestion, the messages that travel back and forth between it and the CNS also affect the immune system, cognition and mood. The cross-talk between the brain and the gut is profoundly influenced by the gut microbiome, the vast community of bacteria that colonizes the gastrointestinal tract and is most abundant in the colon. The bacteria produce neurotransmitters and metabolites that influence the gut-brain axis through several complex pathways. CHIROECO.COM MARCH 28, 2021 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 21FEATURE STORY Regulating digestion, cognition, mood The sympathetic and parasympathetic arms of the autonomic nervous system, for example, carry messages along the vagus nerve in both directions. About 80% of the information is along the afferent pathway; because digestion occurs autonomically, far less information needs to travel along the efferent pathway. Information about changes in the gut microbiome is sent to the CNS; signals from the CNS influence the gut's autonomic tions. to produce 95% of the body's serotonin in the gut. Gut serotonin is involved with motility and GI secretions, but it is linked to cognition and regulating mood in the brain. Another good example is gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production by many species of common gut bacteria. GABA is the brain's primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. A diverse that produces serotonin, GABA and other neuroactive metabolites may play an important role in maintaining a stable mood. The unbalanced gut When the gut microbiome is balanced and digestion is proceeding normally, both the ENS and the CNS are balanced as well. When the gut microbiome is unbalanced (dysbiosis), bacte - rial metabolites' normal production is thrown off. The result can be brain fog, memory issues, and mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. In the other direction, stress hormones such as cortisol can cause dysbiosis and intestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome.1 Leaky gut syndrome (increased intestinal permeability) occurs when the small intestine wall is damaged through dysbiosis, poor diet, antibiotics, stress and other factors. The tight junctions between the epithelial cells open too widely and allow large particles of undigested food to slip through and enter the circulation. The result is inflammation that affects the entire body, including the brain. Leaky gut can be a contributing factor to autoimmune disease and neurodegeneration. When the gut is leaky, intestinal bacteria and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from bacterial cell membranes can enter the circulation. LPS is a potent activator of the immune system. It causes systemic inflammation and the release of proinflammatory cytokines that impact the brain by affecting the vagus nerve and passing through the blood-brain barrier. Modulating the axis with lifestyle changes Restoring a disrupted gut-brain axis quickly is key to resolving immediate health issues and preventing longer-term cognitive impairment. Dietary and lifestyle changes to address dysbi - osis and leaky gut syndrome are essential. Patients should be encouraged to modify their diet to remove gluten, dairy, processed foods, and alcohol and to add fiber-rich vegetables and fruits. Also, patients should aim for at least 30-45 minutes of aerobic physical activity daily. These changes are necessary to make a significant improvement in gut-brain function. Supplements that modulate the gut-brain axis by tightening loose intestinal junctions, reducing systemic and brain inflammation, and speeding gut-healing should be recommended in conjunction with dietary and lifestyle changes. The supplements complement the changes and speed healing. They can help relieve gut symptoms such as bloating, gas and diarrhea and help with brain symptoms such as memory problems and fogginess. The combined effects can help patients feel better faster and encourage them to comply with dietary changes and lifestyle improvements. What affects the gut affects the brain and vice versa. Bearing this in mind at all times is important when choosing supplements for patients with gut-brain issues. The supplements discussed below all have positive effects on both ends of the axis. Five supplements to support the gut A plethora of supplements relieves gut symptoms and supports gut healing. In my experience, these five supplements are helpful for almost all patients and are the basic starting point for treating gut issues. They have all been shown to improve gut function while also having a positive effect on the brain:Restoring a disrupted gut-brain axis quickly is key to resolving immediate health issues and preventing longer-term cognitive impairment.

Prebiotic fiber is found in plant foods high in inulin and fructans, including artichokes, asparagus, chicory, beans, onions, leeks, apple skins and barley. Patients should be encouraged to add servings of prebiotic foods to their daily diet. However, during dysbiosis treatment, patients may need more prebiotic fiber than they can comfortably eat, and some patients will never add enough prebiotic foods to their diet to make a difference in their gut health. Prebiotic supplements containing fructooligosaccharides (FOS) or xylooligosaccharides (XOS) are a good alternative. XOS supplements are particularly valuable because they are highly effective in small doses. Probiotics \u2014 When the gut microbiome is healthy, harmful bacteria are massively outnumbered by beneficial bacteria. In dysbiosis, harmful bacteria are present at much higher levels. Fermented foods that contain live bacteria, such as kefir, sauerkraut and kimchi, can be helpful, and patients should be encouraged to eat them. However, the portions needed to have a positive effect are large, and most patients won't be willing or able to eat enough. Recolonizing the colon through foods alone is also slow and unpredictable. To restore a good balance of beneficial bacteria, probiotic supplements are a good approach. These supplements contain billions of colony-forming units per capsule. Different probiotic products vary in the species and strains they contain. In general, a high-quality probiotic product contains strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, along with Bacillus subtilis in spore form and a range of other bacterial species. Glutamine \u2014 Well-known as a critical nutrient that fuels the gut's epithelial cells, glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body. It's key for maintaining the gut mucosal lining integrity and keeping bacteria from escaping out of the gut. When the gut barrier is disrupted and leaky, glutamine is very helpful for healing the damage. Glutamine supplements are a tasteless powder that can easily be mixed with clear liquids such as water or juice or stirred into foods. Collagen \u2014 Collagen is vital for rebuilding the intestinal lining. It contains the amino acids glycine, glutamine and proline, all of which are beneficial for the stomach lining and the intestinal tract. Bone broth is an excellent dietary source of collagen.2 Supplements containing Type I, II and III collagen (the collagen in your gut is 90% Type I) are easy to take and are readily absorbed. As a bonus, the collagen's properties will also improve the appearance of hair, skin and nails. Zinc carnosine \u2014 The secret ingredient for rebuilding a damaged gut lining is zinc carnosine. In this supplement, zinc (well-known for its wound-healing properties) is chelated with L-carnosine, a peptide combining the amino acids beta-alanine and histidine. The combination has powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant qualities. Zinc carnosine is very valuable for restoring the integrity of the gut tight junctions, lessening exercise-induced gut permeability, and restoring the gut mucosal lining's protective properties. In addition, zinc carnosine has been shown to improve taste disorders \u2014 a growing issue for post-COVID-19 patients.3 Five supplements to support the brain Omega-3 fatty acids \u2014 Fish oil, the most used dietary supple - ment for omega-3 fatty acids, is a key supplement for maintaining both brain health and gut health. Omega-3 fatty acids are required for the production of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which supports the survival of existing neurons and encourages the growth of new neurons and synapses. High levels of DHA, a component of fish oil, inhibit neuronal cell death and are an important neuroprotective agent.4 Omega-3 fatty acids can inhibit inflammation and conditions that can cause major depressive disorder, anxiety and autism spectrum disorder.

Conditions such as major depressive disorder, anxiety, and autism spectrum disorder are often associated with systemic inflammation, gut permeability and dysbiosis. Restoring a better balance in the gut microbiome and reducing gut-associated inflammation can help improve symptoms.5 Pro-resolving mediators \u2014 Lingering inflammation from leaky gut syndrome or dysbiosis can continue to affect brain function even after the primary cause has been treated. In the central nervous system, inflammation can allow neutrophils and cytokines to infiltrate through the blood-brain barrier. Supplements of pro-resolving mediators (PRMs) can shift the body from an inflammation-driving to inflammation-resolving condition by repairing the blood-brain barrier. The pro-resolution mechanisms that balance the normal inflammatory response to prevent excess inflammation and bystander tissue damage can sometimes be inadequate. PRMs can help resolve the inflammation and help reduce brain fog and memory problems. PRMs provide the final boost many patients need to overcome inflammation affecting the gut-brain axis.6 Magnesium L-threonate \u2014 Magnesium is vital for the brain as an essential cofactor to make many of the enzymes involved in brain functions. It's also crucial for maintaining and growing connections among synapses, tasks that are central to learning and memory. High levels of magnesium in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid are related to a lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease and brain aging. The supplement magnesium L-threonate passes through the blood-brain barrier more effectively than other magnesium forms and doesn't cause digestive upsets.7 Vitamin D3 with vitamin K2 \u2014 High serum levels of vitamin D are extremely important for maintaining brain health and reducing the risk of cognitive impairment from Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Vitamin D is also significant for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Conversely, low vitamin D can lead to increased calcium in the brain, which is linked to depression and can cause an increase in the amyloid plaques that characterize dementia. Vitamin D works synergistically with vitamin K to regulate calcium and keep it from accumulating in the soft tissues, such as the blood vessels that nourish the brain. Supplements should include vitamin D in the form of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), the most absorbable form, and vitamin K in the form of menaquinone (vitamin K2). This combination is most effective for preventing the calcification of blood vessels.8 Curcumin \u2014 The active compound in turmeric root, curcumin, is what gives curry powder its vivid yellow color. Curcumin activates the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway, turning on genes involved in detoxifying and eliminating free radicals. In the brain, curcumin supplements have powerful anti- inflammatory and antioxidant qualities. Curcumin also helps prevent dementia by inhibiting the formation of amyloid proteins. Perhaps most importantly, curcumin supplementation can significantly increase serum levels of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor). BDNF plays an important role in protecting existing neurons and stimulating the growth of new neurons. High levels can help prevent cognitive impairment and aid in recovery from concussion and brain injury.9 Optimal bidirectional communication on the gut-brain axis is the superhighway to health for everyone.

Panelists noted that health care \"has been quite sterile\" while \"wellness has become the cool kid on the block,\" but that the future would be a convergence of the two. They argued that, \"new integrations will give health care the pleasurable, aspirational qualities of wellness while wellness will increasingly get the science-backed credibility of the medical industry \u2014 and the players and brands that execute on this (and it's already happening) will 'win big.'\" Strengthening the immune system Strengthening the immune system has already become a well - ness trend, \"across the board, from food, to supplements, to educational classes. We will see more customized immunity hacks, using genetic testing and biohacking ... to pinpoint what immune therapies best suit your system and situation.\" Personalized medicine will include a \"much bigger focus on gut health and our microbiome as it pertains to immunity and brain function.\" Health care providers will target patients' \"immunity gaps\" to shore up their immunity defenses, according to the Global Wellness Summit's wellness trends report. Early in the pandemic last year, sales of immunity products grew more than 200%, with vitamin sales increasing 77%.4 With this insight, DCs are seeing an opportunity to provide patients with the supplements they are already buying elsewhere, and to jump on the shifting trend within the nutritional supplement sector as patients look with a new urgency at getting and staying healthy.

I AM CURRENTLY 62 YEARS OLD AND DO NOT NEED TO TAKE ANY MEDICATIONS. I start with mostly healthy unprocessed foods, although I still play around with the best times for me to eat (including intermittent fasting) and when to take certain supplements. I exercise daily and include some cardio, strength and flexibility. I experiment while exercising with blood flow restriction devices about 3-5 days a week and which supple - ments I take before and after exercise. I give myself some meditation or writing time each day, and I maintain a healthy dose of \"social/relationship\" nutrition. Realizing what you're up against The short answer to my supplement choices is that I like experi - menting on myself (biohacking). The other answer is my purpose: I make supplement choices to help my body remove toxins, keep my inherent nature toward inflammation under control, and to maintain and enhance my brain cells responsible for processing and cognition. My dad had a heart bypass surgery when he was in his 50s but passed away at 94 with Alzheimer's disease (AD). My mom was bipolar with dementia when she passed at 92. Therefore, I'm concerned about overall mental health. Given those genetics, I figure my floor for dying is 92-95 with hopes of living beyond that. I am also inspired to do everything I can for energy optimization, mitochondrial health and blood vessel health, gut optimization, sleep optimization, and hormone optimization. Overall, I think about longevity and my health span. I monitor things like my microbiome with stool testing, I have regular blood work done, I do saliva nitric oxide test strips, and I use my bioimpedance analysis machine regularly. For the fun of it I'm currently wearing a continuous glucose monitoring (a month's worth should do it) device tacked onto my arm with instant readouts on my smartphone app, and I always wear a finger ring that tracks sleep, activity and physiological body signals. Supplements for blood flow and blood vessel health I know I walk the talk about promoting a healthy life span, keeping my fat weight and lean mass in check, striving for good bone health, reducing risks for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, AD and cancer.I have a variety of mixtures of powered protein shakes after my workout in the morning that include multiple vitamin and mineral support. I am most interested in brands that include vitamin D, zinc, iron, magnesium, vitamin A, calcium, magnesium, potassium, B complex and K. In my shake I throw in probiotics, collagen, and a blend of red spinach, beet roots and other berry extracts. These veggies are helpful for nitric oxide production and I am huge on blood flow and blood vessel health. I need to supplement with extra vitamin D because I want my levels around 60. I take extra bone health supplements (five days a week), extra garlic extracts for cardiovascular health (3-5 times a week), omega 3s (daily), and peptides (TB4-Frag and BPC 157) for immune enhancement, inflammation and cognition (five days a week). I tried wheat germ extract for a few months and did not feel a change. I take hemp oil about five days a week, and turmeric (high dose) daily. I've recently experimented with Bergamot extract to see the influence on my blood sugar. It's too early to tell. I believe you have to try something for 3-4 months before really evaluating it. I try different herb combinations for healthy testosterone support and libido. When I get into a mood where I want to increase lean muscle gains I take mTOR elevators such as phosphatidic acid with L-leucine and astragalus for a month and then cycle off. It works! As part of my personal and ongoing COVID-19 prevention plan I experiment with butylated hydroxytaluene (BHT), N-acetyl cysteine, and Acetyl-L-carnitine. The peptides also enhance this goal. I am also a firm believer in two closely-related health topics. One is hydration and the other is what you put on your hair and skin. I use hemp-derived topicals on most days. Please remember there is no one-size-fits-all for nutrition. The ideal recommendations will get more and more personalized sooner than later as off-the-shelf testing is becoming easily available.

THE TAKEAWAY COVID-19 \"long hauler\" patients may experience persistent and life-limiting symptoms that affect several bodily systems. Because these symptoms present differently for everyone, the best regimen for relief is one that takes an individualized and multi-specialty coordination of approaches. CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE only takes COVID-19 \"long haulers\" so far. I've consulted numerous long haulers, and uncon - ventional therapies are not only a reasonable option, but a necessity. Especially with long-term symptoms like aches and pains, exhaustion, shortness of breath, lack of energy and fatigue, neck pain, shoulder pain, joint swelling and pain, chest pain, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, headache, loss of smell, poor sleep quality and cognition challenges. Long COVID patients Post-acute COVID-19 or \"long COVID patients\" are defined as those with the presence of symptoms extending beyond three weeks from the initial onset of symptoms. Long-Haul Syndrome is reserved for chronic COVID-19 symptoms extending beyond 12 weeks.1 The top symptoms post-acute COVID-19 patients consult me for have been musculoskeletal aches and pains, headaches, fatigue and shortness of breath. Viremia related to COVID-19 causes microvascular thrombotic processes that can cause cellular and multiple organ system dysfunction \u2014 therefore treatment will require a multi-specialty coordination of approaches. The residual symptoms seem to be a consequence of direct tissue invasion. Discovering impacted systems A good history and symptoms list can give the practitioner a sense of the system(s) affected. The three key systems that seem to be affected are the cardiovascular, pulmonary and neurologic systems. For example, myocardial injury, thromboembolic disease, myocardial inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac translate into \"weakness,\" \"I look pale\" or exertion 38 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MARCH 28, 2021 CHIROECO.COMWORLDS SAFEST LOW LEVEL LASERS.

Direct invasion of the olfactory nerve leads to anosmia (loss of smell). To date, the most common long-term neurologic symptoms after COVID-19 are headache, vertigo and chemosensory dysfunction \u2014 anosmia and loss of taste (ageusia).6,7,8,9 Because loss of smell is one of the early symptoms in the majority of acute-stage COVID-19 cases, in my office I'm testing every patient for smell using essential oils along with forehead temperatures. Symptoms spike dramatically in the days after overdoing an activity \u2014 physical, cognitive or social efforts. When they say they are \"tired,\" it's not like being tired. It's like you've been drugged. I get the sense they feel OK one minute and then 10 minutes later, they feel run over by a bus. I am used to the \"good day, bad day feeling\" patient, but this is a whole new level of that. Even people who never experienced symptoms of COVID-19 are expressing symptoms related to chronic stress and feelings of isolation and loneliness.3,10 Compromised blood vessels COVID-19 creates a direct viral attack on the vessels, joints or nerves. The virus has been detected in every cell type and tissue in the body. It involves multiple organs besides the vascular system, respiratory system, and the central and peripheral nervous system. This is the way I explain post-COVID-19 symptoms: Your blood vessels have been compromised. It may stem from a few possible sources:Hypoxia \u2014 You have a lack of oxygen to the tissues due to respiratory problems during the infection. Hypoxia is an insufficient amount of oxygen reaching the tissues. Mitochondria need oxygen to create ATP. ATP is the energy required for cells to carry out their specific functions: nerve impulses, tissue repair, muscle contraction, the synthesis of biochemical agents within cells, and more \u2014 all these actions require ATP. Any movement or metabolic process needs ATP. A constant supply is needed to maintain cellular processes for life. Lack of motion \u2014 Being bed-bound for days or weeks and lack of motion can cause low blood supply; blood is stagnant and not reaching the tissues because it is unable to flow to them (the extreme is blockage, i.e. stroke). A lack of blood means a lack of oxygen to the tissues. A lack of oxygen to the tissues is very painful. The virus may have created damaged cells that caused low blood oxygen (blood isn't saturated with oxygen) from defective hemoglobin. Your tissues have had a lack of oxygen to intake. See how we are back to hypoxia. Blood clots \u2014 You may feel muscle aches and pain or fatigue (list their symptoms) from COVID-19. If people have a bunch of small clots in the lungs, that can continue to fatigue for a long period of time \u2014 even after the clots are gone \u2014 if there's damage to the blood vessels. Targeted personalized treatment for long haulers There is no \"one remedy\" for all of these symptoms. I am helping patients manage the condition while they are learning to pace themselves. My key messages for long haulers battling fatigue are to prioritize rest and relaxation, avoid pushing yourself, learn to balance activity and breaks, and improve sleep. Other areas to work on include: High-fat whole foods, a plant-rich diet (ketogenic, intermittent fasting); avoid foods that intensify the inflammatory stress response (most allergic foods are dairy and gluten) in the lungs and musculoskeletal system Exercise (graded) Sleep optimization Stress reduction (meditation, etc.) Thought lifting Nutrient optimization (omega-3, vitamin D, methylation, B's, etc.) The top symptoms post-acute COVID-19 patients consult me for have been musculoskeletal aches and pains, headaches, fatigue and shortness of breath. 12 WEEKS MINIMUM TIME SPAN OF COVID-19 SYMPTOMS FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING 'LONG-HAUL SYNDROME' 40 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MARCH 28, 2021 CHIROECO.COMSupport Healthy Aging and Cellular Energy Generation with Patented Ingredient* Annatto-GG 150 is a unique product that provides 150 mg of geranylgeraniol (GG) per softgel, a compound that plays critical roles in numerous biological processes affecting organs and tissues throughout the body.

My favorite immune/lymphatic flow system exercise is the body-weight swing \u2014 and every patient needs this. Don't forget the lymphatic system As part of the body's natural immune function, we can all appreciate the healing benefits of the lymphatic system. The lymph system, which is the body's second circulatory system, consists of a connected network of tissues and organs that helps to deliver nutrients and filter out water, bacteria, waste products and other debris of cell metabolism. Unfortunately, unlike your veins, the lymph system is not a closed system and has no central pump, like your heart, to support its cleansing. So, for many years I have been utilizing a negative pressure device that helps with lymph flow and drainage while also providing patients with a nice massage-like experience \u2014 it's a very relaxing treatment. Negative pressure therapy is also extremely beneficial for those who have swelling in the body from sports injuries, damaged or blocked vessels in the lymph system following surgery, fibromyalgia, arthritis, congestion, and post-cancer treatment.

HYPOXIA A LACK OF OXYGEN TO THE TISSUES DUE TO RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS DURING INFECTION 44 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MARCH 28, 2021 CHIROECO.COMFULL_Protocols_FNL.pdf 1 2021-02-18 3:31 Cutting-edge tech enhances bioavailability to target pain, stress, anxiety, immunity BY CHRIS D. MELETIS, ND TIME TO READ: 11-13 MIN. THE TAKEAWAY SEDDS, or a self-emulsifying drug delivery system, is producing more than 4X normal CBD absorption by spontaneously emulsifying under conditions such as those encountered in the gastrointestinal tract. THERE ARE MANY REASONS TO EMPLOY CBD OIL IN CLINICAL PRACTICE , as it has been found to be beneficial for a diverse array of conditions. Yet, CBD is not always well-absorbed and used by the body. That's why one of the most interesting recent developments in the CBD space is the invention of tech - nologies to make it more bioavailable. Dosing is only effective if patients are actually absorbing the CBD in the first place. Let's review some of the clinical applications of CBD and then discuss factors that interfere with CBD's bioavailability, as well as a recently developed technology that improves the effectiveness of CBD. CBD and the pain response CBD works through the endocannabinoid system, a pathway that includes endogenous endocannabinoids produced in the body such as anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG). CBD can activate the same receptors as AEA and 2-AG. It is interesting to note that pain relievers such as NSAIDs and acetaminophen work by slowing the breakdown of natural endocannabinoids, illustrating the link between the endocannabinoid system and pain reduction.1 These endocannabinoid-enhancing effects of NSAIDs and acetaminophen indicate their use together with CBD may increase their pain-relieving effects. CBD-rich hemp oil is of clinical use in various types of pain including osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, migraines, irritable bowel syndrome and musculoskeletal inflammation.2-4 CBD indirectly acts on one of the primary receptors in the endocannabinoid system, cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1). Opioids act on receptors in the brain that govern respiration, which is the reason they are associated with often fatal respiratory depression.5 However, CB1 expression is weak in these brain areas, which is why phytocannabinoids like CBD can be safely used as painkillers.5 Furthermore, CBD can interact with the CB2 receptor, which indirectly activates opioid receptors to suppress pain.1 Calming effects for stress, anxiety and sleep People who have a difficult time coping with stress, such as individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder, often have an imbalanced endocannabinoid system6,7 that can benefit by CBD supplementation. 46 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MARCH 28, 2021 CHIROECO.COMWELLNESS APPROACH CBD's ability to reduce stress and anxiety has been well- documented in several studies of humans giving a simulated public speech. For example, in a double-blind study of 57 healthy male participants given one of three doses of CBD (150 mg, 300 mg or 600 mg) or a placebo, 300 mg of CBD markedly lowered anxiety during the public speech.8 The other CBD doses had no effect. However, in another study of patients with generalized social anxiety disorder, a higher dose of CBD (600 mg) was needed to reduce anxiety, cognitive impairment and discomfort in speech performance.9 One of the mechanisms of action of CBD's calming effects is regulating blood flow in brain regions involved in stress and sustaining endocannabinoid levels in the limbic and paralimbic brain areas.10 The endocannabinoid system also plays a role in the circadian sleep-wake cycle.11 This may explain CBD's ability to promote restful sleep.12 Patients with insomnia given 160 mg CBD could sleep longer and more deeply during the night compared to a placebo.12 CBD may also be beneficial in REM sleep behavior disorder and excessive daytime sleepiness.13 CBD's possible role in immunity The endocannabinoid system plays a role in a healthy immune response. It assists with the regulation of bacteria, viruses, and some protozoa and their elimination from the body.14 Additionally, the endocannabinoid AEA and the CB2 receptor regulate gut immunity.15 In fact, CB2 is found primarily in immune cells.16 Working through the endocannabinoid system, CBD may suppress viral hepatitis, according to an in vitro study.17 In animals, CBD has demonstrated antibacterial effects.18,19 CBD also reduces inflammation in the lungs of mice20 and enhances natural killer cell activity.21 Its stress-relieving properties, discussed earlier in this article, are also beneficial to the immune system, given the well-known ability of stress to impair immunity.22 Relieving seizures One of the most promising uses for CBD is its application in epilepsy. A number of human studies have pointed to its clin - ical usefulness in this respect.23-25 One randomized, double-blind, 14-week study of Dravet syndrome patients found that CBD combined with antiepileptic medications led to more notable reductions in the frequency of convulsive seizures compared to the subjects on the placebo.23 In another randomized, double-blind trial, 16 people who had achieved no benefit from antiepileptic medications were administered 200-300 mg daily of CBD plus conventional medications or placebo.26 Four of the eight patients on CBD were nearly free of seizures throughout the trial. Three other participants experienced some improvement after taking CBD. Only one patient in the CBD group did not experience any benefits. In the placebo group, seven participants experienced no benefits and only one patient noted any improvement. Autism and schizophrenia In addition to promoting calm and relaxation and encouraging restful sleep, CBD may improve social interactions. It inhibited social withdrawal and improved social interaction and cogni - tion in two rat models of schizophrenia.27,28 In another rodent model of Dravet syndrome, CBD reduced seizures and behaviors similar to those seen in autism.29 How bioavailable is CBD? Clearly, CBD has many potential applications in clinical prac - tice. However, CBD's usefulness is limited if it is not being absorbed effectively. There are several factors that can affect CBD bioavailability. Body size and composition of patients can determine how well CBD is absorbed. People who have a larger fat free mass experience a faster time to maximum concentration (T max) after oral ingestion of some CBD formulas.30 This may be due to an increased rate of clearance by metabolically active tissues such as skeletal muscle that are well-perfused as a result of larger fat free mass being associated with increased blood volume.30 For some CBD formulations, body mass index is also positively correlated with the time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of CBD levels in the blood.\u00b3 Fat mass may modulate CBD absorption due to the lipid-soluble nature of CBD, which may build up in fat tissue.30 Another factor that affects CBD bioavailability is the lipid- soluble nature of CBD. CBD has poor water solubility and plasma concentrations are higher when taken together with a high-fat meal.31,32 Additionally, whether CBD is administered as a food or beverage, additional ingredients in the formula and method of delivery can affect its absorption.30 Inside the body, gut absorption and breakdown during first-pass metabolism also will play a significant role in circulating CBD levels.30 Factors impacting CBD bioavailability Its lipid-soluble properties Patients' body composition Ingestion on an empty stomach or with a high-fat meal Delivery system of the CBD product Gut absorption First-pass metabolismInside the body, gut absorption and breakdown during first-pass metabolism also will play a significant role in circulating CBD levels. 48 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MARCH 28, 2021 CHIROECO.COMRecent developments in enhancing CBD bioavailability On account of CBD's inconsistent bioavailability, research has revolved around improving the absorption of CBD through the use of various technologies. One of the most promising of these technologies is self- emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS), a lipophilic delivery system which self-assembles on contact with an aqueous phase into a colloidal delivery system, enhancing diffusion, absorption and consequently bioavailability.33 This type of delivery system was previously used to successfully increase the oral bioavailability of coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone) and is therefore considered as a promising means to improve the bioavailability of CBD.34 SEDDS are mixtures of oils and surfactants, and may contain hydrophilic solvents. Upon contact with aqueous fluids such as those found in the gastrointestinal tract, SEDDS-CBD spontaneously emulsifies under conditions such as those encountered in the gastrointestinal tract.33 This leads to the formation of droplets that are transported across the aqueous lumen of the gastrointestinal tract to the surface of the enterocyte. Here, single molecules of CBD separate from the droplets and are transferred to the enterocyte membrane and subsequently to the blood or lymphatic vessels.33 A 2019 study demonstrated that the SEDDS delivery system technology increased the bioavailability of a CBD-rich hemp extract (SEDDS-CBD).33 In this randomized, double-blind, cross- over study, 16 healthy volunteers under fasted conditions received either SEDDS-CBD or the same hemp extract diluted with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT-CBD) at a standardized dose of 25 mg. Single oral administration of SEDDS-CBD led to 4.4-fold higher concentrations compared to the MCT-CBD, as well as 2.85-fold higher area under the curve (AUC) at eight hours and 1.70-fold AUC at 24 hours. Faster absorption was also achieved during SEDDS-CBD administration (one hour) compared to three hours with MCT-CBD. During administration of MCT-CBD there was higher bioavailability in women compared with men.

Dr. Tiffany Crouch Doctor of Chiropractic at The Joint WELLNESS APPROACH SEDDS-CBD ingestion there were no significant differences in CBD concentrations in women compared with men. Only a slightly faster time to maximum concentration was observed in men compared to women during the SEDDS-CBD intervention. Bioavailability is the key CBD is useful in a variety of applications including pain, stress, insomnia, immune support and mental health. However, a number of factors can interfere with its bioavailability, including its water-soluble properties and patients' body compositions. New technologies are being invented to improve CBD's bioavailability. A self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) is one of the most promising of these technologies. This type of technology leads to 4.4-fold higher concentrations of CBD compared to an MCT-CBD delivery system. When treating patients with such a potentially useful modality as CBD, ensuring they are receiving meaningful quantities of this phytocannabinoid is critical to achieving successful therapeutic outcomes.

Presently, we use verbiage during this pandemic such as \"unprecedented,\" \"chal - lenging,\" \"new norm,\" etc. These words and phrases illustrate the issues of chiropractic \u2014 challenging and unprecedented. However, so too are implied issues at school; you were never told that you needed to be a marketer, a sales professional or an accountant. These roles not only became the new normal but the truth. To that end, you froze, you faltered, and you failed miserably at trying to get patients, and then the desire to succeed became the nightmares you experienced \u2014 your truth \u2014 until now. I want to calm your anxiety and provide you an inexpensive and easy way to become your own marketing and public relations agent.

Now that is a lengthy definition that means, as a patient, getting your attention, providing you value and keeping you forever. More comfortable to remember, isn't it? Marketing is nothing more than giving value to your patients. Value is then exchanged for cash, for reimbursement, anything that helps the patient out of pain and comfort. When you provide value, others speak about you. This is where reviews and reputation websites assist, and when you provide exceptional patient service and experience, the patients tell others. This is what is known in marketing as a pull strategy; in other words, you are helping to pull individuals into your universe by hearing about and learning about your uncompromising service. But what happens if: You are just beginning your practice You are running out of patients and need more Your practice, similar to others, has taken an economic hit How can you develop more patients? This is where the challenging part that was never told to you comes from. Ready for the truth? It comes from marketing and its many techniques. Marketing techniques In the past, many marketers built substantial barriers around the various marketing and promotional functions, planning and managing them separately with different budgets, different views of the market, and other goals and objectives. In the 1990s, however, many companies began moving toward the concept of integrated marketing communications (IMC), which involves coordinating the various promotional elements along with other marketing activities that communicate with a firm's customers. As marketers embraced the concept of IMC, they began asking their ad agencies to coordinate the use of a variety of promotional tools rather than relying primarily upon media advertising. Several companies started looking beyond traditional advertising agencies and using other promotional specialists to develop and implement various components of their promotional plans. As the advertising industry recognized that IMC was more than just a fad, terms such as new advertising, orchestration, MARCOM, and seamless communication were used to describe the concept of integration. A task force from the American Association of Advertising Agencies (4As) developed one of the first definitions of integrated marketing communications, defining it as: A concept of marketing communications planning that recognizes the added value of a comprehensive plan that evaluates the strategic roles of a variety of communication disciplines \u2014 for example, general advertising, direct response, sales promotion, and public relations \u2014 and combines these disciplines to provide clarity, consistency, and maximum communications impact. Integrated marketing communications requests that you devise a plan to: a) create a harmonistic message across; b) an array of marketing channels. What are some of those marketing channels? These include but are not limited to sales, advertising, promotion, patient service, and public relations (PR) for the purposes of this article. The cool aspect of public relations is that it is relatively inexpensive and easy to use. The truth is you can quickly and instantly become your own media company and public relations person with as little as 5-10 hours per week \u2014 that is less than one hour per day. First, let me explain PR. Public relations for patient awareness of your brand Public relations is a large part of the integrated communica - tions process that requires a strategic approach to developing relationships with your target market. You may look at this and say, so what on earth is the difference between this and general marketing? We are typically promoting a brand, service or product in marketing; for example, chiropractic tables or orthotics. Public IMC INTEGRATED MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS INVOLVES COORDINATING ACTIVITIES AND PROMOTIONAL ELEMENTS TO GET YOUR BRAND ACROSS TO PATIENTS.Your practice becomes an influencer \u2014 your thoughts, words and choices help create community, and that is what public relations is all about. 54 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MARCH 28, 2021 CHIROECO.COMrelations helps build an image in the target market's mind to say to the market, \"Notice this brand, trust this brand, review this brand, and finally, interact with this brand.\" PR cultivates a story that portrays that client's reputation, idea, product, position or accomplishment in a positive light. PR truly tells a story about you, your practice, the doctor, the patients and draws individuals into your world. How to get started Many years ago, I was the CEO of a public relations firm. Public relations is part of marketing but works differently. First, you can take the lazy way and hire a public relations firm. Giving money to someone to help you with your image is similar to playing the lottery and hoping you win. The truth is no one, and I mean no one, can tell your story better than you. So rather than pay money or at least hordes of cash, here are three very inexpensive and, dare I say, free \u2014 yes, I said free \u2014 services to help you begin as a media magnet. 1 Use Google Search your metropolitan area for each and every AM and FM radio station, your regional periodicals such as magazines and newspapers, and finally, your local television and cable stations. Have you ever read your local newspaper, and ques - tioned why the local accountant or attorney was quoted in an article or perhaps had their own column? Simple \u2014 they conducted outreach. To become a media magnet, people need to know who you are and what you do, and what better way than in the local area with your own column or perhaps a quote in a journal. 2 Contact your local television stations Those locals are always seeking something fresh, new and exciting. For example, early this year you can be on television to discuss new fitness techniques for the annual diet, you can provide quick recipes for people on the go, and for those now stranded at their desks, OSHA-compliant stretching and aware - ness helps quarantined individuals move and remain healthy. Local television is continually looking for new and controversial items that shake people up and get them to say, \"I want more.\" It's no more difficult than sending them a press release outlining what you're available to speak about or when you're available to make a television appearance. MARKETING MATTERS CHIROECO.COM MARCH 28, 2021 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 55MARKETING MATTERS 3 Social media More than 3.6 billion people use social media globally, and the number is only projected to increase, to 4.41 billion in 2025. Social media is being used more today by journalists than ever before. The rationale for the use of social media as a PR resource is because: News cycles are shorter, and if you and your colleagues can provide something interesting for journalists, they are apt to see and carry your story, especially if you \"@\" them or \"cc\" their Twitter or social media handle in their message; Social media is free. Thankfully, there are no membership fees nor rote advertising. You simply keypunch your message and have your community review the content. Every small business can afford to hire a college student studying communications, journalism or public relations to manage their online presence as an intern or part-time employee; Your practice becomes an influencer. Your thoughts, words and choices help create community, and that is what public relations is all about \u2014 building community; 24-7/365. You create social media messaging based on your time and your energy, but there is no music if you do not make any noise. With social media available around the clock, you can reach an audience wherever, whenever and however you desire; Cision and HARO. These names mean nothing to you now, but in a moment, they will. Cision is a database that houses every print and multimedia company in the world. HARO (Help A Reporter Out) works similarly. The two online subscriptions tie journalists worldwide with experts like you desirous of telling a story or of being quoted in a periodical or podcast based on a theme. Next time you switch on the news or a talk show, do not fret that you will never be on television \u2014 untrue! Every guest has someone or themselves use CISION (or other media databases) and HARO to become a media agency while pitching to the press. Politicians, celebrities, and even professional speakers have all gotten more extensive with these databases' power. The next time you believe your business is failing and you cannot get out of the free fall, walk over to a mirror, be truthful, handle the truth and ask yourself if you are marketing in an effective and self-effacing manner. If you desire to be the chiropractor everyone wants to know and be, you must be honest and begin marketing techniques that thrust your practice to a new level. All you need is a story, the ability to connect with journalists and the desire to succeed. Trust me, you can handle the truth.

THE TAKEAWAY See how many of these seven valuable income sources you are taking advantage of as a doctor of chiropractic to alleviate the reliance on only one or two major sources. SUCCESS IN A CHIROPRACTIC PRACTICE can be measured with several metrics. Patient satisfaction, response to care, and provider fulfillment are certainly at the top of the list. However, as with any business, the bottom line is generating the income to maintain the practice and the provider's home life. As with all businesses, success relies on the income your business can generate in deference to what it costs to deliver the services. For a chiropractic practice, there are not only the hard costs of the office and staff, but your student loan debt and other payments should be included. A higher volume of patients will decrease the cost per patient, however volume may not be infinite as there may be a time dependence. Consider diversifying your practice Don't rely on one or only a few avenues of reimbursement. A practice that is all cash is a great idea, but is it sustainable in all areas or during a down economy? There are seven ways a chiropractic office can be paid. Utilizing only one, or too few, could lead to issues of contraction when one of those avenues is compromised: 1 Cash Direct payment from a patient is always a primary busi - ness model, but relying solely on this may reduce greatly the number of patients who have insurance that will not pay out of pocket when they pay, or have insurance that covers chiropractic. There are areas of the country that will allow a model where patients may prepay for visits or the time-of-service payment can be discounted from your regular rate. Cash payments are always part of an office income, but a cash-only office requires a location where there is a higher- than-average income and patients can afford and are willing to pay out-of-pocket for all services, which necessitates salesmanship and personality to promote. 2 Standard health insurance It is not uncommon for insurance plans to cover chiro - practic, and 41 states have mandatory chiropractic benefits. However, the variance of payments (allowable rates), deductibles, and limitations to the number of visits do affect how effective they are to maintaining a practice. Some plans may allow north of $100 per visit while others allow $50-60. These plans provide fewer out-of-pocket costs, which often removes the barrier of costs from the equation to getting care. When a patient has a plan that allows 30 visits a year, even though they may feel better within 12 visits, they may request additional care as they see they have another 18 to use.

FINANCIAL ADVICE deference to the cash model, this is certainly a positive, but the provider must be aware that insurance pays for necessary care to cure or relieve a condition and not for maintenance. The downside is that many patients may have large deductibles or coinsurance that may prohibit use due to cost. In these cases, you can simply convert them to a cash patient and potentially offer a discount compared to your insurance rate. The upside is that you can pick and choose, and you are never obligated to bill insurance. Insurance billing is a courtesy and not a requirement, and you may choose to bill insurance plans A and B but not bill plans C and D. You are only obligated to bill when you join insurance as a provider member. 3 PPO and HMO insurance These plans have chiropractic bene - fits but may limit the patient to seek care from \"in-network\" providers only or reduce the out-of-pocket costs paid by the patient. These plans offer a trade-off in that when you join, you are obligated to see the patient, bill their insurance, and accept the contracted rate. The providers cannot bill the patient beyond that allowance. But you will have greater access to more patients and may care for a higher volume of patients. This is where you have to look at the cost ratio and decide if the reimbursement is at a level that covers overhead in an adequate manner. Note that a higher volume of patients will reduce the per-patient amount, but it also requires seeing a higher volume. These plans often limit reimbursement per visit from as little as $30 per average visit (visits with exams and X-rays would be higher) and up to $60. If your practice is in a region with a high volume of people who have these plans, it is likely that you will enroll in some. Otherwise, you will not have access to these patients because often they will seek care only from providers in the network. You may choose to join one insurance and not the other and still can give yourself some solidarity. Joining one never means you have to join all, and many of these PPO plans contract with several payers and will allow you to pick and choose in which plan you wish to participate. 4 Workers' compensation All states require employers to provide workers' compensation insur - ance, which covers all work-related injuries and illness.

The patient has no deductible or out-of-pocket costs. While the patient has the choice of provider, always assure that the claim was accepted and authorized. An authorized claim is a guaranteed benefit. 5 Personal injury Auto accident claims are always viable payment for chiropractic services, which may be primary care. There can be direct payment in \"no-fault\" or tort states under personal injury protection or PIP or med pay (direct medical benefits under auto insurance). All are essentially guaranteed payment and will pay the billed amount unless your fees are well above usual and customary for your region. If the claim is a third-party liability and in an \"at fault\" state, medical payments will not be paid to the provider but to the patient or their attorney directly. The latter can be riskier, as the payment is dependent on the settlement of the claim. Lower settlements often lead to the patient or an attorney attempting to negotiate your fee. When vetted properly for injury to the patient, property damage and liability, these claims can result in high reimbursement. The nature and severity of the injuries may require more intense and often longer care plans. 6 Medicare While limited to spinal manipulation, Medicare does offer chiropractic benefits for a very large segment of the population. All patients over 65 and anyone permanently disabled for two years or more are Medicare patients. Medicare has specific rules of protocol for diagnosis, including subluxation as the primary diagnosis with a secondary neuromusculoskeletal diagnosis. The number of visits allowed per year often ranges between 20-40 visits for an average Medicare enrollee. The deductible is one of the lowest of any insurance, and C M Y CM MY CY CMY KHalf_PAGE_AD_7.125x4.25__OL.pdf 1 2/1/21 10:43 AM 12-48 CHIROPRACTIC VISITS AVAILABLE FOR VETERANS UNDER THE VA CHOICE PROGRAMAll patients over 65 and anyone permanently disabled for two years or more are Medicare patients. 64 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MARCH 28, 2021 CHIROECO.COM *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

FINANCIAL ADVICE the patient has often met with medical providers before seeing a chiropractic provider. The payment ranges from about $30-50, with Medicare paying 80% and the patient 20%. The patient is also liable for services other than spinal manipulation, for which they may be billed, but other services may also be payable by any secondary insurance plan. You must register as a Medicare provider to see a Medicare patient, and if you choose not to register, you cannot see a Medicare patient even for cash payment. This means that if you are not part of Medicare, you will eliminate a large portion of society who may try to seek care from you. 7 Veterans Administration The VA Choice program allows veterans enrolled in the program to receive care from a chiropractor regis - tered with Triwest (in the western half of the U.S.) and Optum Health (for the eastern portion). These patients require direct authorization, but due to the opioid crisis, chiropractic has become a strong arm to the management of acute and chronic issues for veterans. These plans cover complete care and can range from as few as 12 authorized visits to as many as 48. Payment for services includes not only chiropractic manipulation but exams, X-rays and a multitude of physical medicine services. This plan is also guaranteed payment with no deductible or out-of-pocket costs by the patient. Diversify your payment sources There are multiple ways to run a successful practice, and success can be defined by several facets, including the fiduciary and viability of the practice to sustain itself. The more diverse your payment sources, the more likely you are to have sustained success. Your practice will be a big wheel, and it's better to support it with multiple spokes rather than one or a few. There will always be an ebb and a flow that will reduce one and make the other greater, and when you have a larger wheelhouse, you are less likely to ground in low tides.

Many studies have taken place to see how to prevent spread, to develop vaccines, and what will halt the spread. A recent study published by the Endocrine Society in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism concluded that more than 80% of the 200+ patients studied in a hospital in Spain had a deficiency of vitamin D. \"One approach is to identify and treat vitamin D deficiency, especially in high-risk individuals such as the elderly, patients with comorbidities, and nursing home residents, who are the main target population for the COVID-19,\" study co-author Jos\u00e9 L. Hern\u00e1ndez, Ph.D., of the University of Cantabria in Santander, Spain, said in a statement. \"Vitamin D treatment should be recommended in COVID-19 patients with low levels of vitamin D circulating in the blood since this approach might have beneficial effects in both the musculoskeletal and the immune system.\" Let vitamin D light the way for patient health Many studies in the past have shown that doctors can let vitamin D light the way to health for patients and can strengthen the immune system \u2014 and so being deficient in vitamin D can make people susceptible to viruses. According to this cited study, 82.2% of the patients with COVID-19 have a vitamin D deficiency, while the overall population only has a 47.2% deficiency. More men than women were affected. In addition, patients with COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiencies were more likely to also have hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, and they tended to stay in the hospital longer than those without a vitamin D deficiency. The authors wrote in the paper, \"The interplay between vitamin D and viral infection is an area of growing interest, and interaction with host and viral factors, immunomodulatory effects, induction of autophagy and apoptosis, and even genetic and epigenetic factors have been reported as antiviral effects of this hormone.\" Other issues with vitamin D deficiency The statement issued by the Endocrine Society also said, \"Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to a variety of health concerns, although research is still underway into why the hormone impacts other systems of the body. Many studies point to the beneficial effect of vitamin D on the immune system, especially regarding protection against infections.\" However, the authors wrote, \"Our study was carried out in a hospitalized population, and, in this sense, it is worth mentioning that serum 25OHD has been considered as a negative acute-phase reactant, and its values have been reported to be decreased during acute inflammatory diseases. Thus, our COVID-19 patients had a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, and serum 25OHD levels significantly and negatively correlated with ferritin and D-dimer values, indicating that vitamin D might have a beneficial role on the systemic inflammatory state of this viral disease.\" Solid results, but studies ongoing While they were able to make some connections with vitamin D improving deficiency and helping ward off COVID-19 when there is a deficiency, the authors admit that more study is needed. \"Whether the treatment of vitamin D deficiency will play some role in the prevention of the viral disease or improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 remains to be elucidated in large randomized controlled trials, which will be certainly necessary to precisely define the role of vitamin D supplementation in future waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\" ADVERTORIAL About Dee Cee Labs Founded by Dr. Harry Hester in 1962, Dee Cee Labs has a company culture focused on helping folks discover a healthier quality of life through good, sound nutritional products.

Your patients count on you to help them through this difficult time, as do your family and friends. If you're a business owner your employees are counting on you also. In \"normal\" times you could escape the pressure by seeing friends socially, going to a restaurant, or maybe going to a movie theater. Now we're trying to find that new normal as a society, trying to make it look as close to the old normal we can. WE'RE IN IT TOGETHER Last year we told the story of the two young chiropractors who 30 years ago attained their DC degrees, both near the top of the same graduating class and full of enthusiasm to enter chiropractic care. When they returned for their 30-year reunion, both were married with family and had stayed in touch over the years. But while one worked in a multi-doctor practice, the other had founded his own multi-location practice and as CEO was contemplating an early retirement. THE DIFFERENCE? How and why did the two DC's paths diverge? Both sought success. Both were near the top of their class in school. Both entered the field with enthusiasm. The difference-maker was the business of chiropractic - learning the economics of the industry. The eventual CEO subscribed to Chiropractic Economics and gained the knowledge to take his practice to the next level. LET OUR KNOWLEDGE BE YOUR POWER Chiropractic Economics is the only BPA Audited publication requested by over 20,000 Doctors of Chiropractic.

KETO DIETING FOR WEIGHT LOSS PATIENTS The choice depends on patient goals and being patient BY TINA BEYCHOK TIME TO READ: 4-6 MIN. THE TAKEAWAY The Mediterranean diet and keto often go head-to-head for patients looking to make an eating lifestyle change, and each approaches diet and wellness from two very different directions. MANY PATIENTS TOOK COVID LOCKDOWNS and the additional threat to their health during the pandemic to change their eating habits and tackle a healthy diet. With many restaurants limited to either takeout or delivery, more people are instead preparing their meals at home. Both the keto and the Mediterranean diets have gained a great deal of popularity over the past few years and can easily be followed with ingredients found in most supermarkets. Although there are some similarities in terms of foods that can be eaten, there are key differences in terms of goals, potential risks and long-term benefits. The keto diet The defining feature of the keto diet is that it is extremely low in carbs and high in fat.\u00b9 Carbs should be less than 10% of the total daily intake. When the body no longer has carbs or glucose as a fuel source, it will instead turn to fat, which the liver turns into ketones. These ketones then become the body's new fuel source, replacing the sugars found in carbs. Because the body needs to replace so many carbs, fats are increased to make up as much as 90% of a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet.1 A sample keto-friendly diet might include: Rib eye steak, pork roast and bacon, instead of lean meats Whole dairy Dark chocolate and nut butters Leafy greens, instead of starchy vegetables such as sweet potatoes Oil- or mayonnaise-based salad dressings A 2013 meta-analysis of smaller studies appears to show that the keto diet has success over the short term, compared to just a standard low-fat diet.2 A 2018 study found that patients still retained modest weight loss for periods of up to a year, but there was also a high dropout rate of as many as one-third of all patients.3 While some promote the keto diet as a lifestyle, many point it out as unhealthy over the long term due to its high fat requirements. 70 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MARCH 28, 2021 CHIROECO.COMWELLNESS APPROACH Mediterranean diet The Mediterranean diet is not as strict or regimented as the keto diet. Instead, it is loosely based around the standard diet found among countries surrounding the Mediterranean. Some examples of food that could be found in a Mediterranean diet include: Fresh fruit and vegetables Whole grains, beans, lentils and nuts Herbs, spices and healthy fats such as olive oil Seafood twice a week Moderate amounts of dairy, including eggs and poultry It should not be surprising that the Mediterranean diet has long-term health benefits for most people who follow it. A 2018 study followed the health status of almost 26,000 healthy American women. The researchers found that the risk of cardiac disease was reduced by approximately 25% for those women who followed the Mediterranean diet.4 Mediterranean diet vs. keto \u2014 which is better? The answer to this question really comes down to each indi - vidual patient's health, lifestyle and goals. Because the keto diet puts stress on both the kidneys and liver, it may not be the best option for your patients who are prone to kidney stones or liver problems. But it may be an excellent way for them to \"jump-start\" their weight loss plan, before transitioning to a long-term change in eating habits, such as the Mediterranean diet. On the other hand, the Mediterranean diet will not produce rapid weight loss, so it is likely to be more successful with your patients who are committed over the long term to a wellness lifestyle.

THE TAKEAWAY The authority you establish in your community has a direct correlation to current and future patients, branding and marketing efforts. A COMMON DESIRE FOR MOST CHIROPRACTIC PRACTITIONERS is to have more patients and more revenue \u2014 sounds great! And perhaps familiar? However, before your eyes and efforts are focused on these goals, and before I share three reliable (and possibly surprising) ways to maximize revenue in your practice, I recommend you pause to look at your current overall revenue versus your actual profit. Keeping your focus on this distinction will make the difference between a thriving practice and one that is \"getting by.\" Surprising revenue drivers All too often, practices strive to do everything they can to create higher revenues. This may include fancy marketing campaigns, splashy ads, more team members, a new EMR, coding courses, a bigger office or other similar strategies. Yet, at the end of the day, profit is lacking. If this has happened to you, you are not alone. In fact, this was made painstakingly clear for many practices throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in additional stress and negative outcomes. In your power, right now, is the ability to not only add revenue, but practice profits \u2014 on demand. You can do this despite the pandemic or other circumstances if you offer services and products your ideal patients want and need, and you sincerely help them attain the outcome they desire.Below are three reliable ways for you to maximize revenue in your practice. These are not gimmicks and they have been shown to work consistently in practices despite external situations outside your control. 1. Increase your authority Authority changes everything. It is one of the most transfor - mational things you can do for your practice \u2014 especially now. Having authority increases trust. It improves patient compli - ance, thus improving outcomes. As a result, you will experience more referrals, positive testimonials/reviews and attract even more patients, resulting in more revenue and profits. Unfortunately, the days of listening to the doctor in their white coat and following instructions exactly as prescribed are few and far between. Enter \"Dr. Google,\" self-appointed experts, celebrity experts, big-box companies and more vying for the attention of your patients to serve them in bold ways. To combat this reality and increase the likelihood of your being the sought-after expert best suited to provide your life- changing expertise, I recommend that you do two things. Do no harm to your authority \u2014 Sometimes marketing efforts can erode your authority and lower patient trust. Flashy advertisements, click-bait articles, deep discounts on services, 74 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MARCH 28, 2021 CHIROECO.COMFINANCIAL ADVICE over-the-top claims or gimmicks are generally not expected or respected when it comes to professional services. This can happen sometimes when you trust your marketing to someone who doesn't understand you, your brand, your ideal patients, what you offer, and most importantly the benefits of your services and products. Build your authority \u2014 Stay true to yourself, your vision, your brand and the outcomes you help your patients attain. In your social media posts, blogs, videos, emails and newsletters, consistently share the answers to the primary concerns your patients have. Outline clearly that you understand their struggle and exactly how you can help (along with how they can begin working with you). Don't get overwhelmed by the technology or platforms. Start small and build from there. Nowadays, you and your practice can easily create online \"assets\" such as a video on YouTube, transcribe it into a blog post, create quote graphics to post with a link to the blog and more. An asset you own is online forever as opposed to a paid ad that is short-lived. Also, posts allow you to split test what resonates with your ideal patients before you spend a dime on ads. Another tip \u2014 lead back to a platform you own, such as your website. 2. Focus on your 'one thing' and then add complementary revenue streams I am sure the concept of adding complementary revenue streams is not new to you. It is a great way to have consistent revenue that doesn't require the direct involvement of the doctor. However, now more than ever, it is imperative to take a close look at your financial profit-loss by cost center and to determine the primary service you enjoy providing, and that your patients desire and is profitable for you. Once identified, you will want to keep this as the primary focus for your marketing, newsletters, and communication with your current and prospective patients. Look at the \"flow\" in your office and make any appropriate modifications. For example, necessary space, appointment availability, In your social media posts, blogs, videos, emails and newsletters, consistently share the answers to the primary concerns your patients have. CHIROECO.COM MARCH 28, 2021 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 75FINANCIAL ADVICE staffing, ease of gathering testimonials and streamlined care. Next, focus on complementary services and products that will enhance the experience and outcome of those patients seeking your primary service(s). If you already have additional revenue streams, closely review your financial profit-loss to determine if they are truly complementary to your \"one thing\" and if they are profitable. If so, then determine how you can grow that aspect of your business as well. If they are not profitable, now is the time to either focus on how to make them profitable or consider discontinuation. New revenue stream introduction When considering new revenue streams, such as a retail store for nutritional supplements or other retail-type items such as durable medical equipment and the like, here is a process that can help you set it up for success (and profitability): \u0084Identify a champion in your office to oversee the endeavor (your team must have buy-in) \u0084Determine the right size store for your situation (you can start in a closet, move to an office and onward from there) \u0084Decide upon your timeframe for implementation \u0084Create your plan/budget for success (I recommend a separate cost center for easier profit tracking) \u0084Pick your products and create your sales system (consider e-commerce as well) \u0084Promote on-site (signage, posters, fliers, team promotion with patients) \u0084Promote online (social media channels, emails, newsletters, blogs, YouTube videos, Google and the like) \u0084Track your positive return on investment (weekly/monthly) \u0084Implement growth strategies such as packaging products together, bulk ordering, text campaigns, referral program, events and more 3. Create 'future' revenue Your future is being created today. Your current decisions and actions will dictate your future revenue and profitability. ON-SITE PROMOTION: SIGNAGE, POSTERS, FLIERS, TEAM PROMOTION WITH PATIENTS, ETC.Create a referral program and don't be afraid to ask for testimonials and referrals.

Both need to hear from you regularly, so you are always top-of-mind. For your current patients, focus on their lifetime value. Continue to nurture them and make sure they are aware of new products or services you have that may help them attain their desired outcome. Create a referral program and don't be afraid to ask for testimonials and referrals. For prospective patients, stay top-of-mind with social media content that answers their most-asked questions, addresses their top health frustrations, and demonstrates your knowledge/authority regarding how to attain their desired outcome. Be yourself \u2014 show up in organic searches by optimizing your content/assets. Write that book you have been thinking about and use that as your new business card (it's never been easier to do this \u2014 reach out to a writing professional if you need help). Bottom line \u2014 profit over revenue, simplicity over complexity, authenticity over flashy marketing campaigns. Build your authority, focus on your \"one thing\" and add other complementary revenue streams to create a strong future for you and your practice.
