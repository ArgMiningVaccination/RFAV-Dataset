These key areas we have focused this report on are: 1) To create a trustworthy and responsible source of information. 2) To engage users in accessing information and recommendations, especially after the initial peak of information. 3) To develop strategies for audience segmentation and tailoring to specific groups. 4) To develop communication strategies to reach people's emotions. 5) To develop mo dels to visualize risk and the spread of flu. 6) To develop strategies and tools to engage healthcare workers. Focusing on these six key areas, we have developed logic intervention models to address each form of recommendation from the video produced in WP7. We will use the logic intervention models as guidance in planning our studies. It is our overall goal to test effective communication strategies (i.e. gist communication, testimonials, metaphors, visualization of risk) and gather data that will inform the development of an effective outbreak management tool . We have assembled a team of risk communication experts to utilize this material to design studies to test how health professionals may counter problematic media messages, manipulate uncertainties in outbreak communication, and develop strategies to counter dramatization of risk, while appropriately engage the public in outbreak information. Our team has extensive experience in he alth communication, risk communication, risk perceptions, risk communicati on graphics, omission/action tendencies self -other differences, social cognition. Our goal: We plan to use the logic intervention models we have a developed as a road map to the studies we will conduct in WP8. It is our goal to test these communication strategies so that they can be incorporated into tools that will be developed by Elastique and utilized by health communication experts to convey messages during an outbreak situation. We aim to test these strategies to gain an understanding of communicat ion strategies that are effective in outbreak situation, as well as those communication strategies that are not effective in an outbreak situation. It is especially important that we can gain an understanding of how to keep the public engaged throughout th e life course of a pandemic, how to tap into people's emotions, and how to influence the public's sense of vulnerability by assessing strategies that impact perceived susceptibility and perceived severity of an illness. Suggestion 1: Create a trustwort hy and responsible source of information.
