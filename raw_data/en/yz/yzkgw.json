HRSA is charged with ensuring access to qual-ity health care through a network of commu-nity-based health centers, maternal and child health programs, and community HIV/AIDS programs throughout the States and U.S. juris-dictions. In addition, HRSA's mission includes supporting individuals pursuing careers in medicine, nursing, and many other health dis-ciplines. HRSA fulfills these responsibilities, in part, by collecting and analyzing timely, topical information that identifies health priorities and trends that can be addressed through program interventions and capacity building. HRSA is pleased to present Women's Health USA 2010, the ninth edition of the Women's Health USA data book. To reflect the ever-changing, increasingly diverse population and its characteristics, Women's Health USA selec- tively highlights emerging issues and trends in women's health. Data and information on vision and hearing loss, home health and hos-pice care, sleep disorders, and women veterans are a few of the new topics included in this edi-tion. There is also a new section on women and aging, with data on population character- WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 PREFACE 5 istics and labor force participation among older women, as well as age-specific information on activity limitations, osteoporosis, injury, and abuse. Racial and ethnic, sex, and socioeconomic disparities are highlighted throughout the docu-ment where possible. Where race and ethnic-ity data are reported, every effort was made to ensure that groups are mutually exclusive. In some instances, it was not possible to provide data for all races due to the design of the original data source or the size of the sample population; therefore, estimates with a relative standard er-ror of 30 percent or greater were considered un-reliable and were not reported. The data book was developed by HRSA to provide readers with an easy-to-use collection of current and historical data on some of the most pressing health challenges facing women, their families, and their communities. Women's Health USA 2010 is a concise reference for poli-cymakers and program managers at the Federal, State, and local levels to identify and clarify is-sues affecting the health of women. In these pages, readers will find a profile of women's health from various data sources. The data book brings together the latest available information from various agencies within the Federal gov-ernment, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Labor, and U.S. Department of Justice. Non-Federal data sources were used when no Federal source was available. Every attempt has been made to use data collected during the past 5 years. It is important to note that the data included are generally not age-adjusted to the 2000 popula-tion standard of the United States. This affects the comparability of data from year to year, and the interpretation of differences across various groups, especially those of different races and ethnicities. Without age-adjustment, it is dif-ficult to know how much of the difference in in-cidence rates between groups can be attributed to differences in the groups' age distributions. Women's Health USA 2010 is available online through the HRSA Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), Office of Women's Health Web site at http://hrsa.gov/womenshealth or the MCHB Office of Data and Program Devel-opment's Web site at www.mchb.hrsa.gov/data. Some of the topics covered in Women's Health USA 2009 were not included in this year's edi-tion because new data were not available or preference was given to an emerging issue in women's health. For coverage of these issues, please refer to Women's Health USA 2009, also available online. The National Women's Health Information Center, located online at www.womenshealth.gov, has detailed women's and minority health data and maps. These data are available through Quick Health Data Online at www.healthstatus2010.com/owh. Data are available at the State and county levels, by age, race and ethnicity, and sex.

In most age groups, women accounted for approximately half of the population, with the exception of people aged 65 years and older; within this age group, women represented 58 percent of the population. The growing diver-sity of the U.S. population is reflected in the ra-cial and ethnic distribution of women across age groups. Black and Hispanic women accounted for 9.0 and 6.8 percent of the female population aged 65 years and older, respectively, but they represented 14.1 and 22.4 percent of females under 15 years of age. Non-Hispanic Whites accounted for 79.9 percent of women aged 65 years and older, but only 55.2 percent of those under 15 years of age. Hispanic women now comprise a greater proportion of the female population than in 2000, when they made up 17.5 percent of the population under age 15 and 4.9 percent of those 65 years and older. America's growing diversity underscores the importance of examining and addressing ra-cial and ethnic disparities in health status and the use of health care services. In 2008, 63.4 percent of non-Hispanic White women report-ed themselves to be in excellent or very good health, compared to only 48.1 percent of His-panic women and 48.4 percent of non-Hispanic Black women. Minority women are dispropor-tionately affected by a number of diseases and health conditions, including HIV/AIDS, sexu-ally transmitted infections, diabetes, and asth-ma. For instance, in 2008, rates of new HIV cases were highest among Black and Hispanic females (56.0 and 13.3 per 100,000 females, respectively). In 2008, 36.0 percent of non-Hispanic White women had ever been tested for HIV, compared to 57.0 percent of non-Hispan-ic Black and 50.6 percent of Hispanic women. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 INTRODUCTION 7 Hypertension, or high blood pressure, was also more prevalent among non-Hispanic Black women than women of other races. In 2005-2008, 21.3 percent of non-Hispanic Black women were found to have high blood pressure, compared to 16.3 percent of non-Hispanic White, 10.6 percent of Mexican American, and 12.4 percent of other Hispanic women. Diabetes is a chronic condition and a lead- ing cause of death and disability in the United States, and is especially prevalent among mi-nority and older adults. Among women with diabetes, however, non-Hispanic Black women were most likely to have been diagnosed with the condition by a health professional (63.7 per-cent), compared to only 49.1 percent of non-Hispanic White women. In addition to race and ethnicity, income and education are important factors that contribute to women's health and access to health care. Re-gardless of family structure, women are more likely than men to live in poverty. Poverty rates were highest among women who were heads of their households with no spouse present (25.7 percent). Poverty rates were also high among non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native, and Hispanic women (23.2, 22.7, and 22.3 percent, respectively). Women in these racial and ethnic groups were also more likely to be heads of households than their non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander counterparts. Mental health is another important aspect of women's overall health. A range of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder, dis-proportionately affect women. In 2008, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native and non-Hispanic women of multiple races were more likely than women of other races and ethnicities to report ever having had depression (40.0 percent each), followed by non-Hispanic White women (36.5 percent). Women in these racial and ethnic groups were also more likely than other women to report ever having had generalized anxiety. Some conditions and health risks are more closely linked to family income than to race and ethnicity, including asthma. Rates of asthma decline as income increases, and women with higher incomes are more likely to effectively manage their asthma. Nearly 14 percent of women with household incomes of less than 100 percent of poverty had asthma in 2008, compared to 8.4 percent of women with in-comes of 200-399 percent of poverty and 7.2 percent of women with higher incomes. Severe headaches and migraines were also more common among women with lower household incomes and were more likely to af-fect women than men. In 2008, 24.9 percent of women with household incomes below 100 percent of poverty had experienced severe head-aches or migraines in the previous 3 months, compared to 16.7 percent of women with in-comes of 200 percent or more of poverty. Receipt of oral health care and oral health status among women also varies dramati-cally with household income. In 2005 -2008, women with incomes of 300 percent or more of poverty were more likely to have had a den-tal restoration (89.9 percent) and significantly less likely to have untreated dental decay (10.3 percent) than their lower-income counterparts. Fewer than 69 percent of women with incomes below 100 percent of poverty had had a tooth restored, while 30.3 percent were found to have untreated dental decay. Among older adults, physical disabilities are more prevalent among women than men. Disability can be defined as impairment of the ability to perform common activities like walk-ing up stairs, sitting or standing for 2 hours or more, grasping small objects, or carrying items like groceries. Therefore, the terms \"activity lim-itations\" and \"disabilities\" are used interchange-ably throughout this book. Overall, 68.4 per-cent of women and 54.4 percent of men aged 65 years and older reported having an activity limitation in 2008. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 INTRODUCTION 8 However, men bear a disproportionate bur- den of some health conditions, such as HIV/ AIDS, high blood pressure, and coronary heart disease. In 2008, for instance, the rate of new-ly reported HIV cases among adolescent and adult males was more than 3 times the rate among females (35.9 versus 11.5 per 100,000, respectively). Despite the greater risk, a smaller proportion of men had ever been tested for HIV than women (37.6 versus 40.9 percent, respec-tively). Certain health risks, such as cigarette use and illicit drug use, occur more commonly among men than women. In 2008, 23.1 percent of men smoked cigarettes, compared to 18.3 per-cent of women. Similarly, 29.1 percent of men consumed 4 or more drinks per week in the past year, compared to only 13.3 percent of women. In addition, men were more likely than women to lack health insurance. Many diseases and health conditions, includ- ing some of those mentioned above, can be avoided or minimized through good nutrition, regular physical activity, and preventive health care. In 2008, 76.3 percent of women aged 40 and older reported having had a mammogram in the previous 2 years. In 2005 -2008, 72.5 percent of women aged 20 and older reported having had a cholesterol screening in the previ-ous 5 years. More than 68 percent of women aged 65 years and older also reported receiving flu vaccine; however, this percentage ranged from 60.2 percent of women with incomes be-low 100 percent of poverty to 70.5 percent of women with incomes of 200 percent or more of poverty. There are many ways women (and men) can promote health and help prevent disease and dis-ability. Regular physical activity is one of these. In 2008, 14.9 percent of women participated in at least 2.5 hours of moderate intensity physi-cal activity per week or 1.25 hours of vigorous- intensity activity per week, in addition to mus-cle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days per week. Non-Hispanic White women and women with higher incomes were most likely to meet this level of physical activity. Healthy eating habits can contribute to maintaining long-term health and preventing disease. In 20052008, however, only 24.5 percent of women met or exceeded the recom-mended Adequate Intake of calcium, which is critical in reducing the risk of osteoporosis and preventing bone loss. While some behaviors have a positive effect on health, a number of others, such as smok-ing, illicit drug use, and excessive alcohol use can have a negative effect. In 2008, 58.2 per-cent of women reported any alcohol use in the past year, but relatively few women (8.3 per-cent) reported moderate drinking (more than three and up to seven drinks per week) and even fewer (5.0 percent) reported heavy drinking (more than seven drinks per week). In the same year, 11.5 percent of women used illicit drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogens, inhalants, and prescription-type drugs for non-medical purposes. Cigarette, alcohol, and illicit drug use is par- ticularly harmful during pregnancy. The use of tobacco during pregnancy has declined steadi-ly since 1989. Based on data from 22 States and reporting areas, 10.4 percent of pregnant women reported smoking during pregnancy in 2007. This rate was highest among non-His-panic American Indian/Alaska Native women (24.4 percent) and lowest among non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander women (1.5 percent). Women's Health USA 2010 can be an impor- tant tool for emphasizing the importance of preventive care, counseling, and education, and for illustrating disparities in the health status of women from all age groups and racial and eth-nic backgrounds. Health problems can only be remedied if they are recognized. This data book provides information on a range of indicators that can help us track the health behaviors, risk factors, and health care utilization practices of women and men throughout the United States. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 9 PoPUlAtion cHArActeri SticS Population characteristics describe the di- verse social, demographic, and economic fea- tures of the Nation's population. There were more than 154 million females in the United States in 2008, representing slightly more than half of the population. Examining data by demographic factors such as sex, age, and race and ethnicity can serve a number of purposes for policymakers and pro-gram planners. For instance, these comparisons can be used to tailor the development and eval-uation of policies and programs to better serve the needs of women at higher risk for certain conditions. This section presents data on population characteristics that may affect women's physical, social, and mental health. Some of these char-acteristics include the age and racial and ethnic distribution of the population, household com-position, education, income, labor force partici-pation, and participation in Federal programs. The characteristics of women veterans and rural and urban women are also reviewed and analyzed.

Females younger than 35 years of age accounted for 45.6 percent of the female population, those aged 35 -64 years ac- counted for 39.7 percent, and females aged 65 years and older accounted for 14.5 percent. The distribution of the population by sex was fairly even across younger age groups; however, women accounted for a greater percentage of the older population than men. Of those aged 65 years and older, 57.7 percent were women. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS 11 U.S. feMAle PoPUlAtion The growing diversity of the U.S. population is reflected in the racial and ethnic distribu- tion of women across age groups. The younger female population (under 15 years) is signifi-cantly more diverse than the older female popu-lation. In 2008, 55.2 percent of females under 15 years of age were non-Hispanic White, while 22.4 percent of that group were Hispanic. In contrast, among women aged 65 years and older, 79.9 percent were non-Hispanic White and only 6.8 percent were Hispanic. The dis-tribution of the Black population was more consistent across age groups, ranging from 14.1 percent of females under 15 years of age to 9.0 percent of women aged 65 years and older. The racial distribution of females has shifted dramatically since 2000, when non-Hispanic Whites accounted for 60.2 percent of females under 15 years of age and 83.3 percent of those aged 65 years and older. Hispanic females ac-counted for 17.5 percent of those under 15 years and 4.9 percent of those aged 65 and older (data not shown). 1 Evidence indicates that the prevalence of health conditions varies among women of dif-ferent racial and ethnic backgrounds. With the increasing diversity of the U.S. population, these health disparities make culturally-appro-priate, community-driven programs critical to improving the health of the U.S. population. 2*Includes only non-institutionalized population not living in group housing (e.g. dormitories, institutions) .

Nearly 12 percent of women over age 18 were the heads of their households, meaning that they have children or other family members, but no spouse, living with them in a housing unit that they own or rent. Housing units may include houses, apart-ments, groups of rooms, or a single room that is intended to be used as separate living quarters. Women who are heads of households include single mothers, single women with a parent or other close relative living in their home, and women with other household compositions. More than 17 percent of women lived with par-ents or other relatives, 15.0 percent lived alone and 6.9 percent lived with non-relatives. Women in families with no spouse present are more likely than women in married couple families to have incomes below poverty (see \"Women and Poverty\" on the next page). In 2008, non-Hispanic Black women were most likely to be single heads of households with family members present (28.1 percent), while non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander and non-Hispanic White women were least likely (7.9 and 9.0 percent, respectively). Nearly 14 percent of non-Hispanic women of multiple races and 17.0 percent each of Hispanic and non-Hispan-ic American Indian/Alaska Native women were single heads of households that included other family members.

In comparison, 9.6 percent of adult men lived in poverty (data not shown). With regard to race and ethnicity, non-Hispanic White women were least likely to experience poverty (9.4 percent), followed by non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Island - ers (12.0 percent). In contrast, more than 22 percent of Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women lived in poverty.Poverty status varies with age. Among women of each race and ethnicity, those aged 45 -64 years were less likely to experience poverty than those aged 18 -44 and 65 years and older. For instance, 18.0 percent of non-Hispanic Black women aged 45 -64 were living in poverty in 2008, compared to 26.2 percent of non-Hispan - ic Black women aged 18 -44 and 23.9 percent of those aged 65 years and older. Poverty status also varies with educational attainment. Among women aged 25 years and older, 30.4 percent of those without a high school diploma were living in poverty, compared to 13.1 percent of those with a high school di - ploma or equivalent, 9.8 percent of those with some college and 4.2 percent of those with a Bachelor's degree or higher (data not shown). In 2008, women in families\u2014a group of at least two people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together\u2014experienced higher rates of poverty than men in families (10.1 versus 6.9 percent, respectively). Men in families with no spouse present were consider - ably less likely to have household incomes below the poverty level than women in families with no spouse present (11.9 versus 25.7 percent, respectively). 51015202530 Adults in Families, No Spouse PresentAdults in Families, Married CoupleAdults in Families, TotalAdults in Familie s* Living Below the Poverty Level,** by Household Type and Sex, 2008 Source I.4: U.S. Census Bureau, C urrent P opulation Surv ey 25.7Women Aged 18 and Older Living Below the Poverty Level,* by Race/Ethnicity and Age, 2008 Source I.4: U.S. Census Bureau, C urrent P opulation Surv ey Percent of Women *Families are groups of at least two people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together . **Poverty level, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, was $22,025 for a family of four in 2008. *Poverty level, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, was $22,025 for a family of four in 2008 .Percent of Adults 11.9 5.5 5.510.1 6.9Female Male 9.522.7 11.3 9.4 12.022.0 12.7 10.412.828.0 15.320.7 18.0 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS 14 food Sec UritY Food security is defined as having access at all times to enough nutritionally adequate and safe foods to lead a healthy, active lifestyle.4 Food security status is assessed through a series of sur-vey questions such as whether people worried that food would run out before there would be money to buy more; whether an individual or his/her family cut the size of meals or skipped meals because there was not enough money for food; and whether an individual or his/her fam-ily had ever gone a whole day without eating because there was not enough food. In 2008, an estimated 49.1 million peo- ple lived in households that were classified as food-insecure. 1 Households or persons expe- riencing food insecurity may be categorized as experiencing \"low food security\" or \"very low food security\". Low food security generally in-dicates multiple food access issues, while very low food security indicates reduced food intake and disrupted eating patterns due to inadequate resources for food. Periods of low or very low food security may be occasional or episodic, placing the members of a household at greater nutritional risk due to insufficient access to nu-tritionally adequate and safe foods. Overall, 15.4 percent of women experienced household food insecurity in 2008; this varies, however, by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander and non-Hispanic White women were least likely to be food insecure (10.3 and 11.1 percent, respectively), compared to more than one-quarter of Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women. Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native and non-His-panic Black women were also more likely to have very low food security (13.4 and 10.2 per-cent, respectively). Food security status also varies by household composition. While adult men and women living alone had similar rates of food insecu-rity in 2008, female-headed households with no spouse present were more likely than male-headed households with no spouse present to experience food insecurity (37.2 versus 27.6 percent, respectively). Among adults with no spouse present, females were also more likely than males to experience very low food security (13.3 versus 7.2 percent, respectively). 5 10 15 20 25 30Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska NativeNon-Hispanic Asian/ Pacific IslanderHispanicNon-Hispanic BlackNon-Hispanic Food Insecurity , by Race/Ethnicity , 2008 Source I.5: U.S. P opulation Surv ey, Food S ecurity SupplementFood Security Status Among Adults Aged 18 and Older , by Household Composition and Sex, 2008 Source I.6: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic R esearch Service Percent of Women Percent of Adults *Food insecure includes very low and low food security .

The Supple-mental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly the Federal Food Stamp Program, helps low-income individuals and families pur-chase food. In 2008, nearly 14.3 million adults participated in SNAP; of these, more than 9.5 million (66.8 percent) were women. Among participating women, 4.4 million (46.2 per-cent) were in the 18- to 35-year-old age group. Female-headed households with children made up 29.4 percent of households that relied on food stamps, and represented 57.7 percent of food stamp households with children (data not shown). The Special Supplemental Nutrition Pro- gram for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) also plays an important role in serving women and families by providing supplementary nu-trition during pregnancy, the postpartum pe-riod, and while breastfeeding. In 2009, more than three-quarters of all individuals receiv-ing WIC benefits were infants and children (76.1 percent); however, the program also served nearly 2.2 million pregnant women and mothers, representing 23.9 percent of WIC participants.

Although the number of degrees earned by men has also increased, the rate of growth among women has been much faster; therefore, the proportion of degrees earned by women has risen dramatically. In 1969-1970, men earned a majority of every type of post-secondary degree, while in 2006-2007, women earned more than half of all associate's, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees, and half of all first professional degrees. The most significant increase has been in the proportion of first professional degree earners who are women, which jumped from 5.3 percent in 1969-1970 to 50.0 percent in 2006-2007. The total number of women earn-ing their first professional degree in 2006-2007 (45,032) was 24 times greater than in 1969-1970 (1,841). While the sex disparity in degrees awarded has disappeared or reversed, a racial and ethnic disparity remains among women enrolled in schools for health professions. Non-Hispanic White women accounted for more than half of all women enrolled in schools of allopathic and osteopathic medicine, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, and public health, while fewer than 10 percent of women enrolled in these schools were Hispanic. Non-Hispanic Black women were also underrepresented among female stu-dents enrolled in these schools. In comparison, non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander women were overrepresented relative to their represen-tation within the population, accounting for 30.9 percent of female students of optometry, 28.4 percent of female students of dentistry, and 22.9 percent of female pharmacy students. 20 40 60 80 100Public HealthPharmacyOptometryDentistryOsteopathic MedicineAllopathic Medicine Percent of DegreesDegrees Awarded to Women, by Type, 19691970 and 20062007 Source I.9: U.S. Department of Education, D igest of Education S tatisticsWomen in Selected Schools for Health Professions, by Race/Ethnicity , 20082009 Source I.10: Professional osteopathic medicine, pharmacy , podiatry , veterinary medicine, chiropractic, public health, law , and theological professions. **Includes Doctor of Philosophy degree and degrees awarded for fulfilling specialized requirements in professional fields such as education, musical arts, and engineering.

This represents a 28.5 percent increase over the 46.3 percent of women who were in the labor force in 1975. During the same pe-riod, the percentage of men in the labor force decreased slightly (from 77.9 percent to 73.0 percent). Women and men aged 18 and older experi- ence similar rates of unemployment (not em-ployed and actively seeking employment). In 2008, 5.2 percent of women and 5.8 percent of men in the labor force were unemployed. Un-employment among both men and women de-creases as age increases. Among women, those aged 18 -24 years were most likely to experience unemployment (10.0 percent), followed by 25- to 34-year-olds (5.5 percent). Women aged 45-64 and 65 years and older had the lowest proportion of unemployed workers (3.8 and 3.9 percent, respectively). Labor force participation rates among moth- ers vary with the age of their child. Among women with at least one child under 6 years of age, 64.0 percent were in the labor force in 2008. In comparison, more than 77 percent of mothers of older children (aged 6 -17 years) were in the labor force (data not shown). 5 Labor force participation among mothers of children under age 18 also varies by race and ethnicity. Among women with children un-der 6 years of age, non-Hispanic Black women were most likely to be in the labor force (72.7 percent), followed by non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native and non-Hispanic White women (67.3 and 66.3 percent, respectively). Hispanic mothers of children under age 6 were least likely to be in the labor force (52.3 per-cent), followed by non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islanders (62.8 percent). Similarly, nearly 80 percent of non-Hispanic Black and non-His-panic White mothers of older children (aged 6-17 years) were in the labor force in 2008, compared to 70.0 percent of Hispanic and 71.2 percent of non-Hispanic American Indian/Alas-ka Native women (data not shown). 6 Unemployed* Persons Aged 18 and Older , by Age and Sex, 2008** Source I.11: U.S. Census Bureau, C urrent P opulation Surv eyLabor Force Participation* Among Persons Aged 16 and Older , by Sex, 19752008** Source I.11: U.S. Census Bureau, Current P opulation Surv eyPercent of Population Percent of Labor Force 59.5 5.2 5.810.013.1 5.5 6.14.5 4.6 3.8 4.1 3.9 4.573.0 FemaleMale *Includes persons not employed and actively seeking employment. **Includes only non-institutionalized population not living in group housing; based on annual averages.

This number is projected to rise to 1.9 million by 2016. The percentage of veter-ans who are female has increased by more than 25 percent in recent years. In 2000, 6.1 percent of all living veterans were women, while women accounted for 7.7 percent of living veterans in 2008. Women are expected to account for 9.0 percent of the veteran population by 2013. Female veterans are eligible for the same De- partment of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits as male veterans. Comprehensive health services are available to all women veterans including primary care, gynecology and maternity care, mental health care, and specialty health care services. Full-time Women Veterans Program Managers are available at all VA facilities to help women veterans seeking treatment and benefits. For more information, visit the VA Office of Public Health and Environmental Hazards Web site (www.publichealth.va.gov/womenshealth/). Of the 7.8 million veterans who are enrolled in the VA for health care, women account for more than 487,000 enrollees. The proportion of VA enrollees who are women is expected to in-crease to 1 in 7 over the next 10 years. The ma-jority of new female veterans\u2014from Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF)\u2014are more likely to obtain their health care from VA facilities than previous female vet-erans of previous eras. Women are changing the landscape of care in the VA and not by their numbers alone. Women veterans of OEF/OIF are younger than women veterans of the past; more than three-quarters of OEF/OIF women veterans who are enrolled in VA health care are between 16 and 40 years of age, (i.e., of child-bearing age). These women are likely to be balancing work, motherhood, and transition to civilian life and will rely on the VA to provide high-quality, age-appropriate, and woman-specific care.

Residents of rural areas tend to have completed fewer years of education, have public insurance or no health insurance, and live farther from health care resources than their urban counterparts. Rural areas also have fewer physicians and den-tists per capita than urban areas. 7 In 2008, a greater proportion of urban fe- males were aged 18 -34 years than in rural ar- eas, while the proportion of rural females was greater among 35- to 64-year-olds. More than 10 percent of females in urban areas were 18 -24 years of age, compared to 7.5 percent of those in rural areas. Similarly, 13.1 percent of females in urban areas were 25 -34 years of age, com- pared to 11.9 percent of females in rural areas. Among females in rural areas, 12.5 percent were 55-64 years of age and 15.6 percent were aged 45-54 years; this was slightly higher than in ur- ban areas where 11.0 percent of females were 55-64 years and 14.4 percent were 45 -54 years of age. The percentage of women living with house- hold incomes below 100 percent of poverty var-ies by rural/urban residence and age. Women in urban areas were more likely to be living in poverty than their rural counterparts (13.9 ver-sus 11.5 percent, respectively); this was true for most age groups. Among women in both urban and rural areas, those aged 18 -34 years were most likely to have incomes below 100 percent of poverty: 20.7 percent of women aged 18 -34 years in urban areas and 16.3 percent of those in rural areas did so. Women aged 45 -64 years in both urban and rural areas were least likely to be living below the poverty level (9.8 and 8.6 percent, respectively). 11.5U.S. Female Population, by Rural/Urban Residence* and Age, 2008 Source I.1: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Surv eyWomen Aged 18 and Older Living Below the Poverty Level,* by Age and Rural/Urban Residence,** 2008 Source I.1: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Surv ey *U.S. Census Bureau defines urban as all territory , population, and housing units located within an urbanized area or urban cluster which encompass core census blocks/block groups with at least 1,000 people per square mile, and surrounding census blocks with at least 500 people per square mile; all other areas are categorized as rural.*Poverty level, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, was $22,025 for a family of four in 2008.**U.S. Census Bureau defines urban as all territory , population, and housing units located within an urbanized area or urban cluster which encompass core census blocks/block groups with at least 1,000 people per square mile, and surrounding census blocks with at least 500 people per square mile; all other areas are categorized as rural.Rural 51015202530 65 Years and Older 45-64 Years 35-44 TotalRural Urban Years 12.5% 45-54 Years 15.6% WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 20 HeAltH StAtUS Analysis of women's health status enables health professionals and policymakers to de- termine the impact of past and current health interventions and the need for new programs. Studying trends in health status can help to identify new issues as they emerge. In this section, health status indicators re- lated to morbidity, mortality, health behaviors, and maternal health are presented. New top-ics include hearing and vision loss and violence against women. A new subsection on women and aging also provides data on the population characteristics, labor force participation, and household composition of older women, as well as age-specific information on activity limita-tions, osteoporosis, and injury and abuse. The data throughout this section are displayed by sex, age, race and ethnicity, and income, where feasible. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH BEHAVIORS 21 PHYSicAl Acti VitY Regular physical activity promotes health, psychological well-being, and a healthy body weight; enhances independent living; and im-proves one's quality of life. 1 The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans states that for substantial health benefits, women should en-gage in at least 2\u00bd hours per week of moderate-intensity or 1\u00bc hours per week of vigorous-in-tensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both, plus muscle-strengthen-ing activities on at least 2 days per week. Addi-tional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond this amount. 2 In 2008, fewer than 15 percent of women met the recommendations for adequate physi-cal activity. The percentage of women reporting adequate physical activity generally decreases as age increases. Women aged 18 -24 and 25 -44 years were most likely to have engaged in ad-equate physical activity (16.8 and 17.4 percent, respectively). Women aged 65 years and older were least likely to engage in adequate amounts of physical activity (8.4 percent). The proportion of women engaging in the recommended amount of physical activity also varies by race and ethnicity and poverty status. Overall, non-Hispanic White women were more likely to have reported adequate physi-cal activity (16.9 percent) than non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic women (9.7 and 9.6 percent, respectively).Among each of these racial and ethnic groups, the proportion of women engaging in adequate physical activity was highest among those with household incomes of 200 percent or more of poverty. Among Hispanic women, however, almost twice as many women with incomes be-low 100 percent of poverty engaged in adequate physical activity as compared to those with in-comes between 100 -199 percent of poverty (8.2 versus 4.4 percent, respectively). Non-Hispanic White women with incomes below 100 percent of poverty and 100 -199 percent of poverty had comparable rates of adequate physical activity (10.4 and 9.3 percent, respectively).Percent of WomenPercent of WomenWomen Aged 18 and Older Engaging in Adequate* Physical Activity, by Race/Ethnicity** and Poverty Status, 2008 Source II.1: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, National Health I nterview Surv ey *Adequate physical activity is defined as 2.5 hours per week of moderate-intensity activity or 1.25 hours per week of vigorous-intensity activity , or an equivalent combination of both, plus muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days per week.*Adequate physical activity is defined as 2.5 hours per week of moderate-intensity activity or 1.25 hours per week of vigorous-intensity activity , or an equivalent combination of both, plus muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days per week. **The sample of American Indian/Alaska Natives, Asians, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, and persons of multiple races was too small to produce reliable results.

Women with household incomes of 300 per- cent or more of poverty were more likely than women with lower incomes to have met the RDA for folate (35.8 percent), while women with incomes below 100 percent of poverty were least likely to have done so (23.4 percent). Inadequate calcium consumption can lead to lower bone density, bone loss, and increased risk of osteoporosis. The recommended Ad-equate Intake (AI) for calcium is 1,000 mg/day for women aged 19 -50 and 1,200 mg/day for women aged 51 years and older. In 2005 -2008, fewer than one-quarter of women (24.5 per-cent) met or exceeded this recommendation. Non-Hispanic Black women were less likely than women of other races and ethnicities to have met the recommendations for calcium in 2005 -2008 (14.4 percent). Women with incomes of 300 percent or more of poverty were more likely than those with household incomes of less than 100 percent of poverty to have met the recommended AI for calcium (26.8 versus 19.9 percent, respectively).SleeP diSorder S In 20052008, 7.4 percent of adults report- ed that they had ever been told by a health pro- fessional that they had a sleep disorder. Sleep disorders can take many forms and have serious health effects in addition to their effects on pro-ductivity and quality of life. 3 Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by a person's inability to fall or stay asleep, while narcolepsy is character-ized by excessive daytime sleepiness, or \"sleep attacks,\" and sudden muscle weakness. Some sleep disorders affect an individual during sleep. Sleep apnea, which is sometimes confused with snoring, is marked by gasping or snorting and can momentarily disrupt an individual's sleep cycle or constrict the airway. Overall, sleep disorders are slightly more common among men than women (8.0 ver-sus 6.8 percent, respectively), and vary with age among both sexes. Among women, 45- to 64-year-olds were more likely than women of other age groups to have been told by a health professional that they had a sleep disorder (9.3 percent). Women aged 65 years and older were also more likely than those aged 1824 years to have had a sleep disorder (6.4 versus 4.9 per-cent, respectively). Among men, those aged 4564 and 65 years and older were more likely than younger men to have had a sleep disorder (10.9 and 10.5 percent, respectively). Sleep disorders among women also vary by poverty status. Women with household in-comes below 100 percent of poverty are more likely than women with higher incomes to have reported a sleep disorder (10.1 percent). Wom-en with incomes of 100199 percent of poverty were also more likely than women with incomes of 300 percent or more to have ever been told by a health professional that they had a sleep disorder (7.2 versus 5.3 percent, respectively).

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH BEHAVIORS 24 Alco Hol US e According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), alcohol is a central nervous system depressant that, in small amounts, can have a relaxing effect. Although there is some debate over the health benefits of small amounts of alcohol consumed regularly, the negative health effects of excessive alcohol use and abuse are well established. 4 Short-term effects can include increased risk of motor ve-hicle injuries, falls, intimate partner violence, and child abuse. Long-term effects can include pancreatitis, high blood pressure, liver cirrhosis, various cancers, and psychological disorders, including alcohol dependency and depression. In 2008, 63.1 percent of adults aged 18 years and older were current drinkers (had at least one alcoholic drink in the past year; data not shown). This varies, however, by sex. Overall, women were less likely than men to have con-sumed any alcohol in the past year (57.3 versus 69.2 percent, respectively). While more than half of women had con- sumed alcohol in the past year, most of them re-ported infrequent or light drinking. Fewer than 28 percent of women reported light drinking (3 or fewer drinks per week), and 17.1 percent reported infrequent drinking (1 -11 drinks total in the past year). The frequency of alcohol consumption among women varies by age. Women aged 65 and older were most likely not to have consumed alcohol in the past year (62.5 percent), followed by women aged 18 -24 and 45 -64 years (42.0 and 38.9 percent, respectively). Women aged 18-24 years were, however, more likely than women of other ages to be heavy drinkers (8.2 percent), while women aged 25 -44 years were most likely to have reported light drinking (35.1 percent). While the rate of arrests for driving under the influence has decreased slightly from 1999 to 2008 (from 5.4 to 4.8 per 1,000 people, re-spectively, among reporting agencies), the pro-portion of females arrested for this crime has increased during that time. In 2008, females accounted for 21.4 percent of arrests reported for driving under the influence, compared to 15.8 percent in 1999 (data not shown). 5 Current Drinking* Among Adults Aged 18 and Olde r, by Level of Alcohol Consumption** and Sex, 2008 Source II.1: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for H ealth Statistics, National H ealth I nterview Surv eyLevel of Alcohol Consumption* Among Women Aged 18 and Olde r, by Age, 2008 Source II.1: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for H ealth Statistics, National H ealth indicates 1- 11 drinks consumed in the past year; light indicates 3 or fewer drinks per week in the past year; moderate indicates 4 to 7 drinks per week; heavy indicates more than 7 drinks per week.*Had at least 1 drink in the past year . **Infrequent indicates 1- 11 drinks consumed in the past year; light indicates 3 or fewer drinks per week in the past year; moderate indicates 4 to 7 (for females) or 4 to 14 (for males) drinks per week; heavy indicates more than 7 (for females) or more than 14 (for males) drinks per week .1020304050607080 Heavy Moderate Light Infrequent AnyNone Light Heavy Moderate Percent of Women20 40 60 80 10065 Years and Older45-64 Years25-44 34.0 3.228.7 27.5 13.8 13.219.218.413.0 35.1 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH BEHAVIORS 25 ciGArette SMokin G According to the U.S. Surgeon General, smoking damages every organ in the human body. Cigarette smoke contains toxic ingre-dients that prevent red blood cells from car-rying a full load of oxygen, impair genes that control the growth of cells, and bind to the airways of smokers. This contributes to numer-ous chronic illnesses, including several types of cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, reduced bone density and fertility, and premature death. 6 In 2008, women aged 18 and older were more likely than men never to have smoked cigarettes in their lifetime (62.8 versus 52.4 per-cent, respectively). Women were just as likely to be current cigarette smokers as former smokers (18.3 and 18.9 percent, respectively). Similarly, among men, 23.1 percent were current smokers and 24.5 percent were former smokers. The proportion of women who have never smoked cigarettes was greater among those with higher incomes. Women with household incomes of 400 percent or more of poverty or 200-399 percent of poverty (65.1 and 62.7 per- cent, respectively) were more likely than women with household incomes below 100 percent of poverty to have never smoked cigarettes (57.9 percent). Quitting smoking has major and immedi- ate health benefits, including reducing the risk of diseases caused by smoking and improving overall health. 1 In 2008, more than 48 percent of current female smokers aged 18 and older re-ported trying to quit at least once in the past year; however, this varied by age.

In 2008, nearly 13.4 million women aged 18 years and older reported using an illicit drug within the past year, representing 11.5 percent of adult women. In comparison, 17.4 million men, rep-resenting 16.1 percent of the adult male popula-tion, used at least one illicit drug in the past year (data not shown). Past-year illicit drug use was highest among females aged 18 -25 years (29.9 percent), followed by females aged 12 -17 years (18.9 percent); past-year use was lowest among women aged 26 years and older (8.5 percent). Use of all drug types, except inhalants, was highest among females aged 18 -25 years, with 23.7 percent reporting past-year marijuana use and 13.7 percent reporting non-medical use psychotherapeutic drugs (in-cluding prescription pain relievers, tranquiliz-ers, stimulants, and sedatives). Use of inhalants in the past year was highest among females aged 12-17 (4.2 percent), compared to 1.1 percent of 18 - to 25-year-olds and 0.1 percent of those aged 26 years and older.Marijuana was the most commonly used il- licit drug among females of all ages, followed by the non-medical use of psychotherapeutics. Short-term effects of marijuana use can in-clude difficulty thinking and solving problems, memory and learning problems, and distorted perception. Long-term use of psychotherapeu-tic drugs can lead to physical dependence and addiction. In addition, when taken in large doses, stimulant use can lead to compulsivity, paranoia, dangerously high body temperature, and an irregular heartbeat. Prescription drugs commonly used or abused for non-medical pur-poses include opioids, central nervous system depressants, and stimulants. 7 The percentage of women reporting non- medical use of psychotherapeutics varies by race and ethnicity. Among women aged 18 and old-er, non-Hispanic White women were more like-ly than women of other races and ethnicities to report the use of psychotherapeutics in the past year (6.3 percent). Four percent of non-Hispan-ic Black women also reported the non-medical use of psychotherapeutics, as did 3.5 percent of non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native and Hispanic women (data not shown).

A baby girl born in the United States in 2007 could expect to live 80.4 years, 5.0 years longer than a male baby, whose life expectancy would be 75.4 years (data not shown). The differential between male and female life expectancy was greater among Blacks than Whites. Black males born in 2007 could expect to live 70.0 years, 6.8 years fewer than Black females (76.8 years). The difference be-tween White males and females was 4.9 years, with life expectancies at birth of 75.9 and 80.8 years, respectively. White females could expect to live 4.0 years longer than Black females. The lower life expectancy among Blacks may be partly accounted for by higher infant mortality rates, as well as higher mortality rates through-out the lifespan. 8 Life expectancy has increased since 1970 for males and females in both racial groups. Be-tween 1970 and 2007, White males' life expec-tancy increased from 68.0 to 75.9 years (11.6 percent), while White females' life expectancy increased from 75.6 to 80.8 years (6.9 percent). During the same period, the life expectancy for Black males increased from 60.0 to 70.0 years (16.7 percent), while life expectancy increased from 68.3 to 76.8 years (12.4 percent) for Black females.While life expectancy estimates have not his- torically been calculated and reported for the Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Ameri-can Indian/Alaska Native populations, the U.S. Census Bureau has calculated projected life expectancies for these groups. An Ameri-can Indian/Alaska Native female born in 2010 is expected to live 81.5 years, while a male is expected to live 76.6 years. Among Hispanics born in 2010, females are expected to have a life expectancy of 83.7 years and males 78.4 years. Asian females born in that year are ex-pected to live 81.1 years, while life expectancy for Asian males is 76.3 years.

Of these deaths, nearly half were attributable to heart disease and malignant neoplasms (cancer), which were responsible for 25.5 and 22.4 per-cent of deaths, respectively. The next two lead-ing causes of death were cerebrovascular diseases (stroke), which accounted for 6.8 percent of deaths, and chronic lower respiratory disease, which accounted for 5.5 percent. Heart disease was the leading cause of death for women in most racial and ethnic groups; the exceptions were non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women, for whom the leading cause of death was cancer. One of the most no-ticeable differences in leading causes of death by race and ethnicity is that diabetes mellitus was the seventh leading cause of death among non-Hispanic White women, while it was the fourth among all other racial and ethnic groups. Simi-larly, chronic lower respiratory disease was the fourth and fifth leading causes of death among non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Ameri-can Indian/Alaska Native women, respectively, while it ranked seventh among other racial and ethnic groups. Nephritis, or kidney inflama-tion, was the fifth leading cause of death among non-Hispanic Black women, but ranked eighth and ninth among women of other races and ethnicities. Hypertension was the tenth leading cause among non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander women, accounting for 2.0 and 1.6 percent of deaths, respectively (data not shown). Also noteworthy is that non-His-panic American Indian/Alaska Native women experienced a higher proportion of deaths due to unintentional injury (8.2 percent) and liver disease (4.8 percent; seventh leading cause of death) than women of other racial and ethnic groups.

Types of arthritis that primarily af-fect women include lupus arthritis, fibromyal-gia, and rheumatoid arthritis, which is the most serious and disabling type of arthritis. 11In 2008, nearly 23 percent of adults in the United States reported that they had ever been diagnosed with arthritis; this represents more than 51 million adults (data not shown). Ar-thritis was more common among women than men (26.7 versus 18.5 percent, respectively). The proportion of adults with arthritis increases dramatically with age for both sexes. Fewer than 9 percent of women aged 18 -44 years had ever been diagnosed with arthritis, compared to 55.1 percent of women aged 65 -74 years, and 59.8 percent of women aged 75 years and older (data not shown). The proportion of women with arthritis var- ies by race and ethnicity. In 2008, arthritis was most common among non-Hispanic White women (30.2 percent), followed by non-His-panic Black women (23.6 percent). Non-His-panic Asian and Hispanic women were least likely to report having ever been told that they have arthritis (14.1 and 15.9 percent, respec-tively). Other observed differences were not statistically significant. Among women with arthritis in 2008 who reported a specific condition, 11.6 percent re-ported that a health professional had told them they have rheumatoid arthritis, while 8.1 per-cent reported that they have fibromyalgia.

This disorder may be aggravated by allergens, tobacco smoke and other irritants, exercise, poor housing, and infections of the re-spiratory tract. However, by taking certain pre-cautions, persons with asthma may be able to effectively manage this disorder and participate in daily activities. In 2008, women were more likely to have asthma than men (8.8 versus 5.6 percent, re-spectively); this was true for all income levels. Among women, those with household incomes below 100 percent of poverty were most likely to have asthma (13.6 percent). In comparison, 8.4 percent of women with incomes of 200 -399 percent of poverty and 7.2 percent of those with incomes of 400 percent or more of poverty had asthma. A visit to the emergency room due to an asth- ma attack may indicate that asthma is not being effectively controlled or treated. In 2008, 22.1 percent of women with an asthma attack in the past year sought care from an emergency room for their condition. The proportion of women suffering an asthma attack who visit the emer-gency room varies by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic Black women were most likely to have visited an emergency room (38.6 percent), com-pared to 21.4 percent of Hispanic women and 17.7 percent of non-Hispanic White women. Women with asthma can effectively manage their condition by creating an asthma manage-ment plan with their doctor and knowing about and avoiding asthma triggers. 12 Consistent ac- cess to and use of medication can reduce the likelihood of an asthma attack, as well as the use of hospital and emergency room care for people with asthma. 13Percent of AdlutsAdults Aged 18 and Older with Asthma,* by Poverty Status** and Sex, 2008 Source II.1: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for H ealth Statistics, National H ealth I nterview Surv ey *Reported that (1) a health professional has ever told them that they have asthma, and (2) they still hav e asthma.

Lung and bronchus cancer is expected to be the leading cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 71,080 deaths, or 26 percent of all cancer deaths, followed by breast cancer, which will be responsible for 39,840, or 15 percent of deaths. Colon and rectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and ovarian cancer will also be significant causes of cancer deaths among females, accounting for an additional 56,670 deaths combined.Due to the varying survival rates for differ- ent types of cancer, the most common causes of death from cancer are not always the most common types of cancer. For instance, al-though lung and bronchus cancer causes the greatest number of deaths among females, breast cancer is more commonly diagnosed. In 2006, invasive breast cancer occurred among 119.3 per 100,000 females, whereas lung and bronchus cancer occurred in only 55.0 per 100,000. Other types of cancer that are more likely to be diagnosed but are not among the top 10 causes of cancer deaths include thy-roid, melanoma, and cervical cancer, occurring in 16.0, 15.0, and 8.0 per 100,000 females, respectively. Regular screening can help prevent or detect cervical cancer in the early stages. Cervical can-cer screenings are recommended at least every 3 years beginning within 3 years of sexual activ-ity or by age 21. A vaccine for genital human papillomavirus (HPV; the leading cause of cer-vical cancer) was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration in 2006 and is rec-ommended for adolescents and young women aged 9 -26 years. 14 In 2006 -2007, 10 percent Leading Causes of Cancer Deaths Among Females (All Ages), by Site, 2010 Estimates Source II.6: American Cancer S ocietyInvasive Cancer Rates per 100,000 Females (All Ages), by Site and Race/Ethnicity , 2006* Source II.7: Centers for D isease Control Other Nervous SystemLiver rates are age-adjusted. 49.2 33.2 31.7 15.0 16.5 8.6 Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma 15.7 16.2 11.0 14.2 9.4 10.2 Melanoma 15.0 16.9 1.0 3.9 1.1 3.9 Cervix 8.0 7.7 9.9 11.6 7.4 6.3 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS 33 of women aged 18-26 years had been vaccinated for HPV (data not shown).15 There is also a vac- cine available for adolescent and young men to protect against HPV. Despite preventive measures, cervical cancer incidence varies by race and ethnicity. In 2006, Hispanic and Black females were most likely to have been diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer (11.6 and 9.9 per 100,000, respectively), compared to 7.7 per 100,000 White females. In 2000 -2007, Black females were more likely than women of other races and ethnicities to be diagnosed with colon and rectum cancer (54.2 per 100,000). Overall, Black and non-Hispanic White women aged 65 years and older were most likely to have developed this type of cancer (274.5 and 240.5 per 100,000 women, respectively), followed by American Indian/Alaska Native women of the same age group (209.0 per 100,000). Among women of all ages, Hispanic women were least likely to have colon and rectum cancer. Cancer survival rates vary depending on how early the cancer is discovered. For females diag-nosed with lung and bronchus cancer in 1999 - 2006, 18.3 percent could expect to live 5 years or more; however, this varied by race and the stage of the cancer. White women were more likely than Black women to live at least 5 years when the cancer was diagnosed in the localized stage (57.8 versus 49.0 percent, respectively). Fewer than 27 percent of White females and 22.3 percent of Black females could expect the same when the cancer is in the regional stage (spread beyond the primary site).

Complications of diabetes are serious and may include blindness, kidney dam-age, heart disease, stroke, and nervous system disease. The main types of diabetes are Type 1, Type 2, and gestational (diabetes occurring or first recognized during pregnancy). Type 1 dia-betes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, but may occur at any age. Type 2 diabe-tes is the most common; it is often diagnosed among adults, but prevalence has been increas-ing among children and adolescents as well. Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes include obesity, physical inactivity, a family history of the dis-ease, and gestational diabetes. In 2005-2008, 11.8 percent of adults were found to have diabetes (tested positive for the condition on a fasting plasma glucose test, gly-cohemoglobin A1C test, or 2-hour oral glucose test; data not shown). Diabetes prevalence did not vary by sex and generally increased with age for both men and women. Women aged 65 years and older were significantly more likely than younger women to have diabetes. More than 30 percent of women aged 65-74 years and 33.7 percent of those aged 75 years and older had diabetes, compared to 15.7 percent of 55- to 64-year-olds and 8.8 percent of those aged 45-54 years.

In 2005-2008, two-thirds of adults were overweight (66.6 percent; BMI of 25.0 or more); this includes the 33.4 percent of adults who were classified as obese (BMI of 30.0 or more; data not shown).In 2005-2008, men had higher rates of overweight than women overall (71.4 versus 62.1 percent, respectively); this was only true, however, for non-Hispanic Whites and His-panics other than Mexican Americans. Non-Hispanic Black women were more likely than non-Hispanic Black men to be overweight (76.3 versus 69.2 percent, respectively), while overweight among Mexican American women and men were not significantly different (72.3 and 75.3 percent, respectively). Non-Hispanic White women were least likely to be overweight (59.9 percent), compared to Hispanic, Mexican American and non-Hispanic Black women.Overall, 36.1 percent of women aged 25 and older were obese in 2005-2008; this includes 7.4 percent of women who were severely obese (BMI of 40.0 or more). Rates of obesity and se-vere obesity vary with level of education. Among women aged 25 and older, those with a 4-year degree or more were least likely to be obese (24.1 percent), compared to about 40 percent of women who had not attained that level of education.

Among women, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women were most likely to report having had an ulcer (16.7 percent), followed by non-Hispanic White (10.3 percent) and Hispanic women (7.4 percent). Asian women were least likely to report ever having had an ulcer (5.7 percent). In 2007, physicians reported that digestive disorders were the primary diagnosis in 2.9 per - cent of all visits made by women aged 18 and older, accounting for more than 14 million phy - sician visits. The most common digestive disor - der diagnosis was esophageal reflux (21.1 percent of physician's visits for digestive disorders), fol - lowed by abdominal hernia (8.8 percent). Irrita - ble bowel syndrome was the primary diagnosis in 6.6 percent of visits for digestive disorders, while constipation accounted for 5.1 percent of visits.

These disorders include dys-menorrhea (pain associated with menstruation), vulvodynia (unexplained chronic discomfort or pain of the vulva), and chronic pelvic pain (a persistent and severe pain occurring primarily in the lower abdomen for at least 6 months). Some problems can affect the proper func- tioning of the reproductive system and may af-fect a woman's ability to get pregnant. One ex-ample, polycystic ovary syndrome, occurs when immature follicles in the ovaries form together to create a large cyst, preventing mature eggs from being released. Another reproductive dis-order, endometriosis, occurs when the type of tissue that lines the uterus grows elsewhere, such as on the ovaries or other abdominal organs. In 2006 -2008, 4.8 percent of women aged 15-44 years reported that they had ever been told by a health professional that they have endometriosis. Overall, non-Hispanic White women were slightly more likely than Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black women to report hav-ing been diagnosed with endometriosis (5.7 ver-sus 3.7 and 3.4 percent, respectively). If endometriosis is not treated by medication or surgery, or if a woman is affected by other gynecological or reproductive disorders such as ovarian, uterine, or cervical cancer, she may un-dergo a hysterectomy. This is a surgical proce-dure during which the uterus, and in some cases the ovaries and fallopian tubes, is removed. In 2007, the rate of hospital discharges for hyster-ectomies was 33.7 per 10,000 discharges. The procedure was most commonly performed for women aged 45 -54 years (72.2 per 10,000 dis- charges).

Heart disease describes any disorder that prevents the heart from functioning normally. The most common type of heart disease is coronary heart disease, in which the arteries of the heart slowly narrow, reducing blood flow to the heart mus-cle. While the most common symptom of a heart attack is chest pain or discomfort, women are more likely than men to have other symp-toms, such as shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, and back or jaw pain. 18 In 2008, nearly 12 percent of adults reported that a health professional had ever told them they have a heart condition or heart disease and 4.1 percent reported that they had had coronary heart disease (data not shown). While overall, men were more likely than women to have had coronary heart disease (5.4 versus 3.0 percent, respectively), this was only true for non-Hispan-ic Whites (6.7 versus 3.3 percent, respectively). There were no differences between non-Hispan-ic Black and Hispanic men and women. Stroke is a type of cardiovascular disease that affects blood flow to the brain. Warning signs are sudden and can include facial, arm, or leg numbness, especially on one side of the body; severe headache; trouble walking; dizziness; a loss of balance or coordination; or trouble see-ing in one or both eyes. 18 In 2008, 2.9 percent of adults reported that they had ever been diagnosed with a stroke (data not shown). This rate did not vary by sex. Among both men and women, however, the proportion of persons ever having had a stroke increases with age. Among women, those aged 75 and older were significantly more likely to have suffered a stroke (13.0 percent), than women aged 65 -74 or 45 -64 years of age (5.8 and 2.6 percent, respectively). There is evidence that women diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or heart attack, are less likely than men with AMI to receive certain treatments that have been re-ported to improve outcomes. 19 Research also suggests that physicians are less likely to counsel women about modifiable risk factors, such as diet and exercise, and that after a first heart at-tack, women are less likely than men to receive cardiac rehabilitation, though the reasons for these sex disparities are unclear. 20Percent of AdultsAdults Aged 18 and Older with Coronary Heart Disease,* by Race/Ethnicity** and Sex, 2008 Source II.1: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for H ealth Statistics, National H ealth I nterview Surv ey *Reported a health professional had ever told them that they had a stroke.*Reported a health professional had ever told them that they had coronary heart disease. **The sample of American Indian/Alaska Natives, Asians, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, and persons of multiple races was too small to produce reliable results.Adults Aged 18 and Older Who Have Had a Stroke,* by Age and Sex, 2008 Source II.1: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for H ealth Statistics, H Hispanic Non-Hispanic Black Non-Hispanic White Total Percent of Adults 3.0 2.7 0.90.43.35.86.7 2.613.0 13.0 MaleFemale 3691215 75 Years and Older65-74 Years 45-64 Years 18-44 Years Total WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS 39 HiGH Blood PreSSUre High blood pressure is a risk factor for a number of conditions, including heart disease and stroke. It is defined as a systolic blood pres-sure (during heartbeats) of 140 mmHg or high-er, and/or a diastolic blood pressure (between heartbeats) of 90 mmHg or higher. In 2005 - 2008, 16.7 percent of adults were identified with high blood pressure (not including those whose blood pressure is controlled by taking antihypertensive medication; data not shown). This did not vary significantly overall by sex, but did vary with age. Among adults aged 65 years and older, women were more likely than men to have high blood pressure (41.4 versus 32.3 percent, respectively), while men aged 20 -44 years were more likely than women to have high blood pressure (10.0 versus 3.1 percent, respectively). Rates of high blood pressure among women vary by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic Black women were most likely to have high blood pressure (21.3 percent), followed by non-His-panic White women (16.3 percent). Nearly 11 percent of Mexican American and 12.4 percent of other Hispanic women also had high blood pressure (data not shown). Among women identified with high blood pressure in 2005 -2008, 54.5 percent had been previously diagnosed by a health professional and were taking medication for the condi-tion. Nearly 12 percent of women identi-fied with high blood pressure had been previ-ously diagnosed by a health professional, but were not taking medication, and 33.5 percent had never been diagnosed. Diagnosis status among women with high blood pressure varies, however, with race and ethnicity. Mexican American women with uncontrolled high blood pressure were most likely to be undiag-nosed (45.6 percent), while non-Hispanic Black women were most likely to have been diagnosed and taking medication (61.7 percent).Percent of AdultsWomen Aged 20 and Older with Uncontrolled High Blood Pressure,* by Race/Ethnicity** and Diagnosis Status, 20052008 Source II.2: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for H ealth Statistics, National H ealth and Nutrition Examination Surv ey *At the time of examination had a systolic blood pressure (during heartbeats) of 140mmHg or higher , and/or a diastolic blood pressure (between heartbeats) of 90mmHg or higher; does not include persons taking antihypertensive medication whose blood pressure is controlled. **The sample of Asian/Pacific Islanders, American Indian/Alaska Natives, other Hispanics, persons of more than one race, and persons of other races was too small to produce reliable results.

AIDS is diagnosed when HIV has weakened the immune system enough that the body has difficulty fighting infections. 21 While HIV and AIDS disproportionately affect men, a growing number of women are also af-fected; in 2008, an estimated 39.5 new cases of HIV per 100,000 males (data not shown) and 11.5 per 100,000 females aged 13 and older were reported in the United States.Rates of new cases among adolescent and adult females vary dramatically by race and ethnicity. HIV disproportionately affects Black females (56.0 cases per 100,000 females). Non-Hispanic White and Asian females had the low-est rates of new cases of HIV (2.9 and 3.0 cases per 100,000 females, respectively). A newly released study indicates that low-in- come individuals may be at greater risk for HIV. In low-income urban areas, HIV prevalence among heterosexuals was estimated to be 2.4 percent among those with incomes below 100 percent of poverty and 1.2 percent among those with higher incomes. In comparison, national prevalence is .45 percent (data not shown). 22 Early detection of HIV infection is critical in preventing transmission of the virus to oth-ers, and persons aware of their HIV infection can benefit from advances in medicine that may significantly prolong their lives. Despite these individual and societal benefits, a large proportion of people identified as HIV-positive progress rapidly toward an AIDS diagnosis. In 2007, 30% of HIV-positive females received an AIDS diagnosis within 12 months of their HIV diagnosis. Females were just as likely as males to have had an AIDS diagnosis within 12 months of an HIV diagnosis (data not shown).

Rates of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are highest among adolescents and young adults. In 2008, 3,275.8 cases of chlamydia and 636.8 cases of gonorrhea were reported per 100,000 females aged 15 -19 years, compared to 30.9 and 11.2 reported cases per 100,000 women aged 45 -54 years, respectively. Syphilis was also more com - mon among younger women in 2008, occurring among 3.0, 5.1, and 3.9 per 100,000 females aged 15 -19, 20 -24, and 25 -29 years, respective - ly (data not shown).Although chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis can be cured with appropriate antibiotics, left un - treated they can have serious health consequenc - es. Active infections can increase the likelihood of contracting another STI, such as HIV , and un - treated STIs can lead to pelvic inflammatory dis - ease, infertility, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Some STIs cannot be cured with antibiotics. Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2) is an in - fection that causes genital herpes and can lead to blindness, neonatal infections, and increased risk for HIV . Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) can also cause genital herpes, but it is more com - monly associated with sores around the mouth, and recurring symptoms are less common than with HSV-2. Overall, 59.1 percent of women tested positive for HSV-1 and 23.5 percent tested positive for HSV-2 in 2005 -2008. The prevalence of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 varies by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic Black (54.2 percent) and Hispanic women other than Mexican American (40.8 percent) were more likely to have tested positive for HSV-2 than non-Hispanic White and Mexican American women (18.0 and 14.7 percent, respectively). Despite the relatively low proportion of Mexican American women with HSV-2, they were more likely to have tested positive for HSV-1 than non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks (83.8 versus 52.7 and 63.4 percent, respectively).

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS 42 injUrY Injuries can often be controlled through education, engineering and design of safety products, enactment and enforcement of poli-cies and laws, economic incentives, and im-provements in emergency care. Some examples include the design, oversight, and use of child safety seats, seatbelts, and passenger airbags, workplace regulations regarding safety practices, and tax incentives for fitting home pools with fences. In 2008, unintentional falls were the leading cause of nonfatal injury treated in U.S. hospi-tal emergency departments among women of all ages, and rates generally increased with age. Women aged 65 years and older had the highest rate of injury due to unintentional falls (65.0 per 1,000 women), compared to 21.2 per 1,000 women aged 18 -34 and 20.4 per 1,000 women aged 35 -44 years. However, women aged 65 years and older had the lowest rates of each of the other four leading causes of nonfatal injuries, while women aged 18 -34 years had the high- est rates. Unintentional injuries sustained by motor vehicle occupants were the second lead-ing cause of injury among 18- to 34-year-olds (17.5 per 1,000 women), while unintentional overexertion\u2014which can be due to strenuous or repetitive motions such as lifting\u2014was the second leading cause of injury among women aged 35 -44 and 45 -64 years (12.8 and 8.8 per 1,000 women, respectively). In 2008, there were nearly 1.1 million non- fatal occupational injuries and illnesses in the United States. While males have higher overall rates of occupational injury than females (124.8 versus 97.3 per 10,000 workers, respectively; data not shown), the distribution of injuries by sex varies by occupational sector. In 2008, females accounted for 68.2 percent of injuries occurring in management, professional, and related occupations, despite making up only 51.7 percent of the workforce in that sector. Conversely, females were somewhat underrep-resented in injuries to workers in production, transportation, and material moving and farm-ing, fishing, and forestry. 18-34 Years 35-44 Years 45-64 Years 65 Years and Olde rLeading Causes of Nonfatal Injury* Among Women Aged 18 and Older , by Age, 2008 Source II.14: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; Consumer Product S afety Commission, NEISS-AIPFemale W orkforce Representation and Nonfatal Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, by Occupational Sector , 2008 Source I.1, II.15: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Surv ey; U.S. Department of Labor , Bureau of Labor Statistics* % of W orkforce of V ehicle OccupantFallRate per 1,000 Women *All of the leading causes of injury in 2008 were unintentional; estimates provided are for injuries treated in U.S. hospital emergency departments.*Workforce representation statistics are from the U.S. Census Bureau; nonfatal occupational injury statistics are from the U.S. Department of Labor .21.2 17.514.412.7 7.520.4 11.112.8 9.5 5.324.8 7.7 8.87.04.365.0 4.5 5.1 5.5 2.0 Percent of W orkers10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80Construction, Extraction, and MaintenanceFarming, Fishing, and ForestryProduction, Transportation, and Material MovingManagement, Professional, and RelatedServiceSales and Of fice WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS 43 Violence In 2008, an estimated 4.9 million nonfatal violent crimes were committed in the United States. Males were more likely than females to experience nonfatal violent crime victimization overall (21.3 versus 17.3 per 1,000 persons aged 12 and older; data not shown), 23 however, fe- males were more likely to report nonfatal inti-mate partner violence than males (4.3 versus 0.8 per 1,000 persons aged 12 and older). Intimate partner violence (IPV) refers to any physical, sexual, or psychological harm by a cur-rent or former partner or spouse. IPV can take on many forms and vary in frequency and se-verity, ranging from threats of abuse to chronic, severe battering. IPV often is underreported, es-pecially with regard to sexual and psychological violence. According to the National Crime Victimiza- tion Survey, which collects data on victimization based on household and individual surveys, the rate of nonfatal intimate partner violence has decreased dramatically among both males and females since the early 1990's. Among females aged 12 and older, nonfatal IPV has decreased 53 percent from 9.2 per 1,000 females in 1993 to 4.3 per 1,000 females in 2008. In 2007, females with disabilities reported higher rates of violent crime victimization than females without disabilities. Nearly 35 per 1,000 females aged 12 and older with disabili-ties (age-adjusted) experienced violent crime victimization; this was nearly twice the rate of females without disabilities (18.9 per 1,000; data not shown). 24 Among female victims of violent crimes, the relationship of the victim to the offender var-ied by disability status. For instance, more than one-quarter of nonfatal violent crimes commit-ted against females without disabilities were by an intimate partner, compared to 16.1 percent of crimes against females with disabilities. Fe-males with disabilities were more likely to be victims of crimes committed by strangers than females without disabilities (33.5 versus 24.2 percent, respectively), and by non-intimate rela-tives, such as parents, siblings or cousins (12.5 versus 8.7 percent, respectively).

Similarly, 23.0 percent of women reported ever experienc-ing generalized anxiety, compared to 15.3 per-cent of men. Women were also nearly twice as likely as men to report ever having had panic disorder (10.3 versus 5.5 percent, respectively; data not shown). Among women, lifetime prevalence of de- pression and generalized anxiety varies with race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women and non-Hispanic wom-en of multiple races were most likely to report having experienced depression (40.0 percent each), followed by non-Hispanic White women (36.5 percent). Non-Hispanic Asian women were least likely to have experienced depression (17.4 percent). Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Na- tive women were also most likely to report having had generalized anxiety (35.3 percent), followed by non-Hispanic White and non-His-panic women of multiple races (25.8 and 25.3 percent, respectively). Non-Hispanic Asian and non-Hispanic Black women were least likely to report having experienced generalized anxiety (11.6 and 15.7 percent, respectively).Women who have experienced depression and generalized anxiety are more likely than women without those conditions to be limited in their activities - such as walking or climb-ing, relaxing, or attending social events - and to engage in health risk behaviors such as cigarette smoking and heavy alcohol use. More than half of women who reported having had depression or anxiety also reported current activity limita-tions, compared to about 30 percent of women who hadn't experienced these conditions. Simi-larly, more than 27 percent of women who ex-perienced depression and anxiety were current smokers, nearly twice the proportion of women who had never experienced these conditions.

To prevent caries (tooth decay) and periodontal (gum) disease, the American Dental Association recommends brushing at least twice a day and flossing at least once per day, and re-ceiving regular dental checkups. 26 In 2005 -2008, 39.1 percent of women re- ported that their teeth were in excellent or very good condition. This varied, however, by race and ethnicity; fewer than one-quarter of Mexi-can American women (22.5 percent) and 25.4 percent of non-Hispanic Black women reported their teeth to be in excellent or very good condi-tion, compared to 44.5 percent of non-Hispanic White women. Nearly 50 percent of Mexican American women and more than 40 percent of other Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black women reported fair or poor oral health. Dental restoration, such as fillings or crowns, can be used to treat cavities caused by caries. In 2005 -2008, 81.6 percent of women had had at least one tooth restored, while 17.7 percent of women had untreated tooth decay. The likeli-hood of dental restoration among women in-creases as income increases, while prevalence of untreated tooth decay decreases with increasing income. Women with incomes of 300 percent or more of poverty were most likely to have had at least one tooth restored (89.9 percent), com-pared to 72.3 percent of women with incomes of 100 -199 percent of poverty and 68.3 percent of women living in poverty.

Symptoms of severe headache include intense pain, usually on both sides of the head. Migraine, in addition to severe pain on only one side of the head, may be accompanied by neuro-logical symptoms such as distorted vision, nau-sea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light or sound. In 2008, 13.5 percent of adults reported experi-encing a severe headache or migraine in the past 3 months (data not shown). Severe headaches and migraines were more than twice as common among women as men (18.4 versus 8.2 percent, respectively). The proportion of women with se-vere headaches and migraines is highest among the younger age groups and decreases with age. Among women, only 5.7 percent of those aged 65 years and older reported severe headaches or migraines in the past 3 months, compared to more than 23 percent of women aged 18 -24 and 25 -44 years. The percentage of women experiencing se- vere headaches and migraines also varies by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic women of multiple races and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women were most likely to report a severe headache or migraine in the past 3 months (29.0 and 25.6 percent, respec-tively). Non-Hispanic Asian and non-Hispanic Black women were less likely than women of other races and ethnicities to report a severe headache or migraine (11.0 and 16.7 percent, respectively). The proportion of women with severe head- aches or migraines generally decreases as income increases.

Some exam- ples of such disorders include urinary inconti-nence, urinary tract infection, bladder prolapse, urolithiasis (kidney stones), and kidney and bladder cancer. Many of these disorders affect a large number of adult women; annual medi-cal expenditures for urinary incontinence and urinary tract infections among adult women total more than $458 million and $2.5 billion, respectively. These same illnesses accounted for $10.3 million and $1 billion in expenditures, respectively, for adult men. 27Urinary incontinence is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States and is generally more common among women than men. 27 In 2005 -2008, 40.7 percent of women and 12.5 percent of men aged 20 years and older reported that they ever had urinary leakage (data not shown). The prevalence of urinary incontinence among women varies by race and ethnicity, as well as age. More than 43 percent of non-Hispanic White women and 39.0 percent of Mexican American women reported urinary leakage in 2005 -2008, compared to 30.6 per- cent of non-Hispanic Black and 31.6 percent of Hispanic women other than Mexican American (data not shown). Among Mexican American and non-Hispanic Black women, those aged 45-64 years were most likely to report urinary leakage (56.1 and 42.3 percent, respectively). Among non-Hispanic White women, more than 54 percent of those aged 45 -64 and 65 years and older also reported urinary leakage. Among women with urinary leakage, 39.2 percent reported that it occurred less than once a month, while 29.4 percent reported occur-rence a few times a month. More than 16 per-cent of those with urinary leakage reported that it occurred every day or night, and 15.0 percent experienced leakage a few times a week.

The proportion of adults report-ing trouble seeing or hearing varies with sex and age. Women were more likely than men to re-port trouble seeing without an aid (13.0 versus 9.3 percent, respectively), while men were more likely than women to report moderate or a lot of trouble hearing without an aid or being deaf (6.8 versus 4.3 percent, respectively; data not shown).Among women, the proportion of those who have trouble seeing and hearing increases with age. Women aged 65 years and older were most likely to have trouble seeing (19.4 percent) and hearing (13.0 percent), followed by women aged 45 -64 years (15.9 and 3.4 percent, respec- tively). Fewer than 8 percent of women aged 18-34 years had trouble seeing and only 1.1 percent had trouble hearing. Vision and hearing loss caused activity limi- tations among more than 3 million adults in 2008. Persons with activity limitations may have trouble participating in social activities, going shopping, or attending sporting events without assistance. Among all adults with ac-tivity limitations, 3.6 percent reported that the limitation was due to vision problems, while 1.5 percent of those with limitations reported that hearing loss was the reason for the limitation. Overall, 4.4 percent of adults with any activity limitations reported the limitation due to hear-ing or vision loss.

Overall, the crude birth rate was 14.0 births per 1,000 total population (data not shown). Hispanic women continued to have the highest birth rate in 2008 (98.6 per 1,000 women), followed by Asian/Pacific Islander and non-Hispanic Black women (71.4 and 71.2 per 1,000 women, respectively) despite decreases in the number of births within each of those groups. Non-Hispanic White women had the lowest birth rate (59.6 per 1,000 women).With regard to age, overall birth rates were highest among mothers aged 25 -29 years (115.1 live births per 1,000 women), followed by those aged 20 -24 years (103.1 births per 1,000 women). The birth rate for non-His-panic White women was highest among 25- to 29-year-olds (106.2 per 1,000), while the birth rates for non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indian/Alaska Natives were highest among 20- to 24-year-olds (130.8, 170.4, and 115.6 per 1,000 women, respectively). The birth rate among Asian/Pacific Islanders was highest among 30- to 34-year-olds (126.8 per 1,000 women).The proportion of births delivered by cesar- ean section has steadily increased since 1996. Among all births in 2007 (the latest year for which data are available), nearly one-third (31.8 percent) were delivered by cesarean section, a 53 percent increase since 1996, when only about one-fifth of births were delivered in this man-ner (20.7 percent). Additionally, induction of labor has increased more than 135 percent since 1990, from 9.5 percent in 1990 to 22.8 percent in 2007. *Data are preliminary Induction of Labor Among Women, 1990-2007 Source II.19, II.20: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, N ational Center for Health Statistics, National Vital S tatistics S ystemLive Births per 1,000 Women, by Age and Race/Ethnicity , 2008* Source II.18: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, National Vital S tatistics S ystem Total Percent of Live BirthsTotal 68.7 55.9 28.8 40-44 Years 9.9 8.8 8.8 13.7 6.4 15.222.831.8 510152025303540 2007 2004 2002 2000 1998 1996 1994 1992 1990Cesarean Section Induction of Labor WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 HEALTH STATUS - MATERNAL HEALTH 50 BreAStfeedin G Breast milk benefits the health, growth, im- munity, and development of infants, and moth- ers who breastfeed may have a decreased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. 28 Among infants born in 2006, 73.9 percent were reported to have ever been breastfed, representing a signifi-cant increase over the 68.3 percent of infants ever breastfed in 1999. Non-Hispanic Black infants were the least likely to ever be breast-fed (56.5 percent), while Asian/Pacific Islanders and Hispanics were the most likely (83.1 and 82.1 percent, respectively).The American Academy of Pediatrics recom- mends that infants be exclusively breastfed\u2014without supplemental solids or liquids\u2014for the first 6 months of life; however, 33.1 percent of infants born in 2006 were exclusively breastfed through 3 months (data not shown), and 13.6 percent were exclusively breastfed through 6 months. Breastfeeding practices vary consider-ably by a number of factors, including mater-nal age\u2014infants born to mothers aged 30 years and older were most likely to have ever been breastfed (78.0 percent), while infants born to mothers under 20 years of age were least likely (55.6 percent). Slightly more than 69 percent of infants born in 2006 to mothers aged 20 -29 years were ever breastfed. Maternal employment can also affect whether and for how long an infant is breastfed; mothers working full-time are less likely to breastfeed at 6 months than those working part-time or not at all. 29 In 2007 -2008, 51.4 percent of moth- ers with children under 1 year of age were em-ployed, and 70.2 percent of those mothers were employed full-time (data not shown). 30 Infants* Who Are Breastfed, by Race/Ethnicity and Duration, 2006 Source II.21: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National I mmunization Surv eyInfants* Who Are Breastfed, by Maternal Age and Duration, 2006 Source II.21: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Infants73.9 6 Months 55.6 24.0 7.8Exclusively at 6 Months Percent of Infants *Includes only infants born in 2006; data are provisional. **Reported that child was ever breastfed or fed human breastmilk.

Diabetes, both chronic and gestational (developing only during pregnancy), may pose health risks to a woman and her baby. Women with gestational diabe-tes are at increased risk for developing diabetes later in life. 33 In 2007, diabetes of any type during pregnancy occurred at a rate of 44.8 per 1,000 live births. This varied by race and ethnic-ity; Hispanic mothers were more likely to have had diabetes (46.1 per 1,000 live births) than non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks (42.3 and 38.9 per 1,000, respectively). Hypertension during pregnancy can also be either chronic in nature or gestational. Severe hypertension during pregnancy can result in preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, prema-ture birth, placental abruption, and stillbirth. 34 Chronic hypertension was present in 11.0 per 1,000 live births in 2007 and occurred most often among non-Hispanic Black women (21.6 per 1,000). The rate of pregnancy-associated hy-pertension was 38.8 per 1,000 live births and was more common among non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White women (46.2 and 43.6 per 1,000 births) than among Hispanic women (27.5 per 1,000 births).Eclampsia, which involves seizures and is usually preceded by a diagnosis of preeclampsia, is a life-threatening complication of pregnancy. In 2007, eclampsia occurred among 2.8 women per 1,000 live births. Rates of maternal morbidities and risk factors also varied by maternal age. In 2007, women aged 40-54 years were at highest risk of diabetes during pregnancy (100.5 per 1,000 live births), pregnancy-associated hypertension (50.1 per 1,000), chronic hypertension (32.2 per 1,000), and eclampsia (4.3 per 1,000). Women under 20 years of age were least likely to have diabe-tes during pregnancy or chronic hypertension (14.0 and 3.9 per 1,000, respectively). MAtern Al MortAlitY Maternal deaths are those reported on the death certificate to be related to or aggravated by pregnancy or pregnancy management and which occur during or within 42 days after the end of the pregnancy. The maternal mortal-ity rate has declined dramatically since 1950, when the rate was 83.3 deaths per 100,000 live births; however, the maternal mortality rate in 2007 (12.7 per 100,000 live births) was 55 percent higher than the rate reported in 1990 (8.2 per 100,000). According to the National Center for Health Statistics, this increase may largely be due to changes in how pregnancy sta-tus is recorded on death certificates; beginning in 1999, the cause of death was coded accord-ing to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). Other methodological changes in reporting and data processing have been responsible for apparent increases in more recent years, including question formatting and revisions to the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death. 35 In 2007, there were a total of 548 maternal deaths. This does not include 221 deaths of women that were due to complications during pregnancy or childbirth and that occurred after 42 days postpartum or the deaths of pregnant women due to external causes such as uninten-tional injury, homicide, or suicide. In 2007, the maternal mortality rate among non-Hispanic Black women (28.4 per 100,000 live births) was roughly 3 times the rates among non-Hispanic White and Hispanic women (10.5 and 8.9 per 100,000, respectively). The risk of maternal death increases with age for women of all races and ethnicities. In 2007, the maternal mortality rate was highest among women aged 35 years and older (32.3 per 100,000 live births), compared to 7.1 per 100,000 live births to women under 20 years of age and 8.1 per 100,000 live births among women aged 20 -24 years.

More than 16 percent of older women were aged 85 years and older, compared to only 10.4 percent of the older male popula-tion. Similarly, 27.2 percent of older women were 65 -69 years of age, compared to 32.2 per- cent of older men.The distribution of the older female popula- tion varies by race and ethnicity and age. In 2008, non-Hispanic White women accounted for the majority of women aged 65 and older (79.9 percent), followed by Black and Hispanic women (9.0 and 6.8 percent, respectively). As age increases, non-Hispanic White women ac-count for a greater percentage of the female population, while each of the other racial and ethnic groups account for a lower percentage. Non-Hispanic White women accounted for 77.3 percent of women aged 65 -74 years, and 84.8 percent of women aged 85 years and older.

Among older women, labor force participa-tion rates have increased substantially since the 1970's. Between 1976 and 2008, labor force participation among women aged 65 -69 years increased 77.2 percent, from 14.9 to 26.4 per-cent of the civilian, non-institutionalized popu-lation. Labor force participation among wom-en aged 70 years and older has shown an even greater increase (85.4 percent) from 4.6 percent in 1976 to 8.1 percent in 2008. In comparison, men aged 65 -69 years saw a 21.5 percent in- crease in labor force participation from 1976 to 2008, while men aged 70 years and older saw an increase of less than 3 percent. As labor force participation among women has risen over the past 3 decades, the propor-tion of women receiving Social Security retired worker benefits has increased, as well. In 2006, 67.6 percent of women aged 65 -69 years were receiving Social Security benefits for retired workers (as opposed to benefits for spouses of retired workers), an increase of 21.6 percent over the 55.6 percent of women receiving those benefits in 1990. Among women aged 70 years and older, 61.9 percent received retired worker benefits in 2006, compared to 55.9 percent in 1990; this represents an increase of 10.7 percent during that time period. In 2006, 28.1 percent of women aged 65 and older received employer pensions or retire-ment savings. This is virtually unchanged since 1990, when 28.3 percent of women were receiv-ing pensions or retirement savings. During this time, however, the proportion of men receiving retirement income from these sources decreased from 49.2 percent to 43.6 percent, possibly due in part to the decreasing reliance on traditional pension plans (data not shown).

Nearly 9 percent of older women were heads of their household, with no spouse present, meaning that they had children or other family members, but no spouse, living with them in a housing unit that they own or rent. Research has sug-gested that older adults who live alone are more likely to live in poverty, which has numerous implications including increased risk of food in-security, decreased access to health care facilities due to lack of transportation, and inability to pay utility bills. 36 Nearly 12 percent of women aged 65 years and older lived in poverty in 2008, while 29.9 percent had household incomes of 100 -199 percent of poverty. Only one-quarter of older women had incomes of 400 percent or more of poverty. Among women aged 65 and older, in-come decreases as age increases. For instance, women aged 75 years and older were most likely to have incomes of 100 -199 percent of poverty and less than 100 percent of poverty (36.1 and 13.3 percent, respectively).

While women and men of all ages may be limited in their ability to perform some of these activities, the propor-tion of adults with activity limitations increases with age. In 2008, more than 62 percent of adults aged 65 years and older reported having a condition that limited their ability to perform one or more of these common activities (data not shown). Women of this age were more likely than men to report being limited in their activi-ties (68.4 versus 54.4 percent, respectively; data not shown). The most common causes of activity limita- tions among women aged 65 years and older were arthritis (reported by 50.7 percent of wom-en with limitations) and back and neck prob-lems (19.8 percent). Heart problems were the next most common condition, reported among 7.2 percent of women with activity limitations. The percentage of women aged 65 and older reporting at least one activity limitation varies with race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic Black women (71.9 percent) were more likely than Hispanic and non-Hispanic White women (69.6 and 68.2 percent, respectively) to report any activity limitations (data not shown). Dementia is characterized by loss of mem- ory and a decline in cognitive functioning. In 2002, an estimated 3.4 million adults aged 71 years and older had dementia, 2.4 million of whom had Alzheimer's disease (data not shown). Overall, women were more likely than men to have dementia (15.7 versus 11.1 per-cent, respectively); however this varied with age. For both men and women, the prevalence of de-mentia increases as age increases. Women and men aged 90 years and older were most likely to have dementia (34.7 and 44.6 percent, respec-tively) while those aged 71 -79 years were least likely (4.8 and 5.3 percent, respectively).

Each year more than 1.5 million people suf - fer a bone fracture related to osteoporosis, with the most common breaks occurring in the wrist, spine, and hip. Fractures can have devastating consequences. For example, hip fractures are associated with an increased risk of mortality, and nearly 1 in 5 hip fracture patients is admit - ted to a nursing home within a year. 37 In 2007, there were 208,000 hospital discharges due to hip fractures among women aged 18 and older, nearly half of which occurred among women aged 85 and older. Hospital discharge rates due to hip fractures were 271.8 per 10,000 women aged 85 and older, and 83.7 per 10,000 women aged 75 -84 years. Osteoporosis may be prevented and treated by getting the recommended amounts of cal - cium, vitamin D, and regular weight-bearing physical activity (such as walking), and by taking prescription medication when appropriate. Bone density tests are now recommended for women aged 65 and older, men aged 70 and older, any man or woman who suffers a fracture after age 50, and any postmenopausal women who have a risk factor, including low weight, smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and family history of a broken hip. 38 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 HEALTH STATUS - WOMEN AND AGING 59 injUrY And ABUS e The consequences of injuries can often be controlled by either preventing or lessening the impact of an injurious event. This can occur through education, enactment and enforcement of policies and laws, and improvements in emer-gency care. Some examples of efforts to prevent injury and falls among older Americans include home-modification interventions, community-based exercise interventions, and guidelines recommending that physicians ask about falls as part of a patient's routine physical exam. 39 Despite efforts to prevent injuries among older adults, the rate of unintentional injury treated in hospital emergency departments has increased by 12.1 percent among women aged 65 years and older, from 82.9 per 1,000 women in 2001 to 92.9 per 1,000 women in 2008 (data not shown). Falls were the most commonly reported cause of injury reported by older women, followed by being struck by or against an object. Rates of fall-related injuries and being struck by or against an object increase as age increases, while rates of injuries sustained as a motor vehicle occupant and being cut or pierced by an object decrease with age. Women aged 80 years and older were most likely to have suffered a fall-related injury (110.0 per 1,000 women), compared to 49.3 per 1,000 women aged 70 -79 years and 33.3 per 1,000 women aged 65 -69 years. Statistics regarding the criminal victimization and abuse of older adults have not been uni-formly and consistently collected and reported. In 2006, rates of violent crimes for adults aged 65 and older were 2.1 per 1,000 women and 5.0 per 1,000 men. 40 Despite these low rates, it is estimated that 2 -10 percent of older adults may be victims of elder abuse, and that only 1 in 14 incidents are reported to authorities (data not shown). 41 Elder abuse takes many forms, including physical abuse; neglect; emotional or psychological abuse; financial exploitation; and sexual abuse. A survey of State Adult Protective Services agencies found that, in 2004, women were more likely to be victims of reported elder abuse (65.7 percent; 15 states reporting; data not shown), and that the most common forms of substanti-ated abuse for all adults were self-neglect (37.2 percent) and caregiver neglect (20.4 percent; 19 states reporting).

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 60 HeAltH SerViceS UtiliZAtion Availability of and access to quality health care services directly affects all aspects of wom- en's health. For women who have poor health status, disabilities, limited financial resources, lack of insurance, and limited access to a range of health services, preventive treatment and re-habilitation can be critical in preventing disease and improving the quality of women's lives. This section presents data on women's use of health services, including data on women's in-surance coverage, usual source of care, satisfac-tion with care, and use of various services, such as preventive care, HIV testing, hospitalization, and mental health services. A new addition to this section describes the use of home health and hospice care. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION 61 USUA l SoUrce of cAre Women who have a usual source of care (a place they usually go when they are sick, such as a physician's office or health center) are more likely to receive preventive care, 1 to have access to care (as indicated by use of a physician or emergency department, or not delaying seeking care when needed), 2 to receive continuous care, and to have lower rates of hospitalization and lower health care costs. 3 In 2008, 89.6 percent of women reported having a usual source of care (data not shown); this varied, however, by race and ethnicity and health insurance status. Non-Hispanic White women were more likely than any women of other races and eth-nicities to report a usual source of care (91.7 percent), while Hispanic women were least like-ly to do so (80.0 percent). Nearly 90 percent of non-Hispanic Asian women and 88.1 percent of non-Hispanic Black women also reported having a usual source of care. The proportion of women of different races and ethnicities who have a usual source of care varied with health insurance status. Among all women, more than 93 percent of those with pri-vate or public health insurance reported having a usual source of care; this did not vary signifi-cantly by race and ethnicity. Women lacking health insurance were least likely to have a usual source of care (59.0 percent; data not shown). Among women without health insurance, non-Hispanic Whites were more likely than His-panic and non-Hispanic Asian women to have a usual source of care (63.9 versus 51.1 and 49.6 percent, respectively).

Adults aged 18-64 accounted for 38.3 million of those un- insured, representing 20.3 percent of that popu-lation (data not shown). 5 The percentage of peo- ple who are uninsured varies considerably across a number of factors, including age, sex, marital status, race and ethnicity, and education. Among adults in 2008, those aged 18 -24 years were most likely to lack health insurance. Men aged 18 -64 years were more likely than women of the same age to be uninsured. The highest rate of uninsurance occurred among 18- to 24-year-old men (32.3 percent), which was significantly higher than the percentage of women of the same age (24.8 percent). The lowest rate of uninsurance was among adults aged 65 and older, most of whom are eligible for Medicare coverage. The next lowest rate was found among women and men aged 45 -64 (13.7 and 15.2 percent, respectively); the sex disparity in this age group was less pronounced than in the younger age groups. Among women aged 18 -64 years in 2008, 70.5 percent had private insurance, 15.8 per-cent had public insurance, and 18.0 percent were uninsured. This distribution varied by marital status: women who were married and whose spouse was present were most likely to have private insurance coverage (80.4 percent), while women who were widowed or separated from their spouses were least likely (52.5 and 49.7 percent, respectively). Women who were widowed were also more likely than women of other marital statuses to have public insurance (31.7 percent). Women separated from their spouses were most likely to lack insurance (28.7 percent), followed by women who had never married (25.1 percent).

Medicare has four components: Part A covers hospital, skilled nursing, home health, and hospice care; Part B covers physician ser - vices, outpatient services, and durable medical equipment; Part C (Medicare Advantage Plans) allows beneficiaries to purchase coverage through private insurers; and Part D allows for coverage of prescription drugs through private insurers. In 2008, 55.5 percent of Medicare's 45.4 million enrollees were female (data not shown). Among both women and men, those in older age groups accounted for a greater proportion of overall enrollment; however, men had greater representation than women in the younger age groups. For instance, 19.6 percent of male enroll - ees were under 65 years of age, compared to 14.1 percent of female enrollees. In contrast, adults aged 75 years and older accounted for 43.7 per - cent of female enrollees, compared to 34.5 per - cent of male enrollees. Medicaid, jointly funded by Federal and State governments, provides coverage for low-income people and people with disabilities. In 2007, Medicaid covered 59.4 million people includ - ing children; the aged, blind, and disabled; and adults who are eligible for cash assistance pro - grams. Adults aged 19 and older accounted for nearly half of Medicaid enrollees (29.3 million), and women accounted for 69.3 percent of all adult enrollees (data not shown). Women ac - counted for a greater proportion of adult Medic - aid enrollees than men in every age group, most noticeably among 21- to 44-year-olds and those aged 85 years and older (74.5 and 80.1 percent, respectively). Nearly 12.6 million women, representing 61.6 percent of adult female Medicaid enrollees, were of childbearing age in 2007 (data not shown). In order to expand family planning services to those most in need, States are able to apply for a waiver to cover women after childbirth, when their coverage would otherwise expire. As of No - vember 2009, 27 States had secured a waiver for expanded family planning services; 11 of those states limited this benefit to adults aged 19 years or older. 6 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION 64 Women Aged 40 and Older Who Received a Mammogram in the Past 2 Years, by Age, 2008 Source II.1: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for H ealth Statistics, National H ealth I nterview Surv eyReceipt of Cholesterol Screening Among Women Aged 20 and Older , by Race/Ethnicity ,* 20052008 Source II.2: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for H ealth Statistics, National H ealth and N utrition Examination Surv ey Within Past 5 Years More than 5 Years or Never *The sample of Asian/Pacific Islanders, American Indian/Alaska Natives, persons of more than one race, and persons of other races was too small to produce reliable results.

Women aged 60 -69 years were most likely to have received a mammogram in the past 2 years (79.9 percent), followed by women aged 50 -59 years (78.6 percent). Near- ly 70 percent of women aged 70 years and older had also received a mammogram in the past 2 years.

Among women aged 65 years and older, women with family incomes of 200 percent or more of poverty were most likely to have had a flu vaccine (70.6 percent), compared to 61.5 percent of women with incomes below 100 percent of poverty. Pneumonia (pneumococcal) vaccine is rec- ommended for adults aged 65 years and older, people with certain health conditions (such as asthma), and those who smoke cigarettes. In 2008, 62.9 percent of women aged 65 and older reported ever receiving the vaccine. In this age group, 52.8 percent of women with household incomes below 100 percent of poverty received the vaccination, compared to 65.5 percent of women with household incomes of 200 percent or more of poverty. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended to re- duce the spread of hepatitis B, which may result in cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer, liver failure, and even death. 11 In 2008, hepatitis B vacci- nation varied by poverty level, as well as age. Younger women were more likely than women of other ages to have received at least one of the three recommended doses. In 2009, a new strain of the influenza virus, 2009 H1N1, emerged worldwide. The strain appears to affect younger people more severely than the seasonal flu, and can cause severe ill-ness and death in pregnant and postpartum women. 12 The H1N1 vaccine is recommended for pregnant women, people aged 6 months to 24 years, those caring for children under 6 months, and those aged 25 -64 who have cer- tain medical conditions. 13 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION 66 HeAltH cAre ex Pendit UreS In 2007, the majority of health care expenses of both women and men were covered by pub- lic or private health insurance. Among women, one-third of expenses were covered by either Medicare or Medicaid, while 41.6 percent of expenses were covered by private insurance. Although the percentage of expenditures paid through private insurance was similar for both sexes, health care costs of women were more likely than those of men to be paid by Medicaid (7.8 versus 5.3 percent, respectively). In 2007, 90.2 percent of women had at least one health care expenditure, compared to 78.8 percent of men (data not shown). Among adults who had at least one health care expense, the average expenditure per person, including expenses covered by insurance and those paid out-of-pocket, was slightly higher for women ($5,519) than for men ($5,076). However, men's average expenditures exceeded women's for hospital inpatient services ($21,175 versus $13,626, respectively), hospital outpatient ser-vices ($2,549 versus $1,965), and home health services ($5,769 versus $4,912). Women's ex-penditures exceeded men's in the categories of office-based medical services ($1,529 versus $1,411, respectively) and dental services ($694 versus $639). Despite health care expenses by individual category generally being lower for women than men, the overall mean health care expense was greater for women because of the greater percentage of women incurring more expensive services. For instance, 11.1 percent of women had hospital inpatient services, com-pared to 6.6 percent of men, which contributes to a higher mean expenditure overall. Overall per capita health care expenditures have increased substantially in the past decade. In 2007, the annual mean health care expenses for women and men were 68.1 and 77.0 per-cent higher, respectively, than in 1999 (data not shown).

It is recommend-ed that people who meet any of the following criteria be tested at least annually for HIV: those who have injected drugs or steroids, or shared drug use equipment (such as needles); have had unprotected sex with men who have sex with men, anonymous partners, or multiple partners; have exchanged sex for drugs or money; have been diagnosed with hepatitis, tuberculosis, or a sexually transmitted infection; received a blood transfusion between 1978 and 1985; or have had unprotected sex with anyone who meets any of these criteria. 14 In addition, the CDC recommends that all health care providers in-clude HIV testing as part of their patients' rou-tine health care and that all pregnant women be tested during their pregnancy. In 2008, more than 39 percent of adults in the United States had ever been tested for HIV (data not shown). Overall, women were slight-ly more likely than men to have been tested (40.9 versus 37.6 percent, respectively). Within younger age groups (18 -44 years), women were more likely to have been tested than men, while men were more likely to have been tested at older ages (45 years and older).Among women in 2008, non-Hispanic women of multiple races were most likely to have ever been tested (63.7 percent), followed by non-Hispanic Black women (57.0 percent) and Hispanic women (50.6 percent). Non-His-panic White and Asian women were much less likely to have reported ever being tested (36.0 and 36.2 percent, respectively). Among women who had not been tested, 79.3 percent reported that they had not been tested because they thought it was unlikely they had been exposed and 18.8 percent reported that there was no particular reason they had not done so (data not shown).

While women accounted for a greater proportion than men of home health care patients within all age groups, the proportion of hospice patients who were women varied by age group.Among adults under 65 years of age, men accounted for a greater percentage of hospice discharges (including those released from the facility for any reason, such as death, or moved to another facility, residential, or home care) in 2007 than women (53.7 versus 46.3 percent, respectively), while men and women made up about equal proportions of discharges for those aged 65-84 years. In comparison, 65.3 per-cent of hospice patients aged 85 and older were women. This is likely due, at least in part, to the longer life expectancy among women than men. In 2007, the large majority of both home health care patients and patients discharged from hospice care were non-Hispanic White (76.2 and 87.6 percent, respectively; age-adjust-ed). Non-Hispanic Black women accounted for an additional 12.9 percent of home health care patients, while 8.4 percent were Hispanic. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women made up a substantially smaller proportion of hospice care patients discharged in 2007: 5.9 percent were non-Hispanic Black and 5.2 percent were His-panic (data not shown). As the U.S. population ages, there will be a greater reliance on home health care and on those providing care in the home. Research has found that the burden of caregiving may have numerous physical and emotional health consequences including increased likelihood of chronic disease, fatigue and loss of sleep, stress or anxiety, pain, depression, and headaches. 15 As such, the health needs of female caregivers will also need to be addressed.

Women represented two-thirds of users of mental health services, including inpatient and outpatient care and prescription medications. More than 17 mil-lion women reported using prescription medi-cation for treatment of a mental or emotional condition, representing 14.8 percent of women aged 18 and older, almost twice the rate among men (7.5 percent). Outpatient treatment was reported by 8.5 percent of women, and inpa-tient treatment was reported by 1.0 percent of women.In 2008, mental health services were needed, but not received, by an estimated 10.6 mil-lion adults in the United States. Women were twice as likely as men to have an unmet need for mental health treatment or counseling in the past year (6.3 versus 3.0 percent, respectively). Among women, unmet need for treatment var-ies with age; 9.9 percent of women aged 18 -34 years and 8.0 percent of 35- to 49-year-olds re-ported an unmet need. Slightly more than 4 percent of women aged 50 -64 years also report- ed an unmet need for mental health treatment (data not shown). Among women aged 18 -64 years, reasons for not receiving needed mental health treat-ment vary by age. Cost or lack of adequate insurance coverage was the most commonly re-ported reason for not receiving needed services among all age groups. Women aged 35 -49 years with unmet mental health treatment needs were most likely to cite this reason, followed by 48.1 percent of those aged 18 -34 years, and 42.6 percent of 50 - to 64-year-olds. Nearly one- third of women aged 18 -34 and 50 -64 with an unmet treatment need reported that they could handle their problems on their own, compared to 25.2 percent of 35- to 49-year-olds. Fear of stigma\u2014such as concerns about confidentiality, the opinions of others, or the potential effect on employment\u2014and not knowing where to go for services were reported by 23.7 and 20.7 percent, respectively, of 18- to 34-year-olds.

More than 28,000 of those transplants occurred in 2009, when nearly 15,000 people donated organs. Overall distribution of organ donation by sex was nearly even (7,347 male and 7,284 female organ donors), though females were more likely than males to be living donors (60.4 percent of living donors were female), while males accounted for a greater proportion of de-ceased donors (58.9 percent; data not shown). The need for donated organs greatly exceeds their availability, so waiting lists for organs are growing. As of July 23, 2010, there were 107,960 people awaiting a life-saving organ transplant. Females accounted for 41.0 percent of those patients but made up only 37.9 per-cent of those who received a transplant in 2009 (data not shown). Among females waiting for an organ transplant, 43.4 percent were White, 31.4 percent were Black, and 17.0 percent were Hispanic. In 2009, there were 10,774 organ transplants performed for females in the United States. The most commonly transplanted organ was the kidney (6,678 transplanted), followed by the liver (2,158). The kidney and liver were also the most donated organs, with 6,851 females donating kidneys and 2,865 donating liver in 2009.In 2003, the donation community began to work together through the Organ Donation Breakthrough Collaborative and other grass-roots efforts to increase donations. From 2003 to 2009, organ donation by deceased donors increased by an unprecedented 24 percent. One of the challenges of organ donation is obtaining consent from the donor's family or legal surro-gate. Consent rates may vary due to religious beliefs, communication issues between health care providers and grieving families, perceived inequities in the allocation system, lack of knowledge of the wishes of the deceased, and limited understanding of donation and funeral arrangements. 16 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION 72 HEDIS\u00ae* Chlamydia** Screening Among Women Aged 2124 Years, by Payer , 20002008 Source III.6: N ational Committee for Quality AssuranceHEDIS\u00ae* of Prenatal** and Postpartum Care, by Payer , 20032008 Source III.6: N ational Committee for Quality AssurancePercent of WomenPercent of Women *Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set is a registered trademark of NCQA. **The percentage of sexually active females who had at least one test for chlamydia in the past year .*Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set is a registered trademark of NCQA. **The percentage of pregnant women who received a prenatal care visit in either the first trimester or within 42 days of enrollment.

While there are numerous ways to measure quality of care, some common indi-cators used to monitor women's health care in managed care plans include screening for chla-mydia, screening for cervical cancer, and the receipt of timely prenatal and postpartum care. In 2008, women aged 21 -24 years enrolled in Medicaid were more likely than those en-rolled in commercial plans to have had a chla-mydia screening (59.4 versus 43.5 percent, respectively). Since 2000, the percentage of sexually active females screened for chlamydia has increased by 110 percent among those in commercial plans and 56.7 percent among Medicaid participants. Cervical cancer screenings appeared to be more accessible to women with commercial coverage than to those covered by Medicaid. Among women aged 18 -64 years, cervical can- cer screenings were received at least once during the previous 3 years by 80.8 percent of commer-cially-insured women and 66.0 percent of those covered by Medicaid (data not shown). In 2008, women with commercial insur- ance coverage were more likely than those with Medicaid to have received timely prenatal and postpartum care. More than 92 percent of commercially-insured women received prenatal care in either their first trimester or within 42 days of enrollment, compared to 81.9 percent of those covered by Medicaid. Similarly, 82.8 percent of women with commercial cover-age had a postpartum visit between 21 and 56 days after delivery, compared to 62.7 percent of women participating in Medicaid. Since 2003, the percentage of postpartum women receiv-ing timely care increased 13.4 percent among Medicaid participants and 3.1 percent among commercially-insured women. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION 73 SAtiSfAction WitH HeAltH cAre Patients' use of health care is affected by the quality of care; those who are not satisfied with their providers may be less likely to continue with treatment or seek further services. 17 Some aspects of patients' experience of care that may contribute to better outcomes are patients' per-ceptions of how well their doctors communicate with them and individuals' experiences with their health plans. In 2008, 35.0 percent of women were not satisfied with their experiences related to their health plan's customer service, including re-ceiving needed information or help and being treated with courtesy and respect. This varies by education level. Women with at least a 4-year college degree were most likely to be dissatisfied (38.8 percent), followed by women with less than a high school diploma (35.5 percent). In comparison, 31.0 percent of female high school graduates were dissatisfied with aspects of their health plan's customer service. Overall, 15.4 percent of women were dissat- isfied with how well their doctors communicate including perceptions of how carefully doctors listened to them, whether doctors explained things in a way that was easy to understand, and whether doctors spent enough time with them. This varied, however, with race and eth-nicity. Non-Hispanic White women were least likely to be dissatisfied with how well their doc-tors communicate (13.5 percent), followed by non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women (17.8 percent). Nearly one-quarter of non-Hispanic Asian women were dissatisfied with communication with their doctors (24.4 percent), as were 20 percent of Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black women. 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100Non-Hispanic American Indian/ Alaska NativeNon-Hispanic AsianHispanicNon-Hispanic BlackNon-Hispanic WhiteTotal 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 1004-Year Degree or MoreSome CollegeHigh School Communicate,* by Race/Ethnicity , 2008 Source III.7: U.S. Agency for esearch and Quality , National CAHPS Benchmarking Database\u00aeWomen' s Satisfaction with Experiences Related to Health Plan Customer Service,* by Level of Education, 2008 Source III.7: U.S. Agency for H ealthcare R esearch and Quality , National CAHPS Benchmarking Database\u00ae Percent of W omenUnsatisfied Satisfied *Based on questions related to respondents' experiences with their health plan' s customer service in the past 6 months (Medicaid respondents) or 12 months (commercial health plan respondents). *Based on questions related to respondents' experiences with their doctors in the past 6 months (Medicaid respondents) or 12 months (commercial health plan respondents). 15.4 84.6 13.5 86.5 20.0 80.0 24.4 75.6 17.8 82.2 Percent of W omenUnsatisfied Satisfied 20.4 79.6 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2010 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION 74 HrSA ProGrAMS rel Ated to WoMen'S HeAltH The U.S. Department of Health and Hu - man Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is the Federal agency responsible for providing access to high-quality, culturally competent health care for uninsured, underserved, and special needs populations. A systems approach is at the core of HRSA's efforts to promote access to health care. Systems of care provide integrated and coordinated community-based services, including primary and preventive care, and involve the consumer in health care decision-making. HRSA's Office of Women's Health (OWH) addresses women's health issues across the lifes - pan. The Bright Futures for Women's Health and Wellness Initiative (BFWHW) provides materials on topics such as physical activity and healthy eating, emotional wellness, and maternal wellness. Spanish versions of all materials will be completed in 2010. BFWHW tools, data books, and reports can be found on the OWH Web site at www.hrsa.gov/womenshealth. The HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB) provides resources and services for women living with HIV/AIDS through the Ryan White Program, specifically Part D, which addresses the needs of women, infants, children, youth, and their fami - lies. As of the end of 2009, HAB supported sys - tems of care for women living with HIV/AIDS through 98 Part D grantees. In 2009, HAB also funded a new Special Project of National Sig - nificance under Part F of the Ryan White Pro - gram, entitled \"Enhancing Access to and Retention in Quality HIV/AIDS Care for Women of Color.\" Grantees will develop and test innovative, gen - der-specific strategies to keep affected women in continuous care. The Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) funds a national network of over 1,080 grantees through the Health Center Program. In 2008, BPHC-funded health centers offered primary health services to over 6.5 million uninsured Americans for a sliding-scale fee. Women com - prised 59.2 percent of health center users, over 900,000 of whom were aged 25 -29 years. 18 Systems of care models are central to BPHC's work. Many health centers operate within a network which includes several health centers. Some community health center networks pro - vide a system of care for the homeless, includ - ing primary health care, substance abuse treat - ment, mental health services, and oral health care. Public housing primary care programs are located in or near public housing developments and provide comprehensive services to residents. Community health centers often provide trans - lation services, transportation, and patient edu - cation programs in order to ensure access and continuity of care.The Bureau of Health Professions (BHPr) works to address the shortage of health profes - sionals and clinicians, especially in underserved rural and urban areas. Programs such as the Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education Payment Program; the Nurse Education, Prac - tice, and Retention Program; the Health Careers Opportunity Program; and various scholarship programs are designed to promote the recruit - ment, placement, and training of diverse health care professionals. HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) supports the Title V MCH Block Grant. Through a Federal-State partnership, MCHB aims to provide a comprehensive sys - tem of perinatal care for women. In addition, the Healthy Start Program works to improve the quality of and access to local systems of care in order to improve health outcomes for pregnant women and women in the interconceptional pe - riod. The Healthy Start system of care includes: Direct health care services, such as prenatal care, family planning services, well-woman care, and postpartum care; Enabling services, such as translation, trans - portation, home visitation and education; Population-based services such as immuniza - tion and public information; and Infrastructure building services, such as training of women's health care providers.

The Census Bureau uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is poor. If a family's total income is less than that family's thresh- old, then that family and every individual in it is considered to be poor. Examples of 2008 poverty levels were $10,991 for an individual and $22,025 for a family of four. These levels differ from the Federal Poverty Level used to determine eligibility for Federal programs. 4. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service.
