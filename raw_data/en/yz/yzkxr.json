Did you know that chiropractic care in Shelburne VT can help with that? As children grow, they face a lot of physical changes and challenges on their journey to adulthood. That's why providing them with preventative chiropractic care is crucial to ensure proper physical and neurological development. Pediatric development is vital for adult health, and misalignments can occur as early as birth, affecting the body's essential systemic operations. Misalignments can cause nerve dysfunction, making kids susceptible to colic, reflux, constipation, bedwetting, ear infections, allergies, and asthma. Notably, 17% of chiropractic patients are younger than 18, with 8% younger than five. Chiropractic care is an excellent natural, non-invasive remedy for many developmental issues, childhood illnesses, and injuries. Young bodies can repair themselves faster than older ones, however, ongoing chronic conditions that progress into adulthood lead to dysfunction and degeneration. Therefore, it's essential to seek chiropractic care early on to prevent long-term damage to the body. By providing preventative chiropractic care for kids, we can ensure proper development and help them maintain their health into adulthood. How We Treat Kids at Each Stage in Their Development Infant Chiropractic (Newborn to One Year Old) Chiropractic care for babies is vital to their overall health and development. The trauma of the birthing process can cause some babies to experience up to 70 pounds of pressure on their neck and head, leading to potential issues with spinal health. Just as dental checkups teach good dental hygiene once a baby has teeth, spinal hygiene should begin from birth. Studies have shown that a traumatic birth can lead to upper cervical vertebral subluxations in up to 80% of babies under one year old. This trauma is caused by tractional pressure, forceps, vacuum extraction, or c-sections. These subluxations can affect a baby's neurodevelopment and, if left unaddressed, can cause them to miss critical windows of development and milestones resulting in long-term developmental delays. Chiropractic adjustments tailored for babies can help address issues such as trouble latching, breastfeeding difficulties, underdeveloped digestive systems, acid reflux, ear infections, and problems crawling, standing, and walking. Research shows that chiropractic care has played a role in successfully addressing these issues. It's important to identify and correct these issues as early as possible. The earlier care is received, the better the chances are for successful correction and prevention of long-term developmental delays and better overall health. Toddlers and Preschoolers (1-5 years) Chiropractic care is an effective way to optimize nerve function and correct subluxations in children, even toddlers. Toddlers fall 10-20 times a day while learning how to walk, which can impact their developing bodies. By addressing subluxations, chiropractors can help ensure their nervous system functions optimally. As children move into preschool, their speech and social development become increasingly important. Active children are also prone to injuries that may not be visible to the naked eye. This makes it crucial to assess their physical well-being and address any potential issues early on. Regular chiropractic check-ups can help ensure that children thrive physically and mentally. So, if your child is learning to walk or is a busy preschooler, consider visiting the chiropractor. It can be crucial in supporting their healthy development and ensuring they have the best start in life. School Age (5-12 years) Chiropractic care can be an essential part of a child's healthcare plan, especially during the school-age years from 5 to 12 years old. Scoliosis is a common condition among children that can cause curvature of the spine. You need to be aware of warning signs and seek treatment from a chiropractor if necessary. In addition to scoliosis, posture and technology use issues are also important to address during this stage of life. Backpacks can cause strain on a child's back and neck if not worn properly, and excessive screen time can lead to tech neck and other issues. A chiropractor can provide guidance on how to maintain good posture and reduce the risk of developing these conditions. Other signs may indicate a child should visit a chiropractor, such as frequent headaches, trouble sleeping, or recurring pain in the back or neck. It's important to address these issues early to prevent them from becoming more serious. Alarming research has shown that a surprising number of children may have early signs of degenerative joint disease (DJD). As many as 9% of 10-year-olds have shown these signs. This staggering number highlights the importance of early intervention and preventive care, which chiropractors can provide. Finally, it's worth noting that middle schoolers are twice as likely to experience concussions as high schoolers, who are twice as likely to experience concussions as college athletes. Chiropractors can help manage the symptoms of concussions and support the healing process, making them a critical resource for parents and kids. Overall, chiropractic care can play an essential role in maintaining the health and well-being of school-age children. By addressing issues related to posture, technology use, and other potential health concerns, chiropractors can help children develop good habits that will benefit them throughout their lives. Teenagers (12-18 Years) As teenagers go through their developmental years, they often face a variety of challenges, both physical and emotional. One common issue is maintaining good posture and managing the stress associated with the increased use of technology. With the rise of smartphones and laptops, teenagers spend more time hunched over screens, leading to back and neck pain. In addition to tech stress, sports injuries become more common as teenagers engage in more physical activity. In fact, research shows that concussions are twice as common in high school as they are in college. Another surprising issue that chiropractors are seeing more of is the development of \"horns\" on the backs of teenagers' heads. These bony growths are believed to be caused by the constant tilting of the head forward while using smartphones and other devices. Chiropractic care can help teenagers with all of these issues. Regular adjustments can improve posture, reduce pain and stress, and even enhance cognitive function. Teenagers who receive chiropractic care report better sleep, improved mood, and a greater ability to focus and learn. Overall, chiropractic care can be a valuable tool for teenagers as they navigate the challenges of adolescence. Chiropractors can help teenagers thrive and reach their full potential by promoting better physical and emotional health. Common Childhood Conditions We Help in Shelburne VT Breastfeeding Problems Although breastfeeding is instinctive, it doesn't always come without difficulties, leading to worry and frustration by the mother. Restrictions in ranges of motion in the neck, called torticollis, can cause trouble with latching. Chiropractic adjustments to the cervical spine and soft tissue work in the jaw can help with latching and make breastfeeding a more comfortable experience for both mother and child. Reflux Infant reflux is identified by signs such as frequent spit-up, difficulty feeding, and colic-like symptoms. Causes of infant reflux may include nerve interference associated with immature digestive systems, food intolerances, or allergies. Chiropractic care can help relieve reflux by adjusting the spine to improve the function of the nervous system and digestive system. Colic Colic affects one in six newborns and can cause inconsolable crying and fussing. Unfortunately, exhausted parents are often told to \"wait it out,\" which can be difficult and frustrating for both the child and the family. Chiropractic care can help reduce colic symptoms and make the child more comfortable, leaving no need to make your child just \"cry it out.\" Issues with Crawling, Standing, or Other Movements Proper motor skills, muscle strength, and brain growth are essential for healthy physical and neurological development. Tummy time is crucial for this, while crawling is a sign of proper physical and neurological development and helps establish healthy, normal spinal curves. Chiropractors focus on neuromusculoskeletal issues to help make children stronger and improve their overall development. Asthma Asthma affects 5% of children and can be caused by a combination of inherited risks, nerve interference, and environmental allergens that make it difficult for children to breathe properly. Several fundamental neurological and physiological mechanisms that contribute to the development of symptoms have been identified. During an asthmatic attack, the airways in the lungs become inflamed and narrowed, making breathing difficult for the individual. Various factors, including constriction of the smooth muscles in the airway walls, increased mucus production, and inflammation of the airway lining, cause this narrowing. One of the primary neurological mechanisms contributing to these changes is activating the parasympathetic nervous system. This system controls the smooth muscles in the airway walls and increases mucus production. When the parasympathetic nervous system is activated, it can cause the muscles to contract and the airways to narrow, making it more difficult for the individual to breathe. While allergens or irritants can stimulate the release of certain chemicals, such as histamine and leukotrienes, to produce an inflammatory response and constriction of the airways, the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the \"fight or flight\" response, can also play a role in asthma attacks. During an attack, the sympathetic nervous system may be activated, causing the release of adrenaline and other stress hormones that can further constrict the airways and exacerbate symptoms. Overall, asthmatic attacks involve a complex interplay of various neurological and physiological mechanisms in the respiratory system. Chiropractic adjustments can help regulate respiration and lung capacity, which can help children breathe easier. Scoliosis Healthy spinal curvature is essential because it helps evenly distribute body weight, absorb shock, and protect the spinal cord and nerves. Scoliosis is a condition in which the spine curves to the side, causing an asymmetrical appearance of the back. In kids, scoliosis can cause physical and emotional problems, including: - Back pain, muscle stiffness, and fatigue - Reduced mobility and flexibility - Difficulty breathing - Low self-esteem due to changes in appearance Scoliosis affects people of all ages and genders but is most commonly diagnosed during adolescence. Scoliosis can be identified through a physical examination, where the doctor will look for uneven shoulders, a prominent shoulder blade, or a tilted waistline. X-rays may also be taken to confirm the diagnosis and measure the degree of curvature. If left untreated, scoliosis can progress and worsen over time, leading to a higher risk of spinal deformity and disability. Chiropractic care can help address scoliosis by improving spinal alignment and reducing pain and discomfort. Chiropractors use various techniques, such as spinal adjustments, exercises, and stretches, to improve spinal curvature and mobility. If you suspect your child may have scoliosis, a chiropractor trained in pediatric care can thoroughly examine and develop a personalized treatment plan to help manage scoliosis. Care may include gentle chiropractic adjustments, exercises, stretches, and lifestyle modifications to strengthen the muscles and improve flexibility and other non-invasive techniques to restore the spine's natural curves, improve posture, and reduce pain and discomfort. Early detection and treatment of scoliosis are essential to prevent the need for surgery and further complications in severe cases and promote optimal health and well-being. Constipation Constipation affects 5-28% of children and can be exacerbated by kids being afraid to go when they do have the urge. Suppositories and laxatives are not always the answer. The nervous system controls and coordinates the function of all the body's organs, including the digestive system. Any interference or dysfunction in the nervous system can disrupt the normal functioning of the digestive system, leading to constipation and other digestive issues. Chiropractic adjustments aim to correct misalignments in the spine, which can help reduce interference in the nervous system and improve communication between the brain and the body's organs. Some medical conditions, medications, and other lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise, may also play a role in the development of constipation. Along with chiropractic care, we look closely at lifestyle and how that can be reconciled to get the best outcomes. By restoring proper alignment to the spine and other joints and addressing lifestyle issues, chiropractic care may help improve nerve and digestive function, potentially reducing constipation symptoms, and sometimes the relief is instant. Bedwetting Bedwetting affects 10-15% of kids until age six and can bring embarrassment and frustration for children and parents. Most bedwetting happens at night because kids don't recognize they have to urinate, and subluxations prevent the proper signals from relaying. Chiropractic care focuses on improving the lines of communication between the brain and the body to stop bed-wetting for good. Ear Infections Over 80% of kids get an ear infection before age three, causing pain and discomfort from blocked eustachian tubes in the ear. The nervous system controls the muscles that open and close the eustachian tubes, which are small passageways that connect the middle ear to the back of the throat. When these tubes are not functioning properly, it can lead to a buildup of fluid in the middle ear, leading to infection. Signs of ear infections in kids may include: - Pain in the ear(s) - Difficulty hearing or responding to sounds - Fever - Loss of appetite - Trouble sleeping - Irritability or fussiness - Fluid draining from the ear(s) - Dizziness or balance problems - Headache - Ear pulling or rubbing Chiropractic care may help with eustachian drainage by correcting misalignments in the spine that may impede the proper functioning of the nervous system, promoting better drainage of the eustachian tubes, and reducing the risk of ear infections. Chiropractic care can also help to support a healthy immune system, which can help to prevent infections from taking hold. By keeping the nervous and immune systems functioning optimally, chiropractic care may be an effective way to prevent and address ear infections in children. Sports Injuries We help children recover from sports injuries and prevent future injuries by focusing on the body's proper alignment and function. As a child's skeletal system continues to grow until they are 25 years old, sports can put a significant amount of stress on their developing bodies. - Injury Recovery Chiropractors can help with injury recovery by providing a range of non-invasive approaches to reduce pain and inflammation and promote healing. Chiropractic adjustments can effectively restore proper joint function and reduce nerve irritation, speeding up the healing process. They also provide rehabilitation exercises to help with mobility, strength, and flexibility. - Injury Prevention Chiropractors can identify and address any musculoskeletal imbalances or limitations in range of motion that may increase the risk of injury. They also provide guidance on proper body mechanics and posture to reduce the risk of injury during sports activities. Additionally, they can recommend stretches and exercises to improve strength, flexibility, and balance, which can help to prevent injuries from occurring in the first place. At our clinic, we focus on providing safe, effective, and natural care for children with a variety of common childhood conditions. Our goal is to help children reach their full potential and live healthy, happy lives. Frequently Asked Questions Parents may be concerned about the safety of chiropractic care for their children. Chiropractors who work with children are specially trained to use gentle techniques and adjust the approach to the child's age and size. Chiropractic care for children is generally more gentle and more focused on pediatric development of the neuromusculoskeletal system. Chiropractic care may help with a variety of conditions in children, such as colic, ear infections, asthma, bedwetting, scoliosis, and sports injuries. During a chiropractic visit for a child, the chiropractor will typically ask about their health history and any symptoms they are experiencing. The chiropractor will then examine the child's spine and other joints and may use advanced non-invasive computerized scanning technology similar to that used by the astronauts to identify any areas of nerve interference to muscles and organs, postural concerns, and restrictions in ranges of motion. Gentle techniques adjust any areas that are misaligned or not moving properly. Children of any age can receive chiropractic care, from newborns to teenagers. Chiropractors who work with children are trained to use age-appropriate techniques and adjust their treatment to the child's size and developmental stage. Chiropractic care for children can be beneficial in several ways. Here are some potential benefits of chiropractic care for kids: - Improved nervous system function: The nervous system controls all aspects of the body, including growth and development. Chiropractic care can help ensure that the nervous system is functioning optimally, which can help support healthy growth and development. - Improved immune function: The immune system is closely connected to the nervous system. Chiropractic adjustments can help improve nerve function, which in turn can help support a healthy immune system. Improved sleep: Children who receive chiropractic care may experience improved sleep quality and duration. - Improved behavior: Some children with behavioral problems may benefit from chiropractic care. Chiropractic adjustments can help reduce stress and tension, leading to improved behavior. - Improved digestion: Chiropractic adjustments can help improve the function of the digestive system, which can be beneficial for children with digestive problems.
