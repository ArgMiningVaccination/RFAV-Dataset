We emphasize prevention and the self-healing process by focusing on the foundations of health. Practicing medicine in this way improves outcomes while lowering health care costs. Rather than treat symptoms, we work to identify the root cause of your symptoms and develop personalized treatment plans to address them. Two people may be diagnosed with the same disease by name, but the root cause for each individual can be vastly different. Our appointments are also longer than most conventional medical appointments. We spend the time to hear your full story and figure out the sometimes complicated puzzle of what is causing your symptoms. Naturopathic medicine is a form of integrated, holistic medicine that treats the whole person, which includes mind, body, and spirit. The following principles make up the foundation of naturopathic medicine: The Healing Power of Nature \u2014 Vis Medicatrix Naturae Naturopathic medicine recognizes an inherent self-healing process in people that is ordered and intelligent. Naturopathic physicians act to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to facilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process. Identify and Treat the Causes \u2014 Tolle Causam The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. First Do No Harm \u2014 Primum Non Nocere Naturopathic physicians follow three guidelines to avoid harming the patient: utilize methods and medicinal substances that minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat; avoid when possible the harmful suppression of symptoms; and acknowledge, respect, and work with individuals' self-healing process. Doctor as Teacher \u2014 Docere Naturopathic physicians educate their patients and encourage self-responsibility for health. They also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. Treat the Whole Person \u2014 Tolle Totum Naturopathic physicians treat each patient by taking into account individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physicians encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. Prevention \u2014 Preventare Naturopathic physicians emphasize the prevention of disease by assessing risk factors, heredity, and susceptibility to disease, and by making appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness.
