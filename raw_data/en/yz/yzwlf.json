What did the study on vaccinations in Germany reveal? [A poll](https://www.rnd.de/politik/corona-ungeimpfte-umstimmen-forsa-studie-zeigt-massnahmen-haben-keine-auswirkungen-auf-FX7DOX54OVFGVFDXNAJGVPG2IA.html) carried out by the research firm Forsa on behalf of the German Health Ministry found that: - 65% of the unvaccinated have no plans to get their COVID-19 jab in the next two months; - A further 23% would \"probably not\" do so; - Just 2% said they planned to get a vaccine but hadn't been able to yet.

The biggest concern amongst the unvaccinated, at 34%, was what they called the lack of \"long-term\" studies into possible side effects. Hundreds of millions of doses safely administered throughout the world in the last 18 months. Yet Germany still has one of the lowest vaccination rates in Europe, according to [a new study](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-12-04..latest\u00aeion=Europe&facet=none&pickerSort=desc&pickerMetric=gdp_per_capita&Interval=7-day+rolling+average&Relative+to+Population=true&Align+outbreaks=false&country=CHE~AUT~DEU~ESP~FRA~PRT~ITA~BEL~NLD~GBR~IRL~ISL~NOR~SWE~FIN~DNK&Metric=People+vaccinated) by University of Oxford researchers.
