Nature supports us with tons of other incredible plants and herbs that contain different healing properties, many that we may have never even heard of before Here at Clean, we love working with natural healing modalities, including Ayurvedic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine, to support the body in healing itself. Both of these medicines have been used for thousands of years. That's why today, we are so excited to announce our new product, Fortify. Fortify is an herbal immune support blend, delivering a proprietary blend of Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine herbs, including concentrated andrographis and amla for supporting the immune system. Discover andrographis Andrographis (Andrographis paniculata) is a plant that is native to South Asian countries such as India and Sri Lanka. It is an herb used in Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic Medicine for a long time. Also known as \"Indian echinacea,\" andrographis is rich in compounds known as andrographolides. These compounds are thought to have anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antioxidant properties. In a research review published in 2017, scientists found that andrographis appears to be beneficial for relieving symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infections when compared to other herbs, standard care, or a placebo. It was also found to shorten the duration of cough, sore throat, and sick days compared to standard care, however, well-designed clinical trials are needed to further support (1). Studies have been done around the globe to explore use of this botanical. Andrographis supports immune system health at onset by supporting healthy levels of immune cells in the blood. Investigations from the Sichuan Traditional Medicine Research Institution showed andrographis provided acute support for the immune system, particularly in maintaining a normal body temperature (2). Andrographis might work by stimulating the immune system. It might also prevent influenza viruses from binding to cells in the body (3). Talk about being useful in today's world. Amla - a valuable ally for health Amla, commonly known as Indian gooseberry, is arguably the most important medicinal plant used in Ayurvedic Medicine. Various parts of the plant are used to treat a range of diseases, but the most important is the fruit. One fruit contains as much vitamin C as 20 oranges. Indian Gooseberry fruit grows on a tree found wild and cultivated in all parts of India. The fruits were used as a general tonic in the winter, to support healthy brain function in the elderly, for constipation, urinary problems, and occasional anxiety, and they were used topically and internally to support the integrity of the mucosal membranes of the skin, gums, scalp, and gastrointestinal tract. The fruit is used either alone or in combination with other plants to treat many ailments such as common cold and fever; as a liver tonic, anti-inflammatory, to prevent peptic ulcer and dyspepsia, and as a digestive (4). Amla provides antioxidant support, which allows for it to support a healthy inflammatory response. It's high vitamin C content and polyphenols support healthy tissue integrity, normal cellular growth, and a healthy immune response (5). What else is in there? You might note the soy is part of this herbal blend. Normally, we don't add soy to any of our products because of the potential for sensitivity. However, this combination of herbs with soy is traditionally used to support lung health. From a Traditional Chinese Medicine perspective use of soy is associated to the lung meridian; release of exterior heat contributed to by yin deficiency. Our new Fortify, a proprietary herbal preparation, can be taken as needed to support a healthy immune system. Don't forget, optimal immunity comes with optimal gut health. More than 70% of the immune system is located in the gut, so it couldn't be more important in keeping you strong, healthy, and resilient to whatever may come your way. If your gut isn't operating as well as you'd like, try 21 days to good health and optimal immunity!
