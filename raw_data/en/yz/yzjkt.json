How to Find the Right CBD Flower for You It doesn't matter why you need the best smokable CBD flower in your life; it only matters that you know how to find it. Whether you are a first-time CBD user or a veteran looking to change up your routine with smooth-hitting buds from organically grown hemp cannabis sativa plants, finding the perfect option is best done with these tips from our experts well-versed in the ups and downs of buying CBD online. Understand the cannabinoid profile CBD flowers contain much more than the one prominent cannabinoid, and understanding what's in the flower will be essential in best meeting your wellness needs. You can verify the cannabinoid profile of any strain by finding the link to third-party lab reports on a CBD brand's site. For example, those who struggle with daytime stressors should look for premium CBD hemp flower containing high traces of CBD or [CBG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9322760/). These minor cannabinoids provide long-lasting, calming effects with minimal drowsiness so you can stay productive while keeping a cool head. For evening wellness needs, look for CBD strains containing higher doses of CBN, delta 8, or multiple THC derivatives. These minor cannabinoids are preferred for their calming and sleep-supporting effects, perfect for evening relaxation without feeling groggy the next day. Consider your puff preferences Even after figuring out the type of CBD profile you want, you'll still need to consider the smoking experience. For instance, does an earthy flavor profile compliment your evening tea? Is a light-tasting CBD flower better for daytime use? Fortunately, all it takes is some trial and error smoking CBD hemp flower to figure out which type of buds best fits into your routine. Every strain of the hemp cannabis sativa plant tastes and smells different, so find descriptions of each one provided by the CBD brands themselves and consider which ones you find most appealing. When in doubt, shop brands that offer a generous money-back guarantee or a loyalty rewards program. That way, if you try it and don't find it to suit your palate, you can easily return or use reward points from the purchase to save on a different hemp strain. Ask yourself: \"Am I a lazy smoker?\" There is nothing wrong with not wanting to put in the work to get the effects of CBD. After all, it's that very need for convenience that has made the [best CBD brands](https://www.dallasnews.com/branded-content/2023/03/13/best-cbd-brands-of-2023-7-companies-you-can-actually-trust/) ideal for finding fast-acting tinctures, vapes, and edibles for any occasion. If you want the same convenience when it comes to smoking CBD hemp flower, consider pre-rolls, as they are easy to transport and require no maintenance or grinding of buds for use. Pre-rolled CBD joints also provide a more social way to share the benefits of CBD, ideal for those who hate to smoke alone. However, if you enjoy the tactile sensation of grinding, rolling, or packing, then opt for CBD hemp flower products packaged in pouches, jars, or cases. Additionally, if you are a fan of the visual aesthetic common to hemp cannabis flower, whole CBD buds will allow you to admire the terpene-rich structures of your favorite strains. Know how to spot a fake Not all CBD flowers are created equal, and companies can use misleading marketing tactics to make low-quality hemp flower look like the real thing. To ensure you don't waste money or risk your health, only buy CBD flowers from brands that freely offer their independent lab reports for review. Additionally, avoid CBD hemp flower products that fail to showcase the growing, trimming, and curing methods, as these processes are integral to the potency and effectiveness of CBD flower. If a brand doesn't provide this information, chances are they are hiding more side effects than potential benefits and should be avoided for safety reasons. Finally, never smoke CBD hemp flower sprayed with synthetic terpenes or chemicals. These additives are not only dangerous, but they also ruin the effects of CBD and alter the natural taste of hemp flower. Stick to 100% organic smokable CBD hemp flower to ensure you get the full range of benefits without any added risks. Benefits of CBD Flower To understand the benefits of CBD flower, you must first understand the benefit of the major cannabinoid itself. Cannabidiol, more commonly known as CBD, can antagonize endocannabinoid receptors responsible for wellness relief without triggering ones responsible for psychoactive effects. As a result, the most significant benefit of CBD is that it provides a great way to consume cannabis flower without interrupting your ability to perform tasks and without compromising your work or personal life. But what are these non-psychoactive wellness effects, and how are they experienced with the best CBD-rich hemp flower? Comforting pain relief Nothing quite beats CBD flowers in most people's mind when it comes to pain relief. While other CBD products like tinctures or topicals work well at reducing inflammation, nothing quite matches the effects of smoking hemp flower for both acute and chronic pain. The secret to CBD flower's effectiveness in managing painful conditions and creating relaxing comfort lies in its fast-acting delivery method. As an inhalable product, smokable CBD flower works faster than sublingual or topical absorption, delivering potent cannabinoids directly into the bloodstream for rapid relief. With such an incredible saturation rate directly into the muscles, tissues, and organs responsible for pain, it's no wonder why CBD hemp flowers have become a favorite amongst those dealing with back pain, arthritis, migraines, and other uncomfortable physical conditions. Reduced stress & anxiety CBD hemp flowers are also a favorite among those who suffer from stress or anxiety due to their calming properties. It influences the part of your brain responsible for regulating emotions like fear and panic, allowing you to remain in control of your reactions even during high stress. For many, the secret to ultimate stress relief with the choice to smoke CBD hemp flower lies not in the cannabinoid profile per se but in the combined power of CBD and plant terpenes. These aromatic and flavor plant compounds work together with CBD to enhance its effects, all while providing a pleasant smoking experience that relaxes the mind and calms stress. Those who buy [CBD for stress relief](https://www.sfgate.com/market/article/cbd-for-stress-relief-17852110.php) in other forms that take a while to kick in may do well adding hemp CBD flower strains to their acute wellness routine. With a few puffs before or during a stressful episode, users can support the incredible effects of their CBD edibles with better, more direct relief. Sleep support With nearly 30% of adults experiencing short-term or [chronic sleep issues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5353813/), CBD hemp flower may be the perfect answer to getting those much-needed zzz's without relying on sleep medications. Hemp flower is ideal for promoting good sleep because it reduces anxiety and stress and helps your body maintain a healthy internal clock and balance melatonin levels. In other words, it sets up an environment conducive to better sleep while at the same time calming your mind and body for a more restful night. And unlike CBD tinctures or edibles that can have you lying awake at night waiting for the effects to kick in, CBD flowers can be smoked a few minutes before you get into bed since the effects kick in almost immediately. This ensures you get to sleep fast, ensuring a more restful night's sleep that starts right when you need it to. Reduced stomach upset Whether it's nausea from a hangover, something bad you ate last night, or general motion sickness, CBD flowers can be a great way to reduce stomach upset and help you get back on your feet quickly. CBD is known for its anti-emetic or nausea-reducing properties, making it the perfect solution for those looking for natural relief from an upset tummy. And since CBD flower is smokeable, there is no need to worry about the effects of eating something when your stomach is already feeling upset. Just a few puffs and you will start to feel relief in almost no time. Additionally, many people find that CBD flowers for nausea are a great alternative to other products containing natural botanicals, essential oils, and added flavorings that could interact negatively with other prescription medications. How To Use CBD Flower There is a lot to understand about the many ways to use CBD flowers once your order has arrived. From how much to puff to the proper ways to smoke it, knowing how best to incorporate CBD flowers into your life is critical to getting the most out of its natural benefits. Smoking CBD flower The most common and familiar way to use CBD flower is by smoking it. This can be done in many ways, with each having its own range of benefits and drawbacks. The most popular ways to smoke hemp flower include: - Rolling it up in a joint or blunt - Packing a bowl and smoking it in a pipe or bong - Adding CBD flowers to dry herb vaporizers Of the three, joints and blunts are the most popular, with hundreds of ways to roll them up and many options for paper flavor, thickness, and ingredients. For those who love rolled hemp flower strains but hate rolling, many of the best CBD flower brands offer pre-rolls in single or multiple packs that make CBD use hassle-free. Bongs and pipes are another popular option, though their setup and usage process make them less convenient than joints for on-the-go use. That said, hitting a bong or pipe packed full of CBD flowers at home is a great way to relax and really enjoy the taste, smell, and effects of different strains. Dry herb vaporizers are becoming more and more common as cannabinoid science advances to allow for temperature-controlled vaping. This is an incredibly clean and smooth way to enjoy CBD flower, although it does require some higher-end equipment and a bit of patience due to the need to recharge. No matter how you smoke CBD flowers, be sure to grind up the buds to about the consistency of coffee grounds and avoid packing too tightly. The smaller the pieces and the more airflow, the better a CBD flower joint, bowl, or vape will burn. Dosing CBD flower Understanding how much CBD flower to use at a time is a trial-and-error method that can and will vary depending on your wellness needs, schedule, and the potency of your CBD flower. If you are entirely new to the world of [CBD for sleep](https://www.pdxmonthly.com/sponsored/2023/05/best-cbd-for-sleep-5-cbd-sleep-products-that-work-as-a-natural-sleep-aid), pain relief, or stress management, it is best to start small and work your way up. As a general rule of thumb, 1-3 puffs on a joint or bowl are usually enough for many new CBD flower users, while 0.125 grams per session is the sweet spot for those who prefer vaping. Because CBD flower works fast, within a minute or two, you should notice if you need more or less after a few tries. If you are not feeling the effects of CBD flower, try increasing your dose by one puff or 0.025 grams for vaping until you find what works best for you. New CBD users should also know that the peak effects may not kick in until 30-45 minutes after smoking. So, it's a good idea to wait at least that long before deciding if your current dose is enough or if you need more. You can use whatever you figure out as your baseline CBD flower needs and increase or decrease it depending on your specific wellness issues. For example, days that include your regular workout may require more than a few puffs to help soothe aching muscles and support better recovery. Conversely, slightly less before bed might be just enough to get you in the mood for a restful sleep without making you feel so drowsy in the morning that you can't function until lunchtime. Much of the same advice for new CBD users also applies to experienced ones. While you may be used to other forms of CBD, flowers come on much stronger and sometimes more intensely, meaning you may need to adjust your normal dose. Fortunately, experienced CBD users typically have a baseline dose built up in their system; they should be able to figure out the perfect amount of CBD flower to use quickly and without any issues. Furthermore, this heightened tolerance may allow experienced CBD users to begin at a slightly higher starting point than new users. Ensuring a Positive Experience With CBD Flower While knowing how to smoke and dose is excellent for getting the most out of your third-party lab tested CBD flowers, there are some other things to consider when buying and incorporating them into your daily routine. Try to smoke CBD flowers at the same time or frequency every day. This allows your body to build, sustain, and maintain cannabinoid levels that keep your overall well-being in tip-top shape between dosing. Drink plenty of water when smoking CBD flowers, as the interaction of cannabinoids with salivary glands can leave you feeling dry in the mouth. Additionally, staying hydrated will help you avoid any nasty cannabinoid dehydration headaches that some heavier smokers have been known to experience. You may or may not choose to eat before or after smoking CBD flowers. Some swear by the munchies that usually come with smoking other forms of hemp, while others find that their body processes it better without food. Whichever you decide to do, start small and see how your body responds, as individual responses are unique and can vary significantly from person to person. Last but certainly not least, be sure to create a comfortable environment to smoke your CBD flowers. While the cannabinoid is excellent for providing much-needed stress and pain support, it won't be as effective in environments where you feel anxious, scared, or uncomfortable. So, always be sure to step away from the stressor, find a quiet place, and relax for a few minutes as you take in CBD benefits one delicious puff at a time. Types of CBD Flower Strains Hemp flower is available in a wide variety of strains, similar to how THC-rich marijuana comes in multiple varieties. With the thousands of strains and the new ones added daily, it would be impossible to list them all here. But we can provide a general overview of the types of strains you'll run into to help guide you on your journey to the [best CBD flower](https://www.dallasnews.com/branded-content/2023/03/20/best-cbd-flower-in-2023-top-4-products-to-relax-and-unwind/) strains. Sativa CBD hemp flower strains If you like to smoke CBD flower strains in the daytime, then Sativa options are what you should look for, especially Hawaiian Haze or Pineapple Express. Sativa hemp flower contains higher traces of uplifting cannabinoids and lower concentrations of sedating ones, leaving you with a creativity-boosting, cognition-enhancing wellness boost that can help you take on the day with an energized and focused attitude. Indica CBD hemp flower strains If you are looking for a nighttime relaxation option, Indica strains are the way to go, particularly Secret OG and Northern Lights. Indica hemp flower contains a higher concentration of sedating cannabinoids and low traces of uplifting ones, allowing you to take the edge off after a busy day while promoting much-needed rest and relaxation. , Hybrid CBD hemp flower strains The reason you can find so many cannabis strains is that they can be hybridized to create something new. This still happens with CBD flower strains, and there are some excellent options, like T1, which contains uplifting and sedating cannabinoids for the perfect balance between active daytime energy and nighttime relaxation. Potential Side Effects of CBD Flower The only real side effects of smoking CBD flower strains come from products that haven't been third-party lab tested. These hemp flower options can contain contaminants, like [heavy metals and pesticides](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2021.654308/full) that can make you sick if ingested or inhaled. So, always buy from reputable brands committed to quality assurance through third-party lab testing. Additionally, depending on your frequency of use, you may notice a sore throat after smoking, but this is usually the result of too much smoke in your lungs from improperly managing puffs. If this happens frequently, take smaller, slower puffs to avoid feeling overwhelmed by smoke. Overall, cannabidiol and its many forms are considered a safe and natural remedy when used as directed, and CBD flower is no exception. With the right approach to usage, you can get the most out of your smoking experience without creating or exacerbating other conditions. Frequently Asked Questions 1. Which CBD flower strains are best for pain relief? While all CBD flower strains have potential pain-relieving properties, some of the best include those containing 18% or more in CBD concentration. At this level, CB2 intensely stimulates endocannabinoid receptors for full-on relief from acute or chronic pain. 2. Should I buy CBD buds or pre-rolls? That depends on your preference. If you already have the equipment and knowledge to roll your CBD joints, buying buds is likely the better option for you. Pre-rolled joints are popular with newer smokers who don't want to deal with learning how to make them or finding rolling papers. 3. What is the best CBD flower for sleep? Ultimately, that will depend on your sleep needs, but most find that Indica strains with high traces of CBN are best for promoting a restful, restorative night's sleep. Those who have a combination of physical and emotional issues keeping them up at night, a balanced hybrid can also provide comprehensive wellness support for better sleep quality.
