Doctors of Chiropractic (D.C.) are trained as primary health care providers. They use manipulation in order to help patients maintain proper alignment of the body's musculoskeletal structure, primarily of the spine, but also extremity and soft tissue-related issues. These modalities work in conjunction with the body's ability to heal itself. Manipulation is used to restore mobility to joints restricted by tissue, which can cause dysfunction and pain. Beyond acute chiropractic care, we offer comprehensive, preventative, and maintenance care to enhance overall well-being for adults, children, and infants. Techniques While this office primarily practices Diversified Technique, our providers are skilled in different adjusting techniques that cater to your individual needs, such as: - Instrument-Assisted - We have 2 Activator-trained providers - - Drop-Table - Traction Table Consultations Our providers are excited to work with you to achieve overall health and wellness.

She graduated with honors from the University of Jamestown with a BA in Biology in 2001.

After working as an associate chiropractor in Plymouth, MN, she began working for Northwestern as an assistant professor and faculty clinician. She provided patient care and integrated intern education into her practice. Shortly after moving to their Woodwinds clinic in 2007, she took on the additional role as Chief of Staff, allowing her to manage some of the day-to-day tasks and business activities of the clinic. It would eventually prepare her to own her own practice by honing her leadership and management skills. In 2015, Northwestern Health Sciences University decided to divest themselves of the Woodwinds clinic, and Dr. Fitzgerald, along with Dr. Smith, purchased the facility, making the Natural Care Center of Woodbury an independent and solely provider owned clinic starting in September 2015. Dr. Fitzgerald has a general family practice, and enjoys treating all ages, from newborns to elderly individuals.
