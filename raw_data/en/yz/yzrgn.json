She was an honors graduate of the Academy of Math, Science, and Applied Technologies program at Edward W. Clark High School, but she didn't know how to apply her interest in math and science until her grandmother became ill with non-Hodgkins lymphoma. This was when Dr. Rachel personally witnessed how limiting conventional medical resources could be for patients with chronic illnesses. When her grandmother passed away about a year later, Dr. Rachel decided to completely leave behind her world of accounting and finance to embrace a new life in the healthcare industry. Dr. Rachel pursued a medical degree at the Sonoran University of Health Sciences (formerly Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine) in Tempe, Arizona, where she earned her Doctorate of Naturopathic Medicine. After graduation, she moved back home to refine her skills in acupuncture and Eastern herbal medicine at Wongu University of Oriental Medicine, where she received her Master of Science in Oriental Medicine. She also became a national board-certified acupuncturist with the designation Diplomate of Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) and became a NEXT Level Practitioner of the Neuro Emotional Technique (NET). Dr. Rachel works with families to educate and provide various healthcare options that deliver results. She believes in creating a partnership with her patients and encouraging them to take responsibility for promoting their own health, wherever they are in their health journey. She is trained in both primary care and other natural alternative therapies so that each treatment plan can be tailored to each person's individual needs and lifestyle. Some of the therapies Dr. Rachel incorporates, include nutritional counseling, food allergy testing, botanical medicine, nature cure (aka hydrotherapy), homeopathy, applied kinesiology, and acupuncture. Dr. Rachel is a native speaker of Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese Chinese. "}
