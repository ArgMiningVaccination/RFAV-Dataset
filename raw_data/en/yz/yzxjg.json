Also available in some contraceptives but at much higher doses than those used for menopause treatment. See also Estrogen therapy (ET). Estrogen patch. Also Estrogen skin patch or Estrogen transdermal delivery system. A form of estrogen therapy contained in a special patch that is adhered to the skin. The patch technology allows a gradual release of estrogen through the skin directly into the bloodstream where it circulates throughout the entire body (systemically), affecting many different tissues. See also Estrogen. Estrogen plus progestogen therapy (EPT). Also known as combination hormone therapy. Estrogen is the hormone in this duo that provides the most relief for menopause-related symptoms. Progestogen is added to protect the uterus from estrogen stimulation and the increased risk of endometrial cancer. See also Hyperplasia, Progestogen. Estrogen therapy (ET). General term describing a wide range of estrogen types that are available in various systemic and local formulations in oral, skin patch, and vaginal prescription drugs government approved for treating moderate to severe hot flashes and vaginal atrophy, and preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis.

A medication approved for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in premenopausal women. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). A hormone produced by the pituitary gland (located at the base of the brain). In women, FSH stimulates the growth of ovarian follicles (the small cysts that hold the eggs) and the supporting cells responsible for the growth and nurturing of the egg. FSH also stimulates production of estrogen by the ovaries. When estrogen production is low (after menopause), FSH levels will be high. Formication.

High HDL-C helps to lower the risk of heart disease. Homeopathy. An unconventional Western medical system based on the theory that treating a disease with a substance that causes the symptoms of that disease in healthy people would cure similar symptoms in sick people. Hormone. Specifically, a sex hormone (such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone) produced by the ovaries (in women), testes (in men), or adrenal gland (in both women and men) that affects the growth or function of the reproductive organs or the development of secondary sex characteristics.

See Estrogen therapy (ET) and Estrogen plus progestogen therapy (EPT). Hot flash. A condition resulting in a red, flushed face and neck, perspiration, an increased pulse rate, and a rapid heartbeat, often followed by a cold chill. This is the most common menopause-related discomfort, thought to be the result of changes in the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that regulates the body's temperature. If the hypothalamus mistakenly senses that a woman is too warm, it starts a chain of events to cool her down. Blood vessels near the surface of the skin begin to dilate (enlarge), increasing blood flow to the surface in an attempt to dissipate body heat. See also Vasomotor symptoms. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A virus that gradually attacks the immune system. The virus destroys a type of white blood cells called T-helper cells and makes copies of itself inside them. If left untreated, AIDS can develop, by which time HIV has severely damaged the immune system. Human papillomavirus (HPV). The most common sexually transmitted infection (STI). HPV is so common that nearly all sexually active men and women get it at some point in their lives. There is no treatment for HPV, but in most cases, it goes away on its own and does not cause any health problems. When HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts and cancers including cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis, or anus. It can also cause cancer in the back of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils. Nearly all cervical cancers are caused by HPV. Hyperplasia. See Endometrial hyperplasia. Hypertension. Abnormally high blood pressure. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Problems with sexual desire, arousal, orgasmic response, and sexual pain. Between one-third and one-half of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women experience these problems. Hysterectomy. Surgical removal of the uterus. Does not result in menopause, but ends menstrual periods and fertility. The term is often mistakenly used to describe removal of the uterus and both ovaries, which results in surgical menopause. Hysteroscopy. A surgical procedure to examine the inside of the uterus by inserting a thin, lighted tube into the vagina and through the cervix (lower, narrow end of the uterus). Ibandronate. A potent prescription bisphosphonate drug, government approved in the United States (but not Canada) for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. See also Bisphosphonates.

Treated with topical corticosteroids. Lichen sclerosis. A thinning of the vulvar epithelium characterized with sore, burning lesions that can be seen over the entire labia. The lesions can also appear on the thighs, breasts, and shoulders. There is a high association of lichen sclerosis with vulvar cancer. Treated with topical corticosteroids. Leiomyoma. The technical term for a fibroid tumor. See also Fibroids. Local therapy. Drug therapy that has an effect limited to the site of drug application. It is not systemic (does not circulates through the body, affecting many body systems). Examples include most vaginal estrogen drugs. See also Systemic therapy. Luteinizing hormone (LH). Produced by the pituitary gland (located at the base of the brain). In women, causes the dominant follicle to release its egg from the ovary (ovulation). Macular degeneration.

Specialized x-rays of the breast used to detect abnormal growths or changes in the breast tissue. Melatonin. A hormone that is secreted by the brain in response to darkness. Has been linked to the regulation of the body's 24-hour (circadian) rhythm. Available as a nonprescription supplement. Menarche. The first menstrual period. Menopause. The final menstrual period, which can be confirmed after 12 consecutive months without a period. This time marks the permanent end of menstruation and fertility. It is a normal, natural event associated with reduced functioning of the ovaries, resulting in lower levels of ovarian hormones (primarily estrogen). Menopause transition. See Perimenopause. Menorrhagia. Increased menstrual bleeding occurring at regular intervals or bleeding that last more than 7 days. Menses. The menstrual period. Menstrual cycle. The time each month (typically every 4 weeks) when an egg develops in the ovary, the lining of the uterus thickens, and the egg is released into the uterus. If the egg is not fertilized by sperm, the lining of the uterus (with the egg tissue) is shed through menstruation and the cycle begins again. This cycle typically becomes irregular during perimenopause and ends completely at menopause. See also Menstruation. Menstruation. A woman's \"period\"\u2014the discharge of blood, secretions, and tissue debris from the uterus that recurs in nonpregnant women. See also Menstrual cycle. Metabolic syndrome.

An alternative medical system that views disease as a manifestation of alterations in the processes by which the body naturally heals itself. Night sweats. Hot flashes that occur at night that can interfere with sleep, even if they are not strong enough to cause awakening. If heavy perspiration occurs, the condition is called night sweats. Although it is a myth that menopause makes a woman irritable, inadequate sleep causes fatigue, which may lead to irritability. See also Hot flashes. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). A class of drugs that groups together drugs that provide analgesic (pain-killing), antipyretic (fever-reducing), and in higher doses, anti-inflammatory effects. NSAIDs are nonnarcotic and so are used as nonaddictive alternatives to narcotics. The most prominent members of this group of drugs are aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen and are all available over the counter. Obesity.

Considerable research is ongoing to clarify the relationship between hormones and arthritis. See also Rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoporosis. Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a disease of older women in which the bone density of the skeleton has decreased to a point where bone has become fragile and at higher risk for fractures, often with little or no trauma. In most women, bone loss accelerates during the first few years after menopause, which is related to the decline in estrogen levels. Ovarian cancer. An abnormal growth of tissue that develops into a malignant tumor in a woman's ovaries. Ovarian cyst. A sac filled with fluid or a semisolid material that forms on or within one of the ovaries, usually noncancerous. Ovary. The female gonad, one of a pair of reproductive glands in women located in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus. In premenopausal women, the ovaries produce eggs (ova) and hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, or testosterone. During each monthly menstrual cycle, an egg is released from one ovary. The egg travels from the ovary through a fallopian tube to the uterus. The ovaries are the main source of female hormones before menopause. Ovulation. The release of a mature egg cell from the ovary. Pap test. A screening test in which a sample of cells is taken from a woman's cervix and examined under a microscope for precancerous conditions. Named after George N. Papanicolaou.

PID can affect the uterus, ovaries, and/or fallopian tubes, and may cause pain, fever, scarring of the pelvic organs, and infertility. Pelvic ultrasound. A test that uses sound waves to produce an electronic image of the organs of the pelvis. Pelvis. The lower part of the abdomen, located between the hip bones. Perimenopause. A span of time that begins with the onset of menstrual cycle changes and other menopause-related symptoms and extends through menopause (the last menstrual period) to 1 year after menopause. Perimenopause is experienced only with spontaneous (natural) menopause, not induced menopause. Also called the menopause transition. See also Induced menopause. Phytoestrogens. Plant compounds (such as isoflavones) that have a chemical structure similar to that of estrogen and have weak estrogen-like biologic activity. Available in foods (such as soy) and as nonprescription supplements. See also Isoflavones. Placebo.

A condition that occurs at an earlier age than 40 in which many periods in a row are skipped or there are no periods at all, which can be a sign of menopause or of very few eggs left in the ovaries. POI differs from premature menopause, however, in that ovarian activity may resume. Progesterone. A female hormone that is released by the ovaries after ovulation to prepare the lining of the uterus (endometrium) to receive and sustain the fertilized egg and thus permit pregnancy. If pregnancy does not occur, progesterone (and estrogen) levels fall, resulting in menstruation. Available in prescription and nonprescription therapies (as a bioidentical hormone). See also Hormone therapy. Progestin. A class of progestogen compounds synthesized to act like progesterone in the body. Available in oral prescription drugs and combined with estrogen in prescription skin patches. See also Progestogen, Hormone therapy. Progestogen. A naturally occurring or synthetic progestational hormone. There are various progestogen options: progesterone (identical to the hormone produced by the ovaries) and several different progestins (compounds synthesized to act like progesterone). See also Progesterone, Progestin, Hormone therapy. Prolapse. The falling down or slipping of a body part from its usual position (eg, with a uterus or bladder if the ligaments holding it in place become stretched). See also Bladder prolapse. Raloxifene.

The Z-score compares the bone density to similar-age women and is a rough index of the need for extra diagnostic studies, whereas the T-score compares bone density to young women and is a rough index of the need for treatment. See also Bone mineral density, Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Tamoxifen. A prescription selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM) that is approved for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer in high-risk women. Although it has an antiestrogen effect in the breast, it acts like an estrogen in the uterus and may cause the lining to thicken. See also Selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM). Teriperatide. An injectable prescription drug government approved to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis in women at high risk for fracture. See also Parathyroid hormone (PTH), Osteoporosis. Testosterone.
