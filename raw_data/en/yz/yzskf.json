The scientist duo considered drug addiction as much a nutritional deficiency as a physical and mental disease. For 30 days, Libby and Irwin gave patients 25 to 85 grams of vitamin C powder dissolved in milk in divided doses throughout the day. They also stopped using their drug of choice. The results were astonishing. Regardless of the type of drug the patient was using, all patients began to regain mental alertness, visual acuity, and appetite within as little as 12 to 24 hours. After just two or three days, the subjects reported feeling completely normal and had no trouble sleeping. Stone suggested that vitamin C probably works by mimicking morphine and fitting into opiate receptor sites in the brain. One completely incoherent patient received 30,000mg of vitamin C upon arrival. In just 45 minutes, he had regained alertness and was able to hold a normal conversation! Vitamin C Dramatically Diminishes Withdrawl Symptoms Because vitamin C mimics opioids and increases endorphin levels, high-dose vitamin C has also been found to [dramatically reduce withdrawal symptoms](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10836211). What other treatment can claim that?! Additionally, Libby and Stone's protocol includes multivitamins, a mineral tablet, vitamin E, and protein powder to help replenish nutrient deficiencies associated with addiction. After about four to six days, the researchers suggest lowering the dose to 10,000-30,000mg a day as needed, and then tapering down to lower daily doses indefinitely. How Drugs Deflate the Metabolism Although drugs cause the metabolism to work much harder and in some cases much faster, all of the liver's energy is directed toward ridding the body of the immediate threat: toxins. As a result, the liver has little energy left to metabolize food and regulate glucose release, so glucose accumulates and gets stored in fat cells inside the liver. Over time, this causes \" [fatty liver](http://www.cellnutritionals.com/probiotics-insulin-resistance-blood-pressure-fatty-liver/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=addiction2Apr15)\" a condition characterized by flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, fever, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and eventually even glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes.

Fouled Up Brain Chemistry Causes Compulsive Behavior It makes complete sense that obesity and drug addiction often go hand in hand when you consider the biological mechanisms behind the behaviors of overeating or doing drugs. Both behaviors are pleasure-seeking, and both hijack the brain and cause compulsive behavior. Researchers have documented [reduced levels of dopamine receptors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15256343) in the brains of both obese individuals and drug abusers. With fewer sites to receive the mood-boosting neurotransmitter dopamine, compromised individuals may be more prone to searching for excessive pleasure from external stimuli, like sweets and drugs. Dopamine release in the brain is so inextricably bound with pleasure that neuroscientists have dubbed the nucleus accumbens the brain's pleasure center. The key point to keep in mind is that, like sugar addiction, drug and alcohol addiction are characterized by a toxic overload that hijacks not only your brain function, but also your body's most precious detoxification pathways. By replenishing the body with the right nutrients in proven amounts, like high-dose vitamin C, recovery may be right around the corner. "}
