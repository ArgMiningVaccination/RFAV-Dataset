Lyons BSP '75 Vice President for Alumni and Professional Affairs3 to our Alumni and Friends: Thank you for your generous support of Massachusetts College of p harmacy and Health Sciences. Despite the cloud of uncertainty that hung over the national and global economies this past year, i am pleased to report that the state of the College is strong. i hope that you will enjoy this annual review of our achievements and recognition of our charitable supporters. The continuing generosity of donors underlies our core strength. During this past year, the College achieved several crucial fundraising milestones. For the first time, Annual Fund and p arent Fund receipts exceeded $670,000 while gifts from members of Reunion-year classes topped $100,000. The average gift amount per donor to the Annual Fund and p arent Fund rose to more than $355, and the number of donors who contributed to MCp HS for at least the last two years grew by more than 50 percent. p erhaps most impressively, nearly 2,000 donors made at least one gift to the MCp HS Annual Fund or p arent Fund during Fiscal Year 2009, a growth of more than 11 percent from the previous year. our fundraising success mirrors many of our operational achievements. Last January, we opened the spectacular, six-story Richard e. Griffin Academic Center in Boston. This state-of-the-art facility provides vital academic space for our n ursing, p hysician Assistant and Radiologic Sciences programs, as well as new office space for faculty and staff members. Just last month in Worcester, we opened the newly renovated Ahmad H. Alhaddad building, a 30,000-square foot, $10-million facility that will support the expansion of our accelerated Worcester/Manchester Doctor of p harmacy program over the next three years. i n Manchester, n.H., we will soon put the finishing touches on a newly renovated Student Activity and Academic Center that features new classrooms, study rooms, a student lounge, multi-use conference rooms and a student government office. Wherever you look, things are happening at MCp HS. We now boast an enrollment that exceeds 4,000 students on three campuses. Consistent with national trends, our n ursing, p hysician Assistant, Radiologic Sciences and Dental Hy- giene programs are all growing; we continue to introduce new degree programs, including a Master of Science in n ursing and a Master of Community o ral Health, in response to growing demand for professionals with advanced degrees in these disciplines. MCp HS is also going global, as we enhance the opportunities for student travel and study abroad and continue to forge new collaborative relationships with internationally renowned peer academic institutions. Your generosity has played a key role in contributing to the College's success; our students and faculty are grateful. Thank you for investing in the programs and services that underlie our standing as a leader among institutions of higher learning devoted to the education of health care professionals. Sincerely, Charles F . Monahan Jr. BSp '62, '98 (Hon.) president Repo Rt on Givin G July 1, 2008-June 30, 20094 Building and Renovations 5 As the need for qualified health care practitioners increases, and enrollment on all three campuses grows, the College's strategic plan for expansion is taking shape.BoSton The Richard e. Griffin Academic Center, new home to schools of nursing, p hysician Assistant Studies and Radiologic Sciences, made its dramatic debut at 670 Huntington Avenue. The six-story building, a five-minute walk from the main campus on Longwood Avenue, provides new classrooms and modern offices for the fast-growing health sciences programs. MAnCHeSteR, neW HAM pSHiRe The College purchased a 2.5 acre downtown parcel adjacent to the Joseph F . and Frances p . Brant Academic and Student Center at 1260 elm Street, adding 69,000-square feet of space and 154 parking spaces. While current tenants will remain for the near future, renovation work has progressed on one building, thereby transforming 6,000 square feet for use as a Student Activity and Academic Center that will include two new, high-technology classrooms (with a capacity of 65 students for each room), four study rooms, a multi-use conference room, student lounge and office for use by members of the Student Government Association. The College's only n ew Hampshire campus offers accelerated programs in p harmacy, physician Assistant Studies and n ursing. Wo RCeSteR The three-story, 30,000-square-foot Ahmad H. Alhaddad Building at 40 Foster Street, which opened this fall, will accommodate the significant enrollment increase in the accelerated pharmD program, the largest program at MCp HS-Worcester, over the next three years. The campus also offers fast-track programs in nursing and p hysician Assistant Studies. Last year, more than 3,000 applications were received from prospective p harmD students-with only 150 slots available for the entering class of students.

Following in their parents' footsteps, their twin sons, Gregory PharmD '10, and Paul BSN '12, are students at MCPHS. \"We have been fortunate to see the College's continued growth and dedication to students as well as the pharmacy profession through the eyes and experiences of our son, Gregory, and his friends,\" said Christine. Gregory, a sixth-year PharmD student, is completing his rota - tions, and his twin brother, Paul, an emergency medical techni - cian, was recently accepted to the MCPHS Nursing program. But even before their sons became MCPHS students, the Mainella's were consistent, loyal donors to MCPHS, a place that holds special meaning in both their personal and professional lives. \"The education and life experi - ences we gained as students gave us the tools to reach our career goals and aspirations,\" said Vinnie, Vice President of Phar - macy for Price Chopper Super - markets. He began his career as a nursing home consultant, before becoming a retail pharmacist at Brooks Drug. He moved into pharmacy management with Stop & Shop Pharmacy in 1983. From 1986 to 1998 he held many administrative positions. He joined Price Chopper Pharmacy as director of pharmacy in 1998, and was named Vice President of Pharmacy in 2003. Vinnie is also President of the New York Chain Drug Association. After several years in retail pharmacy and management, Christine was a Drug Control Agent for the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protec- tion, where her responsibilities in - cluded inspecting drug location sites, performing controlled-sub - stance audits and investigating prescription errors and diversion of controlled substances by health care professionals. Today she is a staff pharmacist for Price Chopper. Vinnie notes that his education helped to instill the \"confidence to guide and help my patients regardless of their health challenges... the confidence to turn any challenge into an op - portunity.\" For Christine, one of her proudest MCPHS memories was completing \"the big four in the fourth year\u2014taking Me - dicinal Chemistry, Pharmacology, Dispensing and Therapeutics...If you could handle that, you could handle anything. \"As Vice President of Pharmacy at Price Chopper, I have had the opportunity to work with many schools of pharmacy,\" said Vinnie. \"I am convinced that they pale in comparison to the total experi - ence pharmacy students walk away with when they graduate from MCPHS.\" Christine (Dumais) Mainella BSP '81 and Vincent Mainella BSP '80 with sons Gregory PharmD '10 and Paul BSN '12 \"The education and life experiences we gained as students gave us the tools to reach our career goals and aspirations,\" \u2014vincent Mainella BSp '80 Alumni ProfileRepo Rt on Givin G July 1, 2008-June 30, 200910 C.

Social events for the academic year kicked off on a big journey as 95 alumni and friends embarked on the Heart of China tour, the most successful of all travel expeditions yet sponsored by the College. They watched president Charles F . Monahan Jr. BS p '62 accept a visiting professorship at Hangzhou normal University during the annual Confer - ence on east and West Health Care (the College estab - lished a faculty and student exchange program with the university in 2007) and took in the sights of Beijing, Xi'an, Hangzhou and Shanghai\u2014including the Great Wall, the olympic Stadium, terracotta Warriors, and the oriental pearl tower. Madeleine (Guay) Ferro DH '68 Forsyth, who brought her husband, John, sister, elaine Guay, and sister-in-law Janet Ferro, said the sights were spectacular.\"We loved our experience with MC pHS,\" said Ms. Ferro. \" it couldn't have been a better fit. The trip was very, very well done... Between the place and the people, the trip was a joy.\" in March, the 69th annual Reed Conference, a day-long continuing education program for alumni and pharmacists, once again shattered attendance records. More than 1,000 pharmacy professionals converged on Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass. \"The Reed has become a signature event,\" said Dennis G. Lyons BS p '75, vice president for Alumni and professional Affairs. \" in the past five years, it has grown annually by 20 percent.\" next year, on the Reed's 70th anniversary, Mr. Lyons envisions attendees taking greater advantage of patriot place, where the new Renaissance Hotel and Spa at patriot place opened this year. \"We're encouraging alumni to stay overnight at the site, which is within walking distance of the conference.\" The third annual Recipes for Success, an evening of excel - lent food, drink and spirited auction bidding raised a re - cord amount of nearly $25,000 for scholarships. The event featured Billy Costa from \" t.v. Diner\" as emcee. Seventeen Boston-area restaurants participated, and the mouth- watering dishes ranged from pasta to pita pockets and ribs to lobster rolls, along with tempting desserts. Auction items included exotic vacations, tickets to Celtics, patriots and Red Sox games, and spa treatments. Where can you stay in Boston for $100 for an entire weekend A nD reconnect with your classmates? At the first \"Coming Home to the College\" Reunion Weekend, alumni parked for free and roomed in the Ronald A. Matricaria Ac - ademic and Student Center apartment suites for a bargain $50 a night; a new tradition was born at MC pHS-Boston. There were cooking demonstrations, wine tastings, campus tours, a Red Sox game, karaoke and a piano bar. Dinner in White Hall was accompanied by a five-piece dance band, while a jazz trio entertained Reunion-goers in the Henrietta DeBenedictis Library. on Sunday, the annual Forsyth Alumni Brunch drew another big crowd. \"We had a super time. Staying at the College made it a lot more relaxing,\" said elaine e. Barker, wife of Harry \"Joe\" Barker BS p '59, who shared an apartment suite with Frank Case BS p '59 and his wife, Margaret. \"We ran into people in the elevator... i highly recommend staying at the College.\" Mark your calendars for 2010 Reunion, June 4-6, and don't forget to make your reservations early! n Alumni Events\u2014Far and NearRepo Rt on Givin G July 1, 2008-June 30, 200912 \"The change involved a complete transition from how the Class Gift cam - paign has been traditionally conducted and incorporates a new concept in giv - ing,\" said Lonny townley, Director of Development operations. \"What i found most striking was that of the nearly 350 donors, more than 100 donors made their class gift either their very first, or only their second gift ever, to MCpHS.\" paula Kaspar BS p '84, president of professional pharmacy personnel, inc. in putnam, Conn., was one alumna who made her first large gift to the College. Marking the 25th an - niversary of her graduation, she said it was a time to reflect on her life and her accomplishments and the role the College has played in her successful career. Al - though she had every inten - tion of giving back to her alma mater, life\u2014getting married, having a family, becoming a single parent\u2014 often got in the way. \"But there are moments in your life when the time is right,\" said Ms. Kaspar. \"The Col - lege made such an effort to thank me... it made me feel so good about giving.\" The Class of 1984 chose to support the creation of a Healthy Health Care Prac - titioner series, which will provide future health care practitioners with informa - tion and education about healthy lifestyle choices so that they can be posi - tive role models for their patients. The idea resonated with Ms. Kaspar, who said that as a hard-working health care provider, she understood the need to educate students in that regard. \"We don't realize that we have to take care of ourselves,\" she said. \"...The project gave us ownership. i gave a sizable contribution because it was for a specific item; that made all the dif - ference.\" The gift from the Class of 1984 will fund a scientific study by the well-respected American College Health Association, an organiza - tion dedicated to the health needs of students at colleges and universities, to identify the behaviors and needs of the College's student popu - lation. A survey will be distributed to all students and the data compiled. pro-grams will then be designed around intervention and education so that students can practice and value their own self-care. More than 30 mem - bers of the class of 1984 contributed to the Class Gift, according to Class Agent Arthur Margolis BS p, proprietor of America's Compounding Center in newton, Mass. \"it was an opportunity for the class to make a decision and to do something great for the students,\" said Mr. Margolis, who volunteered for the role. \"The good part is that we actually all agreed.\" A preceptor to sixth-year pharmacy students, Mr. Margolis said his family has a long history with the Col - lege, and he is eager to lend his support in different ways. He established the Jon Margolis Scholarship Fund and the Abraham Margolis Scholarship Fund, named for his father, Jon Margolis BS p '58 and his grandfather, Abraham Mar - golis phG '28 respectively. \"MC pHS has given a lot to my family,\" he said. \"And it continues to give so much to alumni. A lot of us take advantage of the C e programs... if we don't give back to the College then the profession of pharmacy will change without any input from us.\" The creation of a Healthy Health Care Practitioner Series was one of several student-focused projects recommended by Jean Alumni Gifts That Keep On Giving A newly organized Class Gift program, in which members of Reunion classes collaborated to fund specific projects, resulted in a dramatic increase in charitable gifts from Reunion-year classmates of more than $100,000 during 2009. Seven out of nine Reunion classes earmarked funds toward projects that directly benefit students, including tutoring, leadership development, multicultural services and creation of a Healthy Health Care Practitioner series.13 Joyce-Brady, phD, Dean of Students, who met with her staff as well as the departments of Counseling Services and Recreation and Wellness to comprise a list of possible funding op - tions. (See the complete list in the box on this page.) Mr. townley discussed the list with Dean Joyce- Brady, which included otherwise unfunded operational enhancement priorities related to academ - ics, lifestyle and student activities. in addition to the Healthy Health Care Practitioner series, other new or existing programs that were supported with class gifts included tutoring and mentoring services, multicultural and diversity awareness services and a student leadership program. \"i was thrilled when Lonny informed me there were alums interested in providing support for students to be personally and professionally success - ful,\" said Dean Joyce-Brady. \"it's a wonderful way to see the interconnectedness of people who have moved through the institution... We are extremely grateful for their gifts. it's going to make a great difference for students in these areas.\" After the list was final - ized, Mr. townley recruited Class Agents\u2014a volunteer from each of the nine classes who was interested in communicating with his or her classmates to reach consensus on one item to be funded. Class Agents sent letters via regular mail to their classmates, and Mr. townley followed up with class agents by phone and e-mail. Currently there is a waiting list for tutors, which sometimes happens in midyear, after resources have been allocated based on the projected number of students expected to seek academic assistance. This year the Boston campus experienced a 46 percent increase in requests for personal tutoring; Worces - ter/Manchester campuses had a 21 percent increase. MCpHS students are serious about their studies. Some who request tutoring may be passing with a C but want to raise their grade. The College utilizes several tutoring programs: one-on-one tutoring by a professional (all campuses); peer-led tutoring (all cam - puses); and a pilot program called Smart Thinking (Boston campus), whereby students can access Web- based tutors, on a 24/7 basis, for specific subjects like mathematics, biology and chemistry. each year, the College sponsors multicultural events for different months that honor the accom - plishments of different groups, including Black History month, Asian History month, Latino His - tory month and Women's History month. Additional funding has given the of- fice of Student Activities the opportunity to bring in programs and higher- profile speakers whose fees would otherwise strain limited resources. Also with new funding, more prominent speakers for the College's annual Student Leadership Confer - ence will be recruited and a Web-based program on specific leadership skills with books and podcasts to accommodate busy students will be purchased. Leadership topics include What is Leadership? Effective Role Modeling and Etiquette ; Time Management ; and Eth- ics and Values . The online programming will be open to interested students on all three campuses. \"We are first and foremost in the business of provid - ing the optimal learning and living environment for students,\" said Mr. townley. \" now we have found a tool\u2014class gifts\u2014 to expand programs and services that will advance their experiences.\" n 1949Expanded tutoring, mentoring and career resources 2009 Reunion Class Gift Initiatives1954Classroom in the Richard E.

Williams Jerry Zee Class of 2009 1% $130Scott J. BeaurivageNadia S. KattanAmber W. Li Fifty years after graduation from the Forsyth School for Dental Hygienists, Beverly (Panciera) Whitford DH '59, BS, still attends the annual \"pajama party\" with her former Forsyth classmates and life-long friends Barbara (McGuire) Nelligan, Nancy (Meader) Witkowski, Sandra Owens and Christine Dalapas. She remembers too, the silver tea service at the monthly afternoon teas in the Forsyth dormitory at 100 The Riverway. \"We had to wear stockings and a skirt, no bobby sox allowed,\" she recalled. Following her Forsyth graduation, she received a bachelor's degree in dental hygiene from Tufts University and a business management certificate from the University of Bridgeport. However, she attributes the accomplishments of her stellar dental hygiene career to the basic work ethics she learned at Forsyth. Except for a brief stint as a preventive specialist consultant, her professional career was spent in private practice. For 14 years she also worked as a professional representative/consultant with Chesebrough-Pond's Inc. and Unilever-USA, staffing commercial exhibits and introducing new products at major dental meetings throughout the country. The Old Mystic, Conn. resident served as President of the American Dental Hygienists' Association from 1998-1999. \"I remember being told, 'If you want to be treated as a professional, you have to act like one,'\" recalled Ms. Whitford. \"Even to this day, patients compliment me on my professional characteristics.\" In honor of her 50th Forsyth Reunion class, Ms. Whitford spearheaded a drive for a Class of 1959 Forsyth Scholarship Fund to which class members generously donated. She was also a proud member of the Campaign for the Forsyth Dental Hygiene Committee, which raised funds for the Esther M. Wilkins Forsyth Dental Hygiene Clinic at the Boston campus. A plaque near one of the patient operatories honors her contribution. \"It is my hope that we can raise the funds necessary to endow the scholarship fund,\" she said. \"[which] would honor our class in perpetuity while providing meaningful benefits to Forsyth students...I encourage all Forsyth alumni who have benefited from the program to include the College in their giving. Remember your roots. If everyone gave a little, just imagine collectively what that would do for the program. The joy of giving to others is awesome.\" Beverly (Panciera) Whitford DH '59, BS \"if everyone gave a little, just imagine collectively what that would do for the program.

WeinerWilliam Wilkins Class of 1963 Anne C. Davies CMRI '08, a certified fitness instructor, saw the benefits of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a diagnostic tool to aid in patient rehabilitation, she began to ex - plore options for a new career in the health care professions. She chose the postbaccalaureate MRI Certificate program at MCPHS, the alma mater of her sister, Camille (D'Arcangelo) Gervasi BSP '89, and brother-in-law, Gary R. Gervasi BSP '87. \"I have always enjoyed helping people with their health and fitness issues,\" said Ms. Davies, a former electrical engineer and mother of three children. \"I wanted to take my career to the next level of care,\" The education Camille received did well by her. \"I knew the College was well-respected in the medical community.\" Today a licensed MRI techni - cian at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, the site of one of her rotations, Ms. Davies enjoys a close relationship with other health care providers who are now her colleagues. She learns new techniques every day, through continuing education courses and in-house programs. She is most gratified when she is able to use her education to produce a thorough examination in a reasonable amount of time, while providing comfort and care to her patients. \"When the exam is over, and they give me a hug, that's a terrific feeling,\" she said. \"It means that I provided the emotional support they needed for the best experience. It's what makes me happy about being a health care professional.\" Even with her strong back - ground in math and science, Ms. Davies found the coursework in the one-year MRI program very challenging. She praised the program, where her classmates, many of them over 40 years of age from varied backgrounds and careers, remained enthusias - tic about their prospective new careers as MRI technologists. \"We came together not knowing each other, and in a short time we became wonderful friends,\" she said. \"We're still very close and get together as often as possible.\" Soon after graduating, Ms. Davies made a generous gift to support students\u2014she established the Anne C. Davies MRI Scholarship Fund. A 1983 graduate of the University of Massachusetts at North Dart - mouth with a BS in electrical engineering, she was awarded an academic scholarship as an undergraduate. She knows the difference that scholarship funds can make in the lives of students. \"MRI diagnostics is a rapidly developing science, a non-inva - sive procedure that is a leader in the field of imaging modalities,\" she said. \"Each MRI tech has a responsibility to see to the advancement of the MRI industry. By attending continuing educa - tion programs, investing in the colleges that educate new MRI techs, and joining the profession - al organizations that certify our industry, we can participate in the development and expansion of the technology. All alumni, if they are able, should give some - thing back to the College, wheth - er it's time, money, or teaching.\" Anne C.

Kavanagh '97 The Pillar Society The MCPHS Pillar Society calls to mind the six pillars that grace the fa\u00e7ade of the historic George Robert White Building on the MCPHS-Boston campus. The honor- ary association was founded in 2007 as a means for the College to express gratitude to all who have made planned gifts that already have been received, or will someday accrue to the College. These individuals have provided a lasting legacy for tomorrow's generations of students by including MCPHS in their estate plans. Membership in this prestigious society is open to all who provide support for MCPHS through wills, trusts, life income gifts, retire- ment plans and other vehicles. Their membership is for life, as long as the planned gift remains in force. Pillar Society members make an investment in the future greatness, continued growth and leadership of the College. Members include alumni, current and retired fac-ulty and staff and friends of MCPHS. While the Society is relatively new, planned giving to MCPHS is not. Bequests have helped make substantial contributions to the Col- lege's growth and success, providing funds for scholarships and classrooms, technology and student activities as well as professional opportunit es for faculty, staff and alumni. Pillar Society members leave a legacy for future genera- tions of students, faculty and programs. The following list honors members of the MCPHS Pillar Society whose estate or deferred gift commitments demonstrate their confidence in MCPHS as a leading institution of higher learning devoted to excellence in education, scholarship and public service. pillar soCiEty mEmbErs Paul J.

The College enrolls almost 150 international students drawn from 34 countries, including 12 Saudi Arabian students pursuing the accelerated Doctor of pharmacy degree, as well as graduate students from peru, United Arab e mirates and i ndia. At the same time, MCp HS students from all parts of the United States are visiting foreign lands for real-life health care experiences. Diana Ramirez BS pHS '10, one of 14 MC pHS students who volunteered in a rural village health clinic near Arequipa, peru during semester break last January, said the experience opened her eyes to the disparities in global health care services, and served to reaffirm her career choice to practice medicine. \"i want to return to Latin America after i finish medi - cal school because i know the language, and i can help,\" said Ms. Ramirez, who is in the College's premedical and Health Studies program and is in process of applying to medical school. Fluent in Spanish, the north Bergen, n.J. resident has acted as translator for the College's office of international programs. The office of international programs, established in 2008 in response to student interest in learning about health care first-hand in countries around the world, organized the peru trip. it was just one of several interna - tional opportunities for students, now available during each academic year, that also included experiences in Morocco, Belize, China and Malta, where the College's first inter - national clinical internship site for the MR i program was established at Mater Dei Hospital, the university's brand new teaching facility. This summer, student Larry Ravelson MRi '09, recipient of the Anne C. Davies MR i Scholarship, spent the month of June there. in peru, the College's sister institution, Universidad Catolica de Santa Maria in Arequipa, arranged for MC pHS students from premedical and Health Studies, physician Assistant Studies, Doctor of pharmacy and Radiological Sciences programs to assist at a rural clinic, shadowing phy - sicians and visiting hospitals where they observed surgeries. The students, who were accompanied by Lisa McDe - vitt, pharmD, Assistant professor of pharmacy practice, MCpHS-Boston during their two weeks in peru, brought medical supplies and toys to donate to hospitals. At a clinic high in the Andes, 30 minutes from Arequipa, Ms. Ramirez watched two physicians and an infectious disease specialist with few resources at their disposal treat patients with upper respiratory diseases, arthritis and joint problems, digestive issues and diarrhea due to poor water quality. Since there is no organized transportation to hospitals, Ms. Ramirez noted, patients often die from their illnesses, many of which are treatable. \"The doctors did the most with what they had,\" she said. \"We were able to help in what little way we could. i learned a lot about thinking outside the box...\" \"it was a great experience,\" continued Ms. Ramirez, who also volunteers at Children's Hospital Boston. \" i hope we can make the trip again before i graduate. everyone should have the opportunity to travel there. it's definitely worthwhile... i'm really enjoying the premedical Studies program; it's preparing me well to handle the heavy work - load i'll have in medical school.\" Also during the semester break last January, 11 nursing and pharmacy students from MC pHS-Worcester's nursing Students Without Borders organization assisted health care The World is Their Classroom \"The doctors did the most with what they had. We were able to help in what little way we could. i learned a lot about thinking outside the box.\" \u2014Diana Ramirez BSp HS '1023 practitioners in San ignacio, Belize to set up free screening clinics for obe - sity, hypertension and diabetes, screening more than 400 people over six days. They also spent several days teaching school children about diabetes prevention strategies that include diet and exercise. in another corner of the world, MC pHS is establishing a health care-fo - cused program with volunteer Morocco, an organization founded by two MCpHS adjunct faculty, which enables students to gain a working knowl - edge of the Moroccan urban and rural health care system. Last spring, the MCpHS premedical Society held a 5K road race to help raise money for shipping medical supplies to Morocco valued at nearly $300,000. Then, five MC pHS students journeyed to Morocco in June to help distribute supplies and volunteer in maternity, emergency and pharmacy departments at rural hospitals. Several years ago, MC pHS established a sister-college relationship with Hangzhou Medical College in China. Last year, in recognition of this new relationship, the College hosted seven students and one professor from Hangzhou. Following this trip, six MC pHS students and one faculty member completed a one-week visit to Hangzhou Medical College. in addition to the growing number of international experiences for MCpHS students, students from the international pharmaceutical Students Federation ( ipSF) Student exchange program annually visit the College. During four weeks last summer, for example, students from poland, Hungary, Spain and Singapore rotated among a variety of practice sites to gain a broad understanding of pharmacy in the United States. in exchange, just within the past few years, MC pHS pharmacy students have spent time at practice sites in turkey, Hungary and taiwan. indeed, an increasing number of international destinations are becoming working laboratories for MC pHS students committed to broadening their horizons and gaining an appreciation for the stark health care realities around the globe. in their pursuit, they are already making a difference for people, near and far, as they prepare for leadership careers in health care. n Kevin Kearney Edward V.

He lived in the dorms at Emmanuel College, played intramural basketball and was elected treasurer of the Student American Pharmaceuti - cal Association. As an intern at the then-new health mainte - nance organization, Harvard Community Health Plan in Cambridge, which was under the leadership of John J.

At NEMC, Dr. Curtis co-wrote a chapter on mild an -algesics in Dr. Miller's Handbook of Drug Therapy. \"I was fortunate to have very progressive and great mentors with very high standards both at MCPHS and where I interned,\" said Dr. Curtis. After graduation from MCPHS with his bachelor's degree, he enrolled at the University of Missouri Kansas City School of Pharmacy where he received his PharmD degree, and then completed a residency in clinical pharmacology at the Truman Medical Center, before accepting an appointment as an assistant professor at the Univer - sity of Illinois at Chicago, College of Pharmacy. Later, he moved to Pfizer, Inc. in New York City. While at Pfizer, he earned an MBA from Columbia University and subsequently became Direc- tor of Worldwide Pharmaceutical Licensing. Looking for more of an entrepreneurial challenge, Dr. Curtis became involved in start - ing up a series of biotechnology companies across the country.

Laham BSp '73, his wife, Debbie, and his mother, Lorraine, the MCp HS-Boston office of Admission suite recently underwent a complete physical makeover. Mr. Laham, p resident of Sullivan's p harmacy in Roslindale, Mass., has chaired the trustees' Building Committee for the last 10 years, during an era of unprecedented growth. The transformation allows staff members to present the professional face of the school in the best possible light and to attract the most highly qualified students. \"The admission process has become much more personal,\" said e xecutive Director of Admission Kathleen Ryan. \"We have a professional meeting space for students and their families, and we can guide them to discover the best program for their interests. p eople don't realize we have programs other than pharmacy, that in some cases are a better match.\" Modern, inviting professional office suites for 12 Admis - sion recruiters and a comfortable reception area capable of hosting 25 prospective students and their families welcome visitors. When high-school students and their families walk through the Ronald Matricaria Academic and Student Center, and up the majestic steps of the George Robert White building, they are greeted by the Admission office's visit Concierge, and scheduled for a guided tour by one of the College's many Student Ambassadors. According to Ms. Ryan, the emphasis is on the front end of the recruitment process. once a student visits the College, the chances that he or she will enroll are greatly increased. The College's state-of-the-art facilities, premier location in the heart of the Longwood Medical and Aca - demic Area, excellent academic programs and personalized attention are a \"slam dunk,\" an education that makes for a wise investment in a student's future, said Ms. Ryan. \"We are leading people to jobs with impressive starting salaries,\" she said. The College also uses Web-based technology to connect with prospective students. Within the first 48 hours after posting the Facebook page for incoming MC pHS students, half the new class logged on. Students from all three cam - puses and Ms. Ryan are blogging, ready to answer questions. is the new recruitment system working? The numbers say it all: a nearly 20 percent increase in the projected number of first-year and transfer students admit - ted to MC pHS-Boston for fall 2009, including the three programs targeted for new admission strategies: nursing, Dental Hygiene and pharmaceutical Sciences. Ms. Ryan works with provost Michelle Kalis, phD, who schedules meetings for faculty with parents and students. She is also in constant contact with victor M. postemski, Director of Residence Life, who met with more than 50 families last semester, addressing questions about life on campus and after the first year. \"We're trying to engage the entire community in the recruitment process,\" said Ms. Ryan. \" everyone has the opportunity to impact the success of the College, from security to the parking attendant, to faculty. it's everyone's responsibility.

DupuisEccoEdible Professional Association Medicine World, Inc.Donald M. Messina '55MK AssociatesGrowing up in the West African country of Ivory Coast, Fabien Pitt\u00e9 PharmD '04 always knew he wanted to be a pharmacist. His fa - ther is a pharmacist and the owner of Pharmacie & Laboratoire du Longchamps in Abidjan, and his mother is a dermatologist. Both his brother, Christian, and sister, Corrine, are pharmacists. Accepted at three U.S. phar - macy colleges, there was never any doubt which one he would at - tend after consulting with MCPHS alumna Ana Kouissi PharmD '01, the daughter of a family friend. \"MCPHS is famous outside the United States,\" he said. \"I didn't want to attend a large university where I would get lost in the crowd, and I liked the fact that MCPHS is right in the center of Boston, in the Longwood Medical Area.\" At MCPHS, he joined Phi Delta Chi where he palled around with fraternity brothers John Walyzck PharmD '06, Minh Do PharmD and Gene Svirskiy PharmD '06, all with whom he remains in contact. He jumped at the chance to volun - teer as Class Agent for his fifth Reunion; the Class of 2004 raised funds to support multicultural support services and educational programming. \"My education made me what I am today,\" said Dr. Pitt\u00e9, a pharma - cist at CVS. His Government and Regula - tory Affairs rotation, supervised by Vice President Dennis G. Lyons BSP '75 and Katherine Keough, Executive Director of Govern - ment Affairs and Continuing Education, took him to the Massachusetts State House and into the chambers where pending public policy bills are debated. \"I met people who I never would have met,\" said Dr. Pitt\u00e9, who is interested in law and business. \"It was an amazing experience.\" Dr. Pitt\u00e9 has his eye on enter - ing business school. He knows that he will have no trouble managing the curriculum after completing the rigorous MCPHS education. He learned how to manage his time and stress, skills he uses daily in a fast-paced pharmacy where he fills approximately 500 prescrip - tions per day. \"It's a great feeling to give back to the College,\" said Dr. Pitt\u00e9, a regular contributor to the Annual Fund. \"Giving back is a small repay - ment for my education. The more the College is viewed as a leader, the greater the value of my educa - tion. By donating, I'm helping to keep the College a great school.\" Fabien Pitt\u00e9 PharmD '04 \"it's a great feeling to give back to the College. [My gift] is a small repayment for my education. By donating, i'm helping to keep the College a great school.\" \u2014Fabien p itt\u00e9 p harmD '04Alumni Profile Continued from page 2629 Monadnock Water Charles F.

Monahan Jr. '62, '98 ProfileJennifer Hixon, DHSc, PA-C, Dean and Director of the Physician Assistant Studies program, School of Physician Assistant Studies in Boston, endorses the vision of President Charles F. Monahan Jr. to be part of the health care solution. \"I was thrilled to be given the opportunity to work at the College,\" said Dean Hixon, who joined the College in September 2008. \"It's a forwarding-thinking institution, concentrated in health sciences. The College is an exciting place.\" A fellow of the American Academy of Physician Assistants and a member of the Pi Alpha national honor society, Dean Hixon has practiced for more than 30 years in the areas of sports medicine, orthopedic surgery and primary care, and volunteers as a site visitor for the Accreditation Review Commission for Physician Assistant Education, (ARC-PA). The former dean and chair of the Physician Assistant program at Springfield (Mass.) College, she was the health care provider for the U.S. Olympic field hockey team and traveled around the world before and after the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. She received unrestricted educational grants from GlaxoWellcome, Schering/Key Pharmaceuticals and 3M Pharmaceuticals, among others. Most recently Michelle Kalis, PhD, Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs, nominated her as a scholarship leader with the Association of Schools of Allied Health Professionals (ASAHP); she was named one of 10 scholars in the country, and the College aided her participation at ASAHP conference events. \"The College's support of research and scholarship helps the faculty stay current in preparation for teaching our students,\" said Dean Hixon, a past president of the Massachusetts Association of Physician Assistants. \"President Monahan is interested in the Col - lege being a contributor to health care reform. We are educating health care professionals who will be part of that reform.\"She praised the College's commitment to the Physician Assistant Studies program, as evidenced by the state-of-the-art laboratories and new offices in the Richard E. Griffin Academic Center, and recruitment of talented faculty. During the past year, she redesigned the curriculum as part of the College's self-assessment process. \"Physician assistant education requires sophisticated and ever-changing equipment and technology,\" she said. \"All that comes at a cost.\" \"It's important for me to give to the College,\" she continued. \"I want to be part of the health care solu - tion. I'm interested in supporting causes I believe in that match my values as a person and a profes - sional. Contributing to the College is an investment in the future of the physician assistant profession.\" Jennifer Hixon DHSc, PA-CDean and Director, Physician Assistant Studies Program\"it's important for me to give to the College. i want to be part of the health care solution [by] supporting causes i believe in that match my values as a person and a professional.\" \u2014Jennifer Hixon, DHSc, p A-C Faculty 2008-June 30, 200932 Linda MacLeod Gail (Phillips) Bucher '63 and Edward A.

Morey Scholarship Katherine Jacob PharmD '12, who hails from Shelton, Connecticut, is excited about her fourth year at MCPHS. As Treasurer-Elect of the Student Government Associa - tion (SGA), she is eager to put into practice the leadership skills that she learned at the National Association for Campus Activities' Student Government Institute in Seattle, Wash. These skills also will serve her well in her future pharmacy career. Her goal is to help the SGA become more effec- tive as a liaison for students and campus organizations. Ms. Jacob, who especially enjoys interacting with people, is thriving in the College's close-knit learning environment. On her first visit to MCPHS, the size of the College made it feel as though it was her \"home away from home...It's really great that we're a small school. We're like a big family.\" In addition to her service with SGA, she is a member of the Student Alumni Association and a leader among students who work for the Annual Fund phona - thon program. She understands the importance of charitable support by alumni, parents and friends of the College. So, for sev - eral weeks during each academic year, she joins other students telephoning alumni and friends to talk about College develop -ments and ask for Annual Fund support. \"I know tuition doesn't cover all the things that the College needs to do,\" she said. \"The growth of the College has been amazing. None of it would have happened without the generous contributions of alumni and friends. We need to keep moving forward, and we need help to do it.\" Ms. Jacob regards phona - thon conversations as two-way learning experiences. She has chatted with parents of current students who are \"so grateful to hear from a student\" about the dorms, living off-campus, clubs and organizations and life at the College in general. She has also learned about the varied careers of MCPHS alumni and has been fascinated by tales about her cur - rent professors. \"The phonathons are a good learning experience for me, and at the same time it helps the Col - lege. The best feeling is at the end of the night, when I realize that I've made a contribution.\" Katherine Jacob PharmD '12\"The amazing growth of the College would not have happened without the generous contributions of alumni and friends.

Parker PharmD '12 graduated Trinity Christian School in Concord, N.H., his entrepreneur - ial spirit led him to Whittemore School of Business and Economics at the University of New Hamp - shire. After two years, he trans - ferred to MCPHS, where he also had been accepted after his high school graduation. \"In high school, I thought that the pharmacy field was too narrow, but as I got into the business curriculum, I saw the possibilities that pharmacy offered.\" Timothy made the decision to transfer to MCPHS with the ap - proval of his father, Lenny Parker BSP '79, President of Northeast Pharmacy Services in Concord, who encouraged his son to recon - sider his alma mater. The young Mr. Parker's first three years at the College proved to be challeng - ing, but he did well. He especially enjoyed Biochemistry taught by Lawrence Gracz, PhD, Assistant Professor of Biochemistry, and Health Care Delivery by Josephine Babiarz, Esq., Assistant Professor of Pharmacy Administration. \"I had to reprogram the way I thought,\" he said, regarding his adjustment to the MCPHS. \"In business school, a creative opinion is more valued. At the College, I've grown in my ability to deduct and reason. It's made me a better thinker.\" Last year, Timothy Parker won the Roland P . Gosselin Scholarship Award, which makes awards earmarked solely for New Hampshire residents who are in satisfactory academic standing and in the third year of the profes - sional pharmacy degree program. The scholarship has allowed him to reduce his work hours and increase time spent concentrating on studies. (During his first year at MCPHS, he held down three jobs before being recruited by Nextgen Realty, where he became the firm's top-grossing rental agent for the month of January.) The scholarship award not only provided Timothy Parker with a much-needed financial cushion but also served as a greatly ap - preciated reward for his academic achievement and incentive to aspire to future academic success. He is grateful to the family mem - bers of the late Roland P . Gosselin BSP '57, who wished to support students and memorialize this distinguished MCPHS alumnus through this significant scholar - ship fund. \"The biggest thing about the scholarship is that I can spend more time learning; every little bit helps because it means fewer loans,\" he said. \"The scholarship is a decent chunk of change that helps pay for books and food.\" Timothy J. Parker PharmD '12 \"i can spend more time learning; every little bit helps because it means fewer loans... [and it] helps pay for books and food.\" \u2014timothy J. p arker p harmD '12Scholarship Awardee Profile MCPHS giving programs provide donors with flexibility to direct their contributions or to make gifts that benefit all students. Since tuition and fees cover only a portion of the cost of an MCPHS education, all students benefit from programs and services that are supported by charitable giving. WAYS to Give gifts to mCphs can be made in several ways: the easiest gifts to convey include cash and marketable securities. a convenient way to make a gift using a major credit card is to visit the secure website at www.mcphs.edu, and then click on Make a Gift Now . mCphs also encourages donors to verify with either their or their spouse's employer's human resources or personnel offices whether the employer matches charitable contributions. mCphs offers donors the opportunity to establish life income gifts, such as charitable gift annuities and charitable remainder trusts. these vehicles allow donors to simultaneously support mCphs and receive income. mCphs also encourages prospective donors to name the College as the recipient of a deferred gift, made as a bequest that reflects the donor's wishes. the pillar society is a planned-giving recognition program that welcomes into membership alumni and friends who leave gifts to the College through their wills or estate plans, or establish life income gifts with the College. officers of the College are ready to work with you and your financial advisors to help maximize the impact of your contribution, including tax benefits, for your investment today in the pharmacy and health science professionals of tomorrow. for further information, call the development office at 1.800.322.1124, e-mail at development@mcphs.edu, or mail to: development office, massachusetts College of pharmacy and health sciences, 179 longwood avenue, boston, massachusetts 02115.
