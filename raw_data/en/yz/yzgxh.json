The West Coast called to my sense of adventure, and had a lot to offer my active lifestyle. I skied, snowboarded, swam, mountain biked, kayaked, white water rafted and brought others along with me. That was until I had a complicated nerve and tissue injury and my active lifestyle came to a sudden halt. After my injury, I knew I needed to find a new approach to life and solutions for my healing. I began to seek new therapies and experience the amazing power of Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Chinese Medicine provided me with major improvements in circulation, pain, sleep, mood and mental state that helped me to get through a very challenging and dark period of my life. I'm an athlete at heart, so returning to a state where I could once again engage in my active lifestyle brought spark and meaning back to my life. The experience showed me just how much I wanted to help others in the same way.

Performing at a high level was hard on body and mind alike. As such, Chinese medicine and acupuncture became a staple in his life to treat joint pain, stress, insomnia and headaches. As time passed competitions faded and a desire to understand human health took root. Through the 2000s to present Calvin has gained substantial education to treat mobility issues such as headaches, stiff necks, frozen shoulders, aching backs and muscular pain. At one point in his career he worked predominantly with the elderly and gained a unique perspective on treating aging mobility diseases such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Although Calvin has enjoyed serving the public in treating mobility issues he has had other focuses over his 20 year career in conditions around fertility, insomnia and digestive problems. Calvin has had a very deep and broad Chinese medicine education. This is reflected in his treatment presentations that usually consist of acupressure (finger pressure and massage techniques), medicinal ointments, hot towel applications, acupuncture, cupping and the dispensing of Chinese medicinals. With these healing modalities combined, treatments come across to patient's as 'spa-like'. This realization helps to affirm Calvin's healing philosophy of \"Healing should be a pleasant experience not more trauma\". Which would your immune system prefer?

The human experience can be exhausting and confusing at times... \"Can I just get a break!?\" If you are reading this, it's likely you may have reached a point of exhaustion and the logical brain keeps telling you \"but, I don't know why/how...\" yet you feel that there is more or that your soul is calling out and something is missing. I've been there. The body holds inner stories that are trying to be told, but when the mind doesn't know how to process them, they show up as anxiety, depression, feeling lost or stuck, and/or subconscious or conscious behaviors that directly impact our connection to ourselves, others, and the universe. As your integration therapist, I am open and receptive to your specific needs, emotions, and internal processes. I will share skills and tools for you to feel more connected to your body, deepen your understanding of current life situations, and awaken the Inner Healer within. With cooperation, connection, and trust, I am here to share and support you through this journey you're on. About Joney Poon MTA, HCt Joney experienced her first awakening as a child and has been studying the metaphysical, creative arts and psychology ever since. She has a unique fascination with spirituality, music, intuition, energy work and our subconscious minds, and how many of those factors influence how we experience and express ourselves in this world. Wanting to learn and understand more, she embarked on the journey of merging the spiritual with the physical. She studied psychology and graduated with an MTA in Music Therapy. She discovered how music can not only bypass the critical mind and tap straight into the subconscious and the heart felt emotions, it can also alter our conscious states for healing. She then did further training in GIM (Guided Imagery in Music), which then led into Clinical Hypnotherapy. Through the exploration and learning of how powerful our subconscious minds are, she discovered passion for psychedelic medicine approaches to healing and is eager to journey alongside clients in exploring and integrating their experiences. This led her to do training in psychedelic assisted psychotherapy and her pursuit in a masters of counselling with a special focus on psychedelic medicine modalities. It was not until Joney's first ceremony experience of plant medicine, that awakened other parts of her. She became even more attuned with her natural gifts and sensing of energy around her and in others. This was when the Dao found her. Joney continues her journey learning Qi energy work and Tai Chi Baqua along with intuitive energy healing. Since then, she's on a path of healing, helping others connect with their own subconscious, power and qi, holding space for truth, and untamed authenticity. Joney's intention is to shine her light even in the darkest of the night, utilizing her gifts to support others to find their own light and liberation (creating your own powerful inner harmony). More and more, Joney is about being, and being present in the moment with gratitude. Her passions are creating music, art, meditation, exploring sacred sexuality, dance and movement. When she's not with clients, she's hiking, dancing, travelling, cooking, making art or music, and engaging in acro yoga or aerial arts. Joney believes that:\"The key to growth is the introduction of higher dimensions of consciousness into our awareness.\" Lao Tzu Joney is currently completing her practicum requirements to earn her Registration as a Clinical C...
