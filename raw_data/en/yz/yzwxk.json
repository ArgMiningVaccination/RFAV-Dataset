The WYANP increases awareness of and expands access to Naturopathic Doctors, helps its members build successful medical practices, and expands the body of naturopathic medicine research. We are on a mission to enhance human health and wellness by advancing the profession of naturopathic medicine. Naturopathic Doctors guide their patients through effective prevention and management of disease and empower their patients to experience optimal health and wellness through application of conventional medical and natural approaches, ranging from nutrition and lifestyle change to targeted use of botanical and pharmaceutical medicines. Members of the AANP and WYANP are students and graduates of four-year, graduate-level naturopathic medical programs at naturopathic colleges, accredited by an agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education, and, to practice naturopathic medicine, they passed a national professional competency exam and meet annual continuing education requirements. Our more than 1,500 members practice naturopathic medicine, which combines centuries-old, natural, non-toxic therapies with current advances in medicine and covers all aspects of health, from prenatal to geriatric care. Naturopathic medicine focuses on the root cause of health conditions, rather than treatment of symptoms, and customizes treatment to each individual patient. Naturopathic medicine has the potential to transform the health care landscape in this country from a pharmaceutical-based, sick care model to a patient-centered, holistic wellness model that improves the quality of life for millions of patients while saving taxpayer dollars.
