Here are our top 15 tips to help treat psoriasis at home.", "sitename": "Greatist", "date": "2022-03-25", "cleaned_text": "Even with a derm-approved [treatment regimen](/health/why-your-psoriasis-treatment-is-not-working), [psoriasis](/health/eczema-vs-psoriasis) flare-ups can still be a major source of frustration. But just because there's no cure, doesn't mean you can't do your part to calm [psoriasis at home](/psoriasis/psoriasis-home-remedies). Crafting a relaxing psoriasis self-care ritual can help you soothe symptoms and get some much-needed TLC to help keep flare-ups at bay. Research from [2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6520092) even suggests folks who develop a psoriasis [self-care routine](/discover/best-books-for-self-care-rituals#powerofritual) can develop a better relationship with their physicians. Basically, the two of you can become a powerful duo in healing your [psoriasis](/psoriasis/psoriasis-types)! Here's how to #TreatYoSelf (and your psoriasis) with a self-care routine. 1. Make time for bathtime Light a candle, grab a magazine (yes, they still exist), and soak in a lukewarm bath for about 15 minutes. Cleanse with a gentle fragrance-free [body wash](/health/best-body-wash-for-dry-skin), and when your 15 mins are up, gently pat your skin dry to help seal in moisture. Apply a thick, [derm-approved moisturizer](/psoriasis/psoriasis-lotion) and enjoy your newly-soothed skin. Psst: Try adding in some [colloidal oatmeal](/eczema/oatmeal-bath-for-eczema) for extra itch relief. 2. Try relaxation techniques If you feel like your [psoriasis](/psoriasis/early-stage-beginning-of-psoriasis) acts up when you're stressed AF, you're not alone. Like for many conditions, [stress](/psoriasis/psoriasis-stress) is a super common psoriasis trigger. For better [mental health](/grow/resources-when-you-can-not-afford-therapy) and skin health, prioritize rest and relaxation. The [American Academy of Dermatology (AAD)](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/psoriasis/triggers/flares) recommends [stress relief to [2012 research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3511390), [sleep deprivation](/health/what-happens-when-you-dont-get-enough-sleep) can fire up the inflammatory process behind psoriasis. So it's def worth swapping late [Netflix](/eat/best-netflix-food-shows-2021) nights for [deep sleep](/health/how-much-deep-sleep-do-you-need). A [2016 review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079215001239) also found a link between [insomnia](/health/chronic-insomnia) and psoriasis, so it may not be as simple as climbing into bed earlier. To improve your [sleep](/program/sleep), try these [sleep tips](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/sleep_hygiene.html): - Make your bed your [sanctuary](/happiness/minimal-bedrooms)\u2014 for sleep and [sex](/program/sex-guide)only! - Maintain a dark, [cool](/happiness/how-to-cool-down-a-room), and quiet atmosphere. - Consider trying [white noise](/discover/best-white-noise-machine)or even [pink noise](/health/pink-noise)for blissful sleep. - Avoid [caffeine](/eat/best-time-to-drink-coffee), or [alcohol](/health/alcohol-and-sleep)before bed. - Keep [blue light](/health/sleeping-with-tv-on)(especially from phones) out of the bedroom. - Keep a regular [sleep schedule](/health/how-to-fix-sleep-schedule)by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day. 4. Catch some rays Letting the sun kiss your flare-ups (even your [plaques](/psoriasis/what-is-plaque-psoriasis)) may help reduce them. [Sunshine](/health/sunshine-and-depression) can also help ease stress and boost your mood. Of course, layer on [sensitive skin-friendly sunscreen](/discover/best-sunscreen-for-sensitive-skin) \u2014 sunburn will definitely make your psoriasis worse. Aim to be a sunbathing beauty for 5 to 10 mins a day. And ask your derm for specific recommendations on how much sun time is right for your [psoriasis](/health/psoriasis-rash). 5. Create a psoriasis-friendly skin care routine Stick to a gentle [skin care routine](/live/skin-care-for-beginners) using fragrance-free soaps and moisturizers that won't irritate your sensitive skin. The AAD recommends these [symptom relief](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/psoriasis/skin-care/itch-relief) tips: - Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize. Especially after washing psoriasis-affected area, lather up with a soothing, derm-approved, fragrance-free moisturizer. This will help reduce redness, itching, and bonus: help keep your skin healthy and glowing. - Cool off and relieve itchiness. OTC products with camphor or menthol can also lend tingly, cooling relief. And when you're lounging around, try applying a cool compress to your [psoriasis](/health/does-psoriasis-spread)for relief. - Never pull off psoriasis scales! Use derm-approved products with salicylic acid to soften patches and then gently brush them away. If possible, consult a derm to create a well-rounded psoriasis skin care routine you'll love. 6. Use aloe all over Need an additional psoriasis fix beyond your moisturizer? [Aloe vera](/psoriasis/psoriasis-aloe-vera) isn't a cure, but it can help ease psoriasis symptoms like [redness](/health/skin-redness/), itching, and [inflammation](/health/inflammation). According to the [National Psoriasis Foundation](https://www.psoriasis.org/integrative-approaches-to-care), creams with 0.5 percent aloe are ideal. And you can lather up as much as 3x a day. 7. Nosh on nourishing foods [Diet](/health/psoriasis-diet) can both trigger [psoriasis](/health/facial-psoriasis) flares and help boost overall health to [help ease symptoms](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/psoriasis/insider/diet). If you're aware of any [dietary psoriasis obvi avoid 'em. But eating more [nutritious foods](/eat/most-nutritious-foods-to-eat) doesn't have to be a chore, either. Just try to meet your veggie, fruit, and lean protein quota in a way that jibes with your tastes. Pinterest-worthy [breakfast bowl](/eat/easy-breakfast-ideas-that-require-no-cooking-skills), anyone? 8. Drink and go chug [8 ounces](/health/how-much-water-should-i-drink) of H2O. Chances are likely your body is thirsty AF and it's affecting your skin. So, how does [drinking water](/health/why-is-water-important) help psoriasis? [Dehydrated skin](/health/dehydrated-skin) via lack of water is dry and sad, while hydrated skin is moisturized and happy. And moisturized skin will help alleviate dry and itchy skin from a flare. Don't worry, [sparkling water](/health/does-sparkling-water-hydrate-you) counts! 9. Move your body [Exercise](/fitness/13-awesome-mental-health-benefits-exercise) is a fab way to manage [physical and mental stress](https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/related-illnesses/other-related-conditions/stress/physical-activity-reduces-st) and feel freaking fantastic. It may also [help decrease](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/psoriasis/insider/diet) some of psoriasis symptoms \u00e0 la stress reduction. Whether you [start lifting weights](/fitness/how-to-start-lifting-weights), [walking](/health/benefits-of-walking), or [working out at home](/fitness/at-home-workouts-for-beginners), all movement does the body good. 10. Ditch alcohol (or at least limit it) Pass the [mojito](/eat/mojito-recipe-roundup) \u2014 and hold the [rum](/live/benefits-of-rum), please. Try opting for [mocktails](/eat/recipe/non-alcoholic-cocktail-recipes) instead of cocktails or enjoy a soothing [herbal tea](/health/tea-that-helps-you-sleep) instead of a nightcap. According to the [AAD](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/psoriasis/insider/diet), folks with psoriasis who cut back on [alcohol](/health/psoriasis-and-alcohol) may experience: - fewer outbreaks because treatment becomes more effective - more remissions (aka periods without [psoriasis](/psoriasis/early-stage-beginning-of-psoriasis)) - reduced risk of getting [psoriatic arthritis](/psoriatic-arthritis/psa-on-psa-what-no-one-gets-about-psoriatic-arthritis)and fatty liver disease - decreased risk of liver damage from psoriasis meds But that doesn't mean you have to kiss your [ros\u00e9](/eat/rose-cocktails-for-summer) romance goodbye. If you enjoy an alcoholic bevy from time to time, just keep it to a minimum and stay in tune with what might be triggering a flare. 11. Kick tabacco Quitting smoking [can reduce the incidence](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/psoriasis/insider/diet) of psoriasis flare-ups. Bonus: It'll also do your heart, lungs, and overall health a solid. 12. Journal daily Unpack your Password Journal STAT! Daily [journaling](/happiness/gratitude-journal) is an idyllic self-care practice in general. But it also may help you reduce flare-ups by destressing through gratitude prompts and tracking your [psoriasis triggers](/health/food-journal). 13. Destress with aromatherapy Diffusing [essential oils](/health/best-essential-oils-how-to-buy-essential-oils) can help you bliss out \u2014 and *might* even soothe your [psoriasis](/health/essential-oils-for-psoriasis) symptoms. Yes, we need more research to prove [aromatherapy](/health/alternative-medicine-therapies-explained#aromatherapy) helps psoriasis, but it can def help you relax, which can indirectly help prevent flares. Ready your [diffuser](/discover/best-essential-oil-diffuser) and try breathing in soothing scents like [lavender](/health/essential-oils-for-psoriasis#lavender-oil) and [peppermint](/health/essential-oils-for-psoriasis#peppermint-oil). 14. Consider CBD Real talk: There's not enough research that CBD can really help psoriasis or [psoriatic arthritis](/health/cbd-for-psoriatic-arthritis). But generally, that *might* help psoriasis flares. Just make sure you get your docs approval first. Some products could make your psoriasis worse. Is CBD legal?The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp from the legal definition of [marijuana](https://post.healthline.com/health/hemp-vs-marijuana) in the Controlled Substances Act. This made some hemp-derived CBD products with less than 0.3% THC federally legal. However, CBD products containing more than 0.3% THC still fall under the legal definition of marijuana, making them federally illegal but legal under some state laws. Be sure to check [state laws](https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx), especially when traveling. Also, keep in mind that the FDA has not approved nonprescription CBD products, and some products may be inaccurately labeled. 15. Love yourself + your bod The last thing you might feel like doing when you're experiencing a flare is to love your skin as-is. It sounds cheesy, but some [self-love](/grow/self-love-playlist#1) may help you keep your mind off symptoms and feel [more confident](/grow/easy-confidence-boosters) in your own skin. Try enough,\" \"I am healing,\" \"I love myself\") and surround yourself with people, experiences, and things you love as much as possible. Outside of your doctor-recommended treatments, here are some other alternative treatments that [may help improve symptoms](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2698668): - Acupuncture. [Several studies](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2698668)have found acupuncture to be [pretty effective at treating psoriasis](/health/acupuncture-for-psoriasis), as well as soothing the underlying joint pain related to psoriatic arthritis. - Vitamin D supplements. [Vitamin D](/health/vitamin-d-for-psoriasis)is known to help treat [autoimmune conditions](/health/is-psoriasis-an-autoimmune-disease), [psoriasis included](/health/vitamin-d-for-psoriasis). In addition to getting natural sunlight, you also may want to take a supplement \u2014 especially if you live a place a Twilight character could thrive. - Indigo naturalis. Research shows that both [topical](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2698668)and ingested Indigo naturalis, a [plant extract](/psoriasis/herbs-for-psoriasis)often used may benefit psoriasis and [nail psoriasis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26954317)in particular. - Turmeric. A [2018 review](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2698668)concluded that curcumin, chemical compound found in turmeric, helps treat [psoriasis](/health/nail-psoriasis-vs-fungus)symptoms. BRB, time to serve up some curry. - Fish oil. That same [2018 review](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2698668)found daily fish oil supplementation to be effective at soothing [psoriasis](https://greatist.com/health/coronavirus-psoriasis)symptoms.

If you need a little extra support, consider the [following](/health/stress-relief-activities-psoriasis): - Therapy. A therapy sesh can help [reduce stress](/psoriasis/psoriasis-stress), which might translate to less flare-ups. There's also some [2018 research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29771216)that suggests that mindfulness-based cognitive hypnotherapy can improve skin disorders like psoriasis. - Take breaks. Give yourself time to rest and relax and every day. Go on a walk, hang out with a friend, or just take a few deep breaths - you (and your skin!) deserve it. - Listen to music. Turn up the beats to turn down your flare-ups. [Music](/content-series/dj-gr8ist)is a legit stress-reducer. [Research from 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019745561530006X)found that both classical music and nature sounds are especially stress-relieving and soothing. - Cuddle up. Whether you opt to snuggle up with your pet, your boo, or some other human, physical touch scientifically helps [lower stress](/health/stress-relief-activities-psoriasis#listen-to-music). Huggin' it out may just help you (and your psoriasis) feel at peace. There's [no cure](/psoriasis/myths-about-psoriasis#11-psoriasis-myths-that-just-arent-true) for psoriasis. But limiting stress, prioritizing health and wellness, and practicing self-care can help soothe symptoms and reduce the incidence of flare-ups.
