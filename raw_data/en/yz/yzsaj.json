Herbal medicines come in many forms including liquids, tinctures, pills, capsules, tablets, teas and loose herbs. It is generally believed that herbs will do no harm since they are 'natural' substances. Although many herbal remedies have shown no ill effects in studies, some others should be used with caution. About 25% of prescription drugs contain active ingredients from plants i.e. digoxin, morphine. Extracts or parts of plants used for medicinal purposes fall under the herbal remedy category. However, lack of quality control in the growing, harvesting and processing of herbal medicines mean that they may not even contain any active ingredients. How can one know that the herbal product contains what it says on the label? Some products list their ingredients in detail while others do not. In Canada, all medicines are issued a Drug Identification Number. Herbal medicines are not required to meet any regulatory standards. The chemical content of plants vary depending on the part of the plant used, species, variety, age and soil conditions. Some herbal medicines have been found to contain other more toxic herbs, metals or drugs. Are herbs effective as medicines? Western medicine is based on clinical studies (usually randomized placebo-controlled) that are evidence based. The placebo effect works about 30-40% of the time due to expectation, suggestion and belief. Few herbal medicines have been tested this way, but this article will review some of the recent studies on the effectiveness of herbal remedies. (see table) Are herbal medicines dangerous? Some herbal medicines have been found to have adverse effects. These include serious allergic reactions, toxicity, and drug interactions. Summary Numerous herbal supplements are available on the market and the accompanying table identifies just a few that can be found. Plants are potentially effective medicines and consumers wanting to take such herbal remedies should carefully research information on the products.
