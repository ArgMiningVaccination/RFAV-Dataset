Thank you for this opportunity to provide comments. 1.125 Can the different \"Lots\" also be described in grams. Items in the seed to sale tracking system must be in grams according to training. 1.165 Can Production Run also be described in grams. Items in the seed to sale tracking system must be in grams according to training. 1.245 Is an immature cannabis plant less than 8\" tall and 3\" wide? For the purposes of the seed to sale tracking software, a cannabis plant is considered \"vegetative\" and no longer \"immature\" once it was reached 8\" tall and 3\" wide. 6.010 Can \"one ounce\" of usable marijuana be expressed in grams. One ounce is actually 28.3g but I understand the state has defined one ounce to be 28 grams. Can this be explicitly stated? Also mentioned in section 12.010. 6.080 Section 3: if we can acquire seeds from anyone how can these be tracked in the seed to sale tracking system if the supplier does not have seed to sale tracking software? Currently we have no way to introduce seeds into the seed to sale tracking software. All new plants must come from another plant or be transferred from another license. 6.135 Quarterly reporting is currently reported on the 30th of the month for the three previous months. Ex: Jan, Feb, March reporting is due April 30th. Due to harvesting and curing schedules, it would be impossible to fully capture the entire month of March by April 15th. Curing schedules can take up to 21 days before product is fully cued and ready to package. Reporting by April 15th would lead to completely inaccurate harvest data. 9.040 Section 3. Guidance was provided by the department on common items and understood shelf life of those items. Any exception to these understood lives would require testing by the manufacturing facility. Will a similar memo be issued by the Board? 10.035 Section 3 mentions that all components must be stored 6 inches off the floor. 9.030 states \"fifteen centimeters\". Can the units system in the regulations please be unified to avoid confusion? 12.010 While tincture is called out separately here, it is packaged and treated as an edible in the seed to sale tracking software. The single package limit for tincture versus edibles are very different. Can more clarification be given on how to package tincture in the seed to sale tracking software? 2 12.035 Can it please be stipulated that the serving size statement is not required for concentrated cannabis product and is only required for edible products. Serving sizes are not defined and are not required to be defined for concentrates so have a serving size statement on these labels is incompatible. 13.015 Section 4, the distributor must updated the manifest to accurately depict any delays in arrival times, any route change, or any new driver information. The originating establishment cannot be responsible for knowing, or entering this information in the seed to sale tracking software.

MEMO To: State of Nevada Compliance Board From: Anansi Enterprise LLC - (Tim Eli Addo & Kofi Forkuo-Sekyere) Date: June, 6, 2020 Re: Recall Procedures for Cannabis in Nevada Nevada should be proactive in its approach for strengthening recall procedures for contaminated cannabis products. Increasing strength of lab testing is an important step for guaranteeing consumer safety. However, stronger testing needs to be paired with ways for warning the public of contaminated cannabis products. Establishing an effective cannabis recall program now will help ensure Nevada's gaming industry can safely create revenue share models for cannabis. The gaming and tourism industries will seek to profit from another potential lucrative revenue stream as cannabis get closer to federal legalization. Furthermore, the Proposed Final Regulations of the Cannabis Compliance Board does not address how contaminated cannabis products should be recalled or recorded. Regulation 6 of the Proposed Final Regulations of the Cannabis Compliance board does not address how contaminated cannabis products should be recalled or recorded. Regulation 10 of the Proposed Final Regulations of the Cannabis Compliance board does not address how contaminated cannabis products should be recalled or recorded. Regulation 11 of the Proposed Final Regulations of the Cannabis Compliance board does not address how testing facilities should respond during a recall for contaminated cannabis products. Regulation 13 of the Proposed Final Regulations of the Cannabis Compliance board does not address how distributors should respond during a recall for contaminated cannabis products. Anansi Enterprise is prepared to provide recall procedures for each step of the cannabis supply chain (sellers, producers, distributors, testing facilities). Policy Issue: The current method the Department of Taxation uses to notify the public of recall is ineffective in notifying all the parties involved. The lack of notification to affected parties can be fatal, especially since medicinal cannabis patients may already suffer from a compromised immune system. Nevada needs to be equipped with a method of notification and containment for potential recalls on cannabis products. Public safety should be the highest priority for cannabis regulators This memo is not written in fear that an issue may happen. Fatalities from contaminated cannabis have already happened in two states. Although, it had limited press coverage, the deaths still leave a lasting impact. This issue affects the consumers, and also the cultivators, processors, and dispensaries that may be liable. Given the current pandemic, producers and sellers are more prone to contamination since they are experiencing a surplus in inventory; forcing companies to find new, unproven, ways to store cannabis safely. Moreover, contaminants in cannabis products can be a tremendous burden for medical patients waiting to receive an organ transplant. The American Association for the Studies of Liver Diseases (AASLD) has warned potential recipients to refrain from using cannabis because containments can have fatal effects on the transplant procedures. Better testing and recall procedures will help hopeful transfer recipients to consume cannabis for medicinal purposes. Other consumer goods are subject to Federal and State product recall procedures. These procedures try to increase the probability of notification and recapturing of affected products o The FDA requires the following for recall strategies: \u00a7 Classification of recall (in terms of severity) \u00a7 Public Warning \u00a7 Effectiveness Check Level (ensuring all parties who sold and consumed products have been notified) Solidifying Nevada's recall program will further legitimize the state's cannabis programs by providing assurance to consumers o Consumers will have proper notification if a contaminant issue ever occurs o Other states will look to Nevada's improved recall procedures as a blueprint to enact similar procedures in their state Preventative measures need to be placed to ensure fatalities will not happen again as a result of neglect from regulators o Fatalities from contaminants have already occurred in the cannabis industry. In both cases, the products in question had received a passing grade from the lab. o Collection of new data sources are not needed to enact a safe recall protocol. The cannabis industry is already stringent. The amount of personal information required for all parties involved, especially the consumers, is already known and written into law. This information can be leveraged to provide an affective recall tool, that the state and MME's can access. Solution: Ensure implementation of proper recall procedures for every licensed cannabis facility in Nevada. This includes establishing protocols for each facility and employee that could be involved with a product recall, especially compliance managers and directors. Recall procedures will include a technology application that tracks information about the cannabis product; including, the location of the batch to provide a current map of batch location. Templates will be provided for companies and employees who wish to conduct a voluntary recall. This solution will make sure that all parties involved - including the end user - are properly notified. The solution we offer considerers the following as criteria for solving this urgent public health issue: 1. Notifying the public and affected parties in an urgent manner 2. Training of all personnel involved with product recalls 3. Isolating the entities affected to stop a faulty product from spreading 4. Providing accurate mapping of batch distribution, including times of distribution 5. Making participation mandatory for all MMEs (dispensaries) 6. Accessibility by all registered cannabis companies in the State of Nevada Implementation: Implementation of solution will require training all licensed cannabis facilities on the steps of conducting an effective recall. Relevant personnel will learn the steps one should take in the event of a recall. This includes training personnel on how to complete templates when conducting a voluntary recall. A bi-weekly import of information is required from dispensaries, cultivators, and processors to help map the distribution of batches. This information is currently being logged in various systems by employees and can be reviewed by the state for medicinal patients. This process only requires data that is already required for submission by cannabis entities to be compliant with Nevada Law. Information needed includes: Name and/or zip code of customer who purchased batch Time of purchase Method of contact (phone, email, social media, etc....) About Anansi Enterprise LLC Anansi Enterprise is founded by Tim Eli Addo. Eli continues to be an inspiring voice for patient advocacy and minority involvement in the Nevada Cannabis industry. A brilliant mind, Eli plays an important role in Nevada's patient advocacy through current hemp and cannabis legislation. In 2013, Eli was one of the pioneers behind the hemp industry in Nevada. He lobbied House of Representatives Congresswoman Dina Titus (d) and former Congressman Joe Heck (r) to cosponsor the HR 525 Farm Bill. Also, Eli was instrumental in drafting the language for important amendments to SB 374, two of which further patient advocacy: the ability for patients to test their cannabis products at a state licensed Nevada testing lab. Furthermore, Eli helped establish the foundation for the cannabis market in Nevada through operational consulting for MMEs as a R&D consultant for Cannalysis, which includes consultation on anything from the production, testing and compliance. Eli continues to fight for minority representation in the Nevada cannabis industry, especially when it comes to cannabis legislation. Nevada is filled with smart people who can greatly impact cannabis and cannabis legislation. Unfortunately, because many of these people are minorities, Nevada - and other states - have not yet capitalized on this opportunity. Therefore, Anansi Enterprise seeks to provide diverse and effective leadership regarding cannabis legislation.

Current regulation 11.075 (7) Testing states the following: \"Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a cannabis c ultivation facility or a cannabis product manufacturing facility may submit a request for retesting of not more than 50 lots or production runs each calendar year. For any subsequent failure of a quality assurance test in a calendar year, the facility shall destroy the lot or the entire production run, as applicable. A lot which only fails a quality assurance test for moisture content must not be counted for the purpose of this subsection.\" I would propose that the \"50 lot\" limit set for submitting a reque st for retest should only apply to those samples which fail quality assurance tests from both testing labs. Retest samples which are deemed \"safe for sale \" by the lab performing the requested retest should not count towards this limit. Cultivation faciliti es should not be penalized based on discrepancies between labs and potentially lose or lessen the value of revenue generating products that would otherwise be deemed \"safe for sale\" based on a submitted retest. If both labs come to a consensus on a \"faile d\" test for whatever quality assurance factor originally triggered the request for retest, this in my opinion would be a more appropriate indication of issues at the cultivation level and not discrepancies between labs. Otherwise, raising the \"50 lot\" limi t to something closer to 100 may also help reduce any possible negative impact to the cultivator. Thank you for considering this request for the proposed regulations. Sincerely, Daniel Hopper, PhD. 1Amber Virkler From: Daesia To: CCB Regulations Subject: Regulation Comments Good Afternoon, Thank you for the opportunity to provide commentary on the proposed regulations. Please see commentary below. Starting in section 12.0230 to 12.045 The regulations currently state that the number of the medical cannabis establishment registration certificate (medical license number) for the cultivation and/or production facilities operating under a dual license is required on the product label (if applicable). Would it be possible to remove that information from the labels, in the interest of saving space on product labels for important warnings and information? Thank you for your time and consideration. Have a great afternoon.

Section 5.110(5) requires certain forms to be signed by \"[t]he owners, officers or board members\" of a cannabis establishment.... This regulation implies that ALL owners, officers or board members must sign any transfer application. This requirement exceeds and ignores governance statutes, law and common sense. This requirement is inherently overbroad and unduly burdensome. There is substantial administrative difficulty in requiring ALL members of a manager-managed LLC to sign any ownership transfer application. Managers of a manager-managed LLC generally have fiduciary or other obligations to the members in carrying out their duties as managers. Members have delegated managerial responsibility to the managers. Because of the legal duties and obligations of a manager to its constituent members, it should not be necessary for the Department to satisfy itself that all members have approved a transfer of ownership interest. This is particularly burdensome when there are several members or members are out-of-state, hospitalized, deceased or otherwise unavailable. Therefore, this requirement ignores NRS 86, the contractual delegations of the operating agreement and common sense. Likewise, the requirement that both \"officers\" and \"board members\" sign is inherently superfluous, illegal and overbroad. \"[B]oard members\" may only act as members of a board. They have no individual authority. For example, any director who disagrees with the action, although it may have been agreed upon by the requisite vote of the board, may refuse to sign the form, even though their dissention is irrelevant. This dissident director may be able to usurp the powers of the president by refusing to sign, when the signature of the president should be all that is necessary. This requirement allows any director to exercise powers over the corporation individually, which corporate governance laws simply do not permit. Moreover, the resolutions of the board of directors are carried out by the officers. Therefore, requiring each individual board member sign the form is anomalous, because they only act as a board and requiring officers AND board members to sign is redundant. The only required signatures should be an authorized officer, not all officers. Therefore, I believe that Section 5.110(5) should be amended to read that: 5. The authorized owners, managers or officers of a cannabis establishment shall notify the Board on a form prescribed by the Board each time an ownership interest in any amount in the cannabis establishment is transferred.

Sincerely, Brenda Shalloo, COO NV Cann Labs June 9, 2020 STATE OF NEVADA CANNABIS COMPLIANCE BOARD Via Email: regulations@ccb.nv.gov RE: Proposed State Of Nevada Regulations of the Cannabis Compliance Board (CCB) Dear CCB Members, Thank you for the opportunity to review and provide comment on the proposed State of Nevada Regulations for cannabis. Crooked Wine (DBA Blackbird Logistics) holds two distribution licenses in Nevada, in the cities of Reno and Las Vegas. We believe we are one of many operators in the state that can assist the CCB in an advisory capacity, and ensure that the regulations implemented this year are reflective of the operational workflows in the cannabis industry. In other states, we are working equally as hard to establish state-industry working groups, as we have witnessed premature roll-out, and then redaction, of state administrative cannabis procedures/bulletins that were not compatible with the current operational landscape. We welcome the opportunity to work with the CCB on a continuing basis to provide input on regulations from an operational perspective, and how proposed regulations and procedures may cause secondary impacts to efficient workflows. Although not required, we recommend that the CCB implement public review procedures under Chapter 233B, Nevada Administrative Procedure Act. To date, we have not been able to easily find posting of the final CCB Members or these proposed regulations. Following the state's public review procedures under Chapter 233B will ensure that operators have a chance to raise and convey to the CCB any regulations that conflict with the state's now-established cannabis industry operational workflows. The following summary identifies the sections of the proposed regulations that we feel garner the need for more discussion and revision. Sincerely, Crooked Wine (DBA Blackbird Logistics) Tim Conder, CEO tim@myblackbird.com 316 California #30, Reno, NV 89509 Page 1 of 7 2.050 Service of notices in general Identifying the single primary contact as the owner/managing officer of the company does not represent the operational/compliance manager of a licensed facility that would be responding to citations and urgent matters. In other states, we have had electronic notices go to owners that were unavailable for several days. We recommend that the BCC include a provision for the identification of a secondary contact that represents a managing member of the business operations on the ground. This would ensure that more than one individual can receive, and respond to, the electronic notifications. 5.015 Qualifications for licensure This section provides several provisions for the denial of licensure based on perceived character. We recommend that the qualifications for licensure remain solely based on scorable criteria. This will remove potential causes for litigation if a license is denied based on perceived, subjective personal characteristics. 5.025 Submission of application by person who holds medical cannabis establishment registration certificate for cannabis establishment of same type; issuance of license; refund of fee if application not approved. Blackbird supports provisions that limit the potential for monopolies and large conglomerates; however, limiting a person's ability to hold no more than two medical cannabis establishments of the same type, throughout the entire state, may result in forcing the issuance of licenses to individuals who lack business competence and experience. We request that the CCB review this provision in light of the state's intent to increase access to medical cannabis, and the estimated total licenses available in the state over the next five years. Perhaps varied limits based on license types are warranted. For example, a distributor may only need three locations to efficiently cover transport for the state, but a dispensary should have the ability to open one store per region/county. Section 5.110 (c) is an adequate provision for preventing monopolies. 5.085 Surrender of license if cannabis establishment has not received final inspection; extension of time for final inspection; fee not refundable. If an applicant is establishing a facility from the ground up, the time it takes to get final planning approval, construction, and final inspection will likely be longer than the 12 months prescribed in this section. We appreciate the inclusion of the extension clause on a case-by-case basis, and want to highlight the likelihood of this extension being requested in this industry is somewhat frequent, depending on the order and timeframes in which the state and local approvals are granted. Page 2 of 7 5.095 Renewal of license Please include a table that establishes the annual license renewal fees. We recommend that any sections referencing application fees list those fees in text, or reference an appended table of fees. 5.100 Grounds for denial of issuance or renewal of license; grounds for revocation of license; notice; opportunity to correct situation. Please explain the intent behind denying licensure to an owner of a cannabis testing facility if he/she is also an owner, or holds financial interest, in any other cannabis establishment. This provision seems overreaching if the intent is to prevent conflict of interest and self-testing. We recommend the CCB replace this provision with one that explicitly prohibits the cannabis testing between entities owned by the same individuals (or having the same ownership interest). 5.110 Requirements for transfer of all or a portion of ownership interest; reimbursement of costs to Board; notice to Board; disclosure of facts pertaining to representative capacity of certain persons to Board; permission of Board required for registering certain information in the books and records of the cannabis establishment; investigation. Please clarify Section 5.110 (3). Does CCB intend to establish a fee schedule for processing administrative changes in an organization, or is this provision included to capture unusual circumstances when a change of ownership requires investigation beyond the standard administrative review process? 5.150 Categories of registration cards Does an independent contractor providing consultation services (i.e., a third-party compliance review) for a cannabis establishment require a registration card? Clarification on the term contracted \"labor\" may be needed. 6.035 Confidentiality of name and any other identifying information of persons who facilitate or deliver services pursuant to Title 56 of NRS to persons who apply for or are issued registry identification card or letter of approval; exceptions. The state's seed-to-sale tracking system inputs and the requirement to list and print copies of personal driver and vehicle information on every transfer/sale significantly raises risks associated with targeted robberies and identity theft. We request that the CCB work with operators to understand how the current print-receipt requirements fulfill this Section's intent to protect personal information. We have several solutions we would be happy to share and discuss further that would ensure that the state has a record of delivery driver information, in perpetuity, without having that information printed on a piece of paper that could easily get lost. The fastest solution to reducing targeted robberies and identity theft is to apply GPS vehicle delivery requirements to dispensary deliveries and distributors, and remove the detailed Page 3 of 7 transport personnel information from the printed manifests. California implements the following provision of what we consider a good alternative to printed information: A vehicle used for the delivery of cannabis goods shall be outfitted with a dedicated Global Positioning System (GPS) device for identifying the geographic location of the delivery vehicle and recording a history of all locations traveled to by the delivery employee while engaged in delivery. A dedicated GPS device must be owned by the licensee and used for delivery only. The device shall be either permanently or temporarily affixed to the delivery vehicle and shall remain active and inside of the delivery vehicle at all times during delivery. At all times, the licensed retailer shall be able to identify the geographic location of all delivery vehicles that are making deliveries for the licensed retailer and document the history of all locations traveled to by a delivery employee while engaged in delivery. A licensed retailer shall provide this information to the Bureau upon request. The history of all locations traveled to by a delivery employee while engaging in delivery shall be maintained by the licensee for a minimum of 90 days. Many licensed distributors already implement detailed, secure, GPS fleet management systems to manage their operations. These systems track all transport vehicles completing transfers, including all the detailed driver and vehicle information required on BCC manifests. Instead of filling in the driver and vehicle fields in the seed-to-sale tracking system, a distributor would simply enter a shorthand notation to the order tracking number or other delivery reference point associated with the company's chosen computerized fleet management software. All pertinent information on the transfer driver and vehicle is secure, within the fleet management software, and can be provided to regulatory agencies and other authorities, upon request. Distributor's would need to ensure that the personal information normally inputted in these fields is readily accessible, upon request, and maintained by the licensee for a period of time mandated by CCB. This approach would effectively protect driver's personal information, reduce the potential for vehicle tracking for targeted robberies, and would still fulfill the intent of the regulation to maintain detailed information on the movement of cannabis goods within the state. This GPS provision could be added to Section 7.055. 6.120 Restrictions on advertising; required posting of signs in cannabis sales facility. The CCB may want to consider modification and/or addition of additional signage related to consumption lounges. 6.123 Use of packaging: Required approval by Board. Since the CCB is not individually responsible for approving packaging and logos, should this section be revised to reflect compliance with applicable sections related to packages and labels? Page 4 of 7 7.025 Prohibition on sale that exceeds maximum usable quantity of cannabis This section should be updated to reflect new limits established for medical cannabis. 7.040 Delivery to consumer: General requirements. Subsection 3 needs to specify website address or actual name of web page; not easily found. Subsection 10 reflects a delivery model in which a driver performs a single order fulfillment before returning to the dispensary for the next order. This single-order delivery workflow is not a sustainable model, and further discussion is needed to understand the CCB intent around encouraging a typical delivery model in which a driver would have several orders to deliver in one route. Provisions in these proposed regulations favor a single-order delivery model that contradict the state's intent to reduce vehicle miles traveled and greenhouse gas emissions. There are solutions and regulations implemented in other states that may be a good test case to model after and improve delivery efficiencies. 7.045 Delivery to consumer: Duties of cannabis sales facility. Additional discussion around Subsection 2 is needed to ensure that the CCB understands the challenges in reflecting more than one delivery in a single trip using the current seed-to-sale tracking system. A cannabis sales facility that is using a third party delivery service currently has to share access to their seed-to-sale tracking system account in order for the distributor to update the driver information. Additional discussion is needed to ensure that CCB understands the limited options a third party delivery service has when it comes to accurately updating the tracking information. A new access model is recommended for cannabis sales deliveries that allows the third party delivery service to update driver information, similar to how wholesale distribution currently operates. Should Subsection 4 be updated to reflect a timeframe in which information can be altered? For example: can be altered up until the order leaves the cannabis facility. Subsection 10 directly contradicts Subsection 4 (real-world traffic conditions will generate changes in planned routes). Additional discussion is needed to ensure that CCB understands the complexities of route planning and real-time variabilities that cannot be captured in written form in advance of a delivery. Other solutions include mandates on providing CCB GPS tracking logs with actual turn-by-turn records, instead of trying to populate the route information in advance. Subsections 6 and 7 directly contradict the state's intent to protect personal information (see comment under Section 6.035). A truncated version of the shipping manifest should be produced that redacts the personal driver information and detailed vehicle information. Other states allow for electronic receipts. Page 5 of 7 We hope CCB also considers these issues raised in light of an industry that is new and should reflect \"green\" environmental practices (i.e., reduced vehicle miles traveled and printed receipts/paper transactions). 7.050 Delivery to consumer: Restrictions; duties of cannabis establishment agent making delivery. As previously highlighted under Section 7.040, we believe Subsections 1 and 2 of this provision favor a single-trip distribution model that should be reviewed by CCB and discussed further. We encourage CCB to develop regulations that favor a typical distribution model, with larger limits on the total customers serviced in one route. 13.015 Duties of distributor delivering cannabis or cannabis products; transportation manifest; duties of originating cannabis establishment and receiving cannabis establishment; maintenance of records. As previously highlighted under Section 7.045, the logistics of writing out predicted routes for multiple deliveries within the seed-to-sale tracking system is near impossible and very cumbersome (see Subsection 2). Additional discussion with CCB is requested to ensure all parties understand the intent, current limitations, and other options available to fulfill the state's request. Subsection 4 directly conflicts with the state's requirement for distributors to update driver information per transfer. As previously highlighted under Section 6.035, additional discussion with CCB is requested to ensure that driver and vehicle information is secure. A truncated version of a printed wholesale transfer manifest would achieve the desired confidentiality. We believe the requirements under Subsection 7 conflict with the state's intent to protect personal information. 13.020 Storage area for cannabis and cannabis products; verification of inventory; inspection by Board. Additional discussion with CCB is requested around the ability for a distribution hub to store product for a short period of time that would allow for efficient delivery routing and less vehicle miles traveled. As with any other industry, the distributor typically utilizes a transfer hub to ensure maximum efficiency in the delivery route. Without the ability to utilize a distribution hub, we are constantly sending multiple drivers along the same route for deliveries. Utilizing a distribution hub, would also greatly improve estimated delivery windows. This distribution model works well in California. We do not agree that the storage of cannabis products should only be permitted under extraordinary circumstances, as prescribed in Subsection 3. Page 6 of 7 13.025 Amount that may be transported by distributor; transportation by cannabis establishment agent; restrictions on transportation by vehicle. In light of the social distance protocols implemented by the State, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we request that CCB temporarily allow distributors to waive the second driver requirement. Having two drivers in close quarters promotes the spread of this contagious virus.

Introduction The Nevada Dispensary Association (\"NDA\") appreciates this opportunity to assist the Board as it develops a new regulatory paradigm for the cannabis industry. The development of a comprehensive regulatory scheme, aided by industry leaders like the NDA, is integral to the continued success of this relatively nascent industry. Moreover, as the Board develops rules to address the issues in the cannabis industry that were identified by the Legislature in the hearings for and prior to the passage of Assembly Bill 533 (2019), the NDA hopes to be a source of both information and pragmatic and comprehensive solutions. It is within this context and with these intentions that the NDA respectfully submits the following comments. II. Comments: Proposed Rule Changes and Additions a. Add rules that outline the requirements for a petition for rehearing. Proper enforcement is essential to the effectiveness of any regulatory scheme. Successful regulators establish relationships with the industries they regulate through an open, transparent, and fair enforcement process. To that end, NDA proposes that the Cannabis Compliance Board (\"Board\") adopt regulations outlining the process for rehearing of disciplinary matters before the Board, pursuant to Nevada Revised Statues (\"NRS\") 678A.590, to ensure those who may be disciplined under the Board's rules have an opportunity to exhaust their administrative remedies to the extent that there is an identifiable and material problem in the Board's findings and decisions. The NDA believes that an appeals process would not only provide greater equity under the Board's rules, but it would also provide a procedural step that the Board could reference in any potential litigation against the Board that may be founded in a claim regarding a violation of due process. Notably, a rehearing could cure procedural defects that may derail an otherwise lawful disciplinary action. Regulations surrounding rehearing should focus on the statutory requirements outlined in NRS 678A.590, as well as provide the movant with some certainty as to when their motion will be decided. The NDA recommends that the Board act on a motion for rehearing within 60 days of filing. In addition, the Board should prescribe a process that allows parties of record to oppose a motion for rehearing. These goals can be accomplished by adding the language below, or language that is substantially similar, to the end of Rule 4: Rule 4.1XXX Motion for rehearing. 2 1. A motion for rehearing must: (a) Specifically set forth the nature and purpose of any additional evidence to be introduced. (b) Show that such evidence is material and necessary and reasonably calculated to change the decision of the Board. (c) Set forth a sufficient reason that existed for failure to present the evidence at the hearing of the Board. 2. A motion for rehearing of an order must be supported by an affidavit of the moving party or his or her counsel showing with particularity the materiality and necessity of the additional evidence and the reason why it was not introduced at the hearing. 3. A motion for rehearing of an order must be filed with the Board and served upon all parties of record within 10 business days after service of a decision and order. 4. An opposition to a motion for rehearing may be filed with the Board by any party of record in the proceeding within 10 business days after the filing of the motion. The opposition must be confined to the issues contained in the motion. The opposition must be served upon all parties of record. Proof of service must be attached to the opposition. 5. The Board will grant or deny a motion for rehearing within 60 days after the date of its filing. If no action is taken by the Board within this time, the motion shall be deemed denied. 6. Unless otherwise ordered by the Board, a motion for rehearing or the granting of such a motion does not excuse compliance with, or suspend the effectiveness of, the challenged decision and order. 7. If the Board grants a motion for rehearing, it will, within 30 days thereafter, conduct a hearing to allow the parties to present additional evidence and will issue a modified final decision and order or reaffirm its original decision and order. 8. A modified final decision and order of the Board issued upon rehearing will incorporate those portions of the original decision and order which are not changed or modified by the modified final decision and order. A modified final decision and order is the final decision of the Board. b. Default to the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure While the Board has proposed several procedural regulations designed to provide due process to licensees, inevitably, especially in the Board's early years, there will be procedural issues that the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Regulations (\"NCCR\") does not cover (for example, the proposed regulations are silent as to how and when a party can move to strike evidence in a hearing). Rather than attempt to promulgate rules for every scenario, the Board should defer to the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure where its regulations are silent. Therefore, the NDA recommends the following addition to Rule 1: Rule 1.025 Scope; applicability of Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure. 1. The provisions of this chapter govern practice before the Board. 3 2. To the extent that any action before the Board is not covered by these provisions, the Board may follow the applicable rule in the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure. c. The Board should define diversity. Consistent with the legislative intent memorialized in several provisions in Chapter 678B of the NRS that the Board prioritize diversity, the NDA recommends that the Board define diversity to establish certain policy goals and objective metrics to help ensure that all of the participants in the industry are similarly committed to diversity.1 Importantly, the Board should define diversity before it promulgates regulations establishing the relative weight of the criteria of merit used to rank applications prior to requesting applications pursuant to proposed NCCR 5.020. Accordingly, the NDA requests that the Board invite comments from stakeholders regarding the best way to define diversity and measure progress. d. Evidence improperly handled pursuant to proposed NCCR 2.065 should not be admissible. The Board correctly requires any article of property seized by a Board Agent to be treated with sufficient care and safety to establish a chain of custody. Chain of custody is established to ensure that hearings are conducted fairly by requiring documentation related to the evidence seized, including the following: the location of evidence; time and date of evidence recovery; description of item; condition of item; and unique markings on the evidence. While the rule as proposed is identical to Nevada Gaming Commission (\"NGC\") Regulation 2.120(1), chain of custody is particularly important when dealing with fungible goods, like cannabis and cash (two goods heavily used in the cannabis industry). Therefore, while NDA agrees that the regulations which govern gaming should be emulated by the Board, it is important that material differences between the gaming and cannabis industry be reflected in these promulgated rules. Accordingly, the NDA proposes that the Board amend the proposed regulation to state that a failure to comply with the subsection may render that evidence inadmissible in a proceeding before the Board. Specifically, the regulation could be amended as follows: 1 See NRS 678B.280(1)(f) (requiring the Board to consider diversity as one criteria of merit when determining whether to issue an adult-use cannabis establishment license pursuant to NRS 678B.250); See also NRS 678B.240(1)(i) (requiring the Board to consider diversity as one criteria of merit when whether to issue a medical cannabis establishment license pursuant to NRS 678B.210). The Board must also adopt regulations providing for the gathering and maintenance of comprehensive demographic information, including, without limitation, information regarding race, ethnicity, age and gender for each owner and manager of a cannabis establishment and holder of a cannabis establishment agent registration card, which must then be transmitted to the Legislature on January 1 of each odd numbered year. NRS 678A.450(2) 4 2.065 Procedure for control of evidence. 1. When a Board Agent seizes any article of property, the custodian of evidence for the Board shall place the evidence in a secure facility and enter in a suitable system sufficient information to establish a chain of custody. A failure to comply with this subsection shall not may render evidence inadmissible in any proceeding before the Board. 2. If the Board or hearing officer admits evidence in a proceeding that was not handled in compliance with subsection 1, the findings of fact and conclusions of law submitted to the Board must demonstrate that the seized evidence is sufficiently reliable and probative to be admissible This simple amendment retains the Board's ability to admit evidence that does not comply with proposed NCCR 2.065 when appropriate, while also acknowledging that the lack of a sufficient chain of custody is problematic. This amendment ensures licensees are afforded the opportunity to assert that a material and deleterious deviation in the chain of custody is so problematic that the evidence cannot be relied on in a proceeding before the Board. III. Proposed NCCR 4.020 Grounds for disciplinary action should be clarified. NCCR 4.020, as proposed, states that any violation of Chapter 56 of the NRS or NCCR is grounds for disciplinary action by the Board, including the immediate revocation of a license. Paragraph 2 of proposed NCCR 4.020, refers to violations of \"this chapter,\" as distinct from Chapter 56 of the NRS and the NCCR. The violations referenced in paragraph 2 are grounds for disciplinary action \"including, without limitation immediate revocation of a cannabis establishment agent registration card.\" As worded, it appears that it is the Board's intention for paragraph 1 of the proposed rule to define the scope of disciplinary actions available to the Board when a cannabis establishment violates Chapter 56 of the NRS or NCCR, and for paragraph 2 of the rule to define the scope of disciplinary actions available to the Board when a registered agent violates proposed NCCR 4. NDA respectfully requests the Board clarify whether \"this chapter\" in proposed NCCR 4.020(2) refers to proposed NCCR 4, Chapter 56 of the NRS, or NCCR in its entirety. IV. Suggestions on moving forward Establishing a new regulatory paradigm, while simultaneously building a regulatory agency from scratch is akin to building an airplane as you're flying it. Knowing that more regulations will need to be promulgated in the near future, the NDA respectfully proposes that the Board consider addressing several additional issues in upcoming rulemaking proceedings, specifically rules that provide for: 5 1. Request for deviation from NCCR - A lasting regulatory framework must be flexible in its implementation. This is especially true as the Board begins to put the rules into practice. Providing a mechanism that allows an applicant, licensee, or agent card holder the ability to explain why a particular provision should be waived would benefit not only the petitioner, but also the Board. These requests will be instructive to the Board as to how well the rules fit the industry and what requirements may need to be amended or removed. 2 2. Request for declaratory order - NDA would appreciate the opportunity to request a declaration from the Board when it is unclear how a rule should be interpreted. Our members are committed to complying with all rules and regulations. To do so in an industry and marketplace that is so rapidly developing, NDA members need to be able to act on new and innovative ideas with confidence that Board will not later find they violated any rules. In addition, providing for declaratory orders will also reduce the Boards cost spent on enforcement as it will reduce the number of enforcement actions that result from accidental non-compliance. 3 3. Standards for settlement of a civil penalty sought under proposed NCCR 4.030 - Administrative efficiency is served by allowing parties to stipulate to fines prior to conducting a full hearing. The Board should consider allowing stipulations for both civil penalties as well as application determinations and promulgate rules that outline when stipulations may be appropriate for the Board to consider. 4. Guidelines on how adversarial proceedings are conducted with respect to the Board staff's contact with the Board prior to approval of any decision and order - The Board will consider applications and disciplinary actions. Presumably, there will be staff from the Board that will present evidence to the Board or hearing officer in an adversarial proceeding. It is imperative that the Board establish procedures that will prevent ex parte communications with the Board when Board staff effectively participates as a party to a proceeding. V. Conclusion The NDA appreciates this opportunity to submit these opening comments to the Board. Given that the NDA's mission is to dedicate its resources to developing and promoting best practices among Nevada cannabis dispensaries as well as supporting the efforts of cannabis establishments to provide high quality, safe cannabis to Nevada's consumers, the NDA will continue to support the Board as it promulgates the rules that will be necessary to ensure that the best practices of the cannabis industry are properly codified. 2 Nevada Administrative Code 703.115 is a simple model for requests for deviation that can be adopted from the Public Utilities Commission. 3 NGC Regulation 2A provides a useful model for declaratory rulings. Director Tyler Klimas Executive Director Cannabis Compliance Board 555 E. Washington Avenue, Suite 5100 Las Vegas, NV 89101 Submitted via email: regulations@ccb.nv.gov June 9, 2020 Dear Director Klimas, On behalf of members of the Nevada Dispensary Association (\"NDA\"), thank you for considering the comments below in response to the proposed Nevada Cannabis Compliance Regulations (\"NCCR\") published on May 29, 2020. The requests and comments below may not be exhaustive as the comment period is relatively brief and some matters are subject to clarification. Please feel free to request further information or clarification relating to any of the requests and comments below. In addition, please also consider the comments attached that Dallas Harris, Esq., founding partner of High Compliance, prepared on behalf of the NDA. COMMENTS Definitions Please modify the proposed definition of private residence under NCCR 1.163 to prohibit deliveries to establishments that are required to pay transient occupancy tax rather than prohibiting certain locations, such as weekly and monthly hotels, where people often do maintain a residence similar to an apartment. Agent Cards Please modify NCCR 5.120(3), which requires owners with less than five (5) percent interest to obtain an agent card, provide a background check, and provide other financial information. Please consider replacing that with language authorizing the Board to request that a specific establishment provide a background check on certain, or all, owners with less than five (5) percent ownership interest if the Board has a reasonable suspicion or reason for doing so. Please also require that each establishment provide an annual disclosure of all owners (it is not feasible to provide these disclosures in real time as ownership is fluid for publicly traded and some privately held companies). 521 S. 7TH STREET LAS VEGAS, NV 89101 RIANA@NVDISPENSE.COM 702.782.4180 Requiring agent cards for owners with less than five (5) percent interest in a cannabis establishment would be nearly impossible, if not actually impossible for many currently operating cannabis establishments. One of the reasons it is not feasible to comply with this proposed regulation is that ownership of small amounts changes in real time in a publicly traded company and some privately held companies. A shareholder could own 4.9% one day, 5.1% the next day, and then go back down to less than 5%. The owners with less than five (5) percent interest do not have control or influence in the company, unless they are an officer or board member in which case they are required to obtain an Executive Agent Card and undergo more scrutiny. As the Board is aware, gaming regulation is an aspirational model for the CCB and gaming does not require the proposed level of compliance and scrutiny for owners with less than five (5) percent interest. Please maintain current requirements for employee agent cards (applicants must be 21 years of age or older and cannot be convicted of excluded felonies). Please do not require additional information about civil penalties and judgments against the applicant as proposed under NCCR 5.120. When AB533 was drafted and passed, there was a clear intent to increase the level of scrutiny on \"executive\" level agent cards, but not on cards below that threshold. Licensing Please reference the numerical limits on licenses set forth in NRS 678B.260 and 678B.220. Please clarify whether owners less than five (5) percent interest must be included in a license application and license renewal application and what those owners will be required to submit. If applicants must include background checks and extensive financial records for owners with less than five (5) percent, smaller investors who do not control the business may be precluded from investing and potentially only persons with larger amounts of liquid capital will be able to meet this burden. Please consider outlining a process for implementing the statutory requirement to convene a subcommittee and conduct a study on the illegal market and provide recommendations to the legislature pursuant to NRS 678A.310. 521 S. 7TH STREET LAS VEGAS, NV 89101 RIANA@NVDISPENSE.COM 702.782.4180 Please consider outlining a process for imposing sanctions on unlicensed and illegal market activity. Transfers of Interest, Investment, Profit-Sharing, etc. Please provide a procedure and more clarity as to the process relating to reviewing and approving or denying investments, transfers of interest, profit-sharing, license transfers, etc. As the Cannabis Compliance Board (\"CCB\") is aware, there has been a moratorium on transfers of licenses imposed since October 2019. This moratorium has been problematic for many establishments and there is a lack of understanding as to the purpose of the moratorium and how issues relating to transfers can and should be remediated. The NDA respectfully requests that revised proposed regulations shed more light on how the transfer process has changed since the moratorium was imposed and how the process will change once the current moratorium has been lifted. In addition, the NDA respectfully requests the revised proposed regulations include timelines for when and how transfers, investments, and profit-sharing will be reviewed and approved or denied. Due Process Please consider allowing written discovery under NCCR 4.110. Please remove the provision under NCCR 2.065 that allows evidence for which the chain of custody has not been maintained to be admitted in a disciplinary proceeding. Please instead allow the Board to deem the evidence admissible, but require a written finding as to why the Board finds the evidence reliable. Please remove the provision under NCCR 4.120 that creates a rebuttable presumption that missing records, documents, and surveillance would be harmful to the licensee. The regulations already provide for sanctions for failures to maintain these items and the burden of proof in a disciplinary matter is relatively low (preponderance of the evidence) and thus procedural safeguards should be maintained. Please clarify whether violations of chapters of 453A and D will be taken into account when considering civil penalties under NCCR 4.030. Please outline a process for non-Board Members to petition for a regulation change pursuant to NRS 678A.460. 521 S. 7TH STREET LAS VEGAS, NV 89101 RIANA@NVDISPENSE.COM 702.782.4180 Operations Please afford a time period in which licensees may replace labels and packaging that reference \"marijuana\" rather than \"cannabis.\" Please allow for up to two (2) years to be in full compliance with this provision. Please define diversity or outline a process for stakeholders to provide input on the definition of diversity as a step toward accomplishing goals to promote diversity. Please remove the proposed requirement NCCR 6.085 to require a training officer to sign confirmation of training completed by a security manager as this is extremely difficult to obtain and there is no evidence or data to indicate that this requirement will result in increased security. Alternatively, please include a requirement that the CCB maintain a published list of when and where the courses outlined in the regulations are available. Please remove the requirement that a passport to verify a consumer's age be issued by the United States under 7.020 (this language was inadvertently included in Nevada Administrative Code). Please change the amount of adult use cannabis that can be transported at one time under NCCR 7.050 to the same amount as medical cannabis (from 5 ounces to 10 ounces) as the 10 ounce amount allowed in medical has not been a public safety issue. Please remove the requirement to provide each individual customer with a manifest generated by the seed to sale tracking system as required under NCCR 7.050 and allow establishments to provide receipts generated by their own point of sale system. This provision is not necessary to maintain accurate records or provide customers with accurate information. Please remove the proposed additional restriction on delivery limiting orders to one (1) ounce per \"calendar day\" under NCCR 7.050(4). The current statutory requirement for cannabis purchases is one (1) ounce. There has not been a significant issue with purchase amounts so this would impose additional regulatory tracking and burdens unnecessarily. Please include specific timeframes to adjudicate operational decisions (product approvals, administrative holds, packaging approvals, transfers of interest, etc.). 521 S. 7TH STREET LAS VEGAS, NV 89101 RIANA@NVDISPENSE.COM 702.782.4180 Please consider incorporating the current provisions allowing curbside service to continue allowing retail stores to maximize social distancing. Patient Cards Please remove any additional proposed requirements to obtain a patient registry identification (\"patient card\") under NCCR 14 as medical patients are already required to obtain a card through the Division of Public and Behavioral Health, which imposes a process and fee that discourages many patients from obtaining a card. The NDA and its members have encouraged and supported measures that would promote the health of the medical marijuana program in Nevada and measures that render patient cards even more inaccessible would erode the success of the patient program and impose further barriers to medical marijuana patients. Miscellaneous Please provide a process in which the application for a license under Regulation 5 will be drafted and include a provision for gathering industry feedback in that process. CONCLUSION Thank you again for your time and consideration of the above comments and requests as well as the enclosed comments prepared by High Compliance on NDA's behalf. While all of the above comments and requests are noteworthy, some are more critical to the success of the regulatory framework. NDA respectfully requests the opportunity to further discuss those matters. Respectfully Submitted, Riana Durrett, Esq. 521 S. 7TH STREET LAS VEGAS, NV 89101 RIANA@NVDISPENSE.COM 702.782.4180 1 Proposed Regulations of the Cannabis Compliance Board (May 29, 2020) Inputs Submitted by G3 Labs, LLC (L007) Item Page Current Text Comments 1 15 1.155.3(b) \"...74oF (24 oC);...\" Please modify the text to: \"...74o+4 oF (24 o+2.2 o C);...\" The designated temperature needs to have an allowed range.

As written, there is no designation for a custodian. As observed, there is only the Agent's signature on the evidence seal. As such, the \"chain-\u00adof-\u00adcustody\" could only go from the Agent to the receiving party. 4 23 4.050.1(a)(1) \"Transporting cannabis in an unauthorized vehicle;\" Please clarify that this rule is not applicable to testing facilities. Samplers from testing facilities may use more than one vehicle. Apparently it is not feasible to \"authorize\" all the potential vehicles unless the authorization is granted by the responsible cannabis establishment. 5 24 4.050.1(a)(18) \"... storing cannabis from an unlicensed source...\" Please exempt patient samples and/or public verification samples (purchased from cannabis sales facilities) from this requirement. 6 38 5.075.3 \"Board Agents may enter...at any Please modify text to \"Board Agents may enter...at any time 2 time...\" during operation...\" Cannabis facilities such as testing labs do not operate 24/7 (anytime). 7 53 6.025.1 \"The Board may charge and collect a fee from any cannabis establishment that is involved in a complaint...\" Cannabis establishment shall not be charged fees when the complaint submitted is unsubstantiated. As written, \"tort\" complaints (even absent of malice) will cost an establishment the \"fees\" and potentially jeopardize the financial for the establishment, especially if deluged with frivolous claims. 8 58 6.080.2 \"Except as otherwise...\" Please exempt patient samples. As written, patients cannot submit samples to cannabis testing facilities, a cannabis establishment, for testing. 9 63~64 6.085.6 & 7 related to \"security manager or director\" Please provide clear guidance for when and where the required courses are available to satisfy such training to be qualified as security manager or director. As written, a cannabis establishment will have difficulty evaluating the qualifications and implementing any required trainings. 10 64 6.087.2 \"Not allow a person who does not possess a cannabis establishment agent registration card which is valid at the cannabis establishment to:...(b)...(d)...\" Please clarify that these requirements are not applicable to service providers such as instrument/supplies vendors, electrician, plumber, construction labors, etc. 11 65 6.090.1(b) \"If working directly ...\" Please clarify that this requirement is not applicable to a testing facility. 12 68 6.115 \"Prohibition on treating or adulterating usable cannabis with chemical or other compound.\" Please specify that testing facilities are exempt from this section. Testing facilities conduct testing by treating or adulterating 3 usable cannabis with chemical or other compounds. 13 76 8.010.1 \"...(a) all soil amendments, fertilizer, ...\" The information should also be provided in writing to testing facilities too. 14 81 9.040.3 \"...shall perform testing, as specified by the Board, to determine the shelf life of ....\" Please clarify that how does the \"appropriate Board Agent\" determine the applicable protocols for shelf life testing? 15 92 11.015.1(b)&(c) Maintaining independence of testing facilities CCB regulations need to add language that will hold C/P accountable for their invoices to testing facilities conducted quality assurance tests within certain time period, such as 30 days. Since the CCB regulations are mirroring the spirit of gaming regulations, it is important to prevent situations where testing facilities inadvertently lose the independence. As much as every effort is being made by the testing facilities to be compliant as \"independent\", the non-\u00adpayment and aged account receivables from cultivations/productions (C/P) are de facto having testing facilities to \"fund\" the operation of those C/P. 16 93 11.025.3 \"The Board may require an independent third party to inspect and/or...\" Please note that the Board should be responsible for the cost for such inspection and/or monitoring. 17 93 11.025.5 \"The Board Agents or an independent third party ...\" Please note that the Board should be responsible for the cost for such inspection. 18 95 11.040.4 \"To maintain continued licensure...with continued satisfactory performance as determined by the appropriate Board Agent.\" Please modify the text to \"To maintain continued licensure...with continued satisfactory results in participation of proficiency testing program.\" \"Proficiency\" and \"performance\" should not be used interchangeably. And 11.040 details the satisfactory of proficiency testing, therefore it is not necessary to burden 4 the \"Board Agent\" with the task to determine \"continued satisfactory.\" 19 95 11.040.8 \"successful participation includes an acceptable score for 100% of the target analytes...\" Please provide the technical basis for using 100% as the acceptable score. In the case of proficiency testing, 100% does not represent better operations.

June 9, 2020 To: Cannabis Compliance Board From: Jennifer DeLett -Snyder Join Together Northern Nevada 505 S. Arlington, Suite 110 Reno, NV 89509 775-324-7557 Comments: Overall the regulations appear to be thoughtful and well -intentioned. I have two areas for which I'd like to address: 1) CBD sales, and 2) drive -through dispensaries. Regarding CBD sales, I believe the state is losing much needed tax revenue by not enforcing CBD sales by non-dispensaries. In reviewing the proposed regulations, it appears CBD is to be sold at a cannabis dispensaries only. In Washoe County, CBD products are sold at myriad locations. In regard to drive -through dispensaries, the reg ulations do not address this function, yet there are dispensaries in the state that are operating drive -through sales. A Sun Valley location in north Reno has had a fully operational drive -through window for close to a year. The current NRS does not allow for drive -through sales, so I encourage the compliance board to review and address as appropriate. Sincerely, PM To: CCB Regulations Subject: Public commentary Hello, Overall the regulations look sound, if not a bit voluminous. Was there a cost study done to determine the impact of these regulations on a typical grower, distributor, manufacturer, etc? While the regulations appear to be a list of best practices,and that is great, smaller growers could be priced out of the market. Signed, A concerned citizen Cannabis patients desperately need your help because writing the state's cannabis regulations originally had been tasked to the industry lobbyists, themselves. When patients tried to find le gislative support by explaining that the marijuana attorneys and their monied agenda had failed to protect consumers and our communities, we were unilaterally instructed that all cannabis -related legislation must go through them, and no one else. As a resu lt, our cannabis patients have not been given proper consideration, because Nevada's Dispensary Association \" is not w illing to work on anything that may affect the current profit -margin of their clients\". So clearly there is dire need for new and improved regulatory oversight in Nevada. Cannabis patients hope the Cannabis Control Board will bear its weight to become the foundation from which the most serious issues of consumer safety and the safety of our communities, may be resolved in an objective reality, outside the political fray. FIRST AND FOREMOST WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER MUCH MORE STRINGENT CONSEQUENCES FOR CANNABIS ESTABLISHMENTS UPON ALL VIOLATION(S): The penalties are MUCH too low. We feel a mere slap on the wrist isn't going to b ring the teeth we've most definitely needed in order to protect the public from nefarious business practice. So far, serious health violations have gone completely ignored because the cannabis lab owners themselves were granted total control over establish ing the industry's initial testing standards. (Hence all the recalls.) In fact, Nevada's Independent Laboratory Advisory Committee (ILAC) was presented with many subject matter experts brought in by the Department of Agriculture who explained why ignoring scientific data shouldn't be accepted as this industry's practice, yet we've seen no resolve. Instead, we've seen the ILAC amend its meeting bylaws to exclude public input, and then they closed their doors to all. Nevada's regulatory framework should not again be allowed to fail the public! As patients, we mean the board no disrespect, but the fines and penalties as presently written, make it appear as if the industry's lobbyists are still being given all power in crafting the state's cannabis law. We're presenting the following amendments as follows, with the new language introduced, underlined. Page 47 5.125 Policies and procedures for waiving requirement to obtain a cannabis agent registration card for any owner, officer and board member who hold s an ownership interest of less than 5 percent. We insist that family members (to include ex-spouses ) and those people who have live - in relationships with an establishment owner are not granted complete anonymity, even if they live out of state, appeari ng to exert no influence or control. Subsection 2.) A certification by the cannabis establishment that the person who holds an ownership interest of less than 5 percent is not a family member, is not in a close personal relationship with, and does not exert control or hold a position of authority over the cannabis establishment and any of the other persons who claim ownership in the cannabis establishment; and PAGE 74 7.050 Delivery to consumer: Restrictions; duties of cannabis establishment agent making delivery. Allowing delivery to doctors' offices, places of medical and therapeutic care and private clubs which are 21+ and do not hold a gaming license would allow for a much broader economic impact on all Nevada business. There's little value to our community in regulating the entire billion -dollar industry into the hands of the politically connected. Subsection 4.) A cannabis sales facility may only deliver cannabis or cannabis products to a private residence, licensed medical and therapeutic offices, licensed non-gaming adult -only (21+) public establishments, bed & breakfasts, hotels & motels , and shall not deliver more than 1 ounce of cannabis or an equivalent amount of cannabis products to any consumer in one calendar day. Pages 97 -100: It's extremely odd t hat our state's informational chart specifically references NCR 67B.786 many times but where is that information to be gleaned for the public's view? Concerned citizens should have access to the exact testing standards labs adhere to. In fact, let me make you aware that our state's cannabis patients have been begging to see Chromium added to the list of heavy metals because it's sloughing off from the equipment used during extraction. And we also want to see Nickel banned (even at low levels) because it's a cting as the catalyst in creating \"accidental chemical synthesis\" during various downstream processes. Patients also want the CCB to know that from the start of cannabis' regulatory inception, lab owners have been allowed to call all the shots in establi shing testing standards (through the ILAC) while purposely hiding the important information about what's really going on... even though it meant completely ignoring the scientific data and all the subject matter experts presented to the ILAC at my behest, by the Department of Agriculture in 2018. But now YOU can immediately help to ensure consumer safety by simply requiring cultivation facilities also document the specific timetable to which any chemicals have been applied. It will almost immediately help avoid some of the problems being experienced at this time. Because cannabis plants soak up (much like a sponge) everything sprayed onto them especially during the flowering stage, those chemicals can affect everything in the downstream processes (as it doe s in the case of Nickel). Chemicals not broken down during cultivation will cause \"accidental chemical synthesis\" during processing for which the industry has no remedy in sight. Which is also why cannabis patients want the pesticide and chemical additive information presented along with the labs' COA at point of purchase. Medical patients who suffer with immune compromised health NEED to know what we're ingesting so that we may protect our health at all times. In that vein now we'll go back a few pages a nd propose the following (new language is underlined) in order to increase corporate accountability: Page 59 6.080 Inventory control system; authorized sources for acquisition of cannabis and cannabis products; duties of establishment if loss incurred; m aintenance and availability of documentation: 5(d) (6) A list of all chemical additives used in the cultivation, i ncluding, without limitation, non organic pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers along with the frequency and timetable to which the chemic als and additives were applied. Page 75 & 76 8.010 Required written disclosure with each lot of usable cannabis; provision of free samples to cannabis sales facility; applicability of provisions governing excise tax on cannabis to free samples: Subsection 1 (a) \"All soil amendments, fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, and other crop production aids applied to the growing medium or cannabis plant included in the lot showing the timetable to which they were applied; and\" Page 90 10.075 Cannabi s establishment: Establishment of and adherence to written procedures for sanitation; requirement to retain person who is certified applicator of pesticides: Please add to subsection 1: (c) Establishing the timetables to which each chemical may or may n ot be allowed for use during cultivation and maintaining a log for each crop/harvest. Page 112 12.050 Cannabis sales facility: Required disclosures and warnings: Subsection 1.) A Cannabis sales facility must provide with all useable cannabis sold at retail accompanying material that discloses any pesticides/fungicides/growth regulators applied to the cannabis plants and growing medium during production and processi ng and the timetable to which they were applied if they were applied during the plants' flowering period. Page 91 11.010 Employment, qualifications and duties of scientific director; inspection of testing facility upon appointment of new director: Subs ection 6.) The scientific director must be on the premises of the testing facility for a full 8 hour shift at least 8 workdays each month. I very much look forward to meeting our Cannabis Control Board in person the very first chance we all get. Patien ts are very excited to meet each and every one of you and I promise to do my best in not seeming too intense b ecau se the fact is I mean to be kind. Certainly , you've nothing but the hardest and most thankless work ahead of you, so I mean to lend you kind and loving support, as only your community can. Sincerely.

Washington Avenue Las Vegas, Nevada 89101 RE: Proposed Regulations of the Cannabis Compliance Board QUESTIONS & COMMENTS After careful review, the proposed regulations offer more clarity where the use of more explicit language and term inology has been added . Flower One Holdings seeks additional insight into proposed regulations below: 6.015 BOARD AUTHORIZED TO L IMIT CANNABIS PRODUC TION WITHIN STATE. The Board may, upon findings made following a public hearing that the public interest will be supported by limiting the cultivation of cannabis in this State, limit the amount of cannabis in production within this State. 6.015: It is uncertain if this \"authorization to limit \" cannabis cultivation and produc tion is geared toward license limits for producers (E.g., Cultivation /Production) , or if the regulation seeks to reduce the caps on output at a given time to include any future and current licensed cultivator s. It would be beneficial if the Board could provide additional color as to how this regulation would solve an existing or anticipated problem ? Or, if the problem is unknown, what the implications would be in terms of outcomes ; meaning what would most likely be produced from limitations placed on cannabis cultivation , and specifically what types of cultivators or producers would be limited under this moratorium. 6.020 LIMITATIONS ON PROMOT ING CANNABIS AND CAN NABIS PRODUCTS . 1. A cannabis establishment: (a) May only promote cannabis or a cannabis product thr ough marketing the laboratory results on the label of the cannabis or cannabis product; and (b) Must not use an independent testing laboratory or other laboratory to promote any other attributes of cannabis or a cannabis product. (c) Mus t not make any health claims including but not limited to healing, curing, treating or reducing risk of any illness or health related condition. Cannabis Compliance Board (CCB) Proposed regulations 1 -15 FLOWER ONE HOLDINGS INC | 3950 North Bruce Street | North Las Vegas, Nevada | 89030 | For all enquiries: flowerone.com Page 2 of 3 6.020: It appears this regulation may be intended to address a potential problem with cannabis products being promoted as dietary supplements, or to remove the use of misleading consumer marketing /advertising terminology to extinguish the risk of consumer fraud in the market. FDA F ood Labeling & Nutrition regulations provide guidance for , evidence -based review system for proper Scientific Evaluation of Health Claims . This provides the economic and regulatory precedent to allow for instance s where qualified health claims (QHCs) may be allow ed when supported by sound scientific evidence - even when failing to meet the exalted, more rigorous \"significant scientific agreement\" standard required for an authorized health claim . To ensure that these claims are not misleading, they must be accompanied by a disclaimer or other qualifying language to accurately communicate to consumers the level of scientific evidence supporting the claim . There is ongoing scientific research into the medicinal and health benefits of cannabis, specifically target ing the investigation and study of cannabis mixtures and phenotypes and their potential health impacts. The Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research (CMCR) in San Diego, CA, is working to fund primary and pilot cannabis -related studies that further enhance the understanding of the efficacy a s well as adverse effects of cannabis and cannabinoids as pharmacological agents for the treatment of medical and psychiatric disorders, and their po tential public health impacts . The FDA has approved several drugs that contain individual cannabinoids , such as Epidiolex, which contains a purified form of CBD derived from cannabis, was approved for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox -Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome, two rare and severe forms of epilepsy. And Marinol and Syndros, which contain dronabinol (synthetic THC), and Cesamet, which contains nabilone (a synthetic substance like THC), are approved by the FDA. Dronabinol and nabilone are used to treat nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy. Dronabinol is also used to treat loss of appetite and weight loss in people with HIV/AIDS. Has the Board created these regulations using the best available scientific, technical, economic, and other information ? More accurate and precise information leads to a better understanding of the problem and more effective regulatory outcomes. This type of information is useful both when determining the need for the regulation s and assessing the impacts of th ose regulation s. Scientists, economists, technical experts, and others can improve proposed rules by helping to prevent unnecessary regulat ion offering expert advice and opinion, citing published reports, or providing relevant data or evidence regarding the effects of a proposed rule or the need for the rule. Is the Board open to building a process to allow for emergent research and double -blind scientific study data to be submitted for pre -evaluation to provide a means to investigate or crea te a process by which cannabis product claims would be allowed under explicit conditions ?

Due to the lengthy lead times for packaging materials and the recent COVID -19 pandemic events, sizable financial investments have been made to place orders f or packaging that complies with existing requirements. We currently estimate a year ( 365 days ) before we could fully deplete our current inventory of packaging materials. Could the Board offer some clarity as to when this new requirement will would go into effect ? Does the Board plan to issue a transitional grace period to allow producers and sales outlets enough time to deplete their current stock of packaging printed with the \"MARJIUANA\" warning labels ?

The attached sets forth our comments. GreenMart and VVGN also join in the comments provided by the Nevada Dispensary Association. Regards, /s/ Margaret A. McLetchie Margaret A. McLetchie 1 Cannabis Compliance Board Comments to Proposed Regulations Proposed Regulatory Revision Comment 2.040 Appearances 1. Except as provided in subsection 2 or unless an appearance is waived by the Chair, all persons, or their attorneys or agents, if any, must appear at the Board meeting at which their matter is to be heard. Requests for waivers of appearances must be in writing, must be received by the executive assistant no later than eight business days before the meeting, and must explain in detail the reasons for requesting the waiver. If at the time of its meeting the Board has any questions of an applicant, licensee, or registrant who has been granted a waiver and is not present, the matter may be deferred to another meeting of the Board. For con venience, attorneys should be able to represent clients at Board meetings without clients being present. 2.040 Appearances 3. Unless an appearance is waived by the Chair, all persons, or their attorneys or agents, if any, must appear at the Board meeting at which their matter is to be heard. Requests for waivers of appearances must be in writing, must be received by the executive assistant no later than eight business days before the meeting, and must explain in detail the reasons for requesting th e waiver. If at the time of its meeting the Board has any questions of an applicant, licensee, or registrant who has been granted a waiver and is not present, the matter may be deferred to another meeting of the Board. For convenience, attorneys should be able to represent clients at Board meetings without clients being present. 2.060 Employee records. 1. All records concerning Board employees maintained by the Board are confidential as set out in NAC 284.718. 2. Access to employee records declared confidential by this section shall be allowed only as set out in NAC 284.726. Board employees and activities normally subject to the Nevada Public Records Request Act (\"NPRA\") should continue to be subject to the NPRA. Their activities are not ent itled to any more confidentiality than other state agencies. 4.030 Imposition of civil penalty; revocation or suspension of license or cannabis establishment agent registration card; corrective action. 1. (c) If corrective action approved by the Board wil l cure the noncompliance or violation but will not be completed within 30 days after issuance of the order, suspend for more than 30 days the license of a cannabis establishment or the cannabis establishment agent registration card of a person who fails to comply with or violates the provisions of the NCCR and Title 56 of NRS. To ensure sufficient time for corrective action, 60 days should be provided to cannabis establishments to cure any noncompliance. 2 Proposed Regulatory Revision Comment 4.100 Reinstatement of license or cannabis establishment agent registration card: Application; conditions, limitations or restrictions upon reinstatement; denial. 1. If a person applies for reinstatement of a license or cannabis establishment agent registration card that has been revoked pursuant t o this chapter, the person shall: (a) Submit an application on a form supplied by the Board. (b) Satisfy all the current requirements for the issuance of an initial license or cannabis establishment agent registration card. (c) Attest that, in this State o r any other jurisdiction: (1) The person has not, during the period of revocation, violated any state or federal law relating to cannabis, and no criminal or civil action involving such a violation is pending against the person; and (2) No other regulatory body has, during the period of revocation, taken disciplinary action against the person, and no such disciplinary action is pending against the person. (d) Satisfy any additional requirements for reinstatement of the license or cannabis establishment agen t registration card prescribed by the Board. An applicant for reinstatement of a license or registration agent card should not be required to attest that they have not violated any federal law as mere possession of cannabis violates federal law. 5.015 Qualifications for licensure. 1. In addition to the considerations in NRS 678B.200 and NRS 678B.280, the Board may consider the following in determining whether any person qualifies to receive a license under the provisions of chapter 678B of the NRS: (a) The adequacy of the person's business competence and experience for the role or position for which application is made; (b) The unsuitable affiliates of the person applying for the license even if the person is found suitable by the Board, but ass ociates with, or controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, an unsuitable person; (c) The adequacy of the proposed funding for the nature of the proposed operations; and (d) The suitability of the source of funding unless the person sa tisfies the Board that the source of funding: (1) Is a person of good character, honesty, and integrity; (2) Is a person whose background, reputation and associations will not result in adverse publicity for the State of Nevada and its cannabis industry; a nd (e) The Board may consider any other qualifications or behavior of the person that the Board determines is inconsistent with the declared policy of the State. The proposed regulations should more narrowly define \"unsuitable.\" The Board could still maint ain discretion, but unsuitable is too broad and allows for too much subjectivity. 3 Proposed Regulatory Revision Comment 5.100 Grounds for denial of issuance or renewal of license; grounds for revocation of license; notice; opportunity to correct situation. 2. (c) An owner, officer or board me mber of the cannabis establish intentionally provides information that the Board determines is false or misleading; or 5. Before denying an application for issuance or renewal of a license for a cannabis establishment or revoking such a license as a result of the actions of an owner, officer or board member of the cannabis establishment pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 or paragraph (b) of subsection 2, the Board shall provide the cannabis establishment with an opportunity to correct the situation. The Board should only be able to revoke a license for the intentional provision of false or misleading information. Alternatively, the Board should only be able to revoke a license for the negligent provision of false or misleading information. 5.110 Req uirements for transfer of all or a portion of ownership interest; reimbursement of costs to Board; notice to Board; disclosure of facts pertaining to representative capacity of certain persons to Board; permission of Board required for registering certain information in the books and records of the cannabis establishment; investigation. 6. A person without a valid cannabis establishment agent registration card for a cannabis establishment shall notify the Board prior to any: (a) Transfer or conveyance of any interest of 5 percent or greater in or to a cannabis establishment, or any portion thereof of 5 percent or greater; or (b) investment therein resulting in an ownership interest of five percent or greater; or (c) exercise of a significant level of control over; or (d) participation in the profits of five percent or greater thereof by or to any person acting as agent or trustee or in any other representative capacity for or on behalf of another person. Such notification must disclose of all facts pertaining to such action, including, without limitation, a description of the reason for the transfer and any contract or other agreement describing the transaction. Such person must be issued a cannabis establishment agent registration card for th e cannabis establishment at issue, on approval by the Board of the proposed action. A person without an agent registration card should only be required to notify the Board of transfers, investments, or profit participation of 5% or greater in a cannabis establishment. Employees, agents, personal representatives, lenders or holders of indebtedness of a cannabis licensee should be required to obtain agent cards but not apply for licenses. 4 Proposed Regulatory Revision Comment 5.120 Submission of information by cannabis establishment to obtain or renew registration card for person employed by or contracted with establishment or for volunteer; fingerprinting and application fee; issuance of registration card; temporary registration. 3. An officer and board member who wishe s to hold an ownership interest in a cannabis establishment of less than 5 percent shall submit to the Board an application on a form prescribed by the Board. The application must be accompanied by: 4. A cannabis establishment shall notify the Board within 10 business days after a cannabis establishment agent ceases to hold an ownership interest in the cannabis establishment of 5 percent or greater, be employed by, volunteer at or provide labor as a cannabis establishment agent to the cannabis establishment . An owner who wishes to acquire less than a 5% interest in a cannabis establishment should not be required to submit an application to the Board unless such acquisition results in the owner owning greater than a 5% interest in the cannabis establishment in the aggregate. Alternatively, only an owner who wishes to acquire less than a 5% interest in a cannabis establishment should be required to submit an application to the Board only if the owner will also direct the operations of the cannabis establishme nt. 5.125 Policies and procedures for waiving requirement to obtain a cannabis agent registration card for any owner, officer and board member who holds an ownership interest of greater than 5 percent. 1. The Board may waive the requirement to obtain a ca nnabis agent registration card for any person who holds an ownership interest of greater than 5 percent in a cannabis establishment if: (a) The cannabis establishment requests waiver of the requirement on a form prescribed by the Board, including the follo wing information: (1) An explanation as to why the cannabis agent registration card requirement should be waived for the person who holds an ownership interest of greater than 5 percent; (2) A certification by the cannabis establishment that the person who holds an ownership interest of greater than 5 percent does not exert control or hold a position of authority over the cannabis establishment and any of the other persons who claim ownership in the cannabis establishment; and (3) Any other information requ ested by the Board necessary to promote the health, safety, morals, good order and general welfare of the inhabitants of the State of Nevada and the declared policy of this State. An owner who owns less than a 5% interest in a cannabis establishment should not be required to obtain an agent registration card. Alternatively, only an owner who owns less than a 5% interest in a cannabis establishment and directs the operations of the cannabis establishment should be required to obtain an agent registration ca rd. 6.020 Limitations on promoting cannabis and cannabis products. 1. A cannabis establishment: (a) May only promote cannabis or a cannabis product through marketing the laboratory results on the label of the cannabis or cannabis product; and (b) Must not use an independent testing laboratory or other laboratory to promote any other attributes of cannabis or a cannabis product. (c) Must not make any health claims including but not limited to healing, curing, treating or reducing risk of any illness or h ealth related condition. Subsection 1(a) seems like it could pose potential First Amendment problems. The deletion of \"through marketing the\" will eliminate any ambiguity that cannabis products can be advertised as set forth in Section 6.120. 5 Proposed Regulatory Revision Comment 6.025 Board authorized to collect fee for costs for oversight; hourly rate. 3. As used in this section, \"substantiated\" means supported or established by evidence or proof. The term \"substantiated\" should be defined or clarified. For example, does this mean a defici ency was issued or an order was by the Board? 6.060 Operation in accordance with plans and specifications included in application; deviation from plans and specifications; documentation of change to facilities; inspection or audit of change to facilities. 2. A cannabis establishment may operate in a manner that deviates from the plans or specifications included within its application for a license if the change would comply with state and local laws, regulations and ordinances and , if the deviation is mate rial, the cannabis establishment provides the Board with a written notification of its intent to make the change which includes, without limitation: (a) The name, physical address and license number of the cannabis establishment; and (b) A description of t he proposed change. Cannabis establishments should only be required to notify the Board of material deviations to plans or specifications within its application. 6.070 Persons authorized on premises; visitor identification badge and other requirements for other persons; maintenance and availability of visitor log. 7. Live animals shall be allowed on the premises only under the following conditions: (a) Decorative fish in aquariums (b) Patrol dogs accompanying police or security officers (c) In areas that are not used for cannabis storage or preparation, and that are usually open for customers, including but not limited to sales areas, service animals that are controlled by the disabled employee or consumer, if a health or safety hazard will not result from the presence or activities of the service animal. (d) Nothing in this Section shall be construed, or in conflict, with the Americans with Disability Act. Paragraph 7, Section d should state, \"Nothing in this Section shall be construed to supersede, o r be in conflict with, the Americans with Disability Act. 6.085 Required security measures, equipment and personnel; location of outdoor cultivation facility must allow for response by local law enforcement. 3. A cannabis establishment shall make a reaso nable effort to repair any malfunction of security equipment within 72 hours after the malfunction is discovered. A cannabis establishment shall notify the Board and local law enforcement within 24 hours after a malfunction is discovered and provide a plan of correction. Failure to make a reasonable effort to correct a malfunction within 72 hours after the malfunction is discovered is a violation of this section. The first sentence of subsection 3 of Section 6.085 requires a cannabis establishment to make a \"reasonable effort to repair any malfunction of security equipment within 72 hours.\" Accordingly, the second sentence of subsection 3 of Section 6.085 should mirror the \"reasonable effort\" standard set forth in the first sentence o f subsection 3 of Section 6.085. 6 Proposed Regulatory Revision Comment 6.090 Cleanliness and health of cannabis establishment agents. 3. A cannabis establishment agent shall not work directly with concentrated cannabis or cannabis products if the cannabis establishment agent has: (a) A sympto m of gastrointestinal infection, including, without limitation, diarrhea or vomiting; (b) A sore throat with fever; (c) Jaundice; or (d) A lesion that appears inflamed or contains pus, including, without limitation, a boil or infected wound that is not cov ered with: (1) An impermeable cover and a single -use glove if the lesion is on a hand or wrist, both of which must be changed at any time that hand washing is required; (2) An impermeable cover if the lesion is on an arm; or (3) A dry, durable, tight -fitting bandage if the lesion is on another part of the body. Please consider adding coughing in light of efforts to reduce the spread of Covid -19. 6.120 Restrictions on advertising; required posting of signs in cannabis sales facility. 1. A cannabis establishment: (a) Shall not engage in advertising which contains any statement or illustration that: (1) Is false or misleading; (2) Promotes overconsumption of cannabis or cannabis products; (3) Depicts the actual consumption of what appears to be cannab is or cannabis products; or (4) Depicts a child or other person who appears to be less than 21 years of age consuming cannabis or cannabis products or objects suggesting the presence of a child, including, without limitation, toys, characters or cartoons, or contains any other depiction which is designed in any manner to be appealing to or encourage consumption of cannabis or cannabis products by a person who is less than 21 years of age. (b) Shall not advertise in any publication or on radio, television or any other medium if 30 percent or more of the audience of that medium is reasonably expected to be persons who are less than 21 years of age. (c) Shall not place an advertisement: (1) Within 1,000 feet of a public or private school, playground, public par k or library, but may maintain such an advertisement if it was initially placed before the school, playground, public park or library was located within 1,000 feet of the location of the advertisement; (2) On or inside of a motor vehicle used for public tr ansportation or any shelter for public transportation; Under definition of \"public transportation\" this would appear to ban advertisement on taxis. Please clarify that advertisements on taxis are permitted. 7 Proposed Regulatory Revision Comment 7.020 Valid proof of identification of age of co nsumer required. 3. Identification presented to satisfy subsection 1 must be a valid and unexpired: (a) Driver's license or instruction permit issued by this State or any other state or territory of the United States; (b) Identification card issued by this State or any other state or territory of the United States for the purpose of proof of age of the holder of the card; (c) United States military identification card; (d) A Merchant Mariner Credential or other similar document issued by the United States C oast Guard; (e) A passport issued by, or recognized by, the United States Government or a permanent resident card issued by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Board of Homeland Security; or (f) A tribal identification card issued by a tribal government, as defined in NRS 239C.105, which requires proof of the age of the holder of the card for issuance. Please consider accepting international identification, including passports and other government issued identification. 7.050 Delivery to consumer: Restrictions; duties of cannabis establishment agent making delivery. 1. A cannabis sales facility shall not deliver more than 5 ounces of cannabis or an equivalent amount of cannabis products to any combination of consumers within a single trip. 2. A medical cannabis sales facility shall not deliver more than 10 ounces of cannabis, edible cannabis products or cannabis -infused products, or any combination thereof when making a sales delivery exclusively to person s who hold a valid registry identification card or designated as a primary caregiver. These limits should be raised substantially or eliminated as the current limit has not been established as necessary to protect public safety. The current limit is arbitr ary and does not increase public safety especially given that a vehicle can carry 10 ounces of medical cannabis. A person committing theft is not concerned as to whether the cannabis is medical or adult use and thus the limit should be the same. In additio n, an increase would promote efficiency, which is beneficial to a regulated market and necessary to compete with illegal market operators. Memo to: CCB Memo from: MM Development Company, Inc. dba Planet 13 Subject: Comments to Proposed Regulations 1 -15. Background On May 29, 2020, the Cannabis Compliance Board (or \"CCB\") sent notice seeking input from interested parties on proposed regulations 1 -15. The deadline provided for comments was 5:00 p.m. PST on June 9, 2020, and are to be written and emailed to regulations@ccb.nv.gov . MM Development Company, Inc. dba Planet 13 (or \"MMDC\") is a Nevada licensed dispensary, cultivation, production, and distribution operator in Nevada , owned 100% by publicly traded British Columb ia corporation Planet 13 Holdings, Inc., ticker symbol PLTH on the Canadian Securities Exchange. We appreciate this opportunity to provide comment. Regulation 1, and corresponding Regulation 6, Specific Comments Regarding Definition of Public Transportat ion and Taxicabs Section 1.195(4) definition and implications for Section 6.120(c)(2): Section 1.195(4) defines \"Public Transportation\" as including \"Other forms of transportation which charge a fare and are available to the public.\" We request that taxic abs as defined at NRS 706.124 be specifically excluded from the definition of public transportation. Section 6.120(1)(c)(2) states that \" A cannabis establishment ... Shall not place an advertisement ... On or inside of a motor vehicle used for public transpo rtation ... \" Under cannabis statute s, taxicabs are specifically excluded from the definition of public transportation under 678D.430(7), which states, \" As used in this section, \"motor vehicle used for public transportation\" does not include a taxicab, as def ined in NRS 706.124. \" Cab companies were deemed not to be public transportation by the Nevada Department of Tax during the years 2018, 2019, and in 2020 through the current date, a finding which has remained uncontested through the current date. We agree with this prior determination. Historically in Nevada , cannabis companies have used cab company wraps in compliance with NRS 453A, 453D, and corresponding regulations to advertise the licensee brand and location. MMDC also points out the implications of further advertising restrictions and how even a highly regulated privileged industry must have access to commercial free speech. Regulation 4, General Comments Regarding Penalty Framework Comment 1, Penalty Framework. Under Regulation 4.030(2) there is a process described to determine the civil penalty amount \"To determine the amount of a civil penalty assessed pursuant to this section, the Board will consider the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or saving s, if any, resulting from the violation, the size of the business of the violator, the history of compliance with the NCCR and Title 56 of NRS by the violator, action taken to remedy the violation, the effect of the penalty on the ability of the violator t o continue in business and any other matter as justice may require.\" Commenter support s the inclusion of these factors and the weighing and balancing that the Board and its agents propose to undertake. Regulation 4.035 through 4.060 establishes penaltie s based on category of violations, inclusive of suspension, revocation, and civil penalty amounts. Each of these regulations includes language that states, \"Before consideration of the factors described in subsection 1(a), the Board will presume that the following are appropriate penalties for violations of the NCCR and Title 56 of NRS\", which appears to nullify the more thoughtful and measured approach to each unique determination of statutory and regulatory violations by licensees under 4.030(2). We re quest that the presumption that the maximum penalty is appropriate be replaced with language that the \"After analysis of the factors under Regulation 4.030(2), the Board may determine the appropriate penalties for violations of the NCCR and Title 56 of NRS , up to the following amounts, which determination shall be presumed an appropriate penalty for the violation.\" Furthermore, we request that the Board reduce the civil penalty upper limits and reduce the penalty escalation framework from three years to two years. Regulation 5, Specific Comment Regarding Public Company and <5% Owners Without Control Under Regulation 5.125, the Board has the authority to waive agent cards for <5% owners. We support this initial position, but believe further adjustment is required to make public company ownership reporting and verification achievable. MMDC, as a subsidiary of Planet 13 Holdings, Inc., requests a regulatory presumption , such presumption revocable by the Board in its sole discretion, that <5% stockholders of a public company that a) is an owner of a subsidiary licensee of the public company or b) the public company is the licensee, shall not be required be listed as an owner by individual name or to apply for agent cards, unless such <5% stockholder is als o a Director, Employee, or Officer . It would be problematic for a public company to meet th e proposed regulatory requirement, specifically with regards to objecting beneficial owners who purchase stock in the markets through a broker intermediary and sel l the stock without any disclosure of their name or contact information made available to the licensee. An easily understood example would be an objecting beneficial owner day - trader, whose name will not be released by the broker dealer, and only owns the stock for a short period. A beneficial owner of a security is someone who has a security held by a financial intermediary. This tends to be the individual's broker, or, in some cases, it may be another financial intermediary the person is associated wit h. An objecting beneficial owner (OBO) instructs the financial intermediary who holds the securities to not provide the owner's name and personal information to the company that issued the securities. A non -objecting beneficial owner (NOBO) agrees to allow their personal information to be released to the company. For a company such as Planet 13 Holdings, Inc., shareholders own interests either directly in their name, or through a broker dealer in Canada . In order to for Planet 13 Holdings, Inc. to penetra te th e broker dealer beneficial ownership shield, the stockholder must file forms with the broker dealer stating they are a Non-Objecting Beneficial Owner. For voting purposes at the annual shareholders meeting, Planet 13 Holdings, Inc. requires that all beneficial owners who desire to cast a vote at the annual shareholders meeting must be a non -objecting beneficial owner, or hold their shares through direct ownership registered through a transfer agent. If the shareholder is an objecting beneficial owner , they are not allowed to vote on the board members who will oversee the corporation, and thus exert no control over the entity. In lieu of the requirement for reporting <5% owners, MMDC proposes that public companies holding ownership interests in licensees can annually submit a a) the name, audited financial statements, and securities registration of the public company, b) a list of >5% individual persons who are direct or beneficial owners, b) the financial intermediary and broker dealers holding accounts on behalf of beneficial shareholders through the Canadian Depository for Securities Ltd. (CDS Limited) , accompanied by an attes tation by the public company that no <5% shareholder that is not also an Officer, Employee, or Director exerts control over the Licensee. It is important to note, that financial brokers, banks, and financial intermediaries have a strict \"know - your -custome r\" statutory and regulatory framework to ensure invested proceeds are not illegally sourced. Furthermore, if the >5% beneficial owner is an OBO, then they do not have the ability to vote their share, and thus, do not have any form of actual (by vote) or p erceived (by virtue of holding such a small interest in a publicly traded company) control over the license. This is an important issue, as public company investor funds and liquidity are a source of capital that will create jobs, infrastructure, and tax base in Nevada. Regulation 6, Quarterly Inventory and Sales Reporting Deadline Comment 1 , MMDC respectfully notes that 15 days after the quarter close may not be sufficient time to assemble inventory reports, reconcile, and then submit to the CCB. Proposal 1: Set a 1 -month deadline following the quarter close. Proposal 2: Allow for a notice p rocedure from licensee to obtain a once per quarter two-week extension. Regulation 7, Cannabis Sales Facility Sales Comment 1 , minor proposed edit regarding regulatory framework and drafting format . Regulation 7.015 should be edited to state: \"7.015 Dut ies of cannabis establishment agent before sale to consumer. Before a cannabis establishment agent sells cannabis or cannabis products to a consumer, the cannabis establishment agent shall 1. Verify the age of the consumer in accordance with Regulation 7.020; 2. Offer any ...\" If the above edit is adopted, we advise CCB to add the approved verification scanner language to Regulation 7.020. Comment 2, regarding sales limits, Regulation 7.025. CCB must add clarification - as currently worded this could be a l imit on all future sales to that same customer over any time period. On information and belief, the intent of the drafter was that each sales transaction would not exceed the stated limits. For example, Customer A enters into a dispensary, and purchases an ounce of usable cannabis product, and then departs the facility. The customer can return at a later time for and make a purchase for another ounce at each subsequent visit. Alternatively, CCB can look to the same limiting language established at Reg. 7.050(4) , i.e. a one ounce delivery in a 24 hour period . Comment 3, Increase of 5 oz limit on recreational sales to 10 oz Absent a compelling basis (for example, a clear correlation between health, security, or safety), the 5 oz delivery transportation limit for adult -use cannabis should match the 10 oz medical limit. There would be no additional security risk when compared to transportation of 10 oz medical cannabis deliveries, and significant cost benefits to companies offering deliveries, which savi ngs could be passed on to customers and would increase competition among companies offering delivery. This would also serve to have a muting effect on large cannabis company monopolies in Nevada. Comment 4, Regulation 7.050, Definition of Gaming Operato r The definition of gaming license should match the Title 56 definitions, being \"a nonrestricted gaming license described in subsection 1 or 2 of NRS 463.0177\" and not the overly broad definition provided herein being \"a gaming license, as defined in NRS 463.0159\" Comment 5, Regulation 7.0 50, Accident reporting Two hours may not be sufficient time to resolve the accident and then report to the accident. In lieu of the two hour requirement, we propose a reasonableness standard, but not to exceed 12 hours. Proposed Regulation 7.050(9) Each cannabis establishment agent delivering cannabis or cannabis products must: (a) Report to a person designated by the cannabis establishment to receive such reports any motor vehicle crash that occurs during the delivery as soon as reasonably possible afte r the crash occurs, but in no instance shall such time to report exceed 12 hours; Regulation 15, Minor Edit - reference to gaming regulations. Pointing out for drafters, no comment otherwise.

Minnesota, Suite J Creating results for clients throughout the Silver State Carson City, Nevada 89703 June 9, 2020 Honorable Michael L. Douglas, Chairman, Cannabis Compliance Board Tyler Klimas, Executive Director, Cannabis Compliance Board 555 E. Washington Street Las Vegas, Nevada 89101 Dear Sirs: I am reaching out to you on behalf of N2 Packaging LLC (N2 Pack), a cannabis packaging company that already operates in over 20 different state cannabis markets. N2 Pack had previously entered the Nevada marketplace but was unable to continue its operation s as there needed to be some additional clarity provided to the Marijuana Enforcement Division (MED) about N2 Pack and their process. Specifically, the MED expressed concern over N2 Pack's process and how its reduced oxygen packaging environment might inte ract with cannabis and cannabis products. Additional conversations were undertaken with MED, now the Cannabis Compliance Board (CCB, the Board). It appears that with the addition of section 9.025 sub 4, the Board is demonstrating an abundance of caution related to cannabis product manufacturing. Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plans are standard in certain food packaging situations in order to prevent contamination. However, cannabis regulations already address this issue in 1.155 [fo r reference, provided below]. Because the ingredients being processed by N2 Pack in it reduced oxygen packaging process qualify for the exclusions from the definition of 'potentially hazardous cannabis product and ingredients' presented in 1.155 subsectio n 3, it is therefore not necessary for a HACCP plan when reduced oxygen is the processing method. While positive in its intent, given that it is not possible for contaminants to enter cannabis that is already in a sealed container, this is excess regulati on. Also, none of the 20 states in which N2 Pack is already active require a HACCP plan. Therefore, it is recommended that the second sentence of 9.025 sub 4 be removed, as it is unnecessary. Alternatively, this sentence could be substituted: Those pr ocesses that are packaging cannabis products that meet the exclusions listed in 1.115 3. are exempt from the HACCP plan requirement. Silver State Government Relations Silver State Government Relations 204 N. Minnesota, Suite J Creating results for clients throughout the Silver Sta te Carson City, Nevada 89 703 \"4. A cannabis product manufacturing facility preparing menu items that require a HACCP plan as determined by the appropriate Board Agent must be approved by a processing authority prior to submission. Special processes requiring a HACCP plan include, but are not limited to, canning, reduced oxygen packaging, and other processes as determined by the appropriate Board Agent.\" Respectfully, Will Adler, Principal of Silver State Government Relations, on behalf of Scott Martin, CEO, N2 Packaging Systems, LLC Comments on the proposed regulations of the Cannabis Com pliance Board : 1. I do not see it required in the proposed regulations, but so the CCB is aware every person that currently requests an agent card is required to get two of the same sets of fingerprints taken every year, one set of fingerprints for medical and one set for recreational. We get charged for two of the same sets of fingerprints every time we apply for an agent card. Why is one set of fingerprints and background check not satisfactory for both medical and recreational licenses? This is unnecessary and every person in the cannabis industry is required to do it . 2. With regards to Definition 1.125 Defining Lot, I request that the lo t size of flower be increased from 5 pounds a lot to 10 pounds a lot and that the Trim lot size be increased from 15 pounds a lot to 30 pounds a lot. These lot sizes were originally arbitrarily decided on and inc reasing the size does not create a public safety issue. Cultivators can grow hundreds of pounds of finished flower of the same strain at the same time in the same room which will yield the same or similar results for all of the finished product. So being forced to lab te st every 5 pounds of the same strain of flower is unreasonable and only adds costs to the end consumer. 3. The 15% Excise tax on wholesale cannabis should be charged at 15% of the actual sale for an arm's length transactions and not based on a market ra te set by the department that is based on data that is 6 -8 months old. The market rate set by the department is not reflective of the current market rate and market conditions and results in cultivation facilities payin g significantly higher than what NAC 372A and NRS 372 A intend ed which is a 15% excise tax. 4. Currently for an independent cultivation there is no way to do quality control on the products we produce without having to burden our dispensary customers by transferring product to them for us to then go to their location and buy it back. At this point the product has already been sold and it is too late to perform quality control. Also t his option is only possible if the dispensary clients are willin g to do it for us as it entails additi onal work and provides no added value. There is no other industry where you are legally not allowed to perform quality control on the products you produce especially in agriculture . In dealing with cul tivation there are hundreds of variables that determine the quality of your product and we need to know immediate ly if the changes we make are increasing or decreasing the quality of our products. I propose that the CCB allow cultivation licenses to transfer small amounts of Lab Passing finished product to themselves out of Metrc so they can perform quality control on their products. I request that a definition be added called \"quality control sample \" that can be no more than one Ounce (28 grams) per lab passing lot. This quality control sample will need to be allowed to be transferred out of a cult ivation facility in Metrc to an agent card holder of that same facility , or something si milar to this . Currently the only sample proced ure is that dispensaries will request samples (known as Testers ) from cultivation facilities that they will allow their employees to sample the product so they can educate the consumer on the products. However, the cultivation facilit ies without a dispensary who produce the product have no legal access to evaluate their own product p rior to selling it to their customers. As a business we need to evaluate our different strains for marketing purposes , quality assurance, pricing, medicinal benefits and product perf ormance. Imagine if a strawberry farmer had a harvest of strawberries that looked perfect, but they were not allowed to taste them prior to sale, and they ended up having no flavor or sweetness . They would not know that there was a problem with the strawberries until they were sold and got the negative feedback on them and by then it is too late. How can you build a brand with the current scenario?

Minnesota, Suite J Creating results for clients throughout the Silver State Carson City, Nevada 89703 June 9, 2020 Honorable Michael L. Douglas, Chairman, Cannabis Compliance Board Tyler Klimas, Executive Director, Cannabis Compliance Board 555 E. Washington Street Las Vegas, Nevada 89101 Dear Sirs: Scientists for Consumer Safety (SCS) is a Nevada association of cannabis laboratories dedicated to the safety of cannabis consumers through the establishment of appropriate, science -based regulations for cannabis laboratories. SCS has been advocating for i ncreased oversight and transparency in the regulation of cannabis laboratories in order to protect the consumer from unsafe marijuana and fraudulently represented products. The recommendations provided below should be taken as comments submitted in respons e to the Nevada Cannabis Control (Draft) Regulations (NCCR) produced by the Cannabis Compliance Board, published May 29, 2020. 1. 6.085: This section requires several modifications and should exclude laboratories in many/most of the security personnel requi rements. a. 6.085.1(a) - Single entrance. One single secure entrance of a facility is not practical, given the size of various pieces of equipment utilized by laboratory facilities and the incompatibility of such commerce with office entrances appropriate for staff and customers. In addition, facilities are required by fire code to have at minimum an Emergency Exit. Instead, the regulations could require that all entrances be monitored by security cameras. b. Cannabis laboratories should be exemp ted from 6.085.6 and .7, requirements for security director or manager, given that laboratories do not have large quantities of cannabis products or currency on site and thus pose a very small security risk. The other security provisions within these regu lations (excepting 6.085.1(a), see above) are adequate for security requirements of cannabis laboratories. 2. 11.070: Needs the inclusion of an additional sub section that mandates: \"On a weekly basis the Board will publish on their website all Certificates of Analysis issued to them in the preceding time.\" This will include all COA's including retests in their totality, without leaving out any identifying information or results. This is quality assurance Silver State Government Relations Silver State Government Relations 204 N. Minnesota, Suite J Creating results for clients throughout the Silver Sta te Carson City, Nevada 89 703 information that is necessary to inform cannabis disp ensaries and the public they serve of the competence and attention to consumers' safety of cannabis laboratories. 3. 10. 11.010 Laboratory Director Qualifications listed in the proposed regulations seem to be taken or adapted from NAC 652 Medical Laborator ies. Cannabis is tested for public safety, as such similar qualifications should be required for the director of a cannabis laboratory. As such, SCS believes cannabis laboratory director qualifications should mirror NAC 652.380 - 395. This would require the laboratory director to at minimum hold a doctorate degree in a chemical, physical, biological or clinical laboratory science field, and have at minimum 1 year post degree laboratory experience. 4. 11.055: Needs the inclusion of a Sub 2. Section stating : \"All cannabinoids tested must be accurately reported on all Certificates of Analysis issued by laboratories and if that same product is retested in a test authorized by the CCB and found to be not within 50 percent, above or below, of the original cannab inoid test result, the original test shall be documented by the CCB as a false report.\" As reported multiple times in 2019 and published by Dr. James Macrae in his article \"Are Nevada's Cannabis have been manipulated and/or falsely reported. 5. 4.105: Needs to include a Sub 6. Stating \"Upon the issuance of a summary suspension or the closing of any facility for any reason, the Board shall issue a notice to all other cannabis license holders of the suspended facility's closure. Upon the reopening of a facility the Board shall issue a notice to all license holders of their reinstated status that includes the original summary suspension, the charges ultimately agreed to between the Board and the licensee and the plan of correction agreed to by the lice nsee to become reinstated.\" This is necessary in order to create and maintain a transparent cannabis marketplace wherein all participants - growers, laboratories, dispensaries - have complete information about which entities are full participants in that marketplace and under what conditions. Transparency supports consumer protection and reinforces peer accountability. It also reduces the liability of the CCB in its position as regulator of a product that affects consumer health. 6. 11.085 as presented sho uld be replaced in its entirety with regulations that create a functional system of Random Laboratory Assurance Checks (RLAC). A functional RLAC shall randomly audit every cannabis lab in the state four times per year. The Board shall send agents to each laboratory, unannounced. Those agents will select at least 5 retained samples of products already submitted to the seed to sale tracking system with final Certificates of Analysis. With the board investigators present, the laboratory shall retest those same samples and provide the results to the investigator and report them to the CCB. Over an annual set (4 times per year) of at least 5 samples, 80% of the tests need to produce results within 20% of the original test result. All quality assurance test Silver State Government Relations Silver State Government Relations 204 N. Minnesota, Suite J Creating results for clients throughout the Silver Sta te Carson City, Nevada 89 703 results shall be the same as originally submitted on the COA. Taken in totality over the course of the 4 tests per year, any laboratory that fails the RLAC audit shall be classified as having submitted intentionally false statements. Two failed RLACs with in 24 months shall qualify as a Category 1 violation and be accompanied by the revocation of the laboratory's license. 7. 11.075. Needs modification to ensure the quality assurance retesting process is undertaken in a way that produces the intended outcom e. Currently, cultivators/producers can request a duplicate or backup sample be collected while a laboratory is gathering a sample of product for testing. This backup sample will be held at the cultivation facility in case the first test failed, and the cultivator wished to challenge that fail with a retest. While retesting should be an option, the current practice allows a second test to override an existing Certificate of Analysis that shows the cannabis product failing some portion of a quality assura nce test. SCS believes this process should be expanded upon with the addition of a second sample, taken out of the same lot as the initial test, collected in conjunction with a laboratory's arrival at a cultivation or production facility for a retest. The initial sealed retention sample and the second retest sample, collected the day of the retest, shall be analyzed as two separate screenings of the previously failed lot. If BOTH retest samples pass all required safety tests, the previously failed test lot will be declared safe for consumption and will be cleared for sale. If either of the retest samples fail a quality assurance test, this lot will be considered a fail and must not be allowed for sale. If the second retest replicate results do not match the retention sample results for cannabinoid and terpene profiles, the retention sample will be considered tampered with and declared a fail. 8. 11.040. Proficiency Testing (PT), most programs sufficiently test a laboratory's instrumentation and their ability to detect analytes; however, matrix -based tests are best at evaluating all aspects of cannabis analysis. Changes in Regulations, Sub 5, add \"whenever possible, a cannabis testing facility must analyze PT samples...\". Sub 8, Delete \"100%\" and replace with 85 or 90%; there are stability issues with several analytes and it makes them difficult to accurately analyze in a PT sample. Sub, 9, reword (b), in order to reflect the reality that not all PT tests are available every 30 days; some are only held every 6 mo nths. problematic to accurately and reproducibility test at a none detected in one -gram level given the heterogeneity of cannabis flowers. It is SCS's opinion that the safety provided by testing for Aspergillus is outweighed by the inaccuracy of curr ent methodologies and the none detected per gram limit. Silver State Government Relations Silver State Government Relations 204 N. Minnesota, Suite J Creating results for clients throughout the Silver Sta te Carson City, Nevada 89 703 SCS insists on these inclusions as effective and appropriate methods to hold cannabis laboratories accountable for the tests they are issuing. Cannabis tests are used by cannabis license holders and the public to verify the safety and value of the cannabis being tested before purchase. Currently, the public and marijuana license holders are being left in the dark regarding the state of testing in Nevada. Over the last few years SCS has proven to cann abis regulators in Nevada that falsely reported testing data is a serious and relevant issue. SCS has collected a significant amount of documentation in this regard, which it had repeatedly shared with the Department of Taxation's Marijuana Enforcement Di vision and the CCB. Cultivation facilities are still pressuring laboratories for higher THC results and with the COVID -19 crisis, this pressure has only been amplified. If the department does not add language to increase the transparency of the testing program including testi ng failures, violations and penalties invoked, then nothing will change. We request the additions to section 4 in response to the fact Nevada's regulators have failed to pursue any charges against cannabis laboratories whose actions clearly indicate a dis regard for consumer safety. In addition to passing products that failed microbial testing, false THC potency results were reporting, demonstrating a complete disregard for public safety and prevention of consumer fraud. SCS supports the CCB for increasi ng the terms of its penalties and for the compounding effect of multiple penalties over a three year, rather than a two year period. It is assumed that violations documented by MED during its period of oversight and enforcement will carry over into CCB's period of enforcement, given that it is the same license and the record needs to remain intact. If this is not accurate, SCS requests this to be added as a formal portion of the regulation. SCS wishes to go on record supporting the additional language in: - Scientific Directors. Subsections 1(a) and 1(c) and Subsections 4, 5, 6 of 11.010; however, an addition, 1(d) is needed indicating whether the scientific director is an employee or a part of the ownership structure of the license in order that ultimate responsibility rests with the licensee - General Laboratory Standards. Subsections 3 and 7 of 11.025 - Sample Chain of Custody. Subsections 4 and 6 of 11.030 - Quality Assurance Tests. Subsections 3 and 5, and the addition of Subsections 7, and 8 of 11.050. See r ecommendation on adjustment of 11.050 Subsection 4 above - Testing Selection. Subsections 1(c)and (d) of 11.070 SCS wishes to go on record noting concern at the removal of the provisions formerly found at NAC 453D.794. Without those provisions the Board wi ll have no ability to audit failed pesticide tests or use the Nevada Department Agriculture labs for testing the Board deems necessary. Possibly the Board intends to create its own laboratory? If that is not anticipated, or if the SFY Silver State Government Relations Silver State Government Relations 204 N. Minnesota, Suite J Creating results for clients throughout the Silver Sta te Carson City, Nevada 89 703 2021 budget will no t allow the creation of a CCB laboratory, SCS recommends including language that allows NDA to continue to support Nevada's cannabis regulation function in its current capacity. Finally, an issue that is not directly addressed in these regulations, but has persisted since the start of the legal marijuana industry in Nevada, is the full payment of lab testing invoices in a prompt and timely manner. Traditionally, labs have had to balance a difficult relationship between themselves and the clients they ser ve. Laboratories are forced to broker their services across the state, yet have to also deliver the worst news when it comes to a failed quality assurance test. Labs are the only business in Nevada that have to sell their services to their clients while al so holding their clients accountable to some of the strictest laws in the state; as such, it is frequently the case where cultivators and producers will pressure labs through nonpayment to receive better testing results. This is unethical but frequently th e case, and can put the independence of cannabis testing laboratories at risk. It is SCS's opinion policies such as test results being delivered two days, plus a previous deafness of these issues from regulators, have jeopardized the independence and legit imacy of these labs. We ask the CCB to acknowledge this position and craft policies to assist in that situation including, but not limited to, making laboratory invoice payments a requirement for annual audits. Respectfully, Will Adler Executive Director, Scientists for Consumer Safety Director Tyler Klimas Executive Director Cannabis Compliance Board 555 E. Washington Avenue, Suite 5100 Las Vegas, NV 89101 Submitted via email: regulations@ccb.nv.gov June 9, 2020 Dear Director Klimas, On behalf of MedMen, thank you for considering the comments below in response to the proposed Nevada Cannabis Compliance Regulations (\"NCCR\") published on May 29, 2020. COMMENTS Operations: Section 6.085(1)(b) states that the cannabis establishment must have no visible cannabis or cannabis products from outside the establishment. We respectfully request that the CCB define what \"visible\" mean. For example, if secured product displays are 15 feet from the retail establishment's frontage, would that be considered visible. Section 12.040 and 12.045 require cannabis sales facilities to apply or include certain product labeling information that is already included on the product package. We respectfully request that sales facilities only be required to provide customers and patients information exclusive to the sales facility, not already required on cannabis and cannabis products. All sales facilities should reject any inbound product that does not meet regulatory requirement or match the COA As a result, the full requirement of these sections places undue burden and regulatory risk on the sales facility where the product labeling and disclosure responsibility is with the cultivator and producer. Reporting: Section 6.135, which requires certain quarterly reporting to be furnished by cannabis establishments, was updated to require reports to be produced on the 15th calendar day of January, April, July, and October. We respectfully request that the timeline of 30 calendar days be reinstated. Many operators with multiple licenses and license types, who have centralized operations, may require more time to produce such records accurately. We believe that a shorter timeframe may inadvertently impact quality of data provided to the CCB. Respectfully, Dan Edwards SVP, Legal Affairs 1Amber Virkler Cc: Darian Stanford Subject: CCB regulations June 9, 2020 By email to regulations@ccb.nv.gov This correspondence provides input in response to proposed Regulations 1-15 published by the Cannabis Compliance Board (\"CCB\"). There are two comments: Comment #1: Licensees should be explicitly permitted to sell-through previously-approved packaging and labeling prior to enforcing new packaging and labeling regulations. The proposed regulatory changes will have an adverse effect on bulk cannabis product manufacturers that purchase bulk packaging supplies in advance after such packaging has been pre-approved by a state entity. Any changes to packaging and labeling regulations force Cannabis Cultivators and Cannabis Product Manufacturing Facilities to retool their packaging and labeling orders and operations. The proposed regulations covering the transition between the Department of Taxation and the CCB modify the language required on the packaging and labeling of cannabis and cannabis products, raising distinct challenges for licensees. If there is a grace period to allow licensees to sell-through packaging and labeling previously approved by the Department of Taxation, then licensees may adjust their packaging, receive pre-approval from the CCB, and appropriately modify their operations without disrupting the regulated cannabis supply chain. Please provide clear guidance on this concern. Concern #2: Maintain consistency in required language for packaging and labeling. There is a minor discrepancy in the regulatory language in Sec. 12.045(1)(n) in comparison with the example given, and the other similar language in the regulation. The rule itself requires a warning stating: \"Caution: When eaten or swallowed, the intoxicating effects of this drug may be delayed by 2 or more hours.\" Contrarily, in the example shown, the warning reads: \" CAUTION : When eaten or swallowed, the intoxicating effects of thisproduct may be delayed by 2 or more hours.\" In comparison, the rule language in 12.045(1)(p), the required warning states: \"This product may have intoxicating effects and may be habit forming.\" The inconsistent language (drug v. product) causes confusion. Please maintain consistency and refer to any cannabis-infused products as a \"Product\" and not as a \"Drug.\" Using the word \"Drug\" promotes inconsistency, indicates a treatment purpose (where used in adult-use cannabis products), and unnecessarily stigmatizes an otherwise legal, well-regulated product. Additionally, such a minor modification promotes consistency throughout the proposed rules, all of which refer to consumer products containing concentrated cannabis as cannabis \"products\" rather than \"drugs\". 2Please amend Sec. 12.045(1)(n) to require that the exterior packaging of every regulated cannabis product sold in Nevada have a warning that reads: \" CAUTION: When eaten or swallowed, the intoxicating effects of this product may be delayed by 2 or more hours.\" Thank you, John Oceguera JOHN OCEGUERA Executive Vice President C 702.688.0177 O 702.800.2100 10801 W CHARLESTON BLVD SUITE 420 LAS VEGAS, NV 89135 STRATEGIES360.COM SIGN UP FOR OUR FREE WEEKLY NEWSLETTER Tyler Klimas Executive Director Cannabis Compliance Board 555 E. Washington Avenue, Suite 5100 Las Vegas, NV 89101 Via: regulations@ccb.nv.gov. June 9 , 2020 RE: Proposed CCB Regulations Director Klimas: Please consider the following comments from Sierra Well, a vertically integrated , privately held , cannabis operation located in Northern Nevada. We are aware that the Nevada Dispensary Association (NDA) has submitted comments on behalf of members. Sierra Well supports, and participated in the devel opment of, the NDA comments. Agent Cards and Licensing Agent card and licensing provisions in the draft regulations appear to practically preclude ownership of cannabis operations by publically traded companies. We do not believe it is the CCB's intention to establish or to further promote policies that prevent public companies from participating in the Nevada cannabis market, through these regulations. We understand this topic is the subject of current litigation that may be settled, or that may be adjud icated to an unknown result. We suggest that CCB regulations should either reflect the outcome of this matter, when it is determined, or address this matter specifically through a separate process, rather than determining the outcome through this present CCB rulemaking process. Existing precedent and operations suggest that effectively prohibiting public companies from owning cannabis operations through new licensing and card holder provisions may have unanticipated consequences to organizations that alr eady own Nevada cannabis assets, and to companies that may wish to sell their operations to publically held companies. Proposed NCCR 5.120(3) requires owners holding less than 5 percent interest to obtain an agent card, provide a background check, and prov ide other financial information. This provision is not consistent with publically traded companies, whose shareholders may change on a daily basis. It may, however, be reasonable to require majority - shareholders or officers and managers of public companies to pursue a vetting process that could include their establishment of agent cards. With regard to disclosure requirements, please consider allowing an annual disclosure of all owners because it is not feasible for public and for some privately held companies to provide such disclo sures in real time . Similarly, it is not practical to require owners of less than 5% interest in public companies to be included in a license application s and renewal application s. Thank you for the opportunity to review and comment upon the proposed regulations.

We also adopt all of the comments submitted by the Nevada Dispensary Association (NDA). We hope our comments below are helpful and we look forward to assisting the Cannabis Compliance Board in further refining the regulations . Our comments are identified in bullet points below . QualCan LLC proposes consideration of the following regulation : NCRR 1.155 \"Potentially hazardous cannabis products and ingredients\" defined. More Clarification on allowed and not allowed food items . 2. The term includes, without limitation: (c) Cut melons and tomatoes; Section w ould eliminate sauces that can be safely homogenized. NCRR 1.163 \"Private Residence\" defined Should include long term rental options with that exceed 30-day commitments . NCRR 1.220 \"Single -serving edible cannabis product\" Example plus or minus 10%. NCRR 4.050 Category III Violations. (6) Allowing disorderly activity; Not clearly defined. (9) Unintentionally failing to pay taxes to the Department of Taxation; Unintentionally defined? Unintentional failure would seem to require a cure period before imposing violation. Or perhaps the category of violation should start at category I and then scale up if not cured. NCRR 5.100 Grounds for denial of issuance or renewal of license; grounds for revocation of license; notice; opportunity to correct situation . 5. Before denying an application for issuance or renewal of a license for a cannabis establishment or revoking such a license as a result of the actions of an owner, officer or board member of the cannabis establishment pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 or paragraph (b) of subsection 2, the Board may provide the cannabis establishment will have with an opportunity to correct the situation. NCCR 5.120(3) Policies and pro cedures for waiving requirement to obtain a cannabis agent registration card for any owner, officer and board member who holds an ownership interest of less than 5 percent. Please modify to include; A less than 5% owner of a publicly -traded or privately held cannabis establishment shall be exempt from suitability requirements only as long as such owner's direct or indirect beneficial ownership interest in such publicly -traded or privately held company meets the less than 5% limit; provided, however, the Board may require any beneficial owner, regardless of the number of shares owned, to apply for a finding of suitability if the Board has reasonable justification for doing so. NCRR 6.070 Persons authorized on premises; vis itor identification badge and other requirements for other persons; maintenance and availability of visitor log. 40(c) Must not handle any cannabis or money whatsoever; and Non-Cannabis vendors who access the building signing in under the visitors log to receive payments, ie, Nevada Linen . NCRR 7.040 Delivery to consumer: General requirements. The delivery is made by a cannabis establishment agent who holds a cannabis establishment agent registration card in the category of cannabis sales facility; Recommend that it can be any agent card category to qualify as drivers. The re are matching credentials for obtaining an agent card. 4. The Board has received confirmation from the cannabis sales facility, before a person engages in the delive ry process, including, without limitation, accepting an order or physically delivering cannabis or cannabis products, that the person is employed by, volunteers at or provides labor as a cannabis establishment agent at the cannabis sales facility and holds a valid cannabis establishment agent registration card in the cannabis sales facility ; Once submitted the person should be allowed to begin working on a \"temporary\" approval while waiting for state to review . NCRR 7.050 Delivery to consumer: Restrictio ns; establishment agent making delivery. 1. A cannabis sales facility shall not deliver more than 5 ounces of cannabis or an equivalent amount of cannabis products to any combination of consumers within a single trip. Consider increasing limit to better utilize labor and increase ability to deliver to consumer in a timely manner. Increase to 10 ounces. 5. A cannabis sales facility shall not deliver cannabis or cannabis products to any person other than the consumer who ordered the cannabis or cannabis products. Before delivering cannabis or cannabis products to a consumer, the cannabis establishment agent delivering the cannabis or cannabis products for a cannabis sales facility shall: (a) Confirm by telephone that the consumer ordered the cannabis or cannabis products and verify the identity of the consumer; and (b) Enter the details of such a confirmation in a log which must be made available for inspection by an appropriate law enforcement agency, the Board and Board Agents. What details need to be in this log. Can the 3rd party delivery system be considered adequate documentation? Identity is confirmed when the delivery driver scans and confirms the identification. How long does the company need to keep reco rds of the transaction? NCRR 12.015 Requirements for edible cannabis products, products in solid or liquid form, usable cannabis and concentrated cannabis or cannabis products. If having to change all packaging from \"this is a Marijuana Product\" to \"this is a Cannabis product\" at start of newly implemented regulations, a timeframe threshold where establishments can run through already produced packaging with previous approved verbiage. Please also see NDA comments regarding this. We wo uld also ask the commission to consider allowing permanent drive thru windows. Drive thru for cannabis retail stores will be the safest, simplest, and most sanitary method of delivery. Thank you for the opportunity to share our comments with the Canna bis Compliance Board. We appreciate your time and consideration. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. Very truly yours, Michael V. Cristalli, Esq. Mother Herb 6265 Sad dle Tree Dr. Las V egas NV 89118 Craig Rombough 702.533.1 Board regulations@ccb.nv.gov Impertinent Nevada C annabis Issues : Unfairne ss of Man dated Tax for Non-Vertically Integrated Operators This is an issue as the mandated tax does not reflect the true market value of wholesale cannabis in Nevada. Vertically integrated companies do not report a true market value for 280e tax and competitive purposes. Vertically integrated companies purchase little to no flower at all from non-vertically integrated cultivators and if they do it's usually fo r a lot less th an the state mandated price. Non - vertically integrated cultivators are only able to sell their prem ium flower and flower at much lower rates than the mandated price. Non-vertically integrated cultivators are also unable to sell older and inferio r grade cannabis. T his creates an unfair tax a dvantage to vertically integrated operat ions. This can be eas ily verified by stand -alone cultivations as well as the data col lected independently by Cannabis Benchma rks. Mother Herb has been fo rced to pay over $200,000 in tax above and beyond the 15% threshold due to these factors. This makes it exceedingly difficult to operate. We have als o been force d to destroy inferior product that does not warrant the large tax . This is not good for the state, it's citizens , cultivators or the mandate of question 2, and addi tionally helps the black market . The solution is simple ; the tax must be an actual perc entage for stand -alone cultivation operations. This problem is also comp ounded for those without a production license. Product must be taxed on act ual prices sold . It is in every non-vertically integrated cultivators' interest to sell their product for as much as they can. Another solution would be to allow cultivators who are not verti cally integrated a license to sell thei r own product . This is ne cessary for a free market as interpreted under ques tion 2 and normal Nevada business practices . It is also what is most fair for the people of Nevada , all product available at market drive n prices. Monopoly /Oligopoly Created by Limiting the Number of Dispe nsaries The dispensaries are licensed to grow as mu ch as they want under on e licen se and many do not buy from outside sources. For this reason, cultivators are facing extin ction with no market to sell their product. Again , this is against question 2 and has created a n unfair situa tion for stand -alone cultivators and Nevada residents . It also creates an oligopoly for the current license es. It is also affecting the prices and ultimately the patien ts and consumer s. Culti vators need to ha ve a free mar ket to sell their product either with their own dispensary or by not allowing di spensarie s to be able to hold a cultivation license. The state cannot hand out licenses and the n license other license holders in a way that makes the non- vertically integrated cultivators' business unviable. Th is is the current arrangement with new lic enses going to the s ame small amount of license holders. Thes e businesses clearly do not want competition and a free mar ket of licenses and operate under the se principles making it hard for the cul tivators who are forced to operate in an imbalanced market. It also makes it diff icult for Nevadans by limit ing the ir available product selection. Simple s olutions: 1. Let every non -verti cally integrate d cultiva tor have a license to sell their own product. 2. Restrict dispensaries from having more than one dispensary license. 3. Do not l et dispe nsaries grow their own flower. 4. Do n ot limit the amount of dispen sary licenses . Unfair, Unrealistic and Tyrannical Audit Practi ces We have successfully been working as a partner with the State of Nevad a since the inception of this program . We have reported and always paid all taxes. We have operated exactly as inspectors and the guidelines have outlined. We have paid well over a million dollars in tax and over paid $2 00,000 abo ve the 15% whole sale tax we were expected to pay. However, we have still been aggressively audited by the State and L eslie Milana . Although she ha d never done a cul tivation audit, she has tried to recategorize flo wer to add additional tax over and above the overpayme nt mentioned previou sly. She has also ignored paperwor k on usage tax trying to add another source of revenue. Additionally, we ha ve operated within the frame work given to us by inspectors and State officials, yet the auditor s are trying to tax us on air dried water weight that has been exp lained to h er many ti mes yet she continu es to ignore the facts . Her o nly answer is t o tell us to appeal her decisions. The solution to this is also simple. The State of N evada needs to con tinue working as a partner with the industry and not allow such un fair practi ces. It is very disconcerting. We have paid an incredi ble amount of ta xes, see the state as ou r partner and should be treated fai rly. Let us work together an d solve the issues so we all bene fit from this new indu stry. It will only benefit ever yone and our commun ities. Regar ds, Craig R. Rombou gh Joshua J. Hicks, Partner Reply to: Reno jhicks@mcdonaldcarano.com Laura R.

Washington Avenue Las Vegas, Nevada 89101 regulations@ccb.nv.gov Re: Proposed Regulations of the Cannabis Compliance Board To the Honorable Chair Douglas and Director Klimas: We write now to submit comments to the proposed Nevada Cannabis Compliance Regulations ( \"NCCR\" ) published by Cannabis Compliance Board (the \"Board \") on May 29, 2020. These comments are submitted with a reservation of rights to submit further, additional, or different comments as the proposed NCCR progress through the rulemaking process. We welcome the opportunity t o provide further information or clarification that the Board may request. NCCR 2.065 . Please remove the following provisions which allows for inadequately maintained evidence to be used against a licensee in dis ciplinary proceedings : \"A failure to comply with this subsection shall not render evidence inadmissible in any proceeding before the Board.\" NCCR 4.120 . a rebuttable pres umption that missing records, documents, and surveillance would be harmful to the licensee. These failures are already subject to penalty, and t his standard is more punitive that what is already provided in Nevada law, which provides for a similar presumption only after a finding that such evidence was \"willfully suppressed.\" See NRS 47.250(3). Alternatively, consider revising this provision to allow for th e presumption only after it has been established by a preponderance that the missing evidence was \"willfully suppressed\" and/or by allowing the adjudicator , in his or her discretion, to infer that evidence that is missing because of a party 's negligence would have been unfavorable Cannabis Compliance Board June 9, 2020 Page 2 to that party. Finally, and also consistent with Nevada law, this presumption should be reciprocal. That is, if the Board \"fails to create and /or maintain any documents, records, su rveillance video, and/or any other items, \" then there should be a corresponding presumption or inference in favor of the licensee. NCCR 4.030 ; 4.035(2) (a)(1); 4.050(2) (a)(3), (4). The current regulations allow for a civil penalty of up to $35,000 per violation. See 453D.905(1)(a), (4)(a)(1); 453D.940(b). Please consider lowering the $90,000 limit in each of these proposed regulations to $35,000 or, alternatively , $50,000. In experience, the Department of Taxation (\"Department \") combines multiple violations into a single citation . While violations should be remedied , the Board should be required to seek and meet the standard for revocation instead of stacking multiple violations which have the cumulative effect of rendering the continuing operations of a license e, especially a smaller licensee, commercially impracticable . In addition, please consider adding a provision to the NCCR that require s the Board to take a licensee' s revenue into account w hen determinin g the amount of any penalty. NCCR 4.035(2) (a), 4.040(2)(a), 4.050(2)( a), 4.055(2)(a), 4.060(2)(a) . The current regulations provide a two -year lookback period when the Board considers prior violations for determining an appropriate penalty for new violations , while the N CCR provides for a three- year lookback period. In experience, the Department already combines numerous violations related to single incidents and/or audits and, therefore, the two- year window seems appropriate relative to the newness and evolving nature of Nevada' s regulatory framework . With respect to revocation, these regulations presume that revocation of a license i s an appropriate automatic penalty based upon the number of prior violations in the previous three ye ars without respect to the seriousness of prior violations. Given that thes e penalties are presumed appropriate, and especially if the Board is incl ined to expand the two -year lookback period to a three- year period, a requirement that the Board consider the seriousness of prior violations seem s like a commensurate approach to capture the most egregious offenders versus examining the sheer number of violation, which may bear little relevance depending upon the gravity of the situation. Finally, we encourage the Board to take th is opportunity to r evise the current structure of presumed penalties. Specifically , the Board should consider removing any presumption that a certain penalty is appropriate based upon the number of violations in the lookback period. Instead, the Board could add discretionary language which would allow it to take individual circumstances into account when det ermining whether the delineated penalties are appropriate. NCCR 1 1.015(b) , (c). The proposed conflict of interest rules with respect to cannabis testing facility c ould be construed a s impermissibly va gue. S pecifically, s ubpart (b) requires \"independence \" without any definition of the same and , problematically, in addition to other undefined independence requirements set forth in subpart (c). Subpart (c) itself is vague with Cannabis Compliance Board June 9, 2020 Page 3 respect to the undefined terms \" direct or indirect interest\" and \"direct or indirect financial interes t.\" For example, it is not clear whether it is permissible f or a testing faci lity to employ an individual who is related to a n employee of a nother cannabis facility . That the independence requires also reach to any other undefined entity that \"may benefit \" from cannabis industry or the use of cannabis or cannabis products is also problematic and could be interpreted to reach any entity that provides services to a cannabis facility, such as a law firm , or any consumer who lawfull y uses cannabis . In the event that the Board deem s it appropriate to impose this independence requirement upon te sting f acilities , these standards should be clearly defined to ensure compliance and c larity . Examples o f specific definitions that regulate relationships amon g interested parties may be found at NRS Chapter 116, NRS 281.210 and NAC 284.375. In addition, depending upon the extent of prohibitions , we respectfully request that the Board consider certain allowances in the event of lower -level conflicts that allow a testing facility to perform testing if the conflicted employee abstain s from the analysis of samples obtained from relevant entity with which that employee is associated , provided the relationship is disclosed to the Board . This arrangement may be similar to \"ethical screens \" that allow a law firm to take on a matter after isolating a personally disqualified lawyer from participation . See Nev. R. Prof 'l Conduct 1.10( e); State Bar of Nev. Standing Comm. on Ethics and Prof 'l Responsibility , Formal Opinion No. 39 (2008).1 NCCR 11.025(3), (5). We respectfully request additional language that specifie s any independent third party appointed to inspect and/or m onitor a cannabis testing facility must also be accredit ed pursuant to standard ISO/IEC 17025 of the International Organization for Standardization. See NCCR 11.020 (requiring c ongruent certification for cannabis testing facilities). Given the novelty of the subject matter combined with a lack of federal standards regulating cannabis testing , the Board may consider granting itself discretion to refer a testing facility to monitoring by a third party for a specified period of time in lieu of punitive discipline , akin to a suspended sentence in criminal law , where demonstrated compliance for a designated time period will result in the removal or lessening of charged and/or imposed penalties . This approach comports with the flexibility needed to ensure both safety in the industry and success of operators as the Board and NC CR strengthen over time and recognizes the unique role testing facilities play in the industry . For those sam e reasons, we respectfully request that the Board consider providing an avenue for a testing facility to seek the opi nion of a Boa rd agent, the Board, or a qualified independent third party with respect to questions related to analytical testing methodologies. NCCR 11.025 (7). This provision represents a n addition to the current regulations. We respectfully submit that the current regulations provide for adequate regulation of quality assurance testing without re ference to additional outside standards that are not d esigned for the 1 Available at https://www.nvbar.org/wp -content/uploads/opinion_39.pdf . Cannabis Compliance Board June 9, 2020 Page 4 cannabis industry. Quality assurance requirement s that are overly stringent will, unfor tunately, benefit the black market at the expenses of regulated indust ry. The comments articulated above with respect to 11.025(3) and (5) further bolster the ongoing dialogue between the Boa rd and industry to ensure utmost compliance and a better un derstanding of the standar ds. NCCR 11.040(8), (9). C urrent regulation defines successful participation by a testin g facility in proficiency testing to include : (1) positive identification of 80% of the target analytes ; and (2) achieving results that are within the limits of the acceptance range established by the proficiency testing provider. See NAC 453A.660(8), (12). NCCR 11.040 adjusts that de finition to require positive identification of 100% of analytes and eliminates the provision for meeting the requirements of the testing provider. While the ability to rete st somewhat remedie s the issue, it is nearly statistically impossible for a laboratory to achieve 100% identification of all analytes every time. Some amount of error is inherent to al l scientific testing . For example, it is well -recognized that COVID -19 tes ting is imperfect,2 yet we nonetheless rely upon this imperfect testing to ensure public safety as we re- open the economy. In light of this, and the fact that NCCR 11.040 eliminates the option to meet the testing providers requirements in order to achieve a successful result, we request that the Board considering re -setting a passing test to 80 or 90%, in lieu of 100%. On a non-substantive note, the Board may consider referring to percentages , either by using a symbol \"%\" or writing out the word \" percent \" consistently throughout NCCR 11.040 and throughout the NCCR generally. With respect to sub part 9(a), we respectfully request clarification with respect to the time period within w hich a testing facility must notify the appropriate Board Agent that it has not achieved the required sc ore for a quality assurance test. With respect to subpart 9( b), we respectfully request that the Board clarify that a testing facility that has not achieved the required score for a quality assurance test be required to repeat proficiency testing only as to the failed target analytes, not the entire profi ciency test. Thi s clarification aligns with the remaining languag e of this subpart , which states that the testing facility may be required to cease testing \" for those analytes \" in the event of two consecutive or two out of three profi ciency testing even ts.

Coalitions convene key stakeholders at the community level to address emerging issues and develop strateg ies to ensure the health and safety of citizens. Many of the coalitions were members of the Governor's Task Force on the Implementation of Question 2 and assisted in developing the initial recommendations.

Regulation 7.030 This regulation outlines restrictions on the sale of other products. CBD is an allowable product to sell but is also being sold at many other retail establishments in the state, at a lower tax rate. Revenue is lost to the state by not restricting the sale of CBD products to lic ensed dispensaries only. Regulation 6.120 This regulation outlines restrictions on advertising and is very well written and comprehensive. #1e outlines what warnings must be included on all advertising. Enforcement of this regulation is important to send a consistent message to minors under the age of 21 and currently it is not always followed.

While Nevada continues to make significant strides to be the gold standard in cannabis regulation, we have some concerns and suggestions for a few sections of the proposed regulations. 6.080 Subsection 8 (pg 61) : 8 a and b . Most fac ilities do not have the space to maintain records on site for 5 years. We request this be changed to have records on site for 1 year and allow records older than 1 year to be stored at an off -site location. 7.025 pg 70 : This section says the maximum to pu rchase is 1 ounce usable, but this contradicts the amounts allowed by medical patients in Chapter 6, pg 52. Medical patients should be able to purchase a larger amount of product than an adult -use consumer. 11.040 pg 95 : Proficiency testing is a vital par t of evaluating laboratory capabilities, but this industry is too new and has some unique challenges that prevent it from having a gold standard PT program at this time. As such, we recommend making significant changes to section 11.040. PT falls into 2 ca tegories, matrix -based PT and an analyte in solvent PT. For matrix -based PTs, hemp bud or oil is provided which contains analytes of interest. The test evaluates both sample preparation and instrumental analysis. The second PT, analytes in solvent, does no t factor in sample preparation and is only an evaluation of instrument performance. Additionally, the scoring systems for these two types of PTs are not equivalent. For the matrix -based PT, not all analytes are present, so none detected is counted as a cor rect evaluation. Solvent -based PT programs contain most to all analytes so more analytes must be correctly quantified. Based on this information, we recommend changes to the following sections: 11.040 section 5: Add \"when possible\". Not all PTs can be perf ormed using the same procedures as normal sample analysis, specifically the solvent -based PTs. 11.040 section 8. There are numerous analyte stability and reactivity concerns with analytes present in PT samples. For example, Caryophyllene Oxide has solubil ity issues when other terpenes are present with it in solution. Likewise, pesticides Acequinocyl and Bifenazate are not stabile with other pesticides so they cannot be included in solvent -based PT samples. Given these concerns as well as other analytes not mentioned, we do not think it is practical to achieve a 100% for all analytes. We recommend keeping this at 80% (or reducing to 75% for assays with only 4 analytes), which is in line with other industries for quantitative reporting. 11.040 section 9 : The matrix -based PT is only offered twice per year, so it is not possible to redo PT within 30 days. Solvent -based PT does not have the restriction of timing, but this deadline should not be applied only to a specific PT program. Therefore, we do not think 9b should be included. Failing proficiency test s should be repeated, but we do not think the 30 -day limit is appropriate. We do not think a limit should be applied, rather the Board should verify that a passing PT score has been achieved each year. 11.045 section 4 : We would like to remove the requirement to email R&D results to the state. R&D results may contain proprietary information that the cultivator/producer may not want public. As such, electronic mail is not a secure form of data transmission and we should no t send potentially proprietary information through it. 11.050 : We strongly support the Board's decision to move infused pre -rolls to the useable flower testing requirements and apply flower microbial testing limits. Infused pre -rolls often fail microbial testing since they currently have reduced microbial limits once the extract is introduced. It is unfair for the cultivator to pass micro testing for a flower to then fail it due to lower limits by adding an extract. 11.050 : Please define \"Pathogenic E. c oli\". Does this mean the \"big six\" plus O157? Please define this so commercial manufacturers can make more relevant and compliant products. Likewise, we think Salmonella needs to be fu rther clarified to ensure all relevant species are analyzed . 11.050 : Remove all mycotoxins from required testing. Ochratoxin A has significant stability issues making it difficult to keep high integrity QC standards. Ochratoxin and Aflatoxins are not commonly produced on cannabis. They are much more common in high starch prod ucts such as grains and corn. Therefore, they should be removed. 11.050 : Edible products: we think microbial testing should be expanded to require Yeast/Mold testing of edibles . While water activity is a good method for predicting food spoilage, it does not replace Yeast/Mold testing. 11.050 : Topical testing: we think microbial testing should be included in topical product testing. Why are we not looking at microbials for products that will interact with the skin and mucous membranes? 11.050 section 4 : We strongly support this standardization practice. 11.050 section 7 : Remove this requirement. Since all products and inventory are in Metrc, there is no need for this regulation. Several cultivators and producers have not paid laboratories for their work but received the certificate of analysis due to this regulation . Removing this section will allow laboratories to protect their work and not allow cultivators/producers to receive results without paying for the work. Thank you for reviewing our feedback and concerns. If you have any questions or need additional information, please let us know.

Comment: For the purposes of licensure, do all analytes (including ones that are not required) need to pass? For example, per 11.055 (1b) ten terpenoids are required, but most labs report more terpenes to provide a more complete profile. If the one or more of the additional terpenes fails , but all ten of the required terpenes pass (i.e. 100% of required analytes pass), is that s ufficient to meet the requirement? Regarding microbiological sample portion 11.050 (4) The analytical portion that is used for the purposes of any microbial test must be a minimum of one gram, unless otherwise approved by the Board. Suggestion: Change to \"...must be a minimum of 1 \u00b10.1 gram, unless otherwise approved by the Board.\" Regarding Potency Testing 11.055 (1a) When performing potency terpene analysis pursuant to NCCR 11.050, a cannabis testing facility shall test for and accurately quantify the presence of the following: THC, THCA, CBD, CBDA, CBN Suggestion : Total THC = 0.877* 9-THCA + 9-THC + Random QA Compliance Tests 11.085 (3) The cannabis cultivation facility or cannabis product manufacturing facility is responsible for all costs involved in screening or testing performed pursuant to this section. Comment: Getting cultivations and production facilities to pay for state -ordered QC testing has been challenging, especially when the samples are picked up from a dispensary. Our accounts receivable is constantly trying to collect payment for weeks, even months after sampling and results have been submitted. When invoicing cultivations for QC s amples picked up from a dispensary, the cultivation often refuses to pay (e.g. \"We didn't order that testing, so we're not paying for it.\") Then it is weeks of back and forth communication between the lab, the state, and the cultivation to get it sorted o ut. As a lab, we want to help the state in any way we can, but at some point it is not worth it if : (1) we do not get paid , and (2) we lose a current or potential licensee as a client because of a bad QC sample experience with us. Suggestion: Per the FY2019 State of Nevada T ax Revenue Worksheet (https://tax.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/taxnvgov/Content/TaxLibrary/Copy%20of %20NV -Marijuana - Revenue -FY19.pdf ), the state collected $99.1M in excise tax revenue, and another $9.8M in application and licensing fees. A portion of this revenue (say, $100K which is 0.1% of the FY2019 excise tax revenue) should be set aside for testing to include state investigations or random QC testing. The state can make a schedule of fees (or flat rate) and distribute to the labs, so that the state knows exactly how much testing will cost them and labs know exactly how much they will get paid for p articipating (don't make it too low, else labs may decline to participate). This way labs do not have to chase down payment from licensees who didn't ask for the testing, and the state is paying the same amount regardless of what lab they choose. Regardi ng Retest samples (section 11.075) Suggestion: Standardize the retest sample procedure - retest samples collected at the same time as the regular sample, but stored at a neutral, secure 3rd party location to ensure sample integrity. Alternatively, the s tate could provide a lockbox for retest samples, in view of cameras. These procedural steps would improve retest sample integrity, but must be evaluated for practicality and cost -effectiveness. Hon. Mich ael Douglas , Cha ir STATE OF NEVADA CANNABIS COMPLIANCE BOARD 1550 College Parkway, Suite 115 Carson City, Nevada 89706 Via: Email Re: Comments Proposed Regulations of the Cannabis Compliance Board I, Francis Mahoney , hold an Agen t Card as a Volunte er and work mainly out of Northern Nevada . My comments spec ifically relate to NCCR 13.035 Amount that may be transported by distributor; transportation by cannabis establishment agent; restrictions on transportation by vehicle and Subsection 5 which is proposed to read: 5. If the value of the cannabis and cannabis products being transported by a cannabis distributor in a vehicle, as reported on the transportation manifest as the insured fair market wholesale value, exceeds $25,000, the cannabis distributor shall ensure not fewer than two cannabis establishment agents of the cannabis distributor accompany the vehicle. I would propose that the draft regulation be redrafted too: 5. If the value of the cannabis and cannabis products being transported by a cannabis distributor in a vehicle, as reported on the transportation manifest as the insured fair market wholesale value, exceeds $ 50,000, the cannabis distributor shall ensure not fewer than two cannabis establishment agents of the cannabis distributor accompany the vehicle. The $25,000 found in the draft puts an enormous addit ional expense on the transport of a small amount of product on the distribution entity with little addi tional value or safety provided with a second agent in the vehicle. The round trip distribution of cannabis from the Las Vegas region to the Reno area or to n orthwestern Nevada i s normally a 16 to 20 hour round trip wit h deliver ies. The attendance of the second agent place s a severe strain on an already economically cha llenging cost of transportation. If expenses for the agent include three meals and then 8 hours straight time and 8 hours over time. Not includ ing the meal expens e and overnight accommodation the wages alone (on top of t hose of the first agent ) are approximately $400.00 (8hrs* $20/hr + 8hrs*$30hr OT and a t 20 hours round trip would be $580.00). Even using the lower $400 per trip , with 2 p eople that is $800/$ 25,000 of product or 3 .2% of the value of the cargo in addition to amounts already spent in security with alarms and the lock box . Our profit margins are already ver y slim and this addition al burden is hard to accept when the second agent has no rea l purpose in being in the veh icle - especially when you consider that the vehicle is emptied o ver the da y and quickly has less than $25,000 of product and th at is empty on the return trip. There is litt le added safety with the second agent as we are we ll trained not to interfere if there is an attempted hijacking, that there is no work for the agent during travel or at delivery , or on the way back to the distribution site. During t he vast majority of the trip the vehicle is mostly empty and there is almost no circumstance when the second agent is of any use. Especially considering the expenses , and the negative impact to consumers of those added costs, I would ask that the Board consider raising this limit to $50,000 or higher as the public will be better served with more competitive pricing in the "}
