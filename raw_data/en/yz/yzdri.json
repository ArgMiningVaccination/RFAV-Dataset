The Healing Power of Nature Nature is a soft and soothing presence within the world that effortlessly nourishes. When a person attempts to deny the truth of their own nature, they are bound to stifled by attacks of anguish. When a person spends time in nature, they are able to realize how things in nature simply align themselves with their truth. Being in nature can therefore be a very soothing activity that helps individuals be their truest selves. Nature has the power to heal not only on a psychological and emotional level, but also on a spiritual level. Therefore, one thing is certain, nature is an entity that every person should befriend. The Relationship of Spirituality & Nature Spirituality and nature are often interconnected as many spiritual practices emphasize the importance of connecting with the natural world as a way to deepen one's spiritual experience. Many spiritual traditions incorporate nature into their practices, emphasizing not only the importance of respecting and preserving the natural world but also of spending time with it. Did you know that centuries ago, the ancient Indians already had a profound understanding of the healing power of the earth? They believed that one needs to maintain a balance between the body, mind, and spirit to achieve holistic wellbeing. And to help achieve this balance, they knew that spending time in nature was essential. For the ancient Indians, nature was not just a source of beauty and inspiration, but a powerful source of healing energy. They viewed nature as a vital component of physical, mental, and spiritual well-being, recognizing the importance of maintaining a harmonious relationship with the natural world. Prakriti encompasses the natural world and all that inhabits it, bearing witness to the limitless power of the divine, who creates without bounds. The ancient Indians understood the importance of connecting with Prakriti in order to achieve spiritual growth and enlightenment. They recognized that spending time in nature, meditating under a tree, or simply observing the natural world, could bring one closer to the divine and help them gain a deeper understanding of their place in the universe. In the midst of nature's embrace, yoga practitioners were able to find a deep and lasting peace. Amidst the rustling leaves and the soothing sounds of the flowing stream, they were able to ponder upon the divine creations around them, better understand their relationship with the universe and realize their own soul purpose. It's fascinating to think that this wisdom was understood long before modern research began to uncover the many benefits of nature for our health. So next time you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed, take a cue from the ancient Indians and head out into nature to recharge and find balance. Benefit 1: Helps you tackle stress, anxiety and depression Spending time in nature is associated with better emotional outcomes as it reduces stress, anxiety, and depression. Nature has a way of speaking to us, healing us in ways we never thought possible. The simple act of stepping outside and connecting with nature can have a profound impact on our mental wellbeing. [Research](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2020/04/nurtured-nature) has shown that spending time in nature can produce cognitive benefits, helping to clear our minds and sharpen our focus and emotional benefits as it can enhance our mood. But it's not just about the quantity of time spent in nature, but the quality of our connection to it. Feeling connected to the natural world, whether through a walk in the park or simply gazing out at a beautiful view, can produce significant benefits for our overall wellbeing. It supports us in feeling grounded and connected to something larger than ourselves, providing a sense of purpose and meaning. When you give nature the chance to heal you, it lets soothing energy flow throughout you. In today's fast-paced world, we often forget the simple pleasure of nature and the peace it can bring to our lives. So why not take a step outside, and discover the transformative power of nature on your own mental health and well-being. Benefit 2: Lets you experience moments of awe Amidst nature's embrace, the small moments take on greater significance, reminding us of their enduring value. Encounters with awe have the power to connect us with something beyond our individual selves, fostering a sense of connection to the greater world around us. According to [research](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-athletes-way/201704/the-power-awe-star-is-born-images-and-the-small-self), people who saw a part of nature, such as a tree, instead of an industrial view were more likely to help someone who needed them. In other words, viewing nature made people more altruistic. Whether you're aware of it or not, experiencing the small moments that inspire awe in you makes you a better person. Therefore, being in nature is definitely worth it if you hope to make the world a better place. Benefit 3: Guides you toward inner peace When you're immersed in the soothing energy of nature, you experience inner peace. When nature showers us with her mercy, we are able to find true moments of inner calm. These moments help us enhance our self-awareness and also better reflect on our own being. When we're able to reach this state of inner calm, we're also able to realize that the things that often disturb us aren't worth our while. Taking away the reins from the artificial world becomes incredibly easy when you're spending time amidst the gaze of greenery. After all, things that are trying to disrupt us and throw us into an unnatural loop are not as effective as when nature helps us hold on to inner peace with firmness. Whenever we feel like we need to re-experience inner peace, nature offers its shade and sweetness to us. Benefit 4: Supports you as you recharge your energy Nature nourishes you and prepares you to enter back into the world with a renewed well of energy. Nature is the ultimate sanctuary, a place where everyone can find reprieve and renew their energy. Whether it be the gentle rustling of the leaves, the soothing murmur of the wind, or the invigorating hues present around, everything works together to recharge our energy, to restore our spirits, and to offer us a much-needed break from the hustle and bustle of modern life. When you're spending time in nature, you're essentially taking a break from the noisiness of the artificial world. All it takes is a good break to bring you back into the world with renewed vigor and energy. With more energy, you're able to meet the challenges of life heads on and even be a more stable presence for others. Benefit 5: Inspires you to adopt a better attitude in life Nature becomes our muse, inspiring us to strive for greater positivity and personal growth. Spending time in nature helps us find a source of inspiration that pushes us to be more positive. With a better outlook on life, an inner calm, and a renewed sense of vigor, we become better able to play a beautiful role in the world. We can be more altruistic, achieve more, and be better at the relationships gifted to us by the world. Ultimately, nature helps us become the best version of ourselves, by uplifting our outlook, which makes it a beautiful benefactor. Final Thoughts Spending time in nature fosters emotional well-being, reducing stress, anxiety, and promoting happiness. It cultivates spiritual growth by nurturing a sense of interconnectedness which helps us realize our own worth. Immersing in nature's serenity enhances self-reflection and mindfulness, promoting personal growth and mental clarity. Make time to embrace nature's beauty and reap the countless emotional and spiritual benefits it has to offer. In conclusion, reconnecting with nature is essential for a harmonious and balanced life. It offers a sanctuary for emotional healing and spiritual growth, allowing us to rediscover our true selves and find solace in the world around us. With the support of nature, we are better able to find positivity and be a force of positivity for others. Priya R. Monver is a poet, writer, and lifelong learner.
