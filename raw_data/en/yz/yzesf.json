What you feel is the Golden fire from the heart of the Universe\" ~Robert Simmons Geological Information Golden Healer Quartz is a silicon dioxide mineral with a hexagonal crystal system. The golden hue of Healer Quartz is caused by inclusions of hematite, an iron oxide, trapped within the crystal. Its coating is transparent with an almost greasy feel that gives off a beautiful sheen and ranges in color from clear, pale yellow, lemon to a dark mustard-like yellow. Golden Healer was first excavated in the 1980s by miners in Arkansas, though the highest ratio of this crystal has been mined from a location in Wales in the Celtic Quartz mine. Works Well With...
