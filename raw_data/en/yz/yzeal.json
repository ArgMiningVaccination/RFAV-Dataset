Try Microdermabrasion at [Thanyapura](/asia/thailand/thanyapura) Microdermabrasion is best described as plastic surgery without the plastic... or the surgery. It uses microcrystals, which are hard enough to disrupt unwanted tired skin cells that cause dull looking skin but small enough not to do any damage or cause pain. The therapy can be applied on all skin types and shouldn't cause any skin colour changes or scarring. Microdermabrasion will have you reveal new, living cells for a healthy glow and softer skin. Experience this at Thanyapura, a peaceful [spa and sport](/spa-and-sport-holidays) haven surrounded by dramatic mountains, lush vegetation and expansive forest.
