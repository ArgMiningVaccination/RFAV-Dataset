This submission supports a potential multi-year, multi-million dollar contract to develop SuVax and MarVax vaccine candidates for use in the event of a Sudan ebolavirus or Marburg marburgvirus outbreak. Soligenix was invited to submit this proposal following a review of its white paper entitled, \"SuVax: A Safe and Thermostable Single-Vial Adjuvanted Subunit Vaccine with Rapid Onset Immunity to Sudan ebolavirus,\" which proposed the development of SuVax through Phase 1 clinical studies in a $25 million program of work over five years. In a non-human primate model of Sudan viral disease, SuVax demonstrated 100% protection four weeks after vaccination with a 3-dose series of SuVax. BARDA also requested that additional options be built into the full proposal, including addressing a separate potential Marburg marburgvirus vaccine candidate, MarVax. \"We are excited about the favorable review of our white paper by BARDA and by their invitation to submit a full contract proposal,\" stated Christopher J. Schaber, Ph.D., President & Chief Executive Officer of Soligenix, in a [press release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/soligenix-invited-to-submit-barda-contract-proposal-for-development-of-thermostabilized-subunit-vaccines-for-sudan-ebola-and-marburg-viruses-301660857.html) on October 27, 2022. \"Although a contract award is not guaranteed, we believe that we are well-positioned to receive BARDA development support for this indication allowing us to further demonstrate the growing body of compelling scientific evidence supporting our heat stable filovirus vaccine platform, including vaccine candidates directed towards Sudan ebolavirus and Marburg marburgvirus.\" As of October 27, 2022, the Republic of Uganda has reported over 100 Sudan Ebolavirus cases and about 30 related fatalities since mid-September 2022.
