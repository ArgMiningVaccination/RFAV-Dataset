Matt, Matt Brewing Company*Ken Meifert, National Hall Progress Report 3 The MVREDC\u2014in fact, in our opinion, perhaps all of Upstate \u2014exists for times like these - times that are defined by transforma-tional investments and the revitalization of our core communities. For the last five years, the MVREDC has been expanding on its early successes and growing the regional economy. Our perspective has been to take the long view, which is one of the hallmarks of strategic economic development. But on August 20, 2015, our region, with the help of New York State, bore the fruit of more than two decades of labor. At the ams AG announcement, something told us we were dealing with a new economic reality the likes of which none of us had ever seen.We vowed then and there to expand on that momentum to invest and de-velop strategies to benefit our entire region. We sensed, correctly, that in preparation for ams AG, our region's communities would be confronted with a combination of immediate needs and long term concerns, in their attempt to capture the secondary and tertiary impacts of the region's biggest economic development project in more than a century. It was at that time we agreed we would develop the Marcy Nanocenter while not neglecting our established, regional economic development priorities.It is in that visage that we humbly present the 2016-2017 Mohawk Valley Re-gional Economic Development Plan. You'll notice that this year's plan and our 2017 strategy is aligned with a series of New York State priorities. downtown redevelopment, workforce development, expanded opportunities, veterans, global exports and our regional cluster plan are initiatives that are moving our region forward and are already making the Mohawk Valley vibrant once again.The Mohawk Valley Regional Economic Development CouncilRESPECTFULLYMohawk Valley REDC 4 92 1062016 OF THE MOHAWK PROJECT STATUSB. URI INITIATIVES FROM IMPLEMENTATION PLANC. PRIORITY PROJECT DESCRIPTIONSMohawk Valley REDC 6 ams AG rendering2016 - Progress Report 7I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARYMVREDC PERFORMANCE SINCE 2011375 Jobs Valley REDC 8In 2015, the Mohawk Valley Region was one of seven competitors in the Governor's Upstate Revital-ization Initiative. Although not a grand-prize winner, the experience grew our participation, strength-ened our bonds, deepened our commitment and yielded powerful strategies to leverage toward future prosperity.Earlier in the year, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced a combined $4 billion investment by Austria-based ams AG and by GE Global Research in the Marcy Nanocenter and the Computer Chip Commercializa-tion Center at SUNY Polytechnic Institute. The event marked the culmination of more than a decade of persistent planning and bold, consistent regional investment in strategic site development. The initiatives were lifted by four successive years of investment by the Mohawk Valley Regional Economic Development Council, and finally brought to life by a $650 Million economic development incentives from New York State. The cornerstone of transformation had been set. In April, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul celebrated the ams groundbreaking in Marcy, helping bring to life the hope of economic rebirth in our region. In the past year, the Governor and Legislature have introduced or revived two vital programs: The Down-town Revitalization Initiative and the RESTORE NY Communities Initiative. Both programs are well aligned and will help to propel a core driver identified in \"Sparking Transformation,\" and that is Vibrant Communities. And so you will learn in the pages ahead that our Progress Report & Implementation Plan will focus heav-ily on creating vibrant, diverse, creative, innovative and safe communities. We see this as perhaps the most important building block upon which to build a culture of innovation and opportunity.The Mohawk Valley Region also emerged from the URI competition with $50 million to advance the strat-egies introduced in its URI plan, which we labeled: \"Sparking Transformation.\" Those strategies have now been formally embraced as the Regional Council's roadmap to the future. STRATEGY ONE: BUILDING THE STEM ECONOMYConsider this: The American Bald Eagle, was nearly extinct by the 1960s - surviving only in remote niches of the landscape. Strong leadership and bold policy decisions to improve air, water, and habitat were fol-lowed by commitment and capital investment by the public and private sector over a period of decades. The Bald Eagle now thrives once more in North America.Likewise, advanced industry: Nearly extinct after generations of economic decline, destructive policies, and the deterioration of critical infrastructure, a clear vision and bold leadership - backed up by commit-ment and capital - have prevailed. The ams project at Marcy Nanocenter marks the return of world-class technology to the Mohawk Valley. Fertile Soil for Foreign Direct Investment: Continued Build-Out of Marcy Nanocenter. The importance of the single-largest foreign direct investment in the history of the Mohawk Valley is im-possible to understate. For 2017, the MVREDC has prioritized $5.1 million for the construction of a 12\" steel gas main to the Marcy-SUNY Parkway, which will leverage more than $297 million in new investment. The new gas main is necessary to support the ams AG project along with full build out of the Marcy Nano-center site and growth of Quad C and SUNY Poly Innovation Acceleration Center. Looking beyond 2017, the MVREDC is proposes a four-year capital support program to ensure comple-tion of the Marcy Nanocenter site and on-site supply chain development. Full build-out of SUNY Poly's nanotechnology initiatives will support 4,000 to 5,000 direct jobs and approximately 8,000 to 10,000 indirect jobs. ams AG - the first tenant at the Marcy site - will create 740 direct jobs over ten years and is expected to attract another 500 indirect supply chain jobs. 2016 - Progress Report 92016 MVREDC STRATEGIES:STEM INTENSIVE StampingModernizationthINCubatorHot SpotSTEM Intensive Industries EcosystemMVREDC has a commitment to enhancing the total ecosystem - strategic site development, diverse STEM employment opportunities, vibrant communities and a culture of entrepreneurialism. Tryon Tech ParkExpansion Vireo HealthStart upMohawk Valley REDC 10Modernization of Core to expand international exports. In 2017, MVREDC prioritizes the modernization and expansion of five advanced industry sector firms and two infrastructure upgrades to strategic business parks. A combined total of $5.1 million in ESD grant funds will leverage nearly $93 million in new investment by our region's top exporting industries and create more than 500 new entry-level, middle-skills, and advanced-skill jobs across the Mohawk Valley.Streams of Opportunity: Charging the STEM workforce Pipeline.Mohawk Valley institutions of higher edu-cation and Workforce Development Boards are keeping it real when it comes to train-ing STEM workers and exposing youth and hard-to-place workers for careers in STEM and Advanced Industries. This round, the MVREDC is supporting $100,000 in new em-ployee training for the NCI Group - who plans to hire 60 new middle-skill metalworkers and $97,000 in unemployed worker training funds for the MVCC Advanced Manufacturing Insti-tute. MVCC will operate training programs to license welders for NCI and 33 unemployed in-dividuals as Certified Production Technicians. Serving the high-poverty Utica-Rome met-ropolitan area (the largest in the region), the projects address a strong demand for trained entry-level and middle-skilled manufacturing workers. Skilled workers give the region the edge to compete with the world - and win. As workers retire, these sectors require a pool of young job-seekers with strong technology skills to support and sustain the manufacturing industry in all sectors from food to semicon-ductors to metals.Optimal Habitat: A Home for Innovators and EntrepreneursBeyond education, our region is constructing a network of incubators and innovation hot spots for those who would take STEM skills to the next level. The Air Force Research Labo-ratories Information Directorate is the nucleus of the Mohawk Valley's Cyber Cluster, with a budget of more than $1 billion and an eco-nomic impact of nearly $350 million, annually, across Central New York and the Mohawk Val-ley. The Griffiss Institute - a stalwart partner and the primary bridge to commercialization of AFRL Cyber technologies - is the region's priority Innovation Hot Spot for 2016, seeking $250,000 in funding to continue outreach, ed-ucation, and commercialization efforts in Cy-ber and Information Technology. 2016 - Progress Report 11The Forest for the Trees: Targeted Downtown Revitalization to attract a 21st Century workforce. The goal of vibrant communities is to create quality places. They are essential to attracting and retaining talented workers and are a decision-making driver. The new global economy and the people who make it work require that communities possess walkable neighborhoods, active waterfronts and public spaces, and charisma. Our 2016 plan prioritizes the revitalization of vacant, historic, and underutilized buildings - form and function - to amplify social, cultural, and profitable interactions. Nearly 40% ($9.5+ million) of our total ESD Priority Projects and more than 55% ($15+ million) of other agency funding is recommended for downtown projects across the region - with a special focus on DRI communities - for adaptive reuse, historic preservation, green infrastructure, waterfront revitalization, public spaces, and infrastructure improvements.In addition to CFA funding, our URI implementation plan calls for the funding of REcovering our Com-munity's Legacy And Incentivizing Momentum: RECLAIM MV will provide municipalities with financial assistance for the revitalization of commercial, industrial, and mixed-use properties located in key popu-lation centers and along waterfronts to activate new private investment. Mohawk Valley REDC 12Strengthening agribusiness through innovation, infrastructure, and institutional supports are fundamental to constructing sustainable food systems. The models are all around us, in neighboring places with similar assets like Greater Burlington and the Mid-Hudson region. The common denominator is people; vibrant communities and workforce availability are key components of sustainable local systems. In this plan, we demonstrate that, since the beginning of 2015, our refined strategies and concentrated investments are already bearing fruit. Agribusiness and Food Processing are key regional concentrations for opportunity in the Mohawk Valley. Throughout the plan, we discuss how doors are opened to refugees and hard-to-place workers for entry level and advancement opportunities, as evidenced by the Mohawk Valley Resource Center for Refugees' partnership with Food Processors in the region. Four out of the top ten firms hiring refugees in our region are food processing and agribusiness supply chain companies - accounting for more than 500 new place-ments since 2009, and 90 in 2015 alone.The MVREDC is prioritizing $3.3 million in Priority Project funding for place-based agribusiness projects that leverage population centers, innovation in agriculture and food processing, and increased oppor-tunity. The Susquehanna Regional Food & Beverage Hub is the cornerstone of Oneonta's winning DRI Proposal as well as the most ambitious of our Agribusiness-focused priorities. The multifaceted project involves a craft brewery, craft food incubator space, grain-based research and development, and farm-to-table destinations in the heart of downtown Oneonta.Brightwaters Farm further demonstrates modernization of the agriculture industry. It presents the oppor-tunity for Veterans and new Americans to succeed in a growing regional industry cluster, and challenges Mohawk Valley producers to meet the domestic and international demand of major metropolitan restau-rants and grocery chains. Additionally, the Vets2Farm project proposes to enhance the lives of our Veter-ans through agriculture and animal husbandry, while addressing the age cliff and skills gaps in agriculture and food processing.Finally, to advance our URI strategy, MVREDC is proposing two complementary, multi-year initiatives to move the needle. First, a comprehensive asset map and cloud-based interactive inventory of Mo-hawk Valley producers and products. Second, funding to work with ex-pert brokers in the food and beverage industry to identify new domestic and export markets - focus-ing on major metropolitan areas in the Northeastern US and Quebec. Togeth-er, the initiatives provide sustained capital over four years to build marketing capacity, increase exports and leverage current co-operative aggregation and packaging operations such as Mohawk Harvest, Scho-harie Fresh, and Upstate Growers and Packers.Lt.

It is one of the region's fast-est-growing international exports and an important rung in the ladder of opportunity for hard-to-place workers and new Americans. ESD Priority Projects and other featured projects combine for a proposed $3.6 million in funding for Tourism projects, with a focus on downtowns as base camps for adventure, craft beverages, and baseball enthusiasts. Out of a dozen featured Tourism projects, six hail from DRI communities, 11 are connected to city and village centers, and all build on the momentum of past REDC priorities.In September, the National Baseball Hall of Fame in downtown Cooperstown launched PASTIME a digi-tial platform to share rare archival collections with the rest of the world. This year the REDC prioritizes continued marketing of the world-famous museum as well as enhancing the visitor experience with a pro-posal to offer high speed, free WiFi to the hundreds of thousands of visitors to downtown Cooperstown and Oneonta. Further amplifying the already prolific Tourism concentration in the Cooperstown-Oneonta area, the REDC is proposing gap financing for a truly impactful tourism destination - a regional indoor waterpark and destination hotel in southern Otsego County. In keeping with the international flavor of our Tourism priorities, the MVREDC is prioritizing expansion of the world-famous Herkimer Diamond Mines - a notable exporter of gems unique to Herkimer County - and a popular tourist destination for international travelers, thanks to the creative global marketing efforts of the Herkimer Diamond Mines. The revival of Downtown Sharon Springs is, pound for pound, the most remarkable story in the Mohawk Valley. A village of only a few thousand residents is home to the globally-renowned Beekman 1802 life-style brand and the future home of Sharon Springs Resort, a revival of the famous Imperial Baths. The scope and scale of foreign direct investment has spurred the proposed restoration of the Columbia Hotel, a complementary FDI enterprise projected to import significant international tourist dollars to the region.In Sparking Transformation, the MVREDC committed to a five year Mighty Waters Action Agenda to build unique destinations for adventure tourists. Multi-use, accessible riverfront trail projects in Rome and Schoharie are complemented by a major outfitter expansion in the region's most popular Adirondack community of Old Forge. Also featured as priorities are canalside placemaking and activation of the wa-terfronts in downtown Fonda, Frankfort, Canajoharie, and Rome to commemorate the Canal Bicentennial in 2017. Also advancing our URI plan are initiatives and projects that leverage and strengthen the craft beverage industry in myriad ways: through enhanced marketing and access to capital for Tourism employers to provide hiring incentives coupled with on-site enrichment; education and skills training for workers with barriers to employment to guarantee career advancement, and meaningful, long-term participation in the workforce. In summary, we have gotten to where we are today by tenaciously adhering to our strategies. Each year has brought incremental success, and our regional coalition has grown stronger. What, then, is our plan for the year ahead? -- To work the plan. 20122016 - Progress Report 15 Mohawk Valley Gateway OverlookAugust 31, 2016 Ribbon Cutting Trajectory of Visitor Spending in the Mohawk Valley 20102011201320142015$1.4B$1.49B$1.56B$1.59B$1.67B$1.75BMohawk Valley REDC 16 II.

Each Priority Project plays an elemental and strategic role in building the innovation ecosystem and supporting the ex-pansion of advanced industries, the intersection of creative capital, and the blossoming of young minds.Mohawk Valley REDC 28For the past decade - and against over-whelming odds - leaders of the Mohawk Valley have been patiently assembling the core components that comprise the incip-ient innovation ecosystem. Accelerated by MVREDC investments since 2011, our region has emerged on the global stage as a major ex-porter in metals and industrial machinery manu-facturing, leader in Cyber Technology, a nascent hub for Unmanned Systems research and testing, and a world-class target for the next big thing in Semiconductors. But that's only part of the story.The region has a traditional manufacturing base (heavily specialized and concentrated in primary metals, fabricated metal working, and industrial machinery clusters) that in 2014 had 5,255 jobs, an increase of 15.5% from 2010. This sector con-tinues to be the core component of the region's global export economy, accounting for the highest single-sector growth in export value in the entire region. Because of the evolution and moderniza-tion of these firms to supply global transportation, energy, and technology demands, Brookings con-siders these part of the world's elite and irreplace-able \"advanced industries.\"In prior plans, we foretold of a profound conver-gence of nano, cyber, and UAS technologies. That convergence is happening in a more prodigious and meaningful way than we could have imag-ined, thanks to more than $20M in CFA awards in emerging technology concentrations in the Valley. ams AG is a manufacturer of analog sensors -the very mechanisms by which every mobile and com-puting device interacts with the world. The Inter-net of Things (IoT) is a global phenomenon, and the leaders, visionaries, and entrepreneurs in the Mohawk Valley have willfully resolved to play a leading role in the global marketplace.Some of our top CFA Round VI Priority Projects to create STEM jobs, increase exports, and attract global investment are: Marcy Nanocenter. Construction of the natural gas main directly to the ams AG project and future MNC tenants, enabling the creation of at least 700 jobs, and ensuring on-site supply chain develop-ment. Edson Street Business Park Power Upgrades. Crit-ical to the growth and expansion of advanced indus-tries such as AGT, Solar City, Rayco, and Breton In-dustries, a major power modernization is required in the urban business park.Without Vibrant Communities - interesting, effi-cient, and walkable places - the entire ecosystem is doomed to collapse. These industries are growing in our region because of targeted investments in the sustainability of the system itself. The component parts - our governments, private sector, non-profits, and educational institutions - are working toward common regional goals, and supporting one another with the capital, talent, and infrastructure necessary for the system to thrive. Round VI CFA Priorities that help to build the STEM ecosystem in our urban centers that are proximal to major investments this year include projects from DRI target areas: Amsterdam. Down the hill from Edson Street Busi-ness Park, Amsterdam is pursuing the redevelopment of the Sanford Clock Tower (former Coleco head-quarters) building on Prospect Street to provide flex incubator space for new professional ventures and tech start-ups. Utica. Historic Preservation and adaptive reuse projects at the iconic Doyle Hardware building and historic Mechanics Hall in Bagg's Square, creating distinctive living and commercial spaces for the in-flux of Nanocenter workers, Mohawk Valley Health Systems employees, and supporting businesses. Rome. The Downtown Rome SMART Walk, an en-vironmentally sustainable, culturally unique street-scape connecting residential neighborhoods to the central business and cultural districts.Our 2016 plan calls for substantial investment in mod-ernization of our core industries, accelerated invest-ment in cutting-edge technology, and revitalization of the urban centers that support the new economy. This has been our primary strategy since the incep-tion of the Regional Economic Development Coun-cils, resulted in the continued expansion of opportu-nity for our citizens and deeper penetration into the global marketplace.2016 - Progress Report 29 Marcy NanocenterOverburdened material removalMohawk Valley REDC 30 Summer UAS CampStudents learn how to fly drones at the Griffiss Int'l Airport CABVI STEM CampGriffiss Institute2016 - Progress Report 31On July 13, 2016, the Senate passed the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill en-suring the UAS test site designation at the Griffiss International Airport would continue UAS testing for the next three years.Griffiss is installing a \"Test Bed\" range instru-mentation system that will allow the tracking of cooperating and non-cooperating manned and unmanned aircraft. This capability and technol-ogy supports the development of the test site's FAA mission of supporting development of a Sense and Avoid system and provides a major ad-vantage against other test sites across the United States.In just a short time, Griffiss UAS Test Site has at-tracted many private clients, along with federal partners like the FBI, NASA and the FAA. The Griffiss Site has completed over 400 UAS Test Flights utilizing NUAIR as well as proponent pi-lots and observers. Griffiss and NUAIR, in con-junction with MVCC have launched a new degree program starting this fall semester to afford stu-dents the opportunity to obtain a degree in UAS Technology.Just recently, DJI, the world's leading manufac-turer of unmanned aircraft systems, joined Ford Motor Company and the United Nations Devel-opment Program to host the company's annual DJI Challenge at the Griffiss International Airport and Test Site; after receiving more than 130 pro-posals to begin the competition, a team from Cal-ifornia prevailed over a field of ten finalists for a $100,000 prize. According to Howard Zemsky, President and CEO of Empire State Development, \"Events like the DJI Challenge and the upcoming 2016 UTM Conven-tion, which we'll be hosting in the Syracuse area this November, demonstrate the limitless poten-tial and innovation of the UAS industry.\" The international NASA UTM Conference has been scheduled for November and will propel the Mo-hawk Valley and Central New York regions onto the global stage. CFA projects with significant progress since 2015Emerging Industry: UAS Test Range Accomplishments in 2015-16The Griffiss Institute offers a multitude of STEM camps during the summer and winter breaks for students around the Mohawk Valley. This past year they have partnered with the Central Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired, Inc. to offer a summer STEM camp for differently-abled popu-lations. This new camp is part of CABVI's growth and a future expansion indicates a groundswell of community support for their mission, including:1. Creating employment opportunities for people who are blind, preferably in an integrated setting2. Providing upward mobility for employees with vision loss3. Training blind individuals in adaptive technology and soft skillsCABVI offers the only integrated employment program for people who are blind in the Mohawk Valley. The organization aims to expand the foot-print it already occupies by retrofitting its head-quarters and purchasing adjacent lots to custom build a facility that is appropriate for vision reha-bilitation services and employment development. CABVI has experienced an unprecedented 56% employment growth over the past 10 years, where most employees are blind or visually impaired. The expansion project will create 20 jobs, all of which will be occupied by blind populations. CABVI is an outstanding example of how the Mohawk Valley is offering fruitful, rewarding employment and an attainable quality of life for all. To that end, CABVI offers a multitude of activi-ties including Camp Abilities, a youth development program for children and teens that are blind or visually impaired in order to help them realize their full potential. Camp activities include tandem bik-ing, baseball, skiing and cooking, with new expe-riences added yearly. The experience, developed for blind and visually impaired teens and young adults, included workshops like Windows PC Troubleshooting, Hacking 101, SIRI Commands, iOS Zoom/VoiceOver Class, and lectures given by professionals in the cybersecurity field. One ses-sion, titled An Overview of Cyber Threats, covered common industry threats like rootkits, botnets, crypto-lockers and social engineering. CABVI is not only committed to providing a career gateway to differently-abled populations, but to do so in a comprehensive way that is aligned with our re-gion's industry clusters.Griffiss Institute: CABVI CampMohawk Valley REDC 32 In August 2015, the Mohawk Valley's transformation was truly sparked when Governor Cuomo announced the $585 million deal with ams AG to construct and equip a $2 billion semiconductor fabrication plant in Oneida County. The announcement also included $65 million investment in the companion Nano Utica Computer Chip Commercialization Center at SUNY Polytechnic Institute to support semiconductor research & development. In December, our STEM strategy was augmented by more than $12 million in regional Priority Project investments in advanced industries. Those who attended the April 20, 2016, groundbreaking ceremony at Marcy Nanocenter - fu-ture home of ams AG and other global semiconductor companies - witnessed the flurry of ac-tivity already underway. Excavators, bulldozers, and dump trucks were in motion 14 hours a day, seven days a week, for five consecutive months to meet the aggressive construction schedule. 400,000 cubic yards of earth have been removed, reshaped, and repurposed since August 2015.Project design is underway, the tooling list for the fab is in development, and ams AG has hired the fab manager for its NY project. Although many early milestones have been achieved, many more must be attained in order to meet the targeted 2018 fab opening. The work is far from done. What are the significant actions needed to ensure success? Continue site infrastructure improvements. Finance the completion of the natural gas main and on-site supply chain infrastructure at Mar-cy Nanocenter. Invest in transformative downtown projects like the Doyle Hardware Adaptive Reuse Project, Mechanics Hall, Downtown Rome SMART Walk, and MVHS downtown Infill Site Assembly.Austrian-based ams AG's commitment to building the world's next analog sensor fabrication facility means that the world is watching the Mohawk Valley. The future of foreign direct invest-ment in advanced industries in New York State hinges on our execution and stewardship of the ams project.\"Our decision to locate the facility in New York was motivated by the availability of a highly skilled workforce, the proximity to prestigious ed-ucational and research institutions, and the favorable business environ-ment, backed by public and private partners.\" -ams CEO Alexander Everke (2016) What is 400,000 cubic yards of earth equivalent to?12 Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pools5,000,000 kegs of Saranac hockey pucksMarcy Nanocenter at SUNY Polytechnic Institute2016 - Progress Report 33 ams AG Groundbreakingams AG CEO Alexander EverkeApril 20, 2016 Mohawk Valley REDC 34IMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES Downtown Revitalization The Griffiss Institute, in partnership with Mo-hawk Valley Community College, created The Home for Innovative Companies (thINCubator) - a NYSTAR-certified Business Incubator and Innovation Hot Spot - in 2013, to evolve the cul-ture of entrepreneurship - and it was created in downtown Utica. Located in the heart of Bagg's square, the thINCubator is playing an active role of the revitalization wildfire sweeping through downtown Utica - physically, and otherwise. As of August 2016, the thINCubator has experienced dramatic growth and success in building commu-nity connections: Historic preservation and adaptive reuse of the ground floor of a vacant industrial building - the first phase of the massive mixed-use Bagg's Square Lofts project (ESD Round V Priority Project) Convened four commu-nity cohorts and worked with 42 different individu-als/teams Provided consults to over 40 student and com-munity entrepreneurs Held 15 community/business events including TedxUtica Grown ecosystem part-nerships with Wasabi Ventures, Upstate Venture Connect, Leadership Mo-hawk Valley, SUNY Poly, and the Levitt Center Provides workspace and technical assistance to Commercialization Acad-emy teams.Utica College recently moved its Business and Economics programs to Utica's Clark City Center, thanks to an MVREDC grant in 2015. The project expands greatly the College's footprint in down-town Utica as it relocates 14 employees, and adds 4 new professional positions and 12 temporary construction jobs. By bringing business resources to downtown Utica - and with it, hundreds of stu-dents - Utica College is strengthening the bonds between campus and community, and expanding its historic role as an educational leader and eco-nomic anchor in the Mohawk Valley. STEM Intensive businesses in the Mohawk Val-ley are concentrated around our largest popu-lation centers and contribute to their continued revitalization. 2016 - Progress Report 35SUNY 2020 & STARTUP NYIMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES MVCC: The MVCC Rome Campus has chosen to focus on unmanned aerial systems (UAS) as its preferred industry cluster, creating a maintenance curriculum to further job creation and regional industry diversifi-cation. UAS company ProDrones has established an office on the Rome Campus, and MVCC expects the business to benefit from the ecosystem established at Griffiss Business and Technology Park.HCCC: Herkimer College endeavors to partner with businesses that compliment its academic programs and mission, with a particular emphasis on increased internships and research opportunities. Herkimer is focusing on attracting businesses in the following fields: cyber security, computer information systems, crime and intelligence analysis, manufacturing, agribusiness and communication. FMCC: Economic and community development is within the mission of FMCC, and the college is com-mitted to creating a business-friendly environment in our region and state. FMCC has chosen to focus on helping to develop the former Tryon State Facility and the Florida Park Extension and anticipates leverag-ing positive business relationships through active site development. SUNY Oneonta: SUNY Oneonta and the County of Otsego Industrial Development Agency are working to develop a collaborative relationship to redevelop an off-campus property to house the Susquehanna Regional Business Center for Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Incubation. The space will provide busi-ness assistance programs that are specifically geared to the needs of its businesses through faculty/stu-dent collaborations and tapping into a network of partners, mentors and assistance providers. SUNY Oneonta received three SUNY 2020 awards totaling $,460,000 to support their strategic goals including: $350,000 (shared with SUNY Cobleskill) to support a new Making Cents Financial Litera-cy Program aimed at helping students to develop a strong understanding of personal financial manage-ment concepts, $90,000 to enhance advisement capabilities, including the acquisition and implementation of Early Alert Software; and $20,000 for efforts to increase graduate student enrollment, retention and post-graduate success.SUNY Cobleskill: Cobleskill has proposed to designate a recreation area ski lodge as a T ax-F ree NY property in order to attract start-ups or expansion enterprises that are in alignment with the agricultural and technical identity of the college and Schoharie County, which include: food processing and distribu-tion, dairy product and beverage manufacturing, and fruit and vegetable cultivation and processing. Com-pleted projects include the creation of Royal Meadery.SUNY Polytechnic Institute: SUNY Poly in a fully integrated science, engineering, and technology re-search and education institution. The college seeks participate in the statewide development hub-node model to enable the integration of industry partners and regional capabilities. Mohawk Valley REDC 36Full-Spectrum Opportunities in STEM: P-TECH, Partnerships, and Knowledge Worker PipelineThe Mohawk Valley's advanced and emerging in-dustries demand a STEM trained workforce, char-acterized by proficiency in math and science with propensities for creativity and entrepreneurial-ism. Our full-spectrum strategy for building the pipeline begins in local school districts, continues in higher education and industry-aligned training programs, and culminates with incentives for in-novation throughout. New York State has been a perennial leader in pioneering innovative education models that pre-pare students for 21st Century jobs. Those jobs are now here in the Mohawk Valley. To build a pipeline of talent, we must engage students ear-ly - especially those marginalized by traditional educational systems. Enter the P-TECH model. Forged in Brooklyn, P-TECH began in 2011 through a partnership be-tween IBM, CUNY City Tech, and the City De-partment of Education. Due to this program's suc-cess, similar programs were awarded across the state through the NYS Education Department. The P-TECH programs in the Mohawk Valley are shaping students to meet this need by offer-ing pathways of education in fields such as advanced manu-facturing, qual-ity assurance, i n f o r m a t i o n technology, and even agriculture and environ-mental sciences.HFM P-TECH, based in John-stown, was the Mohawk Valley's first P-TECH program and among the first 16 P-TECH programs awarded in NYS. The 2014-15 school year was the first pro-gram year, with 50 ninth-grade students - rising to 100 this year. Partnering with area employers, students can choose one of five STEM-focused career pathways, resulting in an associate's de-gree from Fulton-Montgomery Community Col-lege at no cost. Once considered \"high-risk\" students, these eleventh graders are now taking college-level courses. Valley P-TECH launched out of Herkimer BOCES in 2015, and with it, a class of 33 freshmen stu-dents began a program geared towards careers in quality assurance in advanced manufacturing. Through the program's partnership with a dozen local businesses and Herkimer College, students are able to become a part of the region's pipeline in advanced manufacturing careers.Following these models, P-TECH OHM partners with companies such as Indium Corporation, CONMED Corporation, and JH Rhodes to give students an inside look at potential careers in ad-vanced manufacturing and semiconductors in the Mohawk Valley. The first cohort of 23 students is OHM P-TECH Students on-site at Indium Corp. IMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES 2016 - Progress Report 37joined by a second cohort of more than 25 students this year; all on track to earn associates degrees from MVCC.Innovation is alive in even the most remote pockets of the Valley. In Edmeston Central School District, ig-nited by a Round IV CFA award to build a robotics laboratory, Edmeston is now home to For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST). Founded in 1989 to inspire young people's interest and participation in science and technology, the 501(c)(3) not-for-profit public charity designs accessible, innovative programs that moti-vate young people to pursue education and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math, while building self- confidence, knowledge, and life skills. Edmeston is now a ranked competitor in The First Lego League (FLL) & First Robotics Competition (FRC) - an opportunity for rural students in Otsego County to compete on a national stage and prepare for STEM careers in Rome, Amsterdam, Utica, and Oneonta. Full STEAM Ahead. This summer, the Project Fibonacci\u00ae STEAM Conference took place in Rome. Tar-geted at high-schools and colleges, more than 100 students from 15 counties participated in this first-ever, immersive summer program. The ultimate goal of the Project Fibonacci\u00ae initiative is to cultivate the next generation of young scholars, scientists, artists and productive citizens through a journey of self-discovery by positive motivation and enlightenment. Andrew Drozd, founder of Project Fibonacci\u00ae, is a perfect example of a STEM entrepreneur who has built a small piece of Silicon Valley in Rome. His firm, ANDRO Computational Solutions, leverages some of the highest tech and brilliant minds in cyber through internships and job opportunities within the STEM eco-system. A Round IV CFA Priority Project award is currently enabling further expansion of research and development in cyberspace, sensor, and electromagnetic systems. \"What Project Fibonacci\u00ae is trying to do here is to actually try to increase the importance of math across all of our disciplines,\" Drozd said. \"To me, math is very critical because the math is the binding glue be-tween the arts and the science worlds, you just see it in both domains ... We wanted to make the students more aware of that connection.\"Now beginning its fourth cohort, the Commercialization Academy is a program that helps entrepreneurs build businesses by turning Air Force Research Lab technologies into commercial products and business-es. Through its first three cohorts, the program has created more than 20 new businesses and executed 15 technology licensing agreements with the Air Force Research Lab. This is more than the number of execut-ed licensing agreements at all AFRL sites nationwide in the past decade. Through the first three cohorts of the program, over $400,000 in seed money has been raised for program, a number the MVREDC wishes to leverage further with URI funding. VP-TECH StudentAlternative to culvert project demonstrationIMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 Valley REDC 38Regional Cluster: Cyber and ITUnlike industry clusters in other regions, the Mo-hawk Valley's industry cluster - Cybersecurity - is the keystone that binds all business. The Internet of Things (IoT) involves the increasing prevalence of objects and entities - known, in this context as things -- provided with unique identifiers and the ability to automatically transfer data over a net-work. Much of the increase in IoT communication comes from computing devices and embedded sensor systems used in industrial machine-to-ma-chine (M2M) communication, smart energy grids, home and building automation, vehicle to vehicle communication and wearable computing devices.With the high visibility of automation innova-tions such as autonomous planes, robots and the Internet of Things, people are becoming more aware of the need to address cybersecurity for physical systems. However, because of the rapid emergence of these innovations, the nation's work force and education system are not ready to fully support this new need. Engineering schools, for example, do not integrate the curriculum for elec-tromechanical systems-related departments, such as mechanical engineering, with the curriculum for the departments that teach cybersecurity, such as computer science. The same separations occur in industrial organizations.As advanced as modern manufacturing is be-coming \u2014 with interconnected systems, comput-er controlled machining, and data-driven supply chains \u2014 cybersecurity is a concern for every manufacturer. In fact, cyber attacks are the big-gest risk facing manufacturing today. For instance, if an attacker tampers with the setpoint on a milk pasteurization unit, that manufacturer can pro-duce a product that can make people sick. If an attacker tampers with calibration equipment for turbine blades, it could produce an incorrect com-ponent that isn't discovered until after the fact, when the customer realizes that it isn't functional. Unlike computers, manufacturers can't \"restore from backup\" any damaged products that go out the door.Likewise, agriculture companies are building stur-dier digital fences to fend off cyberattacks that in-dustry officials say are increasingly targeting the sector's intellectual property. Companies includ-ing Monsanto Co. and Deere & Co. are investing more in cybersecurity as the farming industry grows more data-centric, with satellite-steered tractors and algorithm-driven planting services expanding across the United States. Seed and chemical companies have long guarded their tech-nology with patents and security measures, but the expanding array of farm-level data collected by high-tech combines and other farm equipment in recent years has increased concerns that the sector will become a bigger target of hackers.More so than any other industry, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are focusing on the interaction be-tween sensors, information, and physical systems. An ongoing effort is currently underway to discov-er new factors for protecting remote-controlled or autonomous craft. Threats can come from signals beamed into a control stream or even embedded software containing a Trojan horse. Researchers are addressing this challenge from traditional and innovative directions as the use of unmanned ae-rial vehicles continues to expand into new realms. But the issues that must be accommodated are growing as quickly as the industry itself.The tourism industry has learned the hard way that the physical security that they strive to pro-vide to guests, also applies to data security as well. Tourism destinations must make guests feel that the place they are visiting is as concerned about their personal and financial data as they are about their physical security. Moreover, industry leaders seek to meet the growing demand for mo-bile access - only achieved through innovations in cyber technology and security.Together, Cyber and Unmanned systems com-bine to form one of the most dynamic and glob-ally-competitive regional industry clusters in Upstate New York. The Mohawk Valley REDC is working with cyber firms, UAS pioneers, regional colleges, and the Workforce Development Board to strengthen and grow the industry through edu-IMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES 2016 - Progress Report 39cation, innovation, and commercialization of cut-ting-edge technologies.Led by the Air Force Research Laboratory Infor-mation Directorate in Rome, the Mohawk Valley has developed a significant niche in the cyber and IT industry over the last half century. With a massive $1 Billion annual budget, the AFRL has a calculated economic impact of $312 Million to the Mohawk Valley and Central New York. To-day, international firms such as PAR Technology, BAE Systems, and ITT Industries have offices in the region, while homegrown companies such as Black River Systems and Assured Information Se-curity are becoming forces in the industry. Griffiss International Airport is one of six nation-al sites to test the commercial use of Unmanned Aerial Systems, an effort that is being led by a two-state consortium known as the Northeast UAS Airspace Integration Research Alliance, or NUAIR. With more than 40 industry, technology and academic partners in New York and Massa-chusetts, NUAIR will lead the formation of a new industry cluster to make making the Upstate economy a pioneer in the development and com-mercialization of UAS systems that will help make the Region a hub of new economic activity.IMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES Education. Fueling the growth of this industry in the region is the ex-pansive IT talent pool generated by our elev-en local colleges and universities. Utica Col-lege has the expertise to create the first Cy-ber-Nano Test Range in the nation for use in the private sector. The test range provides a test environment for cyber security profes-sionals who are on the front line of defense of security for our nation's infrastructure. The project would, for the first time, place Department of Defense capability in the hands of private and public sector professionals. Cybersecurity professionals in the Mohawk Valley and throughout New York State will be able to test their computer systems so as to observe how those systems and networks may re-act to a variety of threats. With this information, they can identify vulnerabilities more accurately and the potential resulting damage, and importantly, forecast and understand how best to protect their systems from being compromised.Utica College has proposed a state-of-the-art Mal-ware Analysis and Training Center (MATC) on the College campus. Under the banner of the Cyber Tri-angle Park, this project's transformational combina-tion of research/development and training compo-nents will add to the Mohawk Valley's core capability in analyzing cyber threats, training cyber profession-als, while adding to the region's brand recognition to attract cyber related businesses that are focused on commercial applications vs. being primarily defense related.As a mechanism to constant challenge both students and curriculum designers, Mohawk Valley Commu-nity College hosts the semi-annual CNY Hackathon. Griffiss International Hackathon is a regional intercollegiate offensive/ defensive cybersecurity competition held at the end of each Fall and Spring semester designed to improve cybersecurity education and more closely align ac-ademia with Central New York industry partners. There were over 90 students participating from MVCC, HCCC, Utica College, SUNY Poly, Syracuse University and Oneida-Herkimer BOCES. Industry partners and volunteers included Rome Lab, AIS, AX Enterprize, AX Signature, M.A. Polce Consulting, and Quan-terion. Commercialization. Despite these world-class assets, the Mohawk Valley has historically trailed the rest of Upstate New York and the U.S. in patents. The tide is turning. The Commercialization Academy - based at the Griffiss Institute - is turning Air Force Research Lab technologies into commercial products and businesses. Since the beginning of 2015, the program has created more than 20 new businesses and exe-cuted 15 technology licensing agreements with the Air Force Research Lab. This is more than the number of executed licensing agreements at ALL AFRL sites nationwide in the past decade. Now in its fourth cohort, momentum is building and the Commercialization Academy is attracting Cyber entrepreneur teams from across the nation and around the globe.

Oneida County recently approved $100,000 for the CYBER NY Alliance to continue efforts to promote, strengthen and expand the initiatives to develop the assets at the Griffiss Business and Technology Park and the surround-ing region. Additionally, work will be done with NUAIR and the Griffiss International Airport to expand the cyber-driven sense-and-avoid research at the FAA UAS Test Site.NYS Lt. Gov. Hochul, joined by Senator Griffo, Assemblyman Brindisi, County Executive Picente and Rome Mayor Fusco, visited Rome Lab in October 2015. The last visit by a Senior New York Official to the Lab was in 2005. This event represents a major milestone in re-establishing a relationship between the exec-utive branch of NYS and Air Force leadership - one that promises to open new doors for collaboration and partnerships. In fact, regional Department of Defense assets have the full attention and ubiquitous support from our Local, State and Federal officials including County Executive Anthony Picente, Senator Joe Griffo, Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi, Congressman Hanna, and Senators Chuck Schumer and Kristen Gillibrand. Their support only strengthens and ensures that we maximize synergies between New York's technology initiatives and Rome Lab C4I, Cyber and Nano to enable further development of New York's CYBER Valley brand.In December 2015, the Omnibus spending bill included an increase to R&D funding for Rome Lab. With the additional funding, Rome Labs will develop a Cyber City Experimentation Range, which provides a real time, realistic environment for precision development of effective deployment of cyber technology to the battlefield.We continue to point to the profound convergence of Nano, Cyber, and Unmanned Systems in the Mo-hawk Valley; and that the Cyber Cluster is the glue that binds them. Our challenge, however, is that tradi-tional ESD capital funding does not match the requirements of cyber industry firms and entrepreneurs to develop and test new technologies. The rate of expansion and the number of new patents per capita will depend upon how the MVREDC can creatively leverage state funding to meet this demand and accelerate innovation in this cluster. The $50 Million in URI funding will be the key to fueling the prolific expansion of cyber tech I the Mohawk Valley. Mohawk Valley REDC 42In May 2016, with the help of Global NY, local businesses had the opportunity to learn how to get products and services into the market that is often most geographically- and cost-convenient: Canada. In this event, the Rome Area Chamber of Commerce hosted an economic mission from Quebec that included sixteen companies and five municipal governments. The mission from Canada comprised companies and whose focus included IT, software, cybersecurity, and unmanned aeri-al systems. The similarities that existed between these Canadian companies and the existing high tech cluster in the Mohawk Valley made this mis-sion an opportunity for local businesses to ex-plore new partnerships, as well as to expose the Mohawk Valley to Quebec firms as a location for foreign direct investment.Global NYSince 2010, the Mohawk Valley region's exports have increased more than 8%, from just over $1.8 billion to nearly $2 billion. This strong growth is a result of a strengthening US economy relative to the world economy, a growing regional econo-my, and the strategic initiatives of several regional partners whose goals are to promote trade and get local products into international markets.Over this time, the region has seen its strongest export growth in metal products and agricultural products. It is no surprise then, that the Mohawk Valley region identified advanced manufacturing and agriculture as two if its strategic investment areas. Since 2010, the region's export of metal products increased by 14% to more than $400 million in value per year. Meanwhile the region's growth in agricultural exports increased by 77% during this time to more than $170 million in value per year. Canada Delegation VisitRome, NYIMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES 2016 - Progress Report 43Opportunity AgendaIMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES An innovation ecosystem is only as strong as its component parts, particularly the quality and cre-ativity of its workforce. The workforce develop-ment partners of the Mohawk Valley understand that opportunity runs deep throughout all of the region's identified cluster industries, and will en-sure that the workforce needs of the present are met as the region builds for the future. In an effort to target populations that have fallen through the cracks and safeguard an affordable and healthy quality of life, the Workforce Development Board of Herkimer, Madison and Oneida Counties (WDB HMO) has crafted strategies to identify and reach underserved communities. WDB HMO secured an American Apprenticeship grant from the U.S. Department of Labor to aug-ment traditional apprenticeships with high-tech sector apprenticeships that can move lower-skilled area residents into higher-skilled jobs. With mul-tiple pathways to multiple careers, the project offers the opportunity for long-range workforce transformation and the creation of a vibrant ap-prenticeship system that can grow the long-range workforce in the sectors of nanotechnology and cybersecurity. Further, WDB HMO is seeking to at-tract young adults who \"stopped out\" in college, or graduated with degrees that did not result in em-ployment, into the many fields that will be growing jobs, so that young adults with some education can make a rapid transition to the workforce.The WDB HMO developed and is implementing the grant-funded Career Pathways for Youth proj-ect, which also addresses the regional Opportuni-ty Agenda to help low-income young people ac-quire the skills they need for the future. As part of a project providing summer employment, youth will be learning about cyber systems in the con-text of Unmanned Aerial Systems. In the health-care industry, WDB HMO has and will continue to work with educational and employer partners to increase entry and advancement in the healthcare industry. All of these initiatives will help to create accessible, viable career pathways to ensure that no resident of our region is left behind. What does that mean?-- Almost $3 million coming into our area to pay wages for apprentices and pre-apprentices.-- 350 apprentices in sectors that are under the nanotechnology, cybersecurity, digital skills and aviation umbrellas.-- 600 pre-apprentices in the first-ever regional pre-apprenticeship program that connects in-school and older youth with high-growth careers.The apprenticeship program builds on the great work done by our labor unions and visionary manufacturers such as Revere to use this age-old training method and bring it into the 21st Centu-ry. Apprenticeship builds skills as men and wom-en take what they learn and put it to practice on the job, earning wages as they learn what it takes to succeed.The American Apprenticeship project is one piece that was developed through collaboration with business, labor, education, government and economic development. Together, we as a com-munity are creating opportunity. \"The WDB's American Apprenticeship initiative is a piece of a bright new Mohawk Valley mosaic in which a diverse population achieves its dreams.\"-Alice Savino, Executive Director, Workforce Development BoardMohawk Valley REDC 44SUNY CobleskillStudent Dairy ProcessingIMPLEMENTATION OF KEY REGIONAL PRIORITIES Round Projects66750 Vets 2 Farm* Projects64773 Schoharie County Economic Development Strategy (ESD-SPFS)66580 Chaminade Industrial Park Strategy (ESD-SPFS)66750 Vets 2 Farm (DOL-UWTP)68185 Otsego County Regional Compost Facility (DEC-CSC) NYS Priorities section:Innovation Hot SpotDowntown RevitalizationWorkforce DevelopmentVeterans Opportunity AgendaGlobal NYSignificant Actions Plan: Priority URI Initiatives (4-Year Program)URI #Initiative4-Year2017MV21Regional Agricultural Asset Mapping & Cloud-Based Management Project$350,000$75,000MV22Global Food & Beverage Export Brokers for MV Producers $400,000$100,000 2016 - Progress Report 45Mohawk Harvest Cooperative MarketGloversvilleSTRATEGY: AGRIBUSINESS Mohawk Valley REDC 46The Mohawk Valley cannot envision a comprehensive economic recovery without a scientific strategy to strengthen and grow regional agribusiness and food systems. As global climate change and drought continues to threaten crop production and sustainability in traditional ag-riculture like California and Mexico, Upstate New York - specifically, from Buffalo to Amster-dam - consistently ranks among the top five dairy-producing regions in the nation and is posi-tioned to fill the gap to meet growing demand for food by large metropolitan economies.MV500 Project research and key findings in 2015 helped to bring the regional picture into focus: The abundant natural resources and climate give us a competitive advantage in dairy production and water-intensive crops Mohawk Valley producers are only beginning to exploit major metropolitan markets of New York City, Montreal, Ottowa, Boston, or Philadelphia; and demand for upstate produce remains unmet in local and larger NYS metropolitan Farm-to-Table retail and wholesale markets Although the food processing and food manufacturing cluster is growing, there exists a skills gap as well as an age cliff in the agriculture production and food processing sectors There has not been a true mechanism for on-farm capital support through the CFA process since 2011, and agricultural jobs generally fall outside of the traditional FTE paradigm. Our strategy, then, focuses less on what we cannot influence- namely, the climate and on-farm job support - and more on what we can through the CFA and URI: Brightwaters Farms. Situated on 150 acres of urban farmland in North Utica, Brightwaters is one of the largest greenhouse facilities in the northeast, currently shipping products to major metropolitan areas like New York City, Boston, and Washington DC. Promising new job opportunities for veterans, refugees, and hard to place workers in the metro area, the project proposes to expand production capacity, improve energy efficiency, and streamline shipping operations to major metro markets and institutions. Susquehanna Regional Food and Beverage Hub. A follow-on to last year's priority project and comple-mentary to Oneonta's DRI strategy, this project is the penultimate catalyst for revitalization of Oneonta's urban core. Creating a mixed-use environment for craft food and beverage producers, supply chain de-velopment, and tourism, the project features an on-site brewery, specialized training facilities, incubator space, and a boutique destination hotel. Vets 2 Farm. Through hands on training veterans learn the skills required to raise pigs or beef for mar-ket, in addition to skills associated with planting crops and managing forage for livestock through harvest management. Onsite training is accompanied by classroom training that is provided free of charge to par-ticipating veterans. Long-term, the Vets2Farm program will address the skills and age gap in agribusiness, as well as increase the number veteran-owned enterprises in a strategic regional cluster.By virtue of collaboration, the MVREDC is now able to target resources toward strategic industry and workforce development. Perhaps as intend-ed by the architects of the Upstate Revitalization Initiative, the physical and interdisciplinary connections made by MV500 are already beginning to bear fruit. 2016 - Progress Report 47 Green Wolf BrewingMiddleburghPart of Brew CentralPhoto Credit: Mitch Wojnarowicz/Brew Central 48Vireo Health of New YorkTryon Technology ParkCFA projects with significant progress since 2015At the beginning of 2016, slightly more than 70 in-dividuals were certified for medical cannabis treat-ment. Today, that number has increased to more than 7,000. Mohawk Valley leg-islators recently co-spon-sored legislation to stream-line the process in order to expand patient access as well as to expand cannabis production in NYS.In 2014, the former Tryon Campus was deeded over by New York State to the Fulton County Industrial Development Agency (IDA) - at which point FCIDA and County leaders swiftly be-gan the process of trans-forming the site into the Tryon Technology Park. Through the REDC process, Fulton County se-cured $2.18 million in Priority Project and MV Momentum funding to modernize park infrastruc-ture networks to meet strategic industry needs. In 2015, Fulton County invested an additional $2 million to ensure abundant supply of clean water to prospective agribusiness and high-tech tenants. As a result of sustained priority investments by the REDC, Tryon became the ideal site for cannabis research and production for VIREO Health, one of the five pioneering licensed manufacturers in med-ical marijuana in New York State. In 2015, Vireo opened dispensaries in Albany, Binghamton, White Plains, and Queens. The state-of-the-art medical research and production facility employs nearly 30 STEM workers today, and is positioned for expan-sion as the medical marijuana market in NY con-tinues to mature.Vireo Health Sustainable Cannabis Research and Production Facility The closed-loop hydroponic environment at the Tryon Technology Park in Fulton County incorpo-rates cutting-edge horticultural technology to ad-vance state objectives for comprehensive, afford-able health care for all.

In 2014, SUNY Cobleskill was awarded $1 million in REDC funding to establish an agribusiness incubator; and in 2015, the SUNY Cobleskill Farm & Food Business Incubator was a Priority Project, subsequently des-ignated as the MVREDC Innovation Hot Spot for 2015. Today, SUNY Cobleskill and CADE (the Center for Agricultural Development & Entrepreneurship) are currently seeking participants for the Farm & Food Business Incubator, which provides business train-ing and value-added product development facilities for new and expanding farm and food entrepreneurs. Whether looking to establish or expand, the Incu-bator provides access to invaluable services and re-sources through educational programming with local and national experts; access to customized support and mentoring; and for value-added producers, the ability to process without on-farm infrastructure.The Farm & Food Business Incubator offers on-farm and in-depth workshops, in addition to an intensive business planning course. On-farm workshops are demonstrations focused on a specific agricultur-al sector or process and led by local and national experts. By entering the Incubator, participants are fast-tracked into services and support designed to grow the strength and sustainability of our farm and food community. In-depth workshops delve into specific business topics, giving farm and food entrepreneurs invalu-able insight and tools for developing and growing their business. Topics include legal and labor issues, marketing, funding, food safety and other relevant topics. Participants may also utilize SUNY Coble-skill's processing facilities. The commercial kitchen, red meat processing and poultry processing facil-ities will be available beginning in August, and the campus creamery is under construction with an an-ticipated spring 2017 opening.Cobleskill will offer two degrees in Fermentation Science, beginning in fall 2017. The program combines the business and agricultural expertise at Cobleskill and expands more deeply into fer-mentation science with over a dozen new courses and labs. Establishing a foundation in fundamental science, students will be introduced to potential careers in fields that go well beyond beer- and wine-making. The Bachelor of Science degree will focus on biocatalysis, the science of fermen-tation in pharmaceutical and industrial uses; an environmental track that focuses on alternative energies and environmental damage mitigation; and food and beverage. The Bachelor of Technol-ogy degree focuses exclusively on the food and beverage uses of fermentation.There will be 14 new courses, including labs that will give students an opportunity to experiment with small-batch beer and wine-making, cheese fermentation, bread and more. But for the B.S., the focus is on building a strong scientific foundation, giving students the skills and knowledge to ana-lyze fermentation processes, troubleshoot prob-lems and develop new methods.Innovation Hot Spot: SUNY Cobleskill Farm & Food Business Incubator IMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES \"The perfect storm is upon us,\" explained CADE's Executive Director, Rebecca Morgan. \"With increased market maturation in regional foods, continued drought in the West and Southeast, new distribution models to con-nect producers to northeast consumers, this is the right time to grow our regional farm businesses.\"Mohawk Valley REDC 50 \"The Hartwick College Center for Craft Food & Beverage will provide a critical link in a virtuous cycle of economic momentum in this industry, a momentum that will ultimately benefit the region's citizens and our own Hartwick College students through expanded research, internship and, ultimately, employment opportunities for Hartwick graduates.

After an international search the CCFB hired director, Aaron MacLeod - who moved to NYS from Canada and wasted no time in bringing the Center online. Collaborating with local brewers, like Butternuts and Ommegang, MacLeod and President Mar-garet Drugovich have already crafted a stout strategy for growth.The CCFB was an MVREDC Priority Project in both 2013 and 2015, leverag-ing public and private funding from the Appalachian Regional Commission, NYS Legislature, and Hartwick College. The Center offers laboratory testing services for beer and brewing raw materials such as barley, malt and hops. Additionally, the Center routinely provides technical assistance and business planning services as well as professional development opportunities and ed-ucation. The Center fills an essential role in the industry's infrastructure by offering education, training, and research. It also provides reliable testing to assess product consistency and quality, thus ensuring that craft food and beverages will continue to capture market share and maintain consumer loyalty.The Center also continues to support research collaborations involving stu-dents, faculty, and master brewers focused on the biochemistry of brewing, and recently teamed with the Otsego-Delaware Hops Alliance to deliver an Initial Report on the hops industry in Upstate New York.In January 2016, the Center was featured at the MVREDC Regional Show-case. Director Aaron MacLeod and a contingent of European chemists from Sweden were in Albany to display the new Brewmaster analytical machinery, en-route to installation and commissioning in the Hartwick CCFB. Also in 2016, Hartwick College hosted the Farmer Brewer Winter Weekend confer-ence. More than 100 farmers, brewers, and maltsters from across the country attended the sold out two-day conference to explore the science behind their craft and discuss the opportunities and challenges of working with local in-gredients to make great beer.2016 - Progress Report 51 Hartwick CollegeCraft Food and Beverage CenterMohawk Valley REDC 52Agribusiness is working as a catalyst for smart growth in the Mohawk Valley.

Food Systems and the Farm-to-Table movement is playing an increasingly pivotal role in down-town revitalization in our other DRI communities as well:Sharon Springs. Catalyzed by the Beekman 1802 farm-based lifestyle brand, the revitalized Village of Sharon Springs draws tens of thousands of vis-itors from all over the world. Joined by the iconic American Hotel and other South Main Street ca-fes, the farm-to-table concept has blossomed into a farm-to-home lifestyle that culminates in the world-famous Harvest Festival in September.Rome. The City of Rome is embarking on an am-bitious re-tooling of their zoning and infrastruc-ture to attract craft food, dairy, and beverage manufacturers to downtown. With the help of two major NYSERDA grants (one a Round III Cleaner Greener Communities CFA), the city is designing a regional anaerobic digester at the Wastewater Treatment Plant and developing sustainable form-based codes to allow niche producers to locate in the heart of downtown. The plan is working; as Copper City Brewing - a NYS Farm Brewery - is set to open this fall in downtown Rome. Copper City Brewing will be the first brewery to return to downtown Rome in nearly a century...and just in time for the Bicentennial of the Erie Canal.Utica. In August, judges awarded $25,000 to Smith Market, a co-op and grocery that endeav-ors to address the food desert issue by offering a variety of fresh, local food, and is slated to open in September 2017 in Bagg's Square East. The award is the product of collaboration between the thINCubator and The Community Foundation of Herkimer and Oneida Counties to create an impact in downtown Utica. Utica Coffee (CFA Round III), Utica Bread Co, Gerber's, and the Tailor & the Cook are changing the landscape and directly re-sponsible for adaptive reuse and revitalization of historic Bagg's Square.Cooperstown. Situated among the most pictur-esque and fertile landscapes in Upstate New York, the growth of agribusiness and craft brewing fig-ures heavily into Cooperstown's revitalization. Conceived by the Cooperstown Distillery and with the support of local legends, Brewery Ommegang and Cooperstown Brewing Co., the Cooperstown Beverage Exchange is a one-of-a-kind concept in the Mohawk Valley. Gloversville. What started as a small storefront on Main Street has grown into something special. Mohawk Harvest Cooperative Market in down-town Gloversville opened at a time when people began to think more about both their food and their downtown. Mohawk Harvest focuses on \"a triple bottom line\" of social, economic and envi-ronmental revitalization. Working with MVREDC staff, Mohawk Harvest was awarded the region's first Healthy Food, Healthy Communities grant from Empire State Development, which inspired the market to expand upon its offerings for the Wom-en, Infants and Children's program, or WIC. Now there is a walkable, universally-accessible market in the heart of downtown Gloversville - formerly a food desert - offering affordable, healthy, local food choices to families who need it most. IMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES Downtown Revitalization 2016 - Progress Report 532015's Upstate Revital-ization Initiative gave the region a chance to reflect on its most im-portant industries, and how to ensure their via-bility and growth - spe-cifically, to create and retain a new generation of agribusiness workers, innovators and entre-preneurs. As one of the region's strategic industries, the conversation turned to how the region could best address the age cliff, technology gaps, and training needs in ag-riculture and food sys-tems. The response was swift and comprehen-sive. The Canajoharie Central School District partnered with HFM BOCES to secure a fourth P-TECH in the Mohawk Valley - this one with a focus on agriculture. In its first year, AG-PTECH is partnering with more than a dozen area farms and businesses, as well as with Herkimer College, Fulton-Montgomery Community College, and SUNY Cobleskill. Ag-PTECH will put students on pathways for careers in agribusiness, agricultural science and engineering, power machinery, environmental studies, and wildlife technologies. The implementation of this new P-TECH program is vali-dation that agriculture and food processing will play a key role in the new regional economy.Fifteen businesses initially joined in the grant, committed to providing important mentoring and internship opportunities for students in the new PTECH. Today there are 20 participating businesses.AG-TECH StudentsIMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES Workforce Development \"Agriculture is the original STEM industry. Our schools prioritize STEM programs as critical to stu-dent success. STEM is Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, the building blocks of today's agribusiness growth. This grant will provide the means to create new agricultural educa-tion programs aligned with the opportunities in this growing field.\"- Dr. Patrick Michel, HFM BOCES District SuperintendentMohawk Valley REDC 54VeteransVeterans are and continue to be one of the most underserved and hard-to-reach populations both nationally and in our region. Generally, veterans are self-reliant: an admirable quality in the field, but an enormous obstacle when trying to reinte-grate into civilian life. Recent statistics show that nationally, 22 veterans die by suicide each day, and veterans are 41% - 61% more likely to die by suicide than civilians. Unwilling to be a \"burden\" to those around them, veterans will keep their stressors to themselves, having an extreme impact on overall health and decision-making. A bleak picture, but the Mohawk Valley has iden-tified regional initiatives with the capacity to at-tend to veteran needs, and is committed to veteran success after active military duty. Enter Coble-skill's Student Veteran Resource Center, a unique enterprise considering that less than 25% of col-lege campuses nationally have dedicated veter-ans' services. Matt LaLonde, Director of Judicial and Veteran Affairs, has been engaging veterans and raising awareness about what benefits are available to veteran populations. LaLonde, a veteran himself, also encourages stu-dent veterans to use the Center to build a com-munity of their peers. There is no substitute for boots-on-the-ground outreach, interpersonal contact hours and relationship building, particu-larly when your col-lege campus has a higher than average campus veteran pop-ulation: SUNY Co-bleskill has a campus veteran population of 3.5%, where the na-tional average is 2%.The Center has a ded-icated computer lab that has reached ca-pacity, as well as a peer-to-peer support system and a VA work-study program. It also of-fers transition counseling, which consists of get-ting to know the veteran and developing a rap-port as the first step; trust often leads to a higher degree of help-seeking. The counseling includes identifying successes and deficits in a veteran's life: are they financially stable? Do they have so-cial supports? What are their academic interests and skills? Each question moves toward the cen-ter of considering the veteran as a whole person, and helping the veteran reclaim agency over his or her life. The Student Veteran's Association at SUNY Co-bleskill was also awarded a $10,000 grant from the VetCenter Initiative grant program, a part-nership between the Student Veterans of Amer-ica (SVA) and the Home Depot Foundation, to enhance the College's existing Student Veteran Resource Center.Dave Gevry has made it his mission to assist other vets in a way that he found most helpful when he returned from Afghanistan: therapy through agri-culture and animal husbandry.And so, Vets2Farm was founded. Gevry, the Ex-ecutive Director and co-founder, has designed the program exclusively for veteran populations, providing both a physical and emotional outlet SUNY CobleskillStudent Veteran Resource Center IMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES 2016 - Progress Report 55Veterans ConferenceSUNY Poly Uticafor vets with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other distress sustained during wartime. Vets2Farm provides hands-on farm training and classroom instruction to veter-ans interested in pursuing agriculture as a business enterprise or joining a small area farm. The goal of Vets2Farm is two-fold: to as-sist veterans in all aspects as they transition back to civilian life, and to increase the pro-ductivity of small or medium farms through-out the region. Gevry's work feeds into the growth of the region as an agribusiness and agro-tourism hub, adding beef, pork and fresh vegetables to the cadre of marketable products already available. Vets2Farm an-ticipates enrolling 12 unemployed veterans over the course of the next two years and is collaborating with SUNY Cobleskill to provide the classroom-based training com-ponent. Each enrolled veteran will have the opportunity to participate in Cobleskill's welding certification program or butcher certification program. Vets2Farm has the benefit of being co-found-ed by Ward Halverson, a former veteran and a certified family and veteran therapist. Vet-erans enrolling in the program will not only receive hands-on agricultural training and in kind classroom experience, they can confidently address ongoing emotional concerns resulting from com-bat and military-to-civilian transition-related stress. Other programs around the region include a conference at SUNY Polytechnic Institute in Utica that was held in early August. The Engage, Employ and Empower Local Veterans Conference focused on connect-ing veterans to needed services as well as helping employers connect with veterans and better serve their needs. Sessions included \"Veterans Hiring Initiative - One Company is Way Ahead\" which is designed for employers and featured Brendan Kearns and Brian Ray from Walmart. \"Overview of Veterans Benefits\" this was designed for veterans and was taught by with Joe Perrone from Oneida County. \"Driving Com-munity Impact\" which was designed for providers and medical professionals and featured Colonel James McDonough from the Institute for Veterans and Military Families. \"Hire Our Vets. What Employers Need to Know\" which was for employers and featured Patti Williams from ACCES-VR, and Betsy Webb-Bron-zetti from the VA. \"Find a Job or Create a Job - Employment and Business Start-Up Services Available for Veterans\" this one was for veteran families and was with John Calabrese from Express Employment, and Sam Russo from SCORE and MV SBDC. \"Cultural Competency for Providers and Medical Professionals\" which was for providers and medical professionals and it featured Steve Darman and Scott McCumber from Social Science Associates. The event was free to veteran and their families. IMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES Mohawk Valley REDC 56Opportunity AgendaThe most recent data shows an increase in re-gional poverty. However, at the beginning of 2016, the United Way of the Valley and Greater Uti-ca and The Community Foundation of Herkimer and Oneida Counties have pushed to replicate the Rochester-Monroe Anti-Poverty Initiative by creating the Utica-Oneida Anti-Poverty Initiative (UOAPI). The UOAPI has convened area stake-holders and thought-leaders to collaborate with populations living in poverty and identify the pri-mary drivers of poverty, rather than dictating a prescriptive \"solution\" in a top-down approach. The director of the initiative, Kevin Alexander, has lived in poverty and understands better than most the unique challenges of addressing facets of pov-erty: lack of generational wealth and institution-alized racism, as well as more common barriers: child care, transportation, education and housing opportunities. Fulton Montgomery Community College has un-veiled an expanded daycare program, serving college students and employees. The program is equipped to accommodate children from six weeks to five years of age, allowing parents to attend and complete college while alleviat-ing the limitations other-wise posed by childcare. FMCC's daycare program has developed a play-based, developmental-ly appropriate learning curriculum designed to promote the whole child. Additionally, continual assessments help to ad-dress the unique needs and developmental mile-stones of each child. The Community Foun-dation of Herkimer and Oneida Counties, Inc. has launched a $1 million initiative aimed at eliminating childhood lead poisoning in Herkimer and Oneida counties by 2030. Oneida County consistently has one of the highest rates of childhood lead poison-ing in the state: 2.4% of children younger than six had elevated blood lead levels in 2012. In Herkimer County, 1% of children tested had elevated levels. [Observer-Dispatch; NYSDOH]. The risks of lead poisoning are real and all too common: develop-mental delays, learning disabilities and behavior-al issues. People of color and people who live in poverty are disproportionately affected by lead poisoning, which is often found in substandard housing with paint pre-dating 1978. Compassion Coalition began in 1999 in response to a local newspaper article that showed food pantries were out of food mid year, with no means to obtain more food. They were established in or-der to distribute food to local pantries, and keep them stocked throughout the year. The organiza-tion met not only local needs, but needs of food pantries regionally. Compassion Compassion CoalitionUtica IMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES 2016 - Progress Report 57IMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES FMCC- Fulton County YDaycareCoalition has made generous partnerships both locally, and nationally. Compassion Coali-tion has grown to be able to give away $20,000,000+ (retail val-ue) in product in 2015. They have evolved to not only working with food, but serving our local com-munity agencies with sundry products. Compassion Coalition is unique, in that is a primarily a self -sustaining entity. Compassion Coalition is a multi-faceted organization under one roof. One of the goals is to em-body the statement: \"shop with a purpose\". They are the not for profit side of our multifaceted or-ganization that relies on the sales of our for profit grocery store: Your Bargain Grocer. Your Bargain Grocer helps our agency to continue to be self sustaining. We rely on vast marketplace connections that allow us to buy salvage products, as well as donations to keep us sus-tainable. America is currently throwing away 40% of its food yearly. There is a movement arising national-ly, to reclaim wasted food. Our goal is to obtain perfectly good fresh produce, meats, and dry product that is close dated to expiration, and sell it at a low cost to those who shop in our store. We are extending the buying power of those who are using EBT, and aiding the working poor by allowing healthy food options within their budget. Compassion Coalition plans to expand and build a brand new neighborhood grocery store, which will be located on Lincoln Avenue, Utica, NY. Their current store is 1,200 sq. ft. and the new store will have 6,500 sq. ft. of retail floor space. Compassion Coalition, Inc. has partnered with REDC by securing a $160,000 grant through New York State and Empire State Development for the building of this new store. The new location and larger size will allow them to facilitate a larger downtown presence on major bus lines with easy access to not only staples, but fresh fruits and veggies, meats, organics and healthier selec-tions. They will maintain our affordable pricing structure - still below box store prices making healthy food choices very affordable to a growing customer base. Utica is an official Resettlement Community - over 40 languages are spoken in the local high school. Since 2000, the U.S. Census figures show that Utica's Asian population has increased by 206%, African American by 12%, and Hispanics by 64%. The key expected outcome will be to meet the healthy food choice needs of our growing number of refugees and immigrants and those looking for organic products - saving them a trip to larger and more expensive metropolitan centers to shop. Mohawk Valley REDC 58Global NYWhile services such as those offered through the CNYIBA seek to bring local producers into the global market, efforts have been made to also bring the global market to the Mohawk Valley. In May of 2016, the trade commissioner of Ecuador visited Oneida County to discuss future part-nerships with regional business and government leaders. As the United States is already Ecuador's largest trade partner, local representatives ex-plored potential trade relationships between Ec-uadorian and Upstate New York firms in the ag-ricultural/food processing, textiles, and chemicals industries.In June, local economic development professionals put the Mohawk Valley on the world stage again by promoting local products and strategic sites while at the Fancy Food Show in New York city. This annual event, which is attended by thousands of vendors and food producers from around the world, has become a lucrative opportunity to gain greater international exposure for local produc-ers as well as for foreign firms seeking to invest and expand into the American market. As a result of the Fancy Food Show, local producers such as Smith Packing, Adirondack Distilling, and Mer-cer's Dairy have increased international attention and penetrated new markets. In another example of the Mohawk Valley's lever-age of New York State exporting support, the Mo-hawk Valley has sought to capitalize on the avail-ability of exporting assistance through the Global NY Fund, which provides grants of up to $25,000 to help companies start or increase exporting their product. The availability of funds through this program allows one of the Mohawk Valley's rapidly growing industries to better access global markets - craft beverages. Brew Central is the en-gine for making this happen. On behalf of brewers and distillers in the Mohawk Valley and Central New York regions, Brew Central's Craft Beverage Marketing Grant application to the Global NY Fund proposes to perform critical market research and identify appropriate international markets in which to concentrate export efforts. 2016 Fancy Food ShowJavits CenterIMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES 2016 - Progress Report 59IMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES This map depicts major metropolitan and international markets within a day's drive of Mohawk Valley farms, food processors, and craft brewers.

Tourism is playing an increasingly prominent role in our regional economy. Until 2015, however, we had not seen the full picture as it relates to the six-county Mohawk Valley region. The collaborative research and planning effort of the MV500 Project unveiled economic data that surprised and thrilled the team. Overwhelmingly positive impacts on employment opportunities, international exports, and placemaking will continue to guide our priority REDC Investments.Opportunity. The MV500 Project noted that tourism in the Mohawk V alley continues to occupy a com-paratively large percentage of total employment (7.7%, vs. NYS 5.3%) as compared to the rest of New York. Fully aware that service economy jobs tend to be more seasonal and lower-paying than most man-ufacturing, professional, or technical positions, they are a critical rung on the ladder of opportunity in the region. Traditional barriers to entry into the workforce are generally less problematic for entry-level tourism workers; the experience affords individuals the chance to meaningfully participate in the economy while gaining valuable life and employment skills. Our challenge, as a community, is to ensure that oppor-tunities continue beyond entry level and into middle-skills jobs in STEM professions, advanced industries, food systems, and manufacturing.Global Exports. Travel and tourism, as an industry, ranks in the top five export industries by real export value growth in the Mohawk Valley ($58M, 28% growth). International investments in technology, by their very origin, will spark new international interest in the Mohawk Valley. Placemaking. Continued expansion of regional and international tourism is largely a function of unique places, diverse choices, and one's proximity to those features. The majority of the region's most popular destinations are inextricably tied to our cities and villages. The duration and quality of out-of-town visits to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, Howe Caverns, Fort Stanwix National Monument, Adirondack Moun-tains, and the Erie Canal are all deeply dependent upon the desire and ability of tourists to eat, sleep, and explore our downtowns. MountainMan Outdoor Supply expansion project is a perfect example of how growing downtown cor-ridors contributes to a major tourism draw: specifically, the Adirondack Mountains. A robust shopping experience simmers beneath a more meaningful reason for the expansion: the importance of gearing up for an Adirondack adventure. The cycle of adventure tourism and the appeal of the wilderness has driven investment in MountainMan, the entrance to downtown Old Forge. A similar phenomenon has happened in Sharon Springs. The RESTORE NY and Downtown Revitalization Initiative (DRI) have refocused comprehensive planning efforts in our major downtowns, and re-energized implementation plans for 2016-17. The Mighty Waters Action Agenda is comprised of targeted waterfront investments to create an accessible network of places and grow interconnectivity among our waterfront communities. Combined with CFA opportunities like New York Main Streets, the Canalway Grants program, the Green Infrastructure Grant Program, and the Local Waterfront Revitalization Program, this year's strategy prioritizes those projects that create charm-ing spaces and walkable downtowns.Connecting our communities, distinguishing the Mohawk Valley as a unique destination, and continuing to increase tourism as a global export define our strategy for 2016-2017.2016 - Progress Report 63Which industries are exports growing? The prolific tourism ecosystem developing around Cooperstown is a symbiosis of diverse visitor experiences - anchored by the international attraction of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Brewery Ommegang - a compelling argument for the Cooperstown-Oneonta downtown WiFi project. The URI plan also includes a proposal for a 400-room destination hotel and waterpark in the corridor to enhance the visitor experience, create more than 800 jobs, and import new dollars into the region.Mohawk Valley REDC 64Brew CentralStories on TapIn 2014, the Central New York Vacation Region introduced Brew Central, a brand that would take the region beyond its simple identity as north of New York and Westchester. Brew Central trans-formed Central New York into America's Craft Brew Destination and strong support from the state helped stake that claim coast to coast. What started with a modest budget and humble approach utilizing advertising, promotional mate-rials and social engagement has grown into a full scale strategic marketing plan with the support of ESD. The 2016 Brew Central campaign thrives with significant partnerships with Brand USA and VisitTheUSA.com, national press coverage in publications such as Craft Beer & Brewing, do-mestic and international promotion at consumer and travel trade shows, all with the passionate support of Central New York brewers, distillers and vintners. In September 2016 the CNY Vacation Region, in partnership with ILNY, hosted the annual Des-tination Travel Trade Showcase to highlight the Brew Central experience and region's attractions to 75 tour operator companies and 250 group tour leaders from both domestic and international destinations, including the UK, Ireland and China.Not only has the Brew Central brand earned awards in state and national tourism and market-ing competition, it has made a positive impact on CFA projects with significant progress since 2015BrewCentralNY.com Campaignthe region's economy. The Central New York Travel Region saw visitor spending top $2.1 billion in 2015 for a 3.7% ($76 million) increase over the previous year, according to a study by Tourism Economics.In July 2016, the region applied for Craft Beverage Marketing Grant funds to expand the BrewCen-tralNY.com campaign and its partner's craft bever-age products through international export. Should funding be awarded, comprehensive research will be conducted to determine the best market, plan and approach to build a craft beverage export plan. Once completed the plan will be made available to other regions to use as a model for growth through exporting. The Export Plan and process will live on BrewCen-tralNY.com and will be shared with other regions in New York State as a model for growth. The Export Plan will continue to be available as a guide for pro-ducers that may not initially participate, but choose to pursue exporting when the time is right for their business.

Next year, New York will cel-ebrate the Bicentennial of this event. Although the primary focus of the canal has shifted from freight to tourists, it re-mains a resilient blue thread of commerce that connects the jewels of Sylvan Beach, Rome, Utica, Frankfort, Ilion, the Mohawk Valley has witnessed piv-otal developments in communities along the Canal that have stayed the course on planning, partner-ship, and placemaking. The Mohawk Valley Mighty Waters Action Agenda is a collaboration with the Department of State and among waterfront cit-ies and villages. The MV Mighty Waters agenda seeks to leverage the Canal and its tributary wa-terways as epicenters of investment in our historic downtowns and waterfronts. Much has happened since formalized in 2015:In Fonda, forty-one miles of the Erie Canalway Trail were paved to allow universal access to trail enthusiasts. This completes a major section of the system, and connects the Villages of Fonda, Cana-joharie, and Amsterdam via a fully-paved trail net-work along the Canal.After nearly a decade of planning, design, and de-termination, the first three miles of the Mohawk River Trail were completed, connecting the Erie Canal to Fort Stanwix National Monument, down-town Rome, Mohawk Valley Community College, Griffiss Business & Technology Park, and nearly a dozen distinct neighborhoods, schools, and city parks in Rome's urban core. A true example of an urban greenway, the 10-foot wide paved trail is accessible by foot, bike, stroller, wheelchair, skate, and even hoverboard. Due to the astonishing pop-Adventure Tourism: Activating our Waterfronts ularity of the urban trail, last month, three Zagster Bike Share stations were strategically located at popular trail entrances - the first mobile app-based bike share in the Mohawk Valley.Most impressive, perhaps, is the opening of the Mo-hawk River Overlook Bridge this year in Amster-dam.

Cooperstown's legendary museum is, without question, the region's most internationally-renowned tourist attraction. An estimated 50,000 people from around the world crammed onto Cooperstown's Main Street to cheer on the Class of 2016 during Induction Weekend. Every summer, more than 200,000 visitors rent rooms and pack the pubs of Cooperstown and Oneonta. This September, the Hall unveiled another component of their collection- by cloud.For more than 75 years, the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum has been committed to pre-serving the history of the National Pastime in Cooperstown. With more than three million library items, a quarter of a million unique images and 40,000 three-dimensional artifacts representing baseball's illustrious history, the Museum preserves an immense physical collection that brings baseball history to life. Through the Hall of Fame Digital Archive Project, the Museum, over the next several years, will contin-ue to digitize its collections and Library archive, making PASTIME (Public Archive System To Interact with the Museum Electronically) the online portal for fans and students of the game to relive baseball's greatest moments. Today, 25 volumes of 10 different Babe Ruth scrapbooks in the collection will be available online for the first time. These one-of-a-kind artifacts, created by Ruth's agent Christy Walsh, provide a unique look at Ruth's career through letters, stories and photographs, and give a glimpse into the authentic Babe Ruth. Additional digitized material - including photos, audio, video and text - from the Museum collection will be published every other Wednesday as the Museum adds to PASTIME. The goal of the Project is to provide online access to the precious artifacts and documents that are preserved in Cooperstown for fans and researchers around the globe, while ensuring that they are digitally archived for newcom-ers to baseball culture.The Hall of Fame is trying to bring those stories closer to fans who cannot make the journey to Coo-perstown, N.Y.\"The idea is to make as wide a variety of material as accessible as possible,\" said Jeff Idelson, the Hall of Fame's president. \"For those who can't get here, it allows them to touch the Hall of Fame and have a relationship with us.\"Digitizing the full collection of the Hall of Fame library is impractical; the costs of manually tagging and indexing it all would be prohibitive, and copyright laws would prevent permanent posting of books and articles. But the Hall of Fame has a trove of personal effects and correspondence, often donated by players' families, that would otherwise be hidden.\"We don't collect stuff to gather dust in the basement,\" said Jim Gates, the library director. \"We want it to be used.\"Libraries everywhere are digitizing, Gates said, and the Hall of Fame is eager to share its collection with everybody, not just researchers who make appointments in Cooperstown. Ripken, who runs a widely popular youth baseball league, said it was an essential step.Mohawk Valley REDC 68 IMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES Downtown Revitalization The goal of vibrant communities is the creation of quality places. Quality places are essential to attracting and retaining talented workers and are a decision-making driver. Yet quality places rarely occur accidentally.

With for-eign-born immigrants and refugees, in particular, the barriers to employ-ment are significant. As a result, so many talented and willing individu-als are left on the sidelines. We still believe that Tourism is part of the solution to this problem; leveraging diversity to grow one of the region's top exports.More than 18% of Utica's popula-tion is foreign-born - second only to New York City statewide, and the highest in Upstate NY. The Mohawk Valley Resource Center for Refugees (MVRCR) continues to play a critical role in workforce development and refugee resettlement. In addition to facilitating the resettlement of more than 16,000 refugees, MVRCR of-fers employment skills prep, training in interviewing skills, job coaching/counseling, and vocational training. The Turning Stone Resort and Casino is not only the region's most popular tourist destination and Oneida County's top employer; it is also among the largest single-employers of resettled refugees in Upstate New York. Since 2009, more than 700 refugees have been hired in entry-level service and tourism industry positions. Full-time employ-ment for these individuals is literally life-chang-ing - nowhere is this more apparent than at the Turning Stone. Elfad Becic, originally from Bosnia, became a U.S. citizen seven years ago. He is began as a Turn-ing Stone security officer and has been promot-ed twice since starting. \"I love it... they [Turning Stone] gave me so many opportunities, and I took them,\" Becic said of his employer. Many refugees consider entry-level positions as a starting point with a chance to prosper, making the refugee community one of the most reliable sources of IMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES Opportunity Agenda employees in the region; employers like Turning Stone welcome the symbiotic relationship and are only too happy to see their employees flourish. Recognizing the value and ethic of Utica's refugee population, the Turning Stone has partnered with the MVRCR to provide on-site English classes, training programs, and advancement opportu-nities.

Proficiency in the English language, acquired on the job, has also translated into greater community engagement and more meaningful participation in the city's re-vitalization. Mohawk Valley REDC 70Global NY: Imperial Baths, Sharon SpringsThroughout human history, mineral-rich natural spring water has been regarded as a cure for various physical and emotional afflictions. Since the late 1800s, the Village of Sharon Springs has been a destina-tion for Americans searching for the fabled \"water cure.\"Gaining notoriety as a destination for persons in high social standing, prominent families such as the Van-derbilts, Van Rensselaers, and Presidents of the United States frequented the resort town. In 1927, the Imperial Bath House was constructed on Main Street. Complete with 43 tubs, private resting rooms, and four massage rooms, the Imperial was one of the Village's most expansive spa resorts. Eventually, Sharon Springs fell into decline, leaving many of the spas and hotels - including the Imperial Bath House - vacant, neglected, and crumbling.Incentivized by a RESTORE NY grant, Korean investors began redevelopment of the spa and historic structures in 2015. The project not only leverages millions in foreign direct investment (FDI), but is pre-mised upon the attraction of predominantly international tourists to the Mohawk Valley. This round, the same foreign investors have proposed an ambitious plan to revitalize the historic Columbia Hotel in down-town Sharon Springs. Also part of the Village's DRI proposal, the MVREDC has recommended the historic preservation project as a Global NY Priority Project (ESD) in CFA Round VI.In 2015, redevelopment of the site begun with a Korean investor named K yu Sung Cho, who plans to re-habilitate historic structures at the site, revitalize the resort spa, and also renovate the historic Adler and Columbia Hotels. Cho already specializes in catering to Asian tourists, the mayor said it is likely that Sha-ron Springs would also benefit from more travelers heading to or from the Turning Stone casino in Oneida County as well as a recently-approved casino to be constructed in Schenectady.Cho also owns Donbu Tour and Travel Inc., a business that runs tourist buses from New York City to Ni-agara Falls. Historic Imperial BathsSharon SpringsIMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES 2016 - Progress Report 71Cho, in discussing the Sharon Springs project on its new web page, said the bus business will help bring clients to the resort located in the heart of the village.\"The resort can easily be added to the existing tour packages,\" he said, noting his company brings some 40,000 people to Niagara Falls yearly.A key strip of the streetscape in the historic village of Sharon Springs will be preserved as part of the $10 million project to re-open the long-closed Imperial Baths health spa, once the core of the resort industry that put this community on the map.The renovation work could take 18 months to two years to complete, said Kevin Lee, a spokesman for the business. The second phase of the project \u2014 incorporating an Asian-themed restaurant and lodging into the complex \u2014 will begin later. The third phase of the project is a major restoration of the long-closed Hotel Adler, which has fallen into serious disrepair after being abandoned for years.The health spa has the potential for tourism partnerships with other nearby vacation destinations, includ-ing Cooperstown and Howe Caverns.Imperial Baths 2016Restoration Project BeginsIMPLEMENTATION STATE PRIORITIES GroundbreakingImperial BathsMohawk Valley REDC 72 \"To me, success means to achieve the goals I have set for myself, and to be satisfied to what I have.\"-Jenjira May Htoo, Former Karen RefugeeJenjira May Htoo is currently a graduate student in Information Design and Technology at the SUNY Institute of Technology. She is a Karen refugee whose family was originally from the Karen borderlands between what is now Thailand and Burma. She was born and brought up in a Refugee Camp in Thailand and moved to the United States in Fall 2007 after living at Mae La refugee camp.Jenjira was 18 when she arrived in Utica, New York. Unfortunately due to her age she was not allowed to attend the local high school. Instead she was placed in the New Comer Program, a special program for refugee youth aged 17 to 21. This group was diverse and individuals had different educational backgrounds.Jenjira spent two months in the New Comer Program and started seeking employment. Her first job was at Turning Stone Casino, where she worked as a housekeeper in the hotel. After working full time for a year and half and sav-ing up some money, she started thinking of pursuing more education. Jenjira decided to enroll at MVCC. For her first two semesters she attend the ESL program. After completing ESL Jenjira enrolled as a fulltime student. While attending school full time she also had a job as a fulltime CNA (certified nurs-ing assistant).In May 2012, she became the first person in her family to graduate with a college degree, earning an Associate in Psychology. She was also the first person to pursue higher education from the group of Karen/Burmese refugee youth who came to the U.S in 2007-2008 and did not have the opportunity to attend high school in Utica, New York. In December 2013, she graduated from SUNY-IT with a BA in Psychology and a minor in Sociology.Jenjira was a member of the Psychology Club, the American and Refugee Stu-dents for Closer Connection, and an active volunteer with Tabernacle Baptist Church in Utica, NY. She is interested in helping her Karen community, and youth in particular, as well as survivors of trauma. She is also interested in helping girls and minorities enter STEM fields.

PARTICIPATIONThe MV500 Project brought together the most prolific and diverse strategy team that the region has ever seen. Dozens of individu-als dedicated countless hours of precious time and energy into the development of Sparking Transformation. Building upon this unprec-edented public participation, the Mohawk Valley REDC is strength-ened by our broad network of elected officials, educators, not-for-profit leaders, innovators, and captains of industry. Collaborating in the physical and virtual dimensions, our workgroups are focused on advancing state and regional priorities to rebuild the Mohawk Valley economy.Mohawk Valley REDC 86 Six Years of REDC: Changing the Landscape. In 2011, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo redefined New York's eco-nomic development through creation of the REDCs and institution of the CFA process. The next few years were marked by a new era of collaboration and participation by leaders across six counties which, frankly, never fully shared a common media market or eco-nomic ties. This has all begun to change; as the region's business-es, colleges, and governments are continuously exploring new ways to work within the framework.In 2014, the Mohawk Valley came together like never before in an historic MV Regional Summit. More than 200 leaders from the public and private sectors came together to share regional suc-cesses and to set a collaborative vision for the future. So much was learned about each other and the regional economy, and so many new partnerships were formed. There was a tangible, pal-pable new energy permeating the Valley from Rome to Little Falls, Oneonta to Gloversville, Utica to Amsterdam, Sharon Springs to Old Forge. Last year, the Mohawk Valley rallied to compete for $500 million in Upstate Revitalization Initiative (URI) funding, and more than 1500 individuals contributed to the effort through events, workgroups, thinktanks, and community meetings in every corner of the region. Although Sparking Transformation was not selected as a URI Best Plan, we came out of the process stronger, wiser, and more unified than ever. We also had a comprehensive plan that we could im-plement.This year, the MVREDC has focused outreach and engagement of local officials to advance downtown revitalization in order to ad-dress a critical component of the innovation ecosystem - Vibrant Communities. The game-changing Downtown Revitalization Initia-tive, the long-awaited reincarnation of the RESTORE NY program, and the promise of $50 million to advance our URI plan have each validated Sparking Transformation, and provided common goals for all of our communities to pursue - Smart Growth, adaptive reuse, green infrastructure, brownfield revitalization, transportation alter-natives, and sustainable development.2016 - Progress Report 87 MVREDC Regional SummitMohawk Valley REDC 88A Region UnifiedOf all the positive interactions, it is Canajoharie's story that best demonstrates our expansive en-gagement of local governments, widespread col-laboration, and common vision for Vibrant Commu-nities in the Mohawk Valley.A Region Unified. Never before has the MVREDC been so motivated around regional strat-egies than during the MV500 Project. Members of the Council continue to work in concert to engage Cities and Villages of all sizes in every county to step forward with plans and projects for DRI, RESTORE NY, and the URI. Of all the positive collaboration, it is Canajoharie's story that best demonstrates our local government engagement, teamwork and common vision for Vibrant Communities in the Mo-hawk Valley.NYS Thruway Exit 29 is the gateway to some of the greatest treasures in the region. From here, visitors can make the jump to Sharon Springs, Cooperstown, Cobleskill, the Adiron-dacks, and the Canalway Trail. Directly adjacent to Exit 29 and the NYS Barge Canal sits a 600,000 square foot building 26 acres along the Canajoharie Creek. The former Beech-Nut Foods manufacturing complex is a hulking relic of the industrial revolution.Since the late 1800s, Beech-Nut Foods employed literally generations of families in the Vil-lage and surrounding towns, responsible for a once-thriving downtown, Art Museum, and infrastructure network. Today, the former manufacturing complex is the ultimate symbol of bight and decay in Upstate New York. Last year, the cross-regional MV500 team resolved to set the machinery in motion to ad-dress the problem. The Canajoharie site was the major inspiration behind RECLAIM MV - the region's answer to complex brownfield revitalization for communities with limited re-sources. In Sparking Transformation, the project was identified as the #1 priority for RE-CLAIM MV. Although the region was not selected for URI funding, the MVREDC kept the project at the forefront.During the winter, Paul Beyer, the Smart Growth Director for the Department of State, alert-ed MVREDC Co-Chairs and staff to a unique opportunity from the American Architectur-al Foundation's 2016 Sustainable Cities initiative. Based on extensive URI Implementation planning, the MVREDC, DOS, and Montgomery County planners immediately responded to the opportunity, making a compelling case for neighborhood-level brownfield revitalization planning. Against a field of major cities across the United States, we prevailed.In early August, a team representing the County participated in the American Architectural Foundation's 2016 Sustainable Cities Design Academy, in Washington, D.C., alongside win-ning teams from Baltimore, Maryland; Wichita, Kansas; and Fresno, California. The three-day intensive design session focused on the future of downtown Canajoharie through brain-storming sessions, cross-disciplinary training and implementation planning. 2016 - Progress Report 89Former Beech- Nut Facility, Canajoharie Local, state and federal partners, including Congressman Chris Gibson, Montgomery County Executive Mat-thew Ossenfort, and the Village Mayor Francis Avery are fully engaged. Empire State Development President & CEO Howard Zemsky and MVREDC staff have all toured the site, and continue to provide input and ex-plore creative solutions to the brownfield problem. County Executive Ossenfort has assembled an interdis-ciplinary, team of village trustees, county legislators and EPA representatives to keep the project on track.MVREDC members and staff continue to seek funding and leverage opportunities through the CFA and other state programs.A temporary issuance of ownership, will allow a county-hired team to collect data to determine the level of pollution at the site. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is conducting a Phase II Environmental study on behalf of Montgomery County, where approximately $100,000 in environmental work is being done by EPA at no cost to local taxpayers. To further accelerate planning and implementation efforts, Montgomery County prepared a 2016 Local Wa-terfront Revitalization Program CFA (an MVREDC Priority), and plans to submit an application under the Restore NY program for building demolition. The project continues to be the top priority for RECLAIM MV once the URI program is approved.\"This will be a multi-year plan, obviously. The good news is, we're making progress.\" - Montgomery County Executive Matthew OssenfortMohawk Valley REDC 90AGRICULTURE & FOOD SYSTEMS THINKTANK.

DOWNTOWN REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE Mohawk Valley REDC 94 Downtown Revitalization Initiative Awardee: Oneonta2016 - Progress Report 95 LOCATION AND BOUNDARYOneonta's downtown is easily identified and has at its core a traditional city downtown mixed-use district along and adja-cent to Main Street. The downtown is bounded at the south by the 56-acre Neawha Park, a public green space within easy walking distance from Main Street, the park features base-ball fields, tennis courts, a skateboard park, picnic pavilions, numerous walking paths and the historic Damaschke Field, home to the Oneonta Outlaws. The downtown's boundary is firmly defined to the east by the James F. Lettis Highway, and to the north by Walnut Street: In both cases, the roads roughly delineate boundaries between downtown mixed-use development and the adjoining residential neighborhoods. The downtown is vibrant, walkable, compact and welcoming.VISION/CONCEPTAcross the past several years, Oneonta has used persistence and careful planning to overcome much of the economic downturn and retrenchment it has experienced in the latter half of the 20th century. Now the city stands poised to so-lidify its position as the center of commerce and culture in the southern Mohawk Valley and northern Catskills. Its past investments in local and regional plans, as well as very real financial investments in many aspects of its downtown, have helped create exciting, vibrant neighborhoods with a healthy economy. The Governor's DRI funds will enable Oneonta to capitalize on the city's transformational plans to impact both the local and regional economy through investment in cata-lytic projects such as the Craft Food and Beverage Innova-tion District and the Rail Yards redevelopment. Both will cre-ate jobs, attract private investment, and enhance Oneonta's appeal to the next generation of employees and employers.Mohawk Valley REDC 96 REDC RATIONALE & ALIGNMENT WITH STRATEGIESThe Mohawk Valley received competitive DRI applications from several of its major cities and centers, but Oneonta stood out for one principal reason: readiness. The city's strategy for DRI investment built on years of planning, most recently Focus on the Future of Main Street, a comprehensive economic develop-ment and planning study funded with $75,000 of ESD grant monies. One of the priority projects emerg-ing from the DRI application involves creating a craft food and beverage \"innovation district,\" a project emerging directly from a year-long feasibility study funded by MVREDC Momentum Fund investment. Further, Oneonta has a strong track record of investment in downtown, effectively utilizing public dollars to catalyze private investment: $6 million in public and private investment to turn a blighted anchor building, the former Bresee's De-partment store, into Parkview Place, with commercial space on the ground floor and market-rate, loft-style apartments on the upper floors Syracuse-based developer Housing Visions has undertaken a major affordable housing initiative involv-ing 60 units at a total cost of just under $16 million Oneonta won $500,000 in New York Main Street funding to renovate more than 10 historic buildings on Main Street, which has leveraged an additional $800,000 in private funds from property owners The city completed a Main Street Streetscape assessment in 2014 which assessed existing conditions and identified opportunities, including aesthetic improvements and improved ADA compliance and wayfinding. Construction on this $550,000 project began in the spring of 2016 and will leverage $400,000 in CDBG public infrastructure funds with direct city investmentOne of the primary projects, the Craft Food and Beverage Innovation District, aligns beautifully with the MVREDC's three strategic focuses: Agriculture, Tourism, and STEM-related industries, while di-rectly benefitting the region's Opportunity Agenda by creating entry-level jobs, workforce training, and mixed-income housing.The Mohawk Valley REDC selected Oneonta because the city has done the hard work to get to a \"tipping point\" and the infusion of investment dollars from the state will enable Oneonta to readily and effectively transform its downtown. DRI money will truly be the catalyst to create jobs, speed investment and lever-age collaboration.2016 - Progress Report 97 UNIQUE ASSETSOneonta embodies the adage \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\" It is not so much the unique-ness of any one of its assets, but rather the quality, variety and number of its assets that makes Oneonta truly remarkable. As its DRI application states, \"Downtown Oneonta provides big city amenities packaged in small town feel.\" Located in the shadow of the Catskill Mountains, Oneonta's downtown is surrounded by striking natural beauty that compliments the lovely and largely untouched facades of its historic buildings. Because Oneonta is located between Binghamton, Utica and the Capital Region, it serves as primary downtown for a population of more than 150,000 within a 30-mile radius.Immediately adjacent to (and within walking distance of Oneonta's downtown are tSUNY Oneonta and Hartwick College, whose 7,500 students and hundreds of faculty and staff use the city as their primary downtown. Between performances at the newly constructed Foothills Performing Arts Center, live music at the his-toric Oneonta Theatre, independent musicians at the B Side Ballroom, art exhibits at CANO and small galleries, its downtown boasts a lively and walkable arts scene. Residents have access to a year-round farmers' market, and to the organic fare at the Green Earth Grocery; private yoga and exercise studios compliment the large YMCA and A.O. Fox Hospital provides high-quality health care. While small, Oneonta has pursued and instituted progressive policies, including Smart Growth principles, energy efficiency (replacing 146 downtown light fixtures with LED fixtures), Complete Streets, transit-ori-ented development and participation in the six-county Land Bank. Lastly, the city's proximity to major tourism assets cannot be overlooked. In less than 30 minutes, One-onta residents have access to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, as well as to Brewery Ommegang, one of the state's crown jewels of craft beer production and outdoor music venues.Mohawk Valley REDC 98PROJECTS IDENTIFIEDMarket Street Craft Food and Beverage Innovation District: Oneonta has a rare opportunity in devel-oping its languishing Market Street: to double the size of its downtown. Market Street, once an integral part of downtown, lost traffic and buildings over time and currently sits disconnected from downtown both physically and economically. This project promises to transform Market Street into an exciting mixed-use neighborhood that melds a food hub, an ag-based innovation area, and an arts and entertainment district that will stimulate private development and create new jobs. Components include: Food Hub and Entrepreneurial Center, centered on food and beverage R&D and value-added produc-tion; possible tenants include a workforce training center, a commercial kitchen, a pilot craft brewery, an urban grocery store, and mixed-income housing on its upper floors. Oneonta Transit and Lifestyle Center, redeveloping the city's parking garage into a multimodal trans-portation hub with an attractive fa\u00e7ade, retail shops on the first floor and mixed-income housing on the levels above. Mohawk Valley Hospitality and Entertainment Complex, creation of an ambitious mixed-use neigh-borhood that will include an 80 room boutique hotel with craft brewery/restaurant, connected to an entertainment complex that will meld the recreational activities of the YMCA with the performing-arts activities of Foothills, with improved streetscape, wayfinding and branding.In all, these Market Street initiatives are expected to directly create 250 jobs and dozens of ancillary jobs, and to leverage approximately $42 million in private investment.Oneonta Rail Yard Redevelopment: A priority project for the city, the redevelopment of the Rail Yards, will spur major job creation and new business attraction. Otsego Now is working closely with Norfolk Southern to develop approximately 80 acres into shovel-ready sites for such industries as light manufacturing, value-added food production, and distribution. Plans call for construction of workers' housing on the perimeter of the property, close to Chestnut Street. The city is also explor-ing seeking Foreign Trade Zone designation for this area. If successful, the Rail Yards would be one of the most significant development sites in this area of the State. Development in the Rail Yards will directly compliment and bolster the city's downtown revitalization. A vibrant downtown is crucial in attracting new companies to a community, and likewise, the new jobs and demand for housing and services brought by these new companies will further catalyze Oneonta's downtown. Development of this rail-supported commercial real estate is expected to directly create 500 to 700 jobs and to leverage $88 million in private investment. Development Opportunities: The core of Oneonta's Main Street is a largely intact collection of attached late 19th and early 20th century mixed use commercial blocks. While many of its buildings have been renovated and are fully occupied, several vacant buildings persist on Main Street, and far too many buildings have unused and vacant upper floors. As Oneonta suffers from a dearth of mar-ket-rate housing, these vacant floors present an opportunity for repurposing into residential units, of-fices, or other uses. In addition, the city has mapped vacant infill sites along Main and Market Streets, as well as air space above existing parking lots, which can accommodate new development2016 - Progress Report 99NEXT STEPSThe scope of services defined by the DRI indicate that the following steps will be part of the effort: Creating and coordinating the Local Planning Committee Creating and executing a community engagement plan, with public engagement occurring early and consistently through the process, and encompassing a broad and diverse population Developing a profile of downtown downtown Vision: Creating a clearly articulated vision for revitalizing the downtown, building on ex-isting plans and strategies, and considering the unique characteristics of Oneonta and the surrounding region Presenting an outline of plan to MVREDC in October: outline will include assets, strengths, weakness-es, market potential and community vision Creating ambitious strategies to drive development and investment in the downtown, including an Action Plan that brings together elements of economic development, transportation, housing and com-munity projects that holistically encompass downtown revitalization Selecting priority catalytic projects for implementation with DRI funding: projects should be key to the overall revitalization strategy and should have potential to leverage additional investment Creating a detailed strategy to guide implementation of the plan and its proposed projects; strategy will include prioritization, phasing, estimated costs, responsible parties and potential funding sources Creating performance indicators and metric to monitor progress In February 2017, findings and recommendations to be presented to the Local Planning Committee and MVREDC for acceptancePLANNING COMMITTEENancy Kleniewski President SUNY OneontaMargaret Fox Memorial for OtsegoWayne Carrington Principal Owner bside BallroomJoe Ficano Council Member City of OneontaLen Carson Board Representative Otsego County Kristy Lawson Staff Operations Manager YMCAElizabeth Horvath COO Otsego Now Jeffrey Lord VP Commercial Team Leader Community BankTim Masterjohn Principal Owner Red CaboosePatricia Kennedy CEO SpringbrookCarolyn Lewis Regional Development Manager Bassett Healthcare NetworkGary Herzig Mayor City of OneontaKen Meifert VP Sponsorship & Development National Baseball Hall of Fame & Museum STAFF Meg Hungerford Finance Director City of OneontaMohawk Valley REDC 100COOPERSTOWNThe entire Village of Cooperstown is on the national historic register, and boasts not only stun-ning natural beauty and a world-recognized brand, but also state-of-the-art healthcare, a national-ly-ranked high school, a year-round farmers' market, a lively arts scene, an expansive sports center and six public parks. The village has all but completed a comprehensive plan, and has made major investments in infrastructure (rebuilt sidewalks, new rain gardens, creation of a Village Gateway to the south) with plans for more.Cooperstown has seen significant private investment from Bassett Hospital and the National Baseball Hall of Fame, in addition to the burgeoning \"beverage trail\" and in the hospitality sector. Despite these assets, Cooperstown continues to have a housing deficit at every income level, a shortage of residential and visitor parking, and an insufficiently diversified economy. Recognizing these needs, the village is aggressively pursuing several projects to continue to revitalize its downtown. With sup-port from the MVREDC and its strategic agenda, the village hopes to make these projects a reality in the near term: CFA# 66128 - $125,000 (ESD Priority Project) + $448,704 (OPRHP). Rehabilitation of 22 Main Street, a magnificent but aging building housing Village offices, the public library, and the Coo-perstown Art Association. CFA# 65836 - $13,000 (ESD). Doubleday Field improvements and mixed-use development, to restore the field to its former glory and to create a lively, walkable mini-district immediately adja-cent that will include green space, retail, parking and high-end residential CFA# 66252 - $226,950 (OPRHP). Site evaluations and redevelopment of two of the Village's most popular parks, to improve visitor experience Master plans for the redevelopment of the Railroad Avenue and Doubleday districts to create a year-round economy, including design of streetscape improvements and a branding scheme Upgrades to the Village's aged sewer plant to meet current environmental standards and peak season use.The DRI process, helped communities to consolidate recent planning efforts into a focused, targeted strategy for revitalization of their downtowns. Even more, it helped the REDC to better understand the vision for each of the region's most progressive neighborhoods and put the capital projects into perspective. We are now able to take a comprehensive, measured approach to helping these commu-nities achieve their vision - and advance the MV500 Vibrant Communities strategy.Downtown Revitalization Initiative Priorities 2016 - Progress Report 101 ROMEThe city has identified five strategic sites in the Rome Rises Project Area, a 180 acre target redevel-opment area that will catalyze future investment and build on the momentum to revitalize downtown. Each site is an integral part of the urban core and located immediately adjacent to the city's greatest economic development assets, including the Erie Canal and Mohawk River, the Mohawk River and Canalway Trail network, Arts & Cultural district, and a number of significant local and national historic sites. The realization of the Rome Rises projects will leverage these assets, transforming downtown Rome into a thriving, active and attractive urban environment.The DRI funding will support a piece of each project that will prepare the site for private investment and implementation, and be a significant step in reshaping the future of Rome. This funding will offset the costs associated with demolishing, remediating, and enhancing strategic redevelopment sites in the city so that they can be repurposed into economically viable and sustainable destinations. These necessary improvements will further serve as an incentive to private developers, streamlining the development process and providing a shovel-ready site. This funding is critical to move the process forward, so that downtown Rome can be a healthy environment for residents now and in the future.These sites include: Erie Boulevard / South James Street Connective Waterfront Corridor; City Yard Connectivity and Regional Recreation Destination; Rome-Turney Redevelopment; George Street Transportation Hub Redevelopment; Rome Cable Demolition and Shovel Ready. Mohawk Valley REDC 102UTICAUtica is ripe for the Downtown Revitalization Initiative (DRI) investment. The city is on the brink of an exciting and unprecedented economic transformation and downtown Utica will be front and center as the city continues to welcome new visitors, employees, businesses and residents. The region will be able to draw inspiration and innovation from downtown Utica - a nexus for the exchange of concepts, culture, and capital through community-driven planning, sustainable design and creative placemaking, Utica has demonstrated the readiness to implement a $10 million capital program, the momentum to sustain economic transformation, and an overall estimated 57:1 leverage ratio.Focused on creating an attractive and engaging downtown, the city is concentrating resources on the downtown Utica Core. The selected districts best reflect the character, diversity, infrastructure, and policies essential to build investor confidence and to market the area to an increasingly global workforce. Recognizing that professionals, millennials, empty-nesters, and artists are choosing urban life to suburban environments, Utica has been strategizing to spark a local and regional economic resurgence. Downtown Revitalization Initiative Priorities 2016 - Progress Report 103AMSTERDAMThe City of Amsterdam's Downtown Revitalization Initiative area encompasses both the traditional and previously established downtown district, as well as three other key core contributing neighbor-hoods that each function interdependently. The downtown neighborhood consists of four districts: 1) the Southside Culinary and Hospitality District; 2) the East Main Street Riverfront District; 3) the Historic Main Street District; and 4) the Chuctanunda Falls Entrepreneurial District. The area encompasses 127 acres and contains 76 businesses, employing more than 900 people. It includes diverse housing options, healthy and affordable food markets, retail shops and eateries, multi-modal transit, recreational facilities, a multitude of healthcare services, and various entertain-ment venues. The boundary for the City of Amsterdam's target area is intended to incorporate loca-tions that collectively provide the necessary commercial, residential, and recreational amenities that will interconnect.Currently, Amsterdam has seen its first increase in population in over 70 years and has less business loss now than in the last 20 years. With over $63 million recently invested by both the public and pri-vate sector, Amsterdam's downtown revival has already begun. However, deteriorating infrastructure, a surplus of abandoned properties, scattered areas of blight, and the long-lasting repercussions felt by community members in the wake of a collapsing economy can cause the revitalization efforts of this once booming city to feel at times like an overwhelmingly daunting task. While remarkable strides have been made in recent years, Amsterdam is still in great need of assistance to propel the commu-nity through some of the last uphill strides. Mohawk Valley REDC 104 SHARON SPRINGSThe Village of Sharon Springs' Downtown Revitalization Initiative encompasses Main Street (Route 10) within the 1.8 square mile community. It has been listed as a Target Area in the MV500 plan ad-versely affected by the presence of blighted, vacant, and underutilized properties. Since then, Sharon Springs' Main Street is experiencing and economic and cultural revitalization. Private investment has propelled Main Street from a virtually abandoned downtown to a vibrant and thriving area which draws visitors from across the state, country, and world. Sharon Springs, Inc. (SSI), a private developer, incentivized by a $1 million RESTORE New York grant, has begun a $9 million investment in the restoration and rehabilitation of the Imperial Bath and Spa project, as well as multiple hotels within the community. These entrepreneurs are applying their ex-pertise to transform a stock of historic properties into flagship enterprises supported by modern day sales and distribution efforts. The downtown area has attracted much interest worldwide in the past five to ten years. Many success stories have prompted business, civic, and economic growth in this unique and diverse community. Continued investment is greatly needed to continue the upward rise of the community and creating a national tourist attraction community. Downtown Revitalization Initiative Priorities 2016 - Progress Report 105GLOVERSVILLEWithin the past three years something profound has happened to Gloversville and its people. It is dif-ficult to say what sparked this new attitude, but the city is experiencing what can only be described as a transformative awakening. There is a new awareness among a significant percentage of its popu-lation of the principles of new urbanism and the central, leading position a vibrant urban center must assume in the building of a dynamic 21st century community. Much of this change is owed to the open-ing of Mohawk Harvest Cooperative and the spin off initiatives it fostered. It is also the likely result of the well-attended public hearings on the city's new comprehensive plan held in 2014 and the change of leadership direction from newly elected city council members. Today, this new positive spirit is manifesting itself in the form of major private investment in downtown and plans for much greater investment in the near future. The possibility of building a sustainable and vibrant 21st century city upon the architectural legacy in our region has ignited the imagination of business leaders, political office holders and the community at large. This has fostered partnerships and the establishment of common goals among disparate entities that only a few years ago would not have been possible. Though struggling under the weight of abandoned factories, disinvested neigh-borhoods and a high tax rate, Gloversville is uniquely poised for a transformation that will make it a sustainable economic engine.

These infrastructure improvements are needed to help lead to the commitment of Dollar General to construct a 750,000 sq. ft. Distribution Center in the Park on approximately 103 acres. This could lead to 430 indirect jobs from Dollar General. As part of the project, the Montgomery County Industrial Development Agency is being required by the New York State Department of Transpor-tation to undertake various improvements to New York State Highway 5S in order to accommodate the Dollar General Distribution Facility along with future build out of the remaining 67 acres in the Florida Business Park Extension. Projected invest-ment for this project is over $60 million should Dollar General commit to the Florida Business Park Extension site. Strategic Alignment:VIBRANT COMMUNITIES - this project aligns closely with the MVREDC's core strategy of reviving communi-ties. In this project, the investment made to enhance infrastructure at a significant regional business park is directly tied to the attraction of a major employer, which would bring hundreds of jobs to a county that has experienced recent job loss.

Revenues associated with the current location are expected to increase by approximately 75%. Strategic Alignment:STEM - The MVREDC identified manufacturing as one of its key areas for growth in its original 2011 Strategic Plan. The Council stated that in order to grow the region's economy, it must grow its regional concentration of key economic sectors, including advanced manufacturing. This investment aligns with that strategy, as it will result in the physical expansion of a local manufacturer, and will also result in the creation of 80 new high-paying jobs, which will give employees highly valuable and transferable skills. 2016 - Progress Report 119USES OF FUNDSUSEAMOUNTConstruction$2,067,000Architectural/Engineering$1,000,000Training$100,000Equipment$3,335,000Construction $3,683,000Furniture and Fixtures$250,000TOTAL COST$10,455,000SOURCES OF Grant State Funds$260,000,000Other CREATED835AMS AG MARCY NANOCENTER NATURAL GAS MAIN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT Project involves construction by National Grid of a 12\" steel main gas main that will run from Barnes Avenue in Utica to the Marcy-SUNY Parkway. The site currently lacks sufficient natural gas ca-pacity to serve ams AG and full build out of Marcy site. The new gas main is necessary to support the ams AG project along with full build out of the Marcy Nanocenter site and growth of Quad C and SUNY Poly Innovation Acceleration Center. Full build out of SUNY Poly's nanotechnology initia-tives will support 4,000 to 5,000 direct jobs and approximately 8,000 to 10,000 indirect jobs. ams AG -the first tenant at the Marcy site - will create 740 direct jobs over ten years and is expected to attract another 500 indirect supply chain jobs. Strategic Alignment:STEM - The ams AG project is consistent with the MVREDC's 2015 Upstate Revitalization Strategy in that it achieves the following strategy objectives: 1. Growing an innovation network that increases the region's STEM In-tensive Industry jobs; 2. Building a 21st century workforce and education network to develop a workforce pipeline that is aligned with the region's STEM Industries; 3. Fostering the creation of an entreprenurial ecosystem; 4. In-creasing the region's global export economy and positioning the region for attracting foreign direct investment; 5.

The Park is now near capacity with manufacturing firms in-cluding Advanced Generating Technologies (AGT), Solar City, Rayco of Schenectady, and Brenton Industries. AGT is currently in the process of ex-panding its operations with a $17 million upgrade ($3 million from ESD). The new expansion at AGT has placed a tremendous load on National Grid power transmission lines into the Industrial Park. Because of the amount of users and demand, National Grid wants park tenants to use a larger transmission line that is not so heavily loaded. The cost of this extending the 69KV line through the park and associated equipment is around $2.5 mil-lion. The expected outcome would be that existing companies would have the capacity to expand in the immediate future.Strategic Alignment:VIBRANT COMMUNITIES - this project aligns closely with the MVREDC's core strategy of reviving communi-ties. In this project, the investment made to enhance infrastructure at this significant regional business park is tied to the potential growth of a existing tenants, which could bring dozens of jobs to a community that has experienced recent job loss.SOURCES OF FUNDSPUBLIC SOURCES OF FUNDSEmpire State Development Grant $500,000Other Funds$300,000TOTAL FUNDS$800,000PRIVATE SOURCES OF FUNDSPRIVATE: Owner FUNDSUSEAMOUNTConstruction$2,200,000Equipment$300,000TOTAL OF FUNDSPUBLIC SOURCES OF FUNDSEmpire State FUNDS$1,000,000PRIVATE OR RETAINED20INDIRECT/CONSTRUCTIONJOBS CREATED20COLUMBIA HOTEL RESTORATIONThe project involves the historic reconstruction of the Columbia Hotel, a hotel in downtown Sha-ron Springs which has been vacant for almost two decades. The project is currently being designed by DJH Architects and Crawford Associates Engineers in consultation with the NYS Historic Preservation Office. The Columbia Hotel will be rehabilitated historically to have 50 guess rooms. Currently, the only Hotel in operation is the Amer-ican Hotel which has only 8 rooms. With the opening of the Imperial Baths and Spa there will be a need for several dozens of new hotel rooms. Upon completion of the Columbia Hotel and its achieving full occupancy, Sharon Springs will once again become a year-round tourist destination with available rooms to accommodate the influx of visitors. Upon the successful completion of the Columbia, a third hotel, the Adler, is planned for renovation which will accommodate another 120 rooms.Strategic Alignment:TOURISM - This project aligns closely with the MVREDC's core strategy of growing one of its identified key growth sectors - TOURISM. The Village of Sharon Springs traditionally has been a tourist destination with its many spas and resorts. As many of those assets have been closed or underutilized for years, this project reinvests in those assets and reinvigorates the tourism economy of Schoharie County. This project will result in the creation of 20 new permanent full time jobs - and a direct investment of some additional $4 million in private investment.

This facility will be open for public use but monitored by the Cobleskill Agricultural Society staff. This facility can also be utilized as a catering facility to also allow for food preparation to promote the use of the grounds for community gathering events. Strategic Alignment:AGRIBUSINESS - This project aligns with the MVREDC's core strategy of growing one of its identified key growth sectors - Agriculture. This sector provides thousands of jobs, and infuses millions of dollars into the re-gion's economy. As a largely rural region, agriculture is one facet of the economy that unites all counties. This proj-ect, located in Cobleskill, will build on the assets of the Cobleskill Agricultural Society and provide shared space for farmers and other ag-related workers to produce food that is consumer-ready. This project will provide support to local farmers by allowing them to break into new markets in which they can sell their goods.Mohawk Valley REDC 142SOURCES OF FUNDSPUBLIC SOURCES OF FUNDSEmpire State Grant Funds$1,041,700TOTAL FUNDS$1,302,000PRIVATE RETAINED0INDIRECT/CONSTRUCTIONJOBS CREATED30HALES MILLS ROAD DEVELOPMENT AREA WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTFulton County has recognized that the lack of available water and wastewater services outside of the Cities of Gloversville and Johnstown is inhibiting development in the surrounding town-ships. Of these, the City of Gloversville has an ex-cess capacity of 3.12 million gallons per day (mgd). The Gloversville-Johnstown Joint Wastewater Treatment Facility, which is owned and operated by both cities, has an excess flow capacity of 8.6 mgd. Based on research, the County has conclud-ed that a regional water and wastewater system can be successfully implemented. The County's 2016 Capital Plan includes a $100,000 project to prepare a map, plan and report for the creation of a County Water & Sewer District along Hales Mills Road Extension in the Town of Johnstown. Once these Districts are created, FC will proceed with preparing design plans and bid specifications for a waterline project. The project will include the installation of approximately 6,000 feet of 12\" diameter waterline. Strategic Alignment:VIBRANT COMMUNITIES - this project aligns with the MVREDC's core strategy of reviving communities. In this project, the investment made to enhance infrastructure in Fulton County is tied to the potential growth of business in the areas outside Gloversville and Johnstown, which are ripe for development. Such development could bring hundreds of jobs to a community that has experienced significant recent job loss.2016 Priority Projects2016 - Progress Report 143SOURCES OF FUNDSPUBLIC SOURCES OF FUNDSEmpire State Development Grant $280,000Other Funds$1,120,000TOTAL FUNDS$1,400,000PRIVATE OF 1900 BLEECKER STREETThe City of Utica is proposing to demolish an existing, vacant City-owned building in order to create a modern-day business park on City-owned land. The proposed site of the business park includes one entire city block on which the building sits, as well as a second entire city block immediately west. Together, the 2 blocks com-prise a site 9 acres in size. The City will demolish the existing building with its own DPW forces in order to clear the site and accommodate con-struction of a building(s) to house commercial/industrial tenants. This proposed development has the potential to capture relocating businesses affected by the building of a new hospital complex in downtown Utica. Strategic Alignment:VIBRANT COMMUNITIES - This investment will address issues of urban blight, brownfield revitalization, and smart growth by transforming a Utica property from one that is barren and blighted, to one that revitalizes a neigh-borhood. This development has the potential to also complement transformation in the downtown Utica neighbor-hood, by serving as an option for relocation for businesses that will be impacted by the new Mohawk Valley Health System hospital.USES OF FUNDSUSEAMOUNTInfrastructure/Site Work$1,162,500Architectural/Engineering$139,500TOTAL "}
