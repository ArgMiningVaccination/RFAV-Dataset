The term Ayurveda comes from two Sanskrit words; Ayur, which means life; and Veda means science.. the principles of Ayurveda are held together by its core value : BALANCE. Ayurveda believes that health is achieved when there is a balance in all areas of your being; body, mind, and soul. The key to health is gaining balance in everything. Ayurveda perceives the body as made up of energies: Vata, which comprises space and air; Pitta, which comprises fire and water; and Kapha, which comprises water and earth. These are known as doshas. These three doshas encompass movement, transformation and stability in your body. Any imbalance in their creation results in illness. Ayurveda treats a disease by restoring balance against the doshas. Treatment of disease for Ayurveda also covers the soul, mind and then body. - Meditation is for soul; - Mind control is for consciousness - Diet, activity, purification, palliation are for the body. A major area in Ayurveda is detoxification. Toxins destroy the balance of the body and bring forth diseases. Day in and day out, our body processes all kinds of inputs-distinguishing what's good for you from what's not, doing its best to eliminate any harmful substances alongside routine metabolic waste. But in today's scenario, our bodies are inundated with a never-ending barrage of stressors, environmental toxins, processed foods, unresolved emotions and psychological stress, to name a few. Inevitably, in attempting to \"digest\" it all, we accumulate some toxicity-which, over time,can build up in the systems, deposits in the tissues and compromise our health. But there is something you can do to give your body a break. Actually, this is precisely the idea behind an Ayurvedic cleanse; to minimize the variety and complexity of inputs, i.e. potential toxins, so that the body can recuperate and repair itself. And amazingly, when the deluge of damaging inputs slows, the body will immediately take advantage to do some deep cleaning. The practice of cleansing is considered a vital part of an Ayurvedic lifestyle, with great potential for improved energy, strength and immunity, as well as renewed life. At its root , an Ayurvedic cleanse improves the strength of Agni, i.e. metabolic fire in the GI tract and throughout the body by resting and purifying the digestive system. Ayurveda sees balanced Agni as one of the most important requirements for achieving optimal health. Tending to Agni with a cleanse offers a potent antidote to any imbalances that might be active in your system. An Ayurvedic cleanse is focused on drawing toxins and excess Vata, pitta and kapha out of the tissues and into the digestive tract so that they can be eliminated . The cleanse may itself be not entirely pleasant, as these impurities are stirred into circulation to be eliminated, they can become more palpable for a short time. However, if a cleanse is undertaken correctly , the end result should be an improved sense of balance and overall health. Imbalance of the three doshas caused by tension, unstable emotions , poor diet, and toxic environment results in disease.. when one of the doshas experiences imbalance, toxins start to accumulate and this begins the disease process. Since , each of the doshas is said to live in different parts of the body . - Vata - large intestine - Pitta- small intestine - Kapha - stomach In Ayurveda, it is considered that vata imbalance is the primary cause of disease. When vata aggrevates, it disrupts the other two doshas and leads to total imbalance in the system.. mental stress largely contributes in triggering Vata imbalance. In Ayurveda, \"shad kriyakala, i.e. six stages in the disease process\" are there.. - Accumulation : imbalance vata will accumulate toxins in large intestine. - Disturbed: when it gets aggrevated, it fills up the residing area of the dosha. - Flood: aggrevated dosha then floods or spills off from its residing area. - Movement : and then moves to site of another dosha - Manifestation : the primary manifestation of disease starts . The ama that is leaked from the intestines is carried by the bloodstream throughout the body . When this happens , immune system need to increase its power of action double times to fight off toxins . Liver and kidney has to filter out increasing level of toxins. When intestinal walls gets coated with ama, the good bacteria are also overpowered . This destroys body's ability to assimilate nutrients and synthesize vitamins. And body is robbed off the basic nutrients it needs. Ayurveda offers many herbs that have been used for thousand of years to support the body's detoxification system i.e. liver , kidney and colon.
