Classes were challenging, lively, and life-affirming. The best part was being supported by faculty and administration in not only reaching my academic goals, but doing so while not being stressed and staying rested. It's the most unique learning environment I have ever been in. No other place like it No other place like it. My first year at MIU reignited my love of learning, and transformed me from a lackluster high school student to a focused, accomplished college student. My degree at MIU was the springboard for graduate work at UCLA and a successful business career. I am impressed with the high level of... I am impressed with the high level of academic commitment from the faculty and the equally strong commitment by MIU to healthy lifestyle and life/work balance - a unique pairing in today's academic environment. It has been a model of sustainability that has supported me and given me an extra edge through a subsequent graduate degree, professional career and ongoing family life. Focus on self-knowledge MIU's focus on self-knowledge is most important to me. And the faculty is highly knowledgeable and dedicated. I love the block system where we focus on one subject at a time. The diverse student body is amazing and harmonious. The cultural activities in Fairfield are terrific. Perhaps the best, most beneficial years of my life... My years as an MIU student were among the best years of my life. Such a joyous time! I went on to graduate school at an Ivy League university, and I promise you: the knowledge you get at MIU\u2014if you take full advantage of the unique and innovative \"consciousness-based\" educational system\u2014will do more for you than any other education you might receive. Set me up for life This university gave me immense confidence in my abilities. I went on to succeed as an entrepreneur in business: finance and real estate investment. Immediately after graduating, I made a real estate investment that set me up for life, thanks to all that I learned and gained from the well-rounded education I received. Highly recommended! It was my favorite educational... It was my favorite educational experience. Prior to MIU I had done two higher education degrees, and found them to be exhausting and stressful. Because of MIUs emphasis on educating the whole person- mind, body and spirit- I was able to obtain another advanced degree with little stress and a lot of delight. I had attended other colleges before I had attended other colleges before, but found MIU to be the first to provide a useful education. I wouldn't exchange my degree for any other. MIU gave me a profoundly fulfilling, practical education which benefited me my whole life. Everything is alive and interesting Everything is alive and interesting. After serving in the military and attending other universities I was taken aback at how profound learning could be. When you discover that knowledge is structured in your own consciousness it becomes more real. The old adage of \"why do I need to know this...\" disappears. I have never been much of a student I have never been much of a student. I rarely did my homework. All my life I was looking for something more, and I was not finding it. But when I finally got the chance to go to MIU, things changed. One class at a time was so much easier to focus on. I started to do my homework... and it wasn't a strain. I learned more with less effort. I had more fun. If you have to go to school, this is the one I would recommend. Studying at MIU was the best thing I... Studying at MIU was the best thing I ever did. It totally changed my life. At MIU the teachers really care about you and make time for you. There is organic food to eat and it is multicultural with people from all over the world. I loved it. I graduated with my Bachelors and... I graduated with my Bachelors and Masters from MIU. I attended the University of Houston before MIU and there was no comparison. MIU supported my growth and happiness on every level. Academically, the professors were not only extremely knowledgeable in their particular field but they provided a real connection with us as students. Socially, the friends I made there are friends for life. "}
