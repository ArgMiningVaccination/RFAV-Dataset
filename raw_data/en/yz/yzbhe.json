A VERY SHORT PUBLIC STATEMENT ON COVID-19 (COVID) AND OTHER RELATED CORONAVIRUS DISEASES ( MERS , SARS ) ETC : _____________________________________________________ Contrary to General Medical Opinion - COVID (as per COVID-19) has actually been floating around the Globe for far much longer than many Clinical Scientists may actually wish to realise. Since the latter part of 2019 , (when multiple similar cases had been initially reported outside China) , an International Group (of Alternative Medicine Professors) has been closely monitoring the Situation. I have also recently published a Short eBook on the Topic ; which is currently available in the Google Play Books (App) Store. [https://books.google.com/books/about?id=KDMLEAAAQBAJ](https://books.google.com/books/about?id=KDMLEAAAQBAJ) [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PM4DEAAAQBAJ](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PM4DEAAAQBAJ) Further Details will be released in due course. Sincerely , Professor Doctor Joseph Chikelue Obi COVID Response Chairman of the Public Health Group (Council of Alternative Medicine Professors) Role : Monitoring Coronaviruses (COVID-19 , SARS , MERS) , Cough , Colds & Flu.

A Very Important (Valentine's Week) LinkedIn Update (Middle of February 2023): Please Be Advised that I am often between Europe (EU) & New York City (NYC), in my other Professional Capacity as President of ICPS (International College of Physicians and Surgeons) ; via it's Non-Profit (Charitable) Division in (Delaware) USA - primarily for United Nations (UN) Collaboration. My Maximum Linkedin Quota of 30000 (1st Degree) Connections is already Fully Consumed ; but I can also be reached at [https://patreon.com/celebritydoctor](https://patreon.com/celebritydoctor) (where we are currently creating a wide range of Online Courses). I do not have any control (whatsoever) over the Maximum Quota Limits which are (Officially) Set by LinkedIn - and as such cannot 'Over-Ride' Them. Furthermore : I cannot delete any of my Loyal (and Long-Standing) 1st Degree Connections (on LinkedIn) ; in order to Accommodate Any of the New Ones. Profound Apologies (Again and Again) ; (most especially) to All of those who have still not been able to Connect with Me (Yet) via Linkedin. Hopefully (Sometime in the Future) - LINKEDIN MIGHT (POSSIBLY) CHOOSE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. * * * In The Interim : Do Always (Try To) Remain (Totally) Blessed (!) and (Fantabulously) Fabulous (!) * * * Sincerely, "}
