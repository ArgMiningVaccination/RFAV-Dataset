Unique features include a pop-up glossary, a drag and drop concept map, a short written passage, and creation of a multimedia resource to explain and demonstrate the functioning of the adaptive immune system. Students read the passage: Killer Cells, Memory Cells: A Brief Introduction to the Adaptive Immune System. Students watch animations: The Adaptive Immune System and How Do Antibodies Work? Time: Three 45 minute sessions Lesson questions - What are the key features and processes of the adaptive immune system? - How does the adaptive immune system differ from the innate immune system?
