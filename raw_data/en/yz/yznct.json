Immunization with naturally shed outer membrane vesicles from Gram-negative bacteria is being studied for its potential to protect against many infections, since antigens within vesicles maintain their natural conformationand orientation. Shedding can be enhanced through genetic modication, and theresulting particles, generalized modules for membrane antigens (GMMA), not only offer potential as vaccines but also can facilitate the study of B-cell responses to bacterial antigens. Here we show that the response to immunization with GMMA from S. Typhimurium (STmGMMA) provides B-cell-dependent protection and induces antibodies to two immunodominant antigens, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and porins.Antibodies to LPS O antigen (O-Ag) markedly enhance protection in the spleen, butthis effect is less marked in the liver. Strikingly, IgG responses to LPS and porinsdevelop with distinct kinetics. In the rst week after immunization, there is but not to LPS. In contrast, production of IgG1 to either an-tigen was delayed and T cell dependent. Nevertheless, after 1 month, cells in thebone marrow secreting IgG against porins or LPS were present at a similar fre-quency. Unexpectedly, immunization with O-Ag-decient STmGMMA did not sub-stantially enhance the anti-porin response. Therefore, IgG switching to all anti-gens does not develop synchronously within the same complex and so the rateof IgG switching to a single component does not necessarily reflect its frequencywithin the antigenic complex. IMPORTANCE Vaccines save millions of lives, yet for some infections there are none. This includes some types of Salmonella infections, killing hundreds of thou- sands of people annually. We show how a new type of vaccine, called GMMA, that ismade from blebs shed from the Salmonella cell wall, works to protect against infec- tion in mice by inducing host proteins (antibodies) specically recognizing bacterialcomponents (antigens). The rate of development of IgG antibody to antigens withinGMMA occurred with different kinetics. However, the antibody response to GMMApersists and is likely to provide prolonged protection for those who need it. Theseresults help show how antibody responses to bacterial antigens develop and howvaccines like GMMA can work and help prevent infection.Received 9 January 2018 Accepted 26 January 2018 Published 6 March 2018 Citation Schager an outer discordant rates. mBio 9:e02379-17. https://doi .org/10.1128/mBio.02379-17.

Novel, cost-effective vaccination strategies are needed for use in resource-limited regions of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa. A promising approach to generate vaccinesagainst Gram-negative bacteria is to use native outer membrane vesicles (NOMVs),which are blebs of outer membrane naturally shed by bacteria. Key advantages ofNOMVs include their potential safety for use in humans ( 1), enrichment for surface antigens that are often recognized by B cells, and maintenance of these antigens in their natural conformation and orientation ( 2). Furthermore, these nano-sized, nonvi- able antigens can be used in immunocompromised individuals and overcome the potential risks of infection associated with the use of live, attenuated vaccines in suchpopulations. To enhance the production of OMVs from Gram-negative bacteria without using detergents, mutations can be introduced that result in hyperblebbing. This avoids thepotentialfordetergentstoaltertheconformationofsomeantigenswithintheparticlesand to extract some lipoproteins from them. Thus, high yields can be obtained frombacteria in which the Tol-Pal pathway is disrupted by deletion of tolR(3). The resulting particles aresimilar to NOMVs and known as generalized modules of membrane antigens (GMMA). GMMA and NOMVs have been assessed as vaccine platforms to induce protective immunity against several Gram-negative bacterial pathogens suchasEscherichia coli, Shigella, Salmonella, and Neisseria (1,3-19). Invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections are a serious health concern and are estimated to kill over 650,000 people annually worldwide ( 20). Two Salmonella entericaserovars, Typhimu- rium and Enteritidis, are predominantly associated with iNTS disease in children under5 years old in sub-Saharan Africa, and iNTS infections are a serious problem inindividuals of any age with HIV infection. Despite this, there is no vaccine against iNTSinfections that is licensed for use in humans ( 21-23). NOMVs have previously been shown to have potential against experimental iNTS infections ( 8), and one likely mechanism for their mode of action is the induction of a protective antibody (Ab) that can play a role in the control of such infections ( 24). Antibodies to several S. Typhimu- riumantigenshavebeenshowntobeprotective,includingtheOantigen(O-Ag)ofthelipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecule 25-30) and porins While antibodiestoLPSandporinsaredetectableafternaturalinfection,littleisknown about the relative kinetics of their induction, particularly in the context of OMVs andGMMA. Furthermore, the relative persistence of responses to these antigens hasreceived limited attention. This is important to know, as both the induction and themaintenance of responses to antigen are key requisites of any vaccine that provideslong-lasting immunity. In this study, mice were immunized with GMMA from S. Typhimurium (STmGMMA) and the relative kinetics of the induction of antibodies of different IgG isotypes toporins and LPS were addressed. The results show that IgG responses to LPS developmore slowly than IgG responses to porins, with a paucity of IgG1 to both antigensdetected, compared to other IgG isotypes, until the second week after immunization.Unexpectedly, the induction of IgG of all isotypes except IgG1 was independent of Tcells, possibly reflecting the B1b-cell response to STmGMMA observed. Collectively,these data show that B-cell responses to all antigens do not develop in parallel withinthe same GMMA antigenic complex and that the extent of the early IgG response doesnot necessarily reflect the relative abundance of an antigen within a complex. RESULTS Immunization with STmGMMA induces protection that is dependent upon B cellsSTmGMMA were puried from the supernatants of cultures of S. Typhimurium SL1418 tolR.

Mice immunized with STmGMMA for 14 days showed a /H11022100-fold reduction in bacterial burdens in the spleen and liver when challenged i.p. with attenuated S. Typhimurium SL3261. In contrast, B-cell-decient mice immunized in the same way did not have any signicant bacterial burden reduction at these sites(Fig. 1C). Experiments where nonimmunized mice were infected for 24 h with bacteria that had been opsonized with serum from nonimmunized or STmGMMA-immunized miceshowedthatthepresenceofanti-STmGMMAAbwassufcienttoreducebacterialcolonization of the spleen and liver ( Fig. 1D). Therefore, immunization with STmGMMA induces rapid IgM and IgG responses and confers protection that is dependent upon B cells. IgG switching and GC are induced rapidly after immunization with STmGMMA. Since B cells were important for the protection afforded by STmGMMA immunization, FIG 1STmGMMA induce antibodies that can protect against infection. (A) Electron microscopy of STmGMMA.

Mice immunized i.p. with 1 /H9262g of STmGMMA showed splenic germinal centers (GC) and GCBcellsat4daysafterimmunization( Fig.2AandB).NumbersofGCBcellsincreased further after a second immunization with 1 /H9262g of STmGMMA (Fig. 2B). Indeed, immu- nization induced a rapid increase in activated CD4/H11001T cells in the spleen by day 7, including a 3-fold increase in T follicular helper-like (Tfh) cells ( Fig. 2C). Accompanying thesefeatures was an increase in the numbers of plasma cells, including cells that had switched to IgG2b and IgG2c ( Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results show that STmGMMA induce a rapid and extensive T- and B-cell response. Ab responses to LPS and porins within STmGMMA develop with distinct kinetics. The rapid IgG response to STmGMMA observed led us to question whether this was induced similarly to multiple antigens within the particles or if responseswithin the same antigenic complex developed with distinct kinetics. To evaluate this,the responses to two immunodominant antigens, LPS and porins, were of the B-cell response by enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISPOT)assay was used to assess antigen-specic IgM- and IgG-producing cells in the spleen atdifferent time points following immunization with 1 /H9262g of STmGMMA. IgM/H11001Ab- secretingcells(ASC)secretingAbsspecictobothantigensweredetectedinthespleenat days 4 and 7 after immunization, albeit at higher frequencies for porins than forLPS. In contrast, IgG /H11001ASC specic to LPS were largely absent at both days 4 and 7 postimmunization, whereas IgG/H11001ASC specic to porins were readily detectable, and at anincreasingfrequency,atthesetwotimes(Fig.3A).Thisnonparallelresponsewasalso reflected inthetitersofAbstobothantigensinserum(Fig.3B).IgGbindingtoLPSwas not inhibited because of the presence of anti-LPS IgM antibodies, since depletion of IgM from serum samples with a specic monoclonal Ab (MAb) did not result in thedetection of higher anti-LPS IgG serum samplesfrom mice immunized with STmGMMA for 7 days or boosted for 4 days and digestedwith pepsin to generate F(ab=) 2, Fab, and Fv fragments of IgM. These experiments showedthatthesefragmentscouldstillbindtoLPSandporins,butthesignaldetectedwas weaker than that detected for IgM in undigested serum samples (Fig. S2). Thus,serum IgG to porins is detectable for days before IgG against LPS is detected. Analysisshowed that at day 7, all subtypes except IgG1 against porins are present. Despite thisearly variability, by day 35, Abs of all subtypes to both LPS and porins were readilyfound (Fig. 3B). Therefore, although the host can clearly respond to multiple compo- nent antigens within a single antigenic complex, responses to the individual antigens present within GMMA can develop with distinct kinetics. STmGMMA induce T-cell-independent switching to all IgG isotypes except IgG1.Although a humoral response associated with T-cell activation is seen after STmGMMA immunization, the surprisingly rapid and complex Ab response suggestedthat the response may include a T-cell-independent component. We therefore immu-nizedT-cell-decientmicewithSTmGMMAanddeterminedthetitersofIgMandIgGtoSTmGMMA in serum 7 days later. Both IgM and IgG were induced by 7 days afterimmunization in the absence of T cells ( Fig. 4A). The T-cell-independent response to puried T-cell-decient mice were immunized with STmGMMA and the proportion of peritoneal B1 cells that are B1b cellswas determined at 4 and 7 days after immunization. The proportion of B1b cellsincreased after STmGMMA immunization in both WT that STmGMMA induce B1b Fig. 4B). Assessment of responses by ELISPOT assay and ELISA 7 days after immunization showed that IgM to LPS and porins was induced in T-cell-decient mice ( Fig. 4CandD). Surprisingly, assessment of the specic responses to LPS and porins by ELISPOT assay and serology showed that in T-cell-decient mice, there a selective induction of antigen-specic IgG to porins,butnotLPS,andthatallIgGisotypeswereinducedatdays7and14,withtheexceptionof IgG1 (representative results for day 7 are shown in Fig. 4CtoE).

Therefore, immunization of mice lacking T cells shows that STmGMMA induce a strong T-cell-independent response and reveals a key role for T cells in the promotion of switchingto IgG1. STmGMMA induce long-term responses to both LPS and porins. A highly desirable feature of a vaccine is to induce responses that will persist. Therefore, weexamined the response to porins and LPS in the spleen and bone marrow (BM) at latertimes after immunization. Furthermore, since O-Ag has been hypothesized to limit Abbinding to the Gram-negative bacterial surface, we assessed if removing O-Ag fromGMMA could augment the Ab response to porins after immunization. Mice wereimmunized at time zero and boosted 14 days later with 1 /H9262g of STmGMMA that were O-Ag replete (O-Ag/H11001) or decient (O-Ag/H11002), and the response was examined 14 or 203 days later. Robust antigen-specic B-cell responses to LPS and porins were ob-served after immunization with O-Ag /H11001STmGMMA in both the spleen and the BM at days 14 and 203 (Fig. 5A). After immunization with O-Ag/H11002STmGMMA, there was not a dramatic change in the anti-porin B-cell response, and thus, the loss of O-Ag from FIG 3NonparallelAbresponsestoLPSandporinsdevelopafterimmunizationwithSTmGMMA.WTmicewereimmunized i.p. with 1 /H9262g of GMMA for the times indicated.

Typhimurium in this group (Fig. 5B). Therefore, STmGMMA induce persisting Ab responses in the BM and spleen after immunization. The presence of O-Ag in STmGMMA enhances protection in the spleen. It is clear from previous studies that Ab to O-Ag, generated after natural infection or after immunizationwithanO-Agconjugatevaccine,canprotectagainstinfection( 26,30,36, FIG 5The persistence of Ab responses against LPS and porins following immunization.

Nevertheless, STmGMMA are known to contain other antigens, such as OmpD ( 33), that are targets of protective antibodies. Therefore, we tested the level of protection observed after immunization with O-Ag/H11001or O-Ag/H11002STmGMMA. Mice were immunized twice, 14 days apart, with the different STmGMMA and then challenged with S. Typhi- murium, and the bacterial burdens were assessed 3 days later ( Fig. 6). Mice immunized with both types of STmGMMA had bacterial burdens in the liver and spleen that were signicantly lower than those of nonimmunized mice ( Fig. 6). Nevertheless, mice immunized with O-Ag/H11001STmGMMA had markedly lower bacterial numbers in the spleen than mice immunized with O-Ag/H11002STmGMMA (typically, a /H1102270-fold difference in mean bacterial numbers). Mice immunized with O-Ag/H11001STmGMMA also had lower bacterial burdens in the liver than mice that received O-Ag/H11002STmGMMA, but this difference was more marginal (typically, an ~10-fold difference in mean bacterial numbers). Thus, immunization with STmGMMA decient in O-Ag can reduce infectionin the spleen and liver, but the presence of O-Ag can enhance this protection and thiseffect is more pronounced in the spleen than in the liver. DISCUSSION Previous work has shown that immunization with OMVs can protect against infec- tion (1,8,10-17). Vaccines based on OMVs may offer an advantage over other strategies, such as O-Ag conjugates, through increased coverage of antigens in their natural conformation, their simplicity and cost of production, and their intrinsic adju-vant activity. In this study, we have shown that there is a strong dependence on B cellsfor the protection afforded by immunization with STmGMMA. Furthermore, while Abinduced by STmGMMA that lacks O-Ag is protective, the presence of O-Ag in theparticles can bolster this protection, particularly in the spleen. Our evidence alsosuggests that the Ab response to STmGMMA is long-lived, as /H11022200 days after immu- nization, a and persisting number of ASC specic for LPS andporins in the BM. B cells can provide Ab-dependent and -independent protectionagainst infection. Nevertheless, in this instance, Ab is likely to make a major contribu-tion,since opsonization of bacteria with serum samples from immunized mice is sufcient to reduce colonization and the absence of O-Ag reduces the protection afforded by immunization ( 37). Loss oftheimmunodominantO-Ag(28, 30)fromSTmGMMAreducedtheprotection afforded by immunization, although bacterial burdens in the spleen and liver were still /H1102220-fold lighter than those of nonimmunized controls. However, compared to O-Ag/H11002 STmGMMA, the presence of O-Ag in STmGMMA was associated with a greater en-hancement of protection in the spleen than in the liver. This suggests that thecontribution of protective Ab to O-Ag varies for STmGMMA at different sites. Since AbstoS. Typhimurium largely protect through cell-dependent mechanisms in mice ( 38), it is likely that these differences reflect the types of immune cells present in various organs at different stages of infection ( 39). Other reasons for these differences include FIG 6Immunization with O-Ag/H11002STmGMMA offers protection against infection in the spleen and liver. CD1 mice were immunized with STmGMMA O-Ag/H11001or O-Ag/H11002at time zero and day 14 and subsequently challenged i.p. with 2 /H11003104CFU of S. Typhimurium SL1344 at day 28.

Nevertheless, what is not clear is whethersuchdifferencesareclinicallymeaningful,asitisnotknownwhatreductioninbacterialnumbers is necessary to protect against disease. In reality, the level of protectionneededtopreventdiseaseislikelytodependuponthemagnitudeofthedoserequiredto cause an infection within an individual, which will vary depending upon factors such asnutritional status, immune status, and geographic location. Since quantitative culturestudies show that the bacteremia detected in patients with iNTS disease and HIV coinfec-tion is low, in the order of a few bacteria per milliliter ( 40), it may mean that only modest levels of protection by a vaccine are needed. Indeed, the period between loss of maternal Ab and the rst acquisition of IgG to NTS in infants is associated with an increased risk ofinvasive disease ( 24). Therefore, nonsterilizing immunity could be sufcient to provide widespread protectioninvulnerablegroups.ThedatainthepresentstudyindicatethatAb to surface antigens other than O-Ag can reduce bacterial numbers, and it is now necessaryto better understand the nature of these protective antigens and if they can be manipu-lated to provide enhanced protection within a vaccine. A single Gram-negative bacterium can contain millions of LPS molecules ( 41), and each O-Ag can contain over a hundred repeats ( 42), although in GMMA, estimates suggest that numbers of O-Ag repeats are lower than in WT bacteria ( 43). In contrast, estimates of the numbers of porin molecules expressed per cell suggest there is approximately 1 porin molecule for every 10 LPS molecules ( 44). Thus, epitopes for the O-Ag are likely to be present in a signicant excess over those for porins. The combination of a higher epitope frequency and the spatial localization of O-Ag, beingmore distal from the cell surface than porins, makes the more rapid detection ofswitching to IgG against porins surprising. The level of response to an antigen can beimportant. In some individuals with HIV, atypically high titers of Ab to LPS O-Ag fromSalmonella have been shown to inhibit bacterial killing in a serum bactericidal assay (31). Furthermore, a similar phenomenon has been observed in some patients with bronchiectasis and concurrent Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, and in this case, the presence of inhibitory Ab correlates with worse disease ( 45). Therefore, examination of the Ab responses to STmGMMA with and without O-Ag offered an opportunity to examinewhetherO-AglimitedthedevelopmentofAbresponsestootherantigens.WeexpectedtheretobeanincreaseintheresponsetoporinsintheabsenceofO-Agsincethe access of B-cell receptors to these molecules on the bacterial surface couldreasonably be expected to be enhanced. With the exception of a small augmentationofanti-porinAbtitersatday14,wedidnotndthistobethecase.Thismaybebecauseresponses to porins had already reached a peak level or because the tolRmutation can result in O-Ag being shorter in GMMA, anti-porin 43),orbecauselossof wbaPinfluenced mean that O-Ag is not effective at occluding access to the surface of the GMMA. Nevertheless, it suggests that the absence of O-Ag from STmGMMA does not increasethe frequency of the porin-specic Ab response. IgM to LPS and porins was induced rapidly. When digested serum samples contain- ing F(ab=) 2, Fab, and Fv fragments of IgM were used in ELISAs, a reduced IgM signal, compared to that in undigested serum samples, was detected in anti-LPS ELISAs. Thisdifference was greater in serum samples from mice immunized for 7 days than insamples from mice boosted with STmGMMA. Therefore, while IgM does not necessarilyneed to be in pentameric form to bind to these antigens, it is probable that the higheravidity of undigested IgM aids binding to LPS, particularly at earlier time points afterimmunization. Nevertheless, other factors may contribute to the degree of differenceobservedbetweendigestedandundigestedserumsamples.Forinstance,theremaybefewer epitopes available on digested than nondigested IgM for the secondary Ab usedin the ELISA to bind to, and this may alter the intensity of the signal detected. Furtherexperiments are needed to understand fully the role of IgM avidity in Ab binding tothese antigens. In contrast to IgM, the IgG response to porins and LPS developed withSchager et al.\u00ae March/April 2018 Volume 9 Issue 2 e02379-17 mbio.asm.org 10 on February 25, 2019 by guest http://mbio.asm.org/ Downloaded from distinct kinetics after immunization with STmGMMA, despite both antigens being located in the same antigenic complex. IgG to porins was detectable at 4 days afterinfection, whereas IgG to LPS was not detectable until after a week. While some of thismay reflect differences in germline afnities of antibodies ( 47), it was still surprising considering the rapid detection of IgM to both antigens and that LPS O-Ag is stoichi- ometrically the predominant antigen, with each individual O-Ag typically containingmultiple repeats of the same epitope. Both LPS and porins have been reported toinduce when like OmpD, probably induce T-cell-independent responses through a combi- nation of their capacity to oligomerize into units of trimers and their ability to interactwith Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4, and the latter property is lost if the proteinsare digested with proteinase K ( 49). STmGMMA induced B1b-cell responses in WT and T-cell-decient mice, and our previous work found that live S. Typhimurium and porins couldinduceresponsesinthisB-cellsubset( 33).Antigensderivedfrompathogensthat induce B1b responses are typically targets of protective immunity, and multiple anti- gens that induce B1b-cell responses, such as pneumococcal polysaccharide and the Vicapsular polysaccharide from S. Typhi, are used as vaccines in humans ( 35,50). This reinforces the concept that identication of B1b antigens may be a helpful strategy to identify candidate antigens for vaccines. The strong T-cell-independent response to porins within STmGMMA was associated with the early induction of IgG2b, IgG2c, and IgG3. Indeed, the only feature of theresponsedependentuponTcellswastheinductionofspecicIgG1,anisotypewehavereproducibly found to be poorly detected after infection with live S. Typhimurium ( 32). Moreover, in the response to live organisms, we and others have observed that T cells and molecules associated with classical T-dependent responses such as CD28, CD40-ligand, and ICOS or response. An additionaldifferencebetweentheresponsestoSTmGMMAandlive S.Typhimurium is the extensive early GC response, which is absent after live S. Typhimurium adminis- tration and something that live S. Typhimurium can actively suppress ( 47,53,54). Therefore, the cell surface antigens present in STmGMMA cannot be sufcient on their own to be responsible for these differences and the suppression of early GC formationobserved after live infection. It is possible that the T-cell-independent switching toIgG2a seen after immunization with STmGMMA reflects more what is seen afterinfection with viruses and virus-like particles ( 55). The speed of induction of the GC seen after STmGMMA was striking and resembles that observed after immunization of mice with the T-cell-independent antigen NP-Ficoll, where there is a high frequency of antigen-specic B cells ( 56). A recent study showed that T-cell-independent switching to IgG against a peptide antigen within liposomes was strictly dependent on concomitant signaling via TLR4 and TRIF ( 57). Therefore, the multiple TLR4 ligands found in STmGMMA could modulate the response to other antigens within the complex. This means that ultimately the Ab response tothe same antigen can vary dramatically, depending upon the context in which theantigen is encountered, for instance, whether the antigen is part of a viable organism,in a complex with other antigens, or entirely in isolation. Indeed, we have previouslyshown that the pattern of IgG switching to flagellin from S. Typhimurium varies dramatically, depending upon whether mice encounter flagellin as a puried moleculeor in its native context, attached to the surface of a live organism ( 51). An appreciation of how to control the direction of IgG switching to an antigen will help us understand how to maximize the potential of OMVs and GMMA as platforms for vaccine delivery. MATERIALS AND METHODS STmGMMA production, purication, characterization, and electron microscopy. Hyperblebbing GMMA-producing strains (provided by the GSK Vaccines Institute for Global Health) and the production and purication of GMMA were performed as described previously ( 3,6,58). In brief, the tolRgene in S. Typhimurium isolate 1418 (59) was replaced with the kanamycin resistance gene aph(3,6,43). For the generation of a GMMA-producing strain lacking the O-Ag, wbaPwas replaced with the chloramphenicol resistance cassette (cat). Forward and reverse primers with approximately 50 bp homologous toResponses to Outer Membrane Particles from Salmonella\u00ae March/April 2018 Volume 9 Issue 2 e02379-17 mbio.asm.org 11 on February 25, 2019 by guest http://mbio.asm.org/ Downloaded from upstream and downstream regions of the gene to be deleted and approximately 20 bp corresponding to flanking regions of the respective resistance cassette were used to amplify replacement constructs.

Typhimurium 1418 with the lambda phage recombinant system (red operon) located on pAJD434 as described in reference 3.A specic anti-O:4 LPS O-Ag MAb (provided by the GSK Vaccines Institute for Global Health) was used to conrm the loss of O-Ag from STmGMMA generated from this strain ( 25). To purify GMMA, 300 ml of fresh LB medium was inoculated with bacteria from an overnight culture to generate a culture with an opticaldensityat600nm(OD600)of0.05.OncetheculturereachedanOD600of0.7to1,itwasincubated for a further 3 h and then centrifuged for 10 min at 3,220 /H11003g. The GMMA were /H9262m lter, and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. The total protein concentration of GMMA samples was assessed by Lowry assay (Bio-Rad). For TEM, STmGMMA were xed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde-0.1 Mphosphate buffer and embedded in Epon-araldite resin, and 70- to 80-nm sections were cut and stainedwith uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate before being visualized with a JEOL 1200EX at the Centrefor Electron Microscopy at the University of Birmingham. Mice, immunizations, and bacterial challenge strains. All of our animal studies had ethical approval from the University of Birmingham and UK Home Ofce approval and were performed underproject license 30/2850 in compliance with the Animals (Scientic Procedures) Act 1986. Inbred WTC57BL/6 males 6 to 8 weeks old or outbred WT CD1 females 6 to 8 weeks old were obtained from OLACHarlan. In experiments, C57BL/6 mice were used as WT mice unless otherwise stated. TCR /H9252/H9254/H11002//H11002and IgH/H11002//H11002(33,60) mice on a C57BL/6 background were bred at the Biomedical Service Unit, University of Birmingham. Mice were immunized via i.p. injection with STmGMMA O-Ag/H11001or O-Ag/H11002(the doseofproteinwasgiveninalloftheexperimentsinthisstudy)dilutedin200 of O-Ag to protein in STmGMMA O-Ag/H11001preparations was in the range of 0.7 to 0.9 part O-Ag to 1 part total protein (wt/wt). For Typhimurium in PBS. Opsonization experiments were performed as described in reference 32, with multiple nonpooled serum samples from nonimmunized mice or mice that had been immunized with STmGMMA for 35 days. Prior to use, serum samples were heated for 30 min at 56\u00b0C to inactivate complement. Infection doses of S. Typhimurium SL3261 and serum samples (1:100) were then mixed for 30 min at room temperature before infection. Bacterial viability and lack ofagglutination in the presence of opsonizing Ab were conrmed by plating bacteria onto agar andensuring that they grew as discrete colonies at the appropriate frequency. Bacterial numbers weredetermined by direct culturing of homogenized spleen and liver samples. ELISA and ELISPOT S. Typhimurium LPS (Axxora ALX-581-011-L002), or core sugars attached) puried from S. Typhimurium 1418 (provided by the GSK Vaccines Institute for Global Health and described inreference 62).Allantigenswereusedat5 /H9262g/ml,andELISAswereperformedaspreviouslydescribed(32). Mouse serum was added to wells and then serially diluted, and the presence of bound Ab was detected with isotype-specic alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse Abs (Southern Biotech) anddeveloped with Sigma FAST p-nitrophenylphosphate tablets. Titers were calculated by identifying the dilution at which the signal reached a set OD 405. To obtain splenic cells for ELISPOT assay and cytometry, spleens wereobtained by flushing one leg (femur and tibia) per mouse with RPMI 1640 medium. Erythrocyteswerelysedwithammonium-chloride-potassiumlysisbuffer(Gibco).Single-cellsuspensionswerewashedin complete RPMI 1640 medium desired concentrations. For ELISPOT assay,multiscreen lter plates (Merck Millipore) were coated with antigen diluted in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C,washed with PBS, and then blocked with complete RPMI 1640 medium for1ha t37\u00b0C. The wells werethen washed once with PBS, and 5 /H1100310 5cells from spleen or BM were seeded per well in 200 /H9262lo f complete RPMI 1640 medium, each sample in triplicate. Plates were then incubated for6ha t37\u00b0C in 5%CO 2. After incubation, cells were lysed and washed away with PBS-0.05% Tween. Bound mouse Ab was detected with goat anti-mouse Ab linked to AP (Southern Biotech) diluted in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C. Thefollowing day, wells were washed three times with PBS-0.05% Tween and once with PBS. Spots weredeveloped with Sigma FAST 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (BCIP)-Nitro Blue Tetrazolium tablets(Sigma) diluted in sterile water in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Depletion of IgM from serum samples and digestion of serum samples to generate IgM F(ab=) 2, Fab, and Fv. Monoclonal rat anti-mouse Southern Biotech) was conjugated to Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Two hundred microlitersof bead slurry was mixed with 200 /H9262l of serum for 15 min. Beads were centrifuged at low speed. The supernatant, containing depleted serum, was compared with undepleted serum by ELISA to assess IgGand IgM contents and antibodies specic for LPS and porins. Relative levels of IgM and IgG in the serumsamples were assessed by ELISA by the basic technique described above but with the following differences.The capture Ab in the ELISAs was the rat anti-mouse IgM used as described above or unlabeled sheepSchager et al.\u00ae March/April 2018 Volume 9 Issue 2 e02379-17 mbio.asm.org 12 on February 25, 2019 by guest http://mbio.asm.org/ Downloaded from anti-mouse IgG (both used to coat plates at 1 /H9262g/ml), and secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse kappa light chain (Millipore) for IgM and goat anti-mouse heavy and light chains (Southern Biotech)forIgG.Colorwasdevelopedwith3,3= 5,5=-tetramethylbenzidinedihydrochloridetablets(Sigma)and H2SO4in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The OD450was measured. IgM F(ab=)2, Fab, and Fv fragments from serum samples were generated by adapting a previously described method ( 63). Serum samples were diluted with an equal amount of 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and adjusted to a pH of 4.0 with HCl. Immobilized pepsin (Thermo Scientic) was then added to these serum samples at a ratio of resuspended enzyme beads to serum of 1:50, and the mixture wasincubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking for 24 h. The reaction was stopped by removal of the pepsin beads aftercentrifugation at 1,000 /H11003gfor 5 min. Digestion of IgM into F(ab=) 2, Fab, and Fv fragments was veried by SDS-PAGE. Serum samples were then diluted in PBS, and the pH was conrmed to be in the range of7 to 7.5 before they were used in ELISAs. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. Cells from spleen or peritoneal flushes were stained with one or more of the following antibody (712-606-153) from Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc. Cells were thenassessed on a ADP and analyzed with FlowJo 9.3.2. (TreeStar). For intracellularstaining, cells were rst stained for surface markers and then xed and permeabilized with Cytox/Cytoperm Plus (BD Biosciences). Immunohistology. Spleens were processed and stained as described previously ( 32). In short, spleens were frozen in liquid nitrogen and 5.5- /H9262m-thick sections were cut and allowed to dry before xationinacetonefor20minat4\u00b0C.Inallcases,antibodieswereaddedfor45minofincubationatroomtemperature. Sheep anti-mouse IgD (Abcam) was detected with peroxidase-labeled donkey (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc.) and developed with 3,3=-diaminobenzidine tablets (Sigma).CD3 and peanut agglutinin (PNA) Laboratories) Biotinylated Abbinding signal was developed by using a streptavidin-biotinylated AP complex (Vectastain; VectorLaboratories) with Naphthol AS-MX phosphate, levamisole, and Fast Blue Salt. Statistical analyses. Statistical tests were performed with Prism software. The tests performed are indicated in the legends but included the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple-comparison test, thetwo-tailed Mann-Whitney U test (with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons if required), andone-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey's multiple-comparison test. P/H113490.05 was considered signicant. SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL Supplemental material for this article may be found at https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio .02379-17. FIG S1,TIF le, 0.1 MB.
