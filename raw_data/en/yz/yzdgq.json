The hypothesis was that verum acupuncture would demonstrate a significant positive impact on perceived stress as compared to sham acupuncture. This study included 111 participants with high self-reported stress levels who either studied or worked at a large urban public university in the Southwestern United States. 62 participants completed the study. Subjects were randomized into a verum acupuncture or sham acupuncture group. Both groups received treatment once a week for 12 weeks. The Cohen's Global Measure of Perceived Stress scale (PSS-14) was completed by each subject prior to treatment, at 6 weeks, at 12 weeks, and 6 weeks and 12 weeks post-treatment completion. While both verum and sham acupuncture patients showed a substantial initial decrease in perceived stress scores, at 12 weeks post treatment verum acupuncture showed a significantly greater treatment effect than sham acupuncture. This study indicates that acupuncture may be successful in decreasing the perception of stress in students and staff at a large urban university and this effect persists for at least 3 months after the completion of treatment. Biography Stefanie Schroeder has completed her medical education at SUNY StonyBrook in 1990 and studied Acupuncture under Doctor Tsun-Nin Lee at the academy for pain research in San Francisco, in 2001. She is a board certified Emergency Medicine Physician and after 10 years of emergency medicine practice came to Arizona Sate University as the Medical Director of the Student Health Service and built one of the first integrative wellness departments in college health. stefanie.schroeder@asu.eduStefanie Schroeder, Altern Integr Med 2018, Volume 7 DOI: 10.4172/2327-5162-C2-044Page 40 Notes:April 18-19, 2018 | Las Vegas, USA 6th International Conference and Expo on Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine Alternative & Integrative Medicine| ISSN: 2327-5162 | Acupuncture Chinese Medicine, USA Introduction: Aconite and related alkaloids toxicity were recently reported. Aconitum species are highly toxic cardiotoxins and neurotoxins. However, aconite root has been used as an effective traditional herb for various pain ailments and severe diseases in China for thousands of years. Aconitine alkaloids are very potent as medicine and its toxicity is controllable in traditional Chinese medicine. In the last thirty years, new science and technology developed numerous methods to screen and monitor the toxicity level. Due to the rising wave of health awareness, there is more people consuming herbal medicine all over the world, and management of aconite toxicity is extremely important in the medical practice. Goal: Review the toxicity cases in the publications, based on the research of the mechanism and metabolism studies. Set up a methodology protocol for management to assess and prevent the toxicity of aconite in the future. Methods: Classic Chinese medicine texts were reviewed and a Medline search (1963- 2017) was conducted. Key word searches included information on the use of aconite roots in traditional medicine, active (toxic) ingredients, mechanisms of toxicity, and clinical features including indications, contraindications, process methods, herb-herb and herb-drug interactions, and management of aconite poisoning were reviewed. Results: A summary of information included mechanisms of toxicity, clinical features, and management of aconite. Supplement monitoring for indications and contraindications, quality control, processing methodology, drug-drug interactions, benefit and risk assessments, screening for baseline, follow up and intervention of toxicity effects via hospital care were discussed. Conclusion: Numerous applications of aconite while modulating its toxicity can reveal many benefits from herbal supplementation to medicine by incorporating traditional knowledge and contemporary scientific techniques.

Furthermore, it may provide information about the status of the teeth/periodontal conditions and the status of the subluxation of spine vertebrae thus supporting and helping the efficiency of the therapist's work. Material & Methods: We measure the TCM meridian endpoint diagnostics and/or Ryodoraku (mainly boiling points) and the microampere values of the ear zones. From the resulting values we can draw conclusions about the status of the Meridians, the anomalies of teeth/periodontal system and the consequences of subluxation of spine vertebrae. Results: The objective measurement and recording of data provide an opportunity for the comparison of meridian-status during pre and post-therapy, to display acute and chronic energy blockages in images to assist understanding, even recording that the same energy blocks are repeated in one month or several years. Conclusion: In addition to the endpoint and boiling point diagnostics of meridians, important information may be received about the status of the teeth/periodontal system and the subluxation of spine vertebrae. The various energy therapies (acupuncture, ear acupuncture, Homeopathy, Bach flower therapy, Schuessler salts...) are able to influence the biological functions in an integrative way and thus harmonize the various malfunctions of the meridians. The healing specialist may not see well only with his heart, but the status of the 12 main meridians can also be displayed in an objective manner, in images. Psychology has long proven that \"one picture equals to a thousand words. The condition of an effective treatment in addition to the proper medical history is an accurate diagnosis of the objective condition through which one may avoid taking chances. The application of different energy therapies and influencing beneficially the bio thermodynamic condition may take place in an integrative way only after the above.

Using Tuning Forks on the meridians and acupuncture points, in place of acupuncture needles, for a gentler more relaxing, yet equally effective healing treatment.The application of sound vibration to the physical & subtle body opens the energetic pathways where the qi or natural life force flows. As a result, energy blocks are removed, increasing the flow of Qi, facilitating homeostasis through which profound healing begins.Tuning Forks can be used as its own therapy, or can also be used as part of a full acupuncture treatment. Sound Healing therapy has dates back for centuries and is one of the oldest healing modalities. Combining therapeutic knowledge of specific acupuncture points with knowledge of specific frequencies, the body can literally be tuned back into harmonic resonance.

The usual medical approaches are limited to OCP and surgery for endometriosis, which minimally address uterine area symptoms only. For PCOS the medical approaches are OCP , surgery, and metformin. These approaches primarily address symptoms, they are not curative. Effective treatment requires a holistic, systemic approach which resolves the root cause and treats the systemic and gynecologic symptoms of these diseases. The genesis of endometriosis is inflammatory cytokines and disruption of the immune system; the systemic effect is endometrial tissue spread throughout the body and impairment of fertility. The genesis of endometriosis is hyperinsulinemea, leading to systemic endocrine disruption in testosterone, estrogen and progesterone, with cardiovascular, gynecological, fertility and metabolic implications. TCM and 5 element acupuncture offer an integrated case management approach that address the systemic symptoms and effects. Case studies of patients treated with TCM and 5 element acupuncture diagnostic methods, acupuncture, Chinese herbs, nutrition and lifestyle modifications, combined with allopathic medicine bloodwork and Western understanding of the specific immunologic and endocrine impact of these diseases will be presented. In addition, methods of approaching Western MDs to discuss Chinese medicine as an effective treatment method, and getting referrals from MDs will be discussed.

Experiment2: 52 participants randomized into the groups: Heart (H) 3 point, H4 point, control, and bladder 60 point. In both experiments (I and II), the evaluation was the root mean square (RMS) activity and muscle strength. Experiment3: 40 volunteers randomized into the groups: auriculotherapy needle stimulation in the coxofemoral, knee, and ankle points or control group. We analyzed the contact area (CA) and the peak pressure (PP) in both feet at baseline, 20 and 25 minutes after the baseline. The RMS increased on the right side in the Upper Trapezius muscle for the SI8 and SI14 groups (F3,37=4.67) at the 20-minute evaluation. The most vigorous response occurred on the contralateral side because the effects were maintained for 5 minutes after withdrawal (F3,37=4.52). Both groups showed an increase in the muscle strength at the 20-minute evaluation (F3,37=3.41). The RMS was reduced on the contralateral side to the H4 group 20 minutes after of the needles withdraw (F3,48=3.25). Ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation in the H4 group reduced the muscle strength 5 minutes and 10 minutes after withdrawal (F3,48=5.82). Auriculotherapy points showed an increase in CA (F:6.49) and a decrease in PP (F:3.11) at 20 and 25 minutes, when compared to C. The PP decreased is only for the right LL at 20 and 25 minutes (F:6.45). Our data indicate that SI yang meridian increases the muscle response, while the H Yin meridian decreases the muscle response. The auriculotherapy points were able to modify the ipsilateral lower limb weight discharge on the same side of the stimulated auricular pavilion.

However, aspects of its mechanism remain elusive. In these studies, we demonstrate that a portion of the neurological pathway mediating HT7's effects begin with activation of peripheral mechanoreceptors in the ulnar nerve. These receptors send signals through the dorsal column medial lemniscal (DCML) pathway and synapse in the nucleus cuneatus, then, progressively, to the thalamus and lateral habenula before arriving at the ventral tegmental area (VTA). There, activation of delta opioid receptors produces a transient decrease in GABA neuron firing rate resulting in a net disinhibition of VTA dopaminergic projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), producing an ephemeral increase in DA neurotransmission. We further show that these effects are specific to frequency, but not region of stimulus.

Materials & Methods: The change of status we are displaying with modern Meridian- diagnostics, which is an objective method, without any subjectivity and according to scientific criteria it is suitable for showing the effect of Qigong exercises for the naked eye. We show it in a very impressive way \"that one picture is more valuable than 1000 words\" . Results: In both groups we measured a very significant 94% and 86% change respectively in the 12 pairs of main meridians. Conclusion: We may dissolve the energy blocks in the meridians not only with ear acupuncture, body acupuncture, homeopathy, Schuessler salts but also with energy exercises, namely, by exercising Zhong Yuan Qigong.

This obstruction is usually reversible and leads to symptoms of dyspnea and wheezing. The asthma prevalence is increasing in last decades. Despite the presence of good controller drugs like corticosteroids, about 60% of asthmatic patients use alternative medicine. This study was done to determine the effectiveness of Tregonella foenum graceum (fenugreek) seeds in mild asthma. Methodology and theoretical orientation: It is a triple blind trial with placebo effect. One of the ancient prescriptions from Persian Medicine was selected. The participants were divided to 3 groups randomly. One group received fenugreek syrup one received honey syrup and the third group received placebo. Duration of treatment was 4 weeks. Quality of life, Lung function tests and IL-4 levels were evaluated before and after treatment. Findings: from 90 participants to study 79 completed the process. After study there was significant increase in quality of the life and lung function tests and IL- 4 levels in fenugreek and honey groups but there were not significant changes in placebo group. Conclusion and significance: FEV1 level was improved more than 10% in fenugreek group. Treatment was well tolerated. No serious side effects were reported during the study.
