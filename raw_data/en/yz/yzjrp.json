This is wearable art that speaks to your spirit, that heals, that inspires passion. My designs emanate from a perfect blend of a desire to positively impact the lives of others with a passion for unique and beautiful healing jewelry. Rei of Light Jewelry touches people on two levels. Its genuine artistry that appeals to anyone who loves beautiful jewelry. But on a deeper level, each piece is individually crafted to enhance self-expression and empower its owner. From the deep spiritual qualities it imbues all the way to merely catching the eye of the buyer who wants to look their best, my creations are meant to connect you with jewelry and gemstones that speak to your spirit. The result is truly spiritual jewelry. As an artist, creating jewelry is intensely personal for me. Through my understanding of the power of crystals and gems, the stones used in my creations give meaning to every piece beyond its inherent beauty. After carefully considering the properties of each stone and reflecting on its meaning, I give my creations a unique name to give them life for you, the wearer. My hope is that my jewelry will connect you to the healing properties of the natural world and awaken a sense of your own inner strength and beauty. Touching Lives Spirituality and introducing customers to unique stones with healing properties is at the core of Rei of Light Jewelry. My collections speak to the inner spirit, effortlessly igniting the authentic self. My intention is deeper than simply designing pretty jewelry. Rather, in creating jewelry that invites men and women to find strength, inner beauty, self-discovery, and healing I hope to touch lives, to create pieces that resonate and have a positive impact on the lives of those who wear them. By infusing healing energy into each design, my open-hearted spirit shines through each artisanal piece. Healing Rei of Light Jewelry designs are infused with a powerful healing essence. While the stones I use can offer healing for many different conditions, helping those dealing with cancer holds a special place in my heart. Using specific crystals and gemstones for support in healing cancer, many of the Rei of Light pieces are custom designed for those who are searching for ways to ease their journey from a cancer diagnosis back to health. Designs Include From dainty to dramatic, my original designs offer a luxurious collection of crystal necklaces, earrings, bracelets, unique bohemian designs, and cancer healing jewelry. Every design is handcrafted using the highest quality hand-picked gemstones for healing and discovery. Each piece emotes elegance and singularity through precious & semi-precious gemstones, crystals and natural, organic, rustic bohemian materials. Designed to be dressed up or down or layered with precious metal, every design is thoughtfully handcrafted using the highest quality hand-picked gemstones for healing and discovery. At Rei of Light, you will find unique handmade crystal jewelry with healing stones, stacking bracelets, wire wrapped jewelry, handmade fine luxury jewelry, spiritual jewelry, men's jewelry and men's bracelets. Giving Back Over the years, Rei of Light Jewelry has appeared in commercials and retail stores and earned a valued presence on an international level in countries as far away as Europe, the Middle East, Canada and Australia. In order to give back to the immediate community, I support St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital by donating a percentage of all sales to that immensely worthy organization. Best Sellers What Our Customers say Rei of Light handcrafted jewelry is hands-down the most exquisite, breathtaking, elegant, healing, empowering pieces of art that I have ever purchased in my long seasoned life. You can't create beauty of this caliber unless your heart, soul, passion, inspiration, and the integrity of how you live your daily life are in alignment with a higher power. I can see and feel the love and meticulous effort that she infuses into each piece of jewelry that I wear daily. I am especially obsessed with the luxurious color arrangements and the quality stones of her bracelets. This jewelry is what I gift my cherished family and friends. We are all in AWE of how amazing we feel wearing your art. Thank you Brenda!! - Ann W I feel the love and healing energy always when wearing each of Brenda's creation. Each piece is created from the deepest healing intentions of her heart. Brenda is such an inspirational person and that inspiration comes through in all of her creations. Whether she is creating a piece for you from her online collection, a custom piece for you or co-creating a piece, the alchemy of her intuition and the healing properties of the stones chosen come together in such a stunning and admirable magic. Brenda has created several one of a kind pieces for me over the years of knowing her and I have ordered many pieces from her online collection of designs. Her intuitive nature will connect with your spirit to create a stunning and magical piece of jewelry for you or a loved one. Brenda is my go to person for all of my jewelry and for gifts to others.~ Casandra I have never had a more personal online experience. It was not about the purchase as much as it was my conversations with Brenda. I was reading an article about crystals and cancer that Brenda was interviewed in and her comments raised my curiosity. I did an online chat and she offered to speak with me about how crystals might aid me with my treatment. I believe in modern medicine and have great cancer team. Our goal is CURE. Brenda personalized a healing bracelet for me that I can feel the healing energy in it. I have never meet Brenda but there was something about our conversation. I will wear this bracelet on my journey and beyond. Brenda was sincere and I am happy to have her on my team. ~Richard What a treasure! I learned of Brenda/Rei of Light from an online article about the healing power of natural stones. I was looking for meaningful gifts for several dear friends facing cancer treatments. I called Brenda and was so touched by her knowledge, warmth, intention, dedication, talents, intuition, and customer service. What a rare treat to find someone who is living her mission and purpose, who has found the perfect way to share her powerful and many gifts. I ordered a variety of bracelets, custom-made for each loved one, which Brenda then shipped directly to each of them with a personalized note included. Even friends who claim they don't believe the idea of \"healing energy\" (from Brenda or the stones) have acknowledged that their bracelet is the most special gift they've received, they wear it daily, and find it a powerful reminder that they are loved and all possible healing treatments are being leveraged to help them. Brenda is a gift and a healer on many levels. I am so grateful to have found her. ~Edna Mae "}
