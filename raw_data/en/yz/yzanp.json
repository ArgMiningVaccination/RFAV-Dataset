VIDD integrates the expertise and creativity of scientists in basic, translational and clinical research to prevent, treat and cure infectious diseases, including known and emerging infections of major global health importance such as COVID-19, HIV and cancer-related infectious diseases. Applying an innovative multidisciplinary approach, our division houses three formal research programs that systematically pursue explicit goals aimed at eliminating the burden of death and disease from infection. These programs include [Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology](/en/research/divisions/vaccine-infectious-disease-division/research/biostatistics-bioinformatics-and-epidemiology.html); [Immunology and Vaccine Sciences](/en/research/divisions/vaccine-infectious-disease-division/research/infectious-disease-sciences.html). VIDD also houses major networks Prevention Network](https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/) (CoVPN), [HIV [HIV Prevention Trials Network](https://www.hptn.org/) (HPTN), which engage researchers globally in the development of preventive vaccines for COVID-19 and HIV. Within these programs and networks, VIDD's scientists relentlessly work to develop innovative approaches to preventing and treating HIV, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, improve treatment of serious infections among immunocompromised patients and create novel techniques to reduce the impact of infectious diseases worldwide. VIDD's collaborative research initiatives span the globe and include laboratory, clinical and field sites in North and South America, Africa, Asia and Europe. "}
