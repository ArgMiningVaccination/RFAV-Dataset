They could include [massage](https://www.hillsneuroscience.com/services/massage-therapy/), acupuncture, yoga, meditation, and chiropractic therapy. Complementary and alternative medicine can help people manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. Adding complementary and alternative medicine treatments to an integrated therapy approach provides patients with a variety of ways to treat their brain, body, and mind. Since so many of us come to therapy with multiple, co-occurring issues - trauma, depression, and pain, for example - it can be incredibly helpful to take advantage of multiple therapeutic approaches. Dr. Delli Colli is both a licensed clinical psychologist and a registered yoga teacher and yoga therapist. Research has shown that yoga, chiropractic therapy, massage, and acupuncture all work differently to improve mobility, increase flexibility, decrease pain, and often treat psychological and physiological issues. That's why Hills is happy to offer a range of complementary and alternative medicine options to our clients. At Hills, we believe you need to treat the mind and body as well as the brain. Mental health conditions can have somatic symptoms, especially for depression, trauma, anxiety, and substance use disorders. By working on your body and mind, you tap into your healing power to transcend emotional and physical pain. Many of our services can be conducted via phone or video conference - all in compliance with HIPAA privacy standards. Contact us to schedule a free, 15-minute phone consultation to learn more and see if our therapy services are right for you. "}
