{"title": "How to Detoxify from Vaccinations & Heavy Metals", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2014-10-07", "cleaned_text": "to vaccinate (or believe you have no choice), it's time to detoxify. This is not an article intended to debate the efficacy of vaccinations, but merely to address the toxicity from vaccinations and advise on elimination of the toxins. Regardless of what your position on vaccinations is, any rational person cannot deny that the ingredients in vaccines are toxic. In fact, almost every single ingredient in any immunization is toxic to the human body. Besides the vitamins and minerals, nobody in their right mind would drink a concoction with any one or combination of most of the vaccine ingredients (and those vitamins and minerals they add are toxic, too). Most vaccinations are directly injected into our bodies, allowing the ingredients to directly enter the bloodstream, which rationally, seems like an even more dangerous approach. Vaccine ingredients (adjuvants and preservatives) and substances used in the manufacturing process, including vaccine-production media that are present only in trace quantities, include: sucrose, fructose, dextrose, potassium phosphate, FD&C Yellow monosodium aluminum hydroxide, benzethonium potassium peptone, bovine extract, formaldehyde, thimerosal, ammonium sulfate, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, bovine extract), calf serum, aluminum phosphate, aluminum hydroxphosphate sulfate, and ethanol. Vaccinations also contain many inorganic minerals, vitamins, amino acids, salts, and sugars. If anyone can tell me why in the heck they put artificial colors into vaccines, I would love to read about it in comments. Does anyone really care what color an immunization is? Obviously this sort of cocktail going into the bloodstream can slow things down. You are introducing heavy metals, preservatives, and a host of other inorganic compounds, most of which are not even found in nature, directly into the blood stream. Much of the vaccine material will not leave the body without assistance, especially with a typical modern lifestyle and diet. Eat Well The goal in order to detoxify from vaccinations is to flush the body of toxins, including heavy metals. There are a few good supplements available for chelation, but it can also be done with the right foods. Along with a healthy diet, the best ingredients for a natural heavy metal chelation regimen are chlorella, cilantro, citrus peels, spirulina, and garlic. Most vegetables have some chelation properties, and eating combinations of vegetables increases their ability to chelate exponentially (this is true for all the health benefits). Make salads with more than ten different vegetables with lots of cilantro, avocado, and garlic every day. Avoid sugar, and avoid any and all refined, processed, manufactured foods. Fix the Immune System Sugars are present in vaccines, and sugars suppress the immune system. Sugars also feed parasites, viruses (indirectly), fungus, bacteria, and any other little creature that wants to harm us. These refined sugars travel through the bloodstream to wherever infection can be fed. As mentioned, lots of garlic is recommended, as well as the following supplements: oil of oregano, Echinacea, goldenseal, and goldenthread. These supplements, especially when used in conjunction with each other, will help purify the blood, remove toxins, and keep any infectious agent at bay, all while helping to repair the immune system. In addition to those supplements, a B vitamin complex is recommended for a few weeks after immunizing. Formaldehydes, and metals like mercury and aluminum make assimilating B vitamins more difficult. Until the heavy metals are removed, the solution is to take a high quality B complex supplement and to make sure the digestive system is as healthy as possible. Drink Lots of Fluids I try to drink [a gallon of cranberry lemonade with stevia and cayenne (click for recipe) ](/inexpensive-easy-detox-the-one-gallon-challenge/#recipe)every day. I am also 6'2\" and I weigh 220 pounds. Use your best judgment. For most people, a gallon of water a has huge benefits including flushing out our system or toxins, heavy metals, and impurities, detoxifying our blood, lowering blood pressure, and reducing aging dramatically, as long as you are getting enough minerals and other nutrition while you do it. But to make drinking that much water even more difficult, for best nutrient absorption and heavy metal chelation, it's best to take food with supplements and drink water (or lemonade) when the body is not trying to digest. You can also alternate days where you drink a lot more and eat a lot less, and vice-versa. This is a great way to detoxify quickly and get plenty of nutrition at the same time. Exercise Sweating, breathing hard, and moving help detoxify the body. Exercise also moves toxins that had otherwise settled, making elimination more likely. While you exercise, be sure to breathe properly. Breathe deeply from your diaphragm and expand your abdomen when you fill your air with lungs. It's often said that 70 to 80% of the toxins we expel from our body evacuate through the lungs. The skin is the next most significant organ in regards to toxin elimination, hence the sweat with exercising. [Running](/running-without-knee-pain/), exercising in a sauna (a non toxic sauna, ideally), jumping rope, [rebounding](/inexpensive-easy-detox-the-one-gallon-challenge/#rebounding), hiking with hills, squats, [yoga](/issue/4-yoga-a-beginners-guide/), and tai chi are all great exercises for aiding detoxification. Hot and Cold Hydrotherapy Hot water increases blood flow to the surface of the body. Cold water drives the blood from the surface to the core of the body. Alternating hot and cold water increases blood flow and speeds up circulation. It brings fresh blood with oxygen and nutrients to the organs and glands and carries away toxins and waste. Dr. Shillington suggests starting with water as hot as you can stand for a minimum of two minutes. Then turn off the hot water for two minutes of cold\u2014the colder the better. Alternate back and forth for a total of 20 minutes, ending with cold. Read more at [Hot & Cold Hydrotherapy](/issue/3-hot-cold-hydrotherapy/). Supplements [Shillington's Blood Detox](https://www.greenlifestylemarket.com/shillingtons-blood-detox-formula) is absolutely amazing, and in my mind, essential for any detox.

[Shillington's Total Nutrition Formula](https://www.greenlifestylemarket.com/shillingtons-total-nutrition-formula) has chlorella, spirulina, and citrus peels in it, which is awesome for detoxifying and chelating heavy metals, and it's the best multivitamin/mineral supplement I know.

[B vitamin complex ](https://www.greenlifestylemarket.com/basic-b-complex-60c-thorne-research) is recommended for a few weeks at least, since heavy metal toxicity causes the body to assimilate b vitamins inefficiently. Keep Doing It Unfortunately, the amount of heavy metals and other very toxic compounds in vaccines causes a huge burden on our immune system and takes a long time to expel from the body. Where the toxins settle inside the body, determines what, if any, vaccine injuries occur. Keep in mind that heavy metals can shift. And they are heavy, as their name denotes. They often settle at the feet. A footbath detox works well for pulling toxins from the feet. More importantly, keep eating well, keep drinking lots of fluids, keep chelating, and keep exercising and detoxifying. The reality is, the healthier an individual is, the less likely they are to be injured by vaccines. Regardless of their efficacy, the irony is, the healthier a person is, the less benefit they could possibly derive from vaccines.
