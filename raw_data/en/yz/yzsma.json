It has been undertaken in parallel with a public dialogue exercise (run by TNS BMRB), and both activities have been designed to feed into a Stakeholder Summit on Our Food Future, to be held in London on 18 th February 2016. The Our Food Future programme of work flows directly from a commitment made in the Food Standards Agency's Strategy for 2015-16. Sin ce its launch in 2000, the FSA has followed its founding pledge that \" We will put consumers first in everything we do\" (FSA 2015a: 4). The Strategy for 2015-20 reaffirms that, and adds some new responsibilities, including to ensure consumers have \"the right to the best food future possible\" (ibid.:5). This commitment states that the current food system is under pressure, and access to safe and healthy food now - and in future - is unevenly distributed. In making this commitment, the FS A Strategy recognises that it is a very broad agenda, and the Agency itself is only one actor among many who will need to collaborate in order to deliver on that commitment. In some pla ces FSA will lead, and in others it will help and co-ordinate; it is in this spirit of collaborat ion that the Our Food Future programme of work, and Summit, is being convened. Our Food Future has been developed in cl ose co-ordination the Global Food Security programme, of which the FSA is a core partner. The GFS programme was established in 2011 by the BBSRC (the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council), in co-ordination with six other scientific research councils, an d UK governments, departments and associated agencies, to build the evidence base on how to ad vance global food security. Much of the work of the programme includes public engagement, and for the past year GFS has been running a Public Panel on Food Futures, comprising 600 member of the public, subsets of whom are invited to participate in dialogue exercises on different food security topics. The Our Food Future programme pursues similar pre-occupations to the GFS Panel, although its constituency is ultimately system stakeholders not the genera l public. Just as the evidence from public dialogue exercises to date - including by GFS - ha s been central to this review, so it is hoped this review may have value to colleagues in GFS, and others planning to run dialogues in future. This literature review for Our Food Future has been undertaken in parallel to the public dialogue work on the programme, being delivered by TN S. The review's emerging findings have informed the approach to the dialogue exercise s, but the outcomes from those dialogues have not been incorporated back into this review. As such the review represents the knowledge base from which stakeholders working on Our Food Future can move forward together. The review is itself the product of an extensi ve and collaborative research programme, led by Andrew Darnton (AD). The full methodology is detailed in the Annexes to this report, but its different phases and their extent can be summarised as follows: i) The Initial Call for Information The review process began in October 2014, when AD, acting as external advisor to the Wellcome Trust's food and drink initiative ( now branded 'The Crunch') sent out a call for information to 60 researchers and practi tioners working on aspects of the UK food system. The scope of the call was broad in terms of topics, summed up as evidence on 'where the UK public is at' in terms of food-related perceptions and practices. A relatively tight timeframe was set (sources since 2010 - although this was not always 3 adhered to by contributors). As the pr incipal aim of the review was to provide benchmarks to support the development of the Crunch, and track changes in public engagement over time, the emphasis was on quantitative data (though not just from surveys). AD was supported in the logging an d selection of sources by Clare Curtis, then of the Wellcome Collection. In total, 101 sour ces were gathered from 42 individuals; 60 were selected as the basis of an internal report to the Crunch programme team and contractors (February 2015). ii) The Follow-Up Call for Information As FSA's 'Our Food Future' programme bega n to take shape in early 2015, it became clear that the evidence base on the UK public's relationship with food, and their role in the food futures agenda, would need to be reviewed (not least, preliminary to the new primary research which FSA was planning to undertake). The Wellcome Trust agreed to share the assembled body of evidence with the FSA, and AD was commissioned by FSA to update and then synthesise the evidence base. Accordingly in August 2015 a second call for information was sent out, to all 42 individuals who responded to the initial call (they were also sent a copy of the longlist of 101 sources gathered from the first call). The scope was similarly broad, with the same timeframe set, although the kinds of data searched for were extended, to include more qualitative evidence. The second call's focus was summed up as being on the 'views voices and practices of the UK public in relation to food', now and in future. The call was left open throughout the rest of 2015, and even into 2016, with participants contribu ting new work as it became available, right up to the reporting deadline in February 2016. In total, 76 individuals contributed to this call, and the total set of relevant sources th ey contributed across the two calls numbered 131. iii) The Systematic Study In November 2015 the FSA resolved to commission a systematic review to supplement the expert-led calls for information. The aim of the systematic review was to add transparency and robustness to the review pr ocess, and ensure any important gaps had not been left in the coverage of evidence. Valerie Viehoff at the University of Bonn was commissioned to undertake the systematic sear ch, using a scope derived from the expert- led calls. Accordingly her search terms were br oad, albeit the same timeframe was set, of sources produced since 2010. The search r eturned 1,307 sources. A set of filtering criteria were then applied, based on whether the source covered a) the UK b) food, in relation to consumers c) the UK public, whose 'views, voices, and practices' needed to be visible through the source (ie. it included pr imary evidence relating to them - although this need not always be new). Applying these filters to the titles of the sources returned, the selection reduced to 528, which was then reduced to 94 on reviewing the abstracts of each paper against the three filters. The full text of each of these sources was then reviewed against the priority topics of the 'Our Food Future' programme (agreed with the FSA and partners' steering group), with th e result that 52 of the systematic sources went forward for final review. The three strands in this programme of secondary research have been brought together in this single synthesis review. It is based on the 183 selected sources which in total were gathered via the three routes above. In drafting the report not all those sources were cited (largely due to constraints of space), while 15 more 'classics' were added to provide firm theoretical footings for the commentary. In the final outcome, this review cites 100 sources; these are listed in the annex at the back of this report, along with the 183 sources selected in total. 4 The result of this process is a substantial body of evidence: an inclusive current selection of what researchers know about the UK public's relati onship with food going forward. An initial observation is that few of these sources explicitly talk about (or report on) food in the future from the public's perspective. As a result, mu ch of this review involves extrapolating the public's role in food futures from what we know about their practices and preferences now. It is hoped that the FSA's Our Food Future programme , and other work like it, will see the public more fully involved in these questions from here on. Acknowledgments Thanks are due to all those researchers and practitioners who contributed evidence to this review [listed in the Annexes below] - especially those who provided access to working drafts, or bespoke analyses of their datasets. Clare Curtis, and Valerie Viehoff, have earned huge gratit ude for their sure handling of the large bodies of incoming evidence. Finally, thanks go the anonymous peer reviewer, whose ca reful weighing of the data, and rich connections out to the wider ev idence base, have strengthen ed the report immensely. 5 Executive Summary Members of the public show very little awarene ss of the term 'global food security' when it is presented to them. Arguably it was not designed for use with the public, and is technical jargon, but they also show very little awaren ess of the issues that global food security represents, including that there is an impending crisis facing the food system, which in itself is harming the natural environment on which it depends. The only part of the situation with which people seem familiar is the pressure of the growing world population on food supply. The fact that the current system is unsustai nable, and that our ways of producing and consuming food will have to change , is new news to most people. The very idea of food futures is strange to most people. People's relationship with food tends to be immediate, in the sense of short term, and proximal, based on what they buy and eat, not on global issues of supply and demand. 'Food choice' is a problematic phrase, best used to describe a body of literature which explores the factors in consumer decision making . It should arguably be used alongside the phrase 'food non-choice' which would highlight that for most people in everyday life food is not eaten as the result of rational deliberation; it would also foreground those publics whose access to food is proscribed, including through lack of available income. The most influential factors in food choice are price, quality and taste. Health concerns are subordinate to these, and environmental consid erations are lesser still. The considerable evidence supporting this ranking suggests that people will not change their behaviours for food security reasons unless their requirements in terms of price, quality and taste and also met. Factors arguing against a rational choice view of food behaviours include emotions and habit, plus questions of identity, belonging an d culture. Convenience is also key: food practices have to fit in with people's lifestyles; when they are busy (or time is not prioritised for food) convenience foods dominate. Capacity to choose is constrained for a numb er of subgroups within the public. For example, one fifth of women are on diets to lo se weight. One fifth of over 70s cannot eat certain foods for medical reasons. Most topically, a proportion of households on low incomes lives in a state of food insecurity. Though we currently lack meaningful ways of measuring this group, Trussel Trust food banks provided emergency parcels on over 1 million occasions in 2014 - and these numbers have been growing year on year. For these groups in particular, talk of food choice may not be merely inaccurate but iniquitous. The very existence of a food system is a surprise to participants in dialogue exercises. They tend to regard it as a 'black box', and this sense of 'opacity' is felt to have increased in recent years as production methods have made more use of innovative technologies, and supply chains have become longer and more complex, to the point where they can be perceived as \"unnatural, mechanised and alien \". Since 2012, the predominant method for researching with the public around food futures has been dialogue exercises: intensive grou p discussions drawing on external information and expert inputs, often involving a series of meetings staggered over a period of weeks. 6 When dialogue participants are first told a bout the links between food and environmental impacts, and the urgency of the need for change in the food system, their first response is one of surprise. Following discussion, they th en tend to develop a determination to do something about it, and their preference is th at consumers take action by changing their behaviour, rather than that producers introd uce more technological innovations to increase yields - for fear of adding to the 'unnaturalness' they already perceive in supply chains. Across several dialogue exercises, the participan ts go on to change their own behaviours, the most common changes being to eat less meat, reduce food waste, and buy locally produced food. Many participants report that they were already doing this anyway - but never on grounds of global food security. These 'demand side' changes among dialogue participants are - to an extent - mirrored in the wider public. Shopping locally and wasting less food appear to be acceptable to the majority of the public, or at least to be reco gnised as aspirational or appropriate forms of conduct. Eating less meat is more controversial. Dialogue exercises can result in enthusiasm for reducing meat intake - though this is not universally shared among participants. Evidence from the wider pub lic suggests reluctance among some and flat refusal among many. Reasons for not reducing meat are well documented and include the 4 Ns (that it is natural, normal, necessary, and ni ce). There is also a well-established literature suggesting that meat eating can be fundamenta l to self and social identity (especially for men). However, reducing meat seems to be poten tially much easier to negotiate than giving up meat altogether. Precise numbers vary fr om survey to survey but two subgroups seem to show a disposition towards meat reducing: older people (among whom 40% of those in their 70s have reduced the amount of meat they have eaten in the last year - apparently as a result of ageing effects) and younger people (among whom 20% of under 25s intend to reduce their meat eating in the next year). Yo ung people are also the most likely age range to be vegan or vegetarian (5% of under 30s say they are), while women are also much more like to be vegan or vegetarian than are men (4%, vs. 2%). Overall, based on current evidence, the public are relatively evenly split on whether they are prepared to eat less meat (though the unwilling tend to speak louder). On the supply side, the public's principal ro le is in accepting (or refusing) new food technologies - which presupposes an initial level of knowledge and awareness, which is currently lacking for many of the newer technol ogies in particular. Beyond acceptance, there will then need to be a phase of acti ve engagement as people negotiate how - or whether -to fit the technologies into their daily lives (as new 'sociotechnical' arrangements). Overall, the public appears to be mildly supportive, decreasingly negative, and largely uncertain about the application of new technologies in food production. In establishing the acceptance of new technologies, members of the public seem to deploy a number of rules of thumb. These include risk calculations (combining susceptibility and severity), personal experience of risks and ill e ffects, the scale of the organism on which the technology is being applied (ie. micro-organisms are more acceptable than plants which are more acceptable than animals), and the degree of 'naturalness' of the process (ie. how much the composition of the food is altered from its original state). However, for most technologies, most of the public are approa ching from a position of ignorance - hence uncertainty or neutrality being the most popular option when they are forced to take a position on particular food technologies, couple d with an insistence on safeguards being in place. 7 In terms of acceptance, the novel technologies th at are most acceptable are those that are closest to 'natural' processes. Functional foods are an ill-defined category, but seem to elicit little concern, especially if they foreground heal th benefits and are applied to healthy 'carrier' foods (eg. brown bread). Mechanically separated poultry meat is also relatively acceptable, on the basis that the chemical composition of the meat has not been altered (and with the caveat that the resulting product is clearl y labelled). Other technologies are much less acceptable, eg. irradiation (which may be ok ay on reflection, but people still wouldn't buy the products), and biotechnology with plants or animals (the former being preferable to the latter, but both fundamentally messing with na ture). The least acceptable technology is synthetic meat, although in one study peopl e's response was not aversion so much as confusion, and they spent time constructing scenar ios to make sense of how it might fit into their daily lives. All other food technologies ar e much more emergent, attracting very little awareness among the public, and being very little researched to date in terms of public perceptions; these technologies include nanot ech, and personalised nutrition advice based on genomics. In these spaces, experts call for awareness raising, or two-way dialogues in order to help the public establish their views. Finally, eating insects is an example of a potentially innovative practice (rather than a novel technology) which features in the literature. Indeed, eating insects is taken up by the wider public as the epitome of the debate on future foods - and is treated as novel, trivia l, and revolting on social media, although in dialogue exercises it elicits few concerns, in principal at least (being both natural, and normal, somewhere). The tale of GM foods offers an important illustration of how public attitudes to food technologies can change over time, with nearly 20 years' worth of research evidence on public perceptions available to be reviewed. In 2009 the public's position on GM foods was described as one \" of moderate support and general ambivalence \", and in the period since little appears to have changed, apart from oppositi on weakening slightly, and uncertainty growing further. At the two poles, opinions are still di vided but much of the antagonism appears to come from entrenched stakeholders rather than the lay public. There is however a strand in the story which demonstrates that people's views have been ignored: that the technology was ostensibly developed for the benefit of distan t others, and for the profit of the agri-food industry, with arrangements made between businesses and farmers, while the end consumer was left out. The GM debate is also seen as important in casting a shadow over public perceptions of other food technologies, in a similar way to the shadows which other incidents have cast: from salmonella and BSE through to horsemeat . These incidents appear to have had a cumulative negative effect on trust in the food industry, and to have strengthened public perceptions of an over-engineered and technol ogized food system, closed to consumer understanding or influence. The role of the media is evident in turning food incidents into food scares, and their reach clearly shapes public opinion. However, it is notable how brief the influence of scares on behaviour can be: in the case of horsemeat, sales of frozen burgers bounced back within six months, once barbeque season arrived. Not least due to food scares, which shine a light into the 'black box' of the food system, the public report very low levels of trust in th e food industry (while continuing to eat its products). They tend to bracket all operator s in the supply chain as 'big business' - although those in rural locations appear to know more about production methods, and discriminate accordingly. Supermarkets feature prominently in public views on the industry however, and come in for universal criticism (oft en explicitly linked to the horsemeat issue). 8 Partly because of the 'black box' effect, people feel they have little power to influence the food system as consumers. They also struggl e to deal with the complexity of the system when it is revealed to them, and push aw ay responsibility for dealing with it onto government and business together. However, they tend to be little more trusting of government than they are of business - and often see it as in hock to business interests. People also tend not to understand the workings of government any better than they do the food industry. Nonetheless, participants make clear calls for stronger oversight of the system, and express their desire for someone to take the lead on food security issues (once they have been awoken to them). However, their calls for government action are general, and they do not tend to identify particular roles the government should take, or organisations which should lead on those role s - unless they are prompted by researchers. Given the very low levels of awareness of th e impending crisis in the food system, the public dialogue exercises under review tend to close with participants calling for a programme of awareness raising. In some ca ses they see this as preparatory to behaviour change - of the sort they themselves have unde rtaken as a consequence of participating in the public dialogues. While this process works for them, it is clearly not scaleable: we'd be a long time achieving population-level change if we had to work through two rounds of discussions in a month with groups of 50 people at a time. Such a method would also be of questionable value in the longterm, as we consta ntly need to renegotiate our approaches to achieving food security in the face of ev er-changing pressures and newly-emerging technologies. The first GFS dialogue from 2012 notes that experts and the lay public use different frames to talk about food system challenges. This review closes by recommending an open-ended process of sense-making shared between food system stakeholders and the lay public, in order to develop visions of viable food futures which everyone can share in. It is hoped that organisations like GFS, the Wellcome Trust, and the FSA can lead the way in carrying this shared endeavour forward over the coming years. 9 Main Findings 1. Context The FSA Strategy for 2015-20 frames its work wi thin the challenge of delivering food security for the UK public. In doing this, it takes the definition of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), for whom food security is a state which \"exists when all people at all times have physical, social and economic access to suff icient, safe and nutritious f ood which meets their dietary needs and food preferences fo r an active and healthy life \"(1999, in FSA 2015). This state cannot be said to exist now in the UK - think of those in poverty (see eg. Fabian Society 2015) - and it is under increasing threat as we move into the future, not least as the effects of climate change take hold: there will be radical change over the next 25 years , potentially including in the period up to 2020, says the FSA Strategy. There is increasing mobilisation around the ch allenge of food security across the civil society actors who make up an emergent 'community of practice' focused on the interaction between the public and the food system (for more on communities of practice, essentially \" groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly\", see Wenger et al. 2002). The work of the Wellc ome Trust, and the FSA itself, has already been flagged, added to which are new networking bodie s like the Food Research Collaboration, Eating Better, and - internationally, the EAT Forum. Thei r work follows in the footsteps of the more established Food Climate Research Network (FCRN) , who have been alive to this agenda since 2005. Consumer groups such as Which? are playing a part, whilst industry-facing groups such as the Carbon Trust and Forum for the Future also have programmes of work running in this space. Meanwhile, the ESRC has brought together researchers in a multidisciplinary Nexus Network: exploring the 'interdependencies, tensions and trade-offs' between water, energy, food and environment (see http://www.thenexusnetwork.org/ ). Political groups and think tanks like Chatham House, and the Fabian Society, have set down their own markers in the debate, based on collaborations and Commissions which they have developed. Finally, UK governments, departments and the research councils fund th e Global Food Security programme, co-ordinated by the BBSRC. [Many of these organisations - and more besides - have contributed evidence to this review: see the Annexes below.] All these bo dies in their different ways are responding to the common challenge of providing healthy and sa fe food for people across the world, now and in future - and their mobilisation recognises that the challenge is urgent. These bodies' ways of working also recognise th at the challenge is complex: they have come together as networks and collaborations in order to respond to the interactions and feedbacks in the global food system. Like many sustaina bility challenges, food security cuts across boundaries: of governance, of markets, of th eories and disciplines, as well as geographic territories. This challenge requires new institut ions which work across traditional silos, an approach exemplified by the Global Food Securi ty (GFS) programme. GFS was created in 2011 to explore responses to questions of food s ecurity, and to bring together policymakers and academics in the UK to help shape the agenda. It pursues global food security as a classic sustainability challenge of living within (ever-decreasing) limits, in order \" to provide the world's growing population with a sustainable, secure supply of nutritious food from less land and using fewer inputs \" (see http://www.foodsecurity.ac.uk/ ). This will involve balancing increasing supply (eg. through sustainable intensification - though what this entails and how remains contentious - see eg. BBSRC 2014) with reducing demand (especially for resource-intensive proteins like meat) whilst both mitigating and adapting to climate chan ge (which is already reducing yields). 10 Judging from a number of key indicators, the situ ation is already urgent. A number of these are cited in the sources under review here, where they help to set the context for the discussion of public understanding and attitudes which follows. These include that: Emissions from the livestock sector acco unt for 14.5% of global greenhouse gases (GHGs) - approximately equal to the tailpipe emissions from fuel burnt in all the world's vehicles (FAO/IPCC, in Wellesley et al. 2015). At current rates, consumption of meat and dairy produce is expected to rise by 76% and 65% respectively by 2050, with emissions rising accordingly (Bailey/FAO 2014, in ibid.). A 'do nothing' approach would mean that emissions from agriculture would take up the total carbon budget allowed in a 'two degree' warming scenario by 2050 (as agreed at COP 21) - without rises in emissions from any other sector (Bajlzejl et al. 2014). Recent modelling has established that increasing efficiencies in food production will be insufficient to prevent further increases in land use for agriculture, and accompanying emission rises; yield increases will need to be accompanied with \" substantial \" demand reduction if we are to live within land and carbon limits (ibid.). The situation is summed eloquently by Tim Benton the UK's Global Food Security Champion who, giving evidence to the Fabian Co mmission on Food and Poverty, said the \"agri-food system is completely not fit for purpose going into the future, even though it has been relatively good to us over the last 20 or 30 years \" (Fabian Society, 2015). Or, put even more cris ply, in the title of his presentation to the Wellcome Trust's Crunch team: 'Business as Usual is not an option'. As this review shall go on to reveal, for most of the public, this situation is 'new news'. Indeed, like the community of practice outlined above, th e 'food futures' research agenda is only just emerging: it is hoped that it can be made more tangible through this review. This agenda potentially spans the whole food system, including the supply side, the demand side, and the supply chains and governance structures which link and mediate between the two. There is the strong risk of the agenda being expert-led an d technocratic, to the exclusion of the publics who are at the centre of the systems. This in turn wo uld increase democratic deficits (ie. the lack of voice for certain subgroups in policy discussions), with the public being 'done to', and resulting in more winners and losers. It would also most likely lead to (or perpetuate) a broken system, which failed to allow for the needs and practices of the public as end user, and increasingly so as pressures on the system build over time. This review endeavours to bring together the 'food futures' literature, and array it around the public (or - better - 'publics') at its centre. It is a vast literature, but one which currently is strangely hollow: as we shall see, there are relati vely few sources in which the public addresses the future head on, in the context of food. Th e exceptions include public dialogue exercises, such as those run by the GFS, by Which?, and now under the FSA's 'Our Food Future' programme. Topics of relevance to the food fu tures agenda thus include: awareness of food security challenges, actual/potential dietary and other behaviour change, acceptability of emerging food technologies, risk perceptions, an d trust in government and other actors. The evidence on these issues and more will be reviewed below, before closing with implications for ways forward in engaging the public in food future. 11 2. The Public and Food Future While 'food futures' is beginning to appear as a professional agenda, the future is a dimension which is missing from public discourses around food. A telling example of this is provided by a 'social listening' study undertaken for the Wellc ome Trust (OLR 2014); social listening, whereby researchers analyse content which has been shared through publicly-accessible social media platforms (largely Twitter and Facebook), provid es an interesting complement to conventional market research methods, in that, while it is not derived from a representative sample of the public, it analyses discourses which were created without any researcher inputs (hence there is no chance of leading the public - a constant risk in areas of low salience and understanding). The OLR study reports that the social media de bate was confined to future foods, was \" small in volume and limited in scope \", and that \"most of the people talking about the to pic were not seriously engaged with the future of food \" (ibid.: 44). They conclude that \" any triggers in debate were drowned out by general noise - mostly around the novelty of eating insects\" adding that such discussion tende d to be approached from the perspective of 'I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!'. While the food futures agenda among professionals is framed in terms of food security, this language has no place in public discourse. In an early survey run by TNS for GFS in 2012, respondents were asked directly whether they had he ard of the term 'global food security' (GFS 2012a). Around one in ten respondents (13% ) said they had, whilst 86% said they had not. Notably, men were significantly more likely than women (17% vs. 10%) to have heard of the term, as were those in ABC1 socio-economic grad es (18% vs. 8% of C2DEs). However, these response patterns are what one might expect to any knowledge testing question, and may well over-estimate actual awareness. That suspicion is reinforced by evidence from qua litative research. Parallel to their survey, the GFS team commissioned a public dialogue exercise - the first of several, convened by them, Which?, and by the FSA. In this 2012 exercise (designed with researchers from SPRU at Sussex, and delivered by TNS), two workshops were held with a cross-section of 44 members of the public, across three locations (London, Aberystwyth and Edinburgh - see GFS 2012b). The first workshop explored the public's current percep tions and framings, before providing factual inputs including scenarios. There was then a brea k, during which time participants were asked to visit websites and reflect upon what they had learnt to date. The second workshop involved more factual inputs, including from selected ex perts in person, and from Tim Benton (the GFS Champion) by video. As we shall see repeatedly in this review, dialogues of this kind provide both research evidence and action-based examples of how participants respond to particular inputs, such as pieces of evidence or 'messaging': as such they are a popular tool in policy development work - although there is the constant need to scrutinise the findings to ensure that unprompted and prompted responses are not blurred. In the instance of the 2012 GFS dialogue, the concept of 'global food security' was intr oduced early in the first workshop, and the researchers report that overall awareness of the phrase was \" extremely low \" (ibid.: 14). However, \"upon reflection participants had a broad intuit ive understanding of what the term implies \" and in particular they associated it with feeding a growing global po pulation; it is notable that climate change was not reported to be part of their initial intuitions. The absence of climate change from public unders tandings is important as it is arguably what injects the urgency into considerations of gl obal food security - notwithstanding the large feedbacks between food production and climate chan ge. In the next in what we might call the series of public dialogues - here, convened by Which? in September 2012, explicitly on the topic 12 of 'the future of food', and based on two-day ci tizen's juries in four UK cities - researchers report that participants were \" surprised \" at the information from experts that there was an impending crisis in the food system (Which? 2013 : 22). Further, the 'jurors' were described as \"shocked \" to hear of the connections between food, climate change, and price rises, which together were described as bringing this crisis a bout. One participant in Cardiff is quoted saying: \"It's a lot more urgent than you re alise and we're led to believe.\" In early 2014, TNS-BMRB convened two rounds of 'citizens forum' events for the Food Standards Agency, as a part of a programme of research to explore public perceptions, in support of the forthcoming FSA Strategy 2015-20 (F SA 2014a). The first wave of forums took place in five cities in England Wales and Northe rn Ireland, and involved 90 minute discussions to review and respond to existing research on pub lic perceptions. Following an interval of a few weeks, the five forums were reconvened, and 'town hall' style meetings were held, with participants choosing the topics to be discussed, before dividing in to two parties to debate them, against each other as it were. The three top t opics chosen were affordability and healthy eating, food safety, and fraud and authenticity. However, other topics such as environmental impact and food security were also kept on the agenda. The researchers report that \" food security was not a top of mind concern for participants\" (ibid.: 32). This seems an understatement; it is striking that when the moderator raised the topic of availability, pa rticipants assumed they were talking about over-, rather than, under-supply of food. \" Consumers tended to raise the negative consequences of having too much choice. There was a perception that ex cessive choice in supermarkets was enco uraging irresponsible food choices and wasteful practices \" (ibid.: 32). The most recent in this loose series of dialogue s was again undertaken by Which?, when in 2015 they ran a follow-up exercise to their 2012 juries (in partnership with the Government Office for Science, and again delivered by TNS-BMRB - see Whi ch? 2015). This time the exercise involved two full-day workshops, reconvened one week apart; 49 people took part in all, in London, Cardiff and Paisley, and again they were selected to span diverse subgroups in the UK public. Again, a range of inputs were provided, includin g expert testimony; the interim week included a shopping task, informed by learnings from th e first workshop, before the second workshop presented participants with a range of 'potential solutions' to the food system challenges and asked them to respond with plans of their own. Notably there were also a round of follow-up interviews, undertaken two months after the workshops, to explore lasting effects on participants. In terms of findings, once again, as in 2012, \" very few participants were aware of the challenges facing the food system \" (ibid.: 63). Moreover, there was \" considerable surprise \" at the level of impact the food system was shown to have on th e environment (and this was even apparent among those who tended to \" take an interest in the environment \"). It is informative to take a look at one of the items of stimulus used in the first of the 2015 workshops: 13 The researchers describe these as \" stand-out pieces of information \", and found that they were \"generally a surprise to participants \" (ibid.: 20). The breadth, scale, and interconnectedness of the challenges clearly struck participants hard, judging from these quotations: \"All of that really worried me, it's a massive problem.\" (London, Female) \"It's just a big eye-opener - the amount of greenhou se gas, the water, the crops ... it's just everything.'' (Paisley, Female) This qualitative evidence - or more precisely, findin gs from public dialogues - is important as it provides a relatively unprompted fix on levels of public awareness of the challenges to food security, which can serve as a se nse-checker against quantitative da ta. We have already seen how the 2012 GFS survey revealed extremely low le vels of awareness of the 'GFS' term (and suspected those responses may have included some guesswork). Related quantitative measures may also be inflated, for example the same survey reports that, when presented with the statement 'people in developed countries such as the UK need to change their diets and eat less or there won't be enough food to go round', ha lf of respondents (51%) agreed. (However, 31% disagreed with the statement, and the researchers somewhat plaintively note \" this is therefore an area to improve upon \" - GFS 2012a: 10). However it does seem that the one aspect of food insecurity which the UK public is able to respond to is the questions of population growth; it was part of their 'intuitive' unpacking of the 'GFS' term described above (GFS 2012b), and is present in a number of other survey questions ab out the need for change in the food system. For example, in an 18-country survey by Gl obescan for National Geographic in 2014 - the 'Greendex' study - an average of 60% of responden ts agreed that 'large' or 'very large' changes are needed in 'how we produce and consume our food in order to be able to feed a growing global population over the long term' (National Ge ographic, 2014). In the UK the figure was slightly lower than the global average, with 54% calling for 'very no responden t called for no changes - although the wording of the question did not encourage them to do so. 14 GFS survey data also suggest that the population di mension of food security is familiar to a large section of the public; the 2012 survey asked res pondents whether any of a list of factors were 'likely to affect food security in the future' (GFS 2012a). From the list of prompts, respondents chose population increases (65%), climate change (59%) and the price of food (47%). However, given the qualitative evidence above we can have serious reservations about the levels of response to this question - though the rankings seem fair: more of the public are aware of population than climate links to food security (and most likely the gap between the two is far larger than this prompted question suggests). A pot entially more valid measure is provided in a 12-country survey undertaken by MORI for Chatham House in 2014, as part of their programme of work on meat and dairy (Ipsos MORI 2014a). The survey is interes ting (and potentially more useful) as it asks the question about the link between food and climate the other way round, as shown below. Q3 How big a part, if any, do you think the following activities play in human contribution to climate change? [sic] [UK n = 1,040] Little/nothing % A Lot % Lot/Moderate % Cutting down of trees and forests 9 62 88 Burning coal, oil and gas in power stations to produce electricity 10 63 87 Exhaust emissions from trains, planes, cars, lorries and ships 11 59 86 Industry and manufacturing, for example the production of goods 11 52 85 Disposal and treatment of waste such as rubbish in landfill, and sewage treatment 16 49 81 Heating and cooling our homes and offices 16 40 80 Farming, processing and packaging the meat and dairy products that we eat and drink 26 29 69 As the table shows, of the 7 activities which could contribute to anthropogenic climate change, meat and dairy farming is the least likely to be identified by the UK public: 69% say it has an effect, and 26% say it has little or no effect. It is notable that only respondents in Russia (42%) and the USA (39%) are more likely to say meat and dairy farming has little or no effect. While the research evidence exploring UK public awareness of growing food insecurities is relatively limited, there is enough here to sugge st that the vast majority of the UK public is unware there is a crisis now, or any time soon, and that the only piece of evidence they have to draw on in beginning to comprehend this reality is their general awareness that the global population is growing rapidly. Without a greater understanding of some other elements of the system (notably climate change, but also resource intensity, inefficiencies and wastes in the supply chain) it will be hard for them to join in wider public conversations about how to negotiate 'food futures'. 15 3. The Public and Food Present If 'Global Food Security' is a professional discours e - and 'food futures' is an emerging area of work - what happens when we adopt the pub lic's perspective? In contrast to the \" extremely low awareness of the phrase\" reported in the first GFS public dialogue (GFS 2012b), the researchers found that participants \" were not used to thinking about food in a global context - the frame of reference was too large. Rather... their 'engagement' with food was at point of purchase and concer ned more immediate factors such as price and quality \" (ibid.: 14). This finding has the ring of common sense, and suggests that any enquiry into public perceptions of food futures should start by unde rstanding the public's relationships with food present. Food is primarily, for all of us, som ething to eat. If we were to adopt a blunt needs- based understanding of behaviour, like that proposed by Maslow back in the 1940s in his 'Hierarchy of Needs', food supplies our basic physiological need for sustenance (Maslow 1943). Yet even as he presented this analysis Maslow noted that basic needs are only the start of it: \"It is quite true that man lives by bread alone - when there is no bread. Bu t what happens to man' s desires when there is plenty of bread and when hi s belly is chronically filled?\" (ibid.: 375). Wo/men (and Maslow) move up the hierarchy, until they reach the top tier of needs, for 'self actualisation' (\" A musician must make music, an artist must paint, a poet mu st write.... What a man can be, he must be \" - ibid.: 382). For Maslow, food satisfies hunger, and the need to eat is then left behind; but readers (and writers) coming along after will note that food is fundamen tal both to sustenance and self expression. In the words of Claude Fischler, for example, \" food not only nourishes, but also signifies \" (Fischler 1988: 276). Fischler's paper (on 'Food Self and Identity') prov ides analysis on how food is essential to our selves in two dimensions. The first we can call vert ical, in following the orientations of Maslow's 'Hierarchy': this dimension \" runs from the biological to the cultural , from the nutritional function to the symbolic function \" (ibid.: 275). \" The second links the individual to the coll ective, the psychological to the social\" , and it is this dimension which Fischler's paper fo cuses on. It opens with the much cited adage: \"Food is central to our sense of identity \" (ibid.: 275, and eg. Macdiarmid 2015; Thompson et al. 2015). Fischler's contribution is to focus on how food literally and metaphorically makes us what we are; what we ingest is also a form of expression (s elf actualisation, in the language of Maslow). To turn away from foods we have been used to eating is to turn our back on who we have been, and ask questions about who we are and intend to be. The ties between ways of eating and ways of bein g have been noted by social scientists since the start of their disciplines, and became especially prominent in the work of Levi Strauss, and of Mary Douglas, in the 1960s. In the 1970s, the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu focused on the role of tastes, as preferences or styles of being and do ing, by which people identified themselves with particular groups, and marked themselves out from others. In 'Distinction' (1979; trans. 1984) Bourdieu identifies a fundamental opposition between 'distinguished' and 'vulgar' objects and practices, such that distinction becomes a means of expressing social class through lifestyle. Bourdieu finds this opposition in art, the body, language and food, with distinction being played out through the discourse of taste. Thus popular (v ulgar) tastes are grounded in necessity: filling and economic foods which are eaten quickly in an \" ethic of convivial indulgence \" (ibid.:179). By contrast, dominant (distinguished) tastes are base d on luxury and restraint, delayed gratification and \" sobriety for the sake of slimness \". To make reference to Maslow, there is a distinct hierarchy at work here - and tastes and foods provide some of the stuff of which it is constructed. 16 'Distinguished' styles are associated with those in power, and the observance of these tastes in part serves to keep those who cannot, or do not, follow the same practices at bay. In researching and observing these 'distinctions' Bourdieu reveals great affection for the 'vulgar', and his hero is the bon vivant who \" is not just someone who enjoys eating and drinking; he is someone who is capable of entering into the generous and the familiar - that is both simple and free - relationship that is encouraged and symbolized by eating and drinking together, in a conviv iality which sweeps away reticence and restraint \" (ibid.: 179). Eating is a social act, and being sociable (\" convivial \") expresses it at its height - in contrast to the separateness (eg. of menus, courses, and even tables) of refined dining. Foods taken and eaten express not only th e identity of the eater, but eating together actively shows care for the social group to whom the eater affiliates. A more British example of egalitarian impulses is found in George Orwe ll's 'Road to Wigan Pier' (1937; 2011): \"A millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita, an unemployed man doesn't. When you are underfed, harassed, bored an d miserable, you don't want to eat dull, wholesome food. You want something a little bit tasty. Let's have three penn'orth of chips! Put the kettle on and we'll all have a nice cup of tea!\" The quotation is taken from a paper on the 'junk food mums' episode at Rawmarsh School, Rotherham, South Yorkshire, where in 2006 a group of mothers responded to the School implementing a new healthy menu and banning pupils from leaving the site at lunchtime, by bringing food from local takeaways and passing it though the railings. By the third day it was reported that there was so much demand from the children that the mums used a shopping trolley to distribute the orders. A media storm bl ew up, in what the paper's authors describe as a case of 'moral panic' (borrowing a term from Stanley Cohen). Lines were drawn on both sides, with one of the mums, Julie Critchlow, describing the food served in the canteen as \"over-priced low fat rubbish\" , while the celebrity chef Jamie Oliver weighed in on the healthy eating side, himself having campaigned for healthier school meals (he used the forum of Top Gear to describe Julie Critchlow as a \" big old scrubber \" - ibid.: 407). The episode clearly stuck with Oliver, as he subsequently launched his 'Ministry of Food' TV show and concept, which included him returning to Rotherham in 2008 to teach the mums how to cook ten simple healthy meals (having first apologised for his remarks). From the media perspective, the fault (and there generally needs to be some) was with the mums who failed to take responsibility for their childre n's healthy diets - in fact, flouted measures others were taking to do so. The Sun punningly branded them 'sinner ladies', and ran a cartoon based on the Fat Slags from Viz (in turn pointing up the regional identities and stereotypes marked out through different 'tastes', similarl y to Orwell's idiom in 'Wigan Pier'). The prescription of cookery lessons is another sign of a deficit model being applied: it is presented as help (as in the 'Ministry of Food' format) but presupposes that individuals can determine what foods they and their families eat - if only they were skilled enough. (As an aside, cooking lessons appear frequently in research and policy on healthy eating, as an intervention approach, or 'lever'. For instance, in a paper on people's use and perceptions of salt, the authors note that respondents aged under 40 \" reported a lack of time to cook, preferring to spend time on leisure activities, or more signific antly, citing an inability to cook for themselves \" (Kenten et al. 2013: 108). It is hard not to feel that such observations carry some of the moral charge which Fox and Smith find in the Rawmarsh School story. By contrast, it is notable in a paper which reports on an interesting exercise in which people in Scotland were asked to follow a healthy diet (ie. as prescribed in government guidelines) for three days, that participants were clear that their 17 usual diet of less healthy foods was not followed on account of a lack of cooking skills (Macdiarmid et al. 2013: 416): ''It's not that I can't cook, I think I am quite a decent c ook... It's just more often th an not I can't be bothered doing it to be perfectly honest.'' In the 'Ministry of Food' programme in which Ja mie Oliver meets Julie Critchlow, she counters his apology by arguing that Oliver is \" living in a bubble \" (Fox and Smith 2011: 409). The phrase both sums up that his daily circumstances are different from her own, but also how the food practices she follows reflect the circumstances ar ound her - she too is not making choices 'in a bubble'. From the outset, the mothers had argued that their action was \"nothing to do with junk food, but was a matter of cost and freedom of choice in an age of health surveillance \" (ibid.: 407). While there is much that is unedifying about the story (and the paper's authors raise the question of whether anyone other than the mums who featured in the 'Ministry of Food' programme benefited from Jamie Oliver's intervention) they do conclude that the episode \"moved the debate on from a focus upon individual responsibility and blame, to the beginnings of a discussion of t he wider cultural, social and economic contexts in which people buy, prepare and eat food\" (ibid.: 410). The episode moved the debate on, but did not close it; it smoulders in other contexts, such as cooking from scratch, and families eating together , while in other places it burns with a full flame, such as in discourses around food banks (see most notably Fabian Society 2015 also discussed in the next section). A recent study based on interviews with food back users finds people in similar circumstances to those in Rotherham (as Oliver says \" This is fucking Britain, this is fucking 2008. I've been to Soweto, I' ve seen AIDS orphans eat better than that \" - in Fox and Smith 2011: 410), and their comments echo both with those at Rawmarsh, but also those in the three day healthy eating trial in Scotland, reported above. One food bank user, Naomi, comments (Garthwaite et al. 2015:40): \"I try and do the best I can with what I've got like I say it costs so much to get the food that I need, and it's easy for a GP to say to me 'Well you're eating the wrong stuff', I haven't got the money.\" In the context of people with sufficiently low incomes to be eligible (and willing) to take emergency handouts, the authors conclude \" food choice is a concept no long er relevant to foodbank users.\" (ibid.: 43). In so saying, the authors point to anothe r version of the fault line between personal responsibility and social context which was cro ssed and re-crossed in the Rawmarsh story. There is a substantial part of the literature on f ood behaviours which talks about 'food choice' in unproblematic ways - whereas other researchers, often working qualitatively or ethnographically, cannot use the term comfortably, or at all. 'F ood choice' not merely assumes that what people eat is what they want to eat ('revealed preferences', to an economist), but that it is the result of a behavioural calculation: as such the phrase is found most often in private sector sources, and commercial market research. It sits well with th e concepts of consumer sovereignty, and of rational choice - it does not however work we ll for people whose consumption (here, their dietary intake) is selected from the donations of other people with greater choice over the food they buy, and who feel a duty to share it with others. While food choice, or the power to choose, is unevenly distributed, a look across the literature which uses the term uncritically is highly informative. When the public are asked (in market research) what the factors are in their purchasi ng choices, their top answers are (in slightly 18 varying orders and wordings) price, taste and quality. A clear example is provided by a TNS survey for the FSA, undertaken back in 2008 (FSA 2008). While similar questions are asked in various pla ces (see eg. Divine 2015), the 2008 version above is interesting because of the way it is asked (unprompted) and the way the answers are analysed: clustering the responses into categories, ec onomic considerations are far more commonly reported than health concerns, which in turn are more widespread than environmental issues (in any case, we may argue that 'free range' is more an ethical than an environmental concern, while it is notable that 'sustainability of food source' gets a few mentions - this may hint at what we now call food security issues). This general ranking is in line with the results to comparable questions in other surveys. For example, a 2013 survey commissioned by the food industry think tank IGD provided respondents with a pre-coded list of factors in fluencing their shopping choices, and similarly found that price and quality outstripped health co ncerns, with ethical considerations coming at the bottom of shoppers' priorities (IGD 2013). 19 Q. Rank your five most important considerations when shopping. Please think about the individual food and grocery products that you buy. Price 91% Promotions 68% Quality or performance 63% Taste or smell 53% Healthy option 49% Use by or sell by date 47% Familiarity 46% Brand 35% Ease of use 20% Ethical or eco-friendly 19% Taken at face value, the simple implications of such data for work on food futures include that the public does not tend to look beyond the pr ice and quality of food when making purchase decisions, and that, even if people were more aware of the environmental and global impacts of the food they eat, alternative options would need to satisfy price and quality criteria before people would consider making different 'choices '. Even on their own terms such data prove food behaviours to be complicated. In another variant on this question, asked in a special module of the British Social Attitudes survey for the FSA, respondents were provided with prompted options, but unlike in the IGD version above, they were allowed to pick as many as applied (FSA 2009a). It is notable that the mean number of answers selected was six. For marketers trying to match their products to these criteria, the task is challenging - even without allowing for variation between different types of shopper (see the section below for further discussion). Even within the discrete answering options offere d to respondents in questions like these, there are shades of meaning at work, such that the an swering categories may not be as stable as the survey writers would hope. If we take the example of 'quality', the second or third factor after price in the answers shown above, the IGD stud y complements its survey work with four focus groups, and finds that \" quality represents different things to di fferent shoppers and often denotes different environmental, ethical and nutrition credentials \" (IGD 2013). Quality is revealed to be a subjective bundle of issues, incorporating animal welfare concerns, farming methods, long shelflives, and country of origin. We may also note that some of the issues in this bundle appear as answering options in the survey question itself, further blu rring the categories. A recent economic choice experiment probed such distinctions further, and fo und that for those who can afford it, quality attributes are important, but that price tends to trump quality (Hussein et al. 2015). Within quality however are a range of considerations includ ing taste/flavour, texture, colour and shape. Similarly, a 2010 study on attitudes to functi onal foods across several European countries including the UK found that consumers tend to make judgements about whether food is 'good quality' based on four dimensions: taste (or ot her sensory measures, as in Hussein above), convenience, healthiness, and naturalness (Gru nert 2010). Clearly these criteria are more multifaceted, and subjective, than those asked about in the familiar survey questions. The conclusion however is similar, being that, in th e absence of cost considerations, few consumers are willing to compromise on taste. Questions like these - especially when asked qua ntitatively, through the medium of surveys - assume food purchasing to be the product of a rational choice. However, when we lift the lid on 20 this process, for instance, in qualitative resear ch, complications quickly appear. One objection is that people are forced to deliberate and give rational answers when asked in research about how or why they buy particular foods. In contrast, when people actually shop, it is apparent that they are not deliberating over their options as carefully as they are in research. To give one example, in a piece of conflicting quantitative data, 24% of UK respondents said they always check food purchases to see if they have quality labels, while 39% said they do this sometimes; 36% said they never check (incidentally, the highest proportion across all European countries - Eurobarometer 2012). A further reason why we should be circumspect about these questions on factors influencing food choices is that they are precise ly framed around the act of purchasing, rather than wider practices relating to dietary intake. There are a raft of influences on food behaviours which are known to be non-rational, and these also feature widely in the literature. An obv ious example would be the role of emotions, or affective factors - put simply, choosing with the heart not the head. The 'taste' option in the survey question above arguably conceals more subjective factors than the 'quality' option, and liking is recognised as a strong reason for eati ng particular foods (see the comments above about consumers not being prepared to sacrifice tas te). The affective dimension is particularly important in the context of heal thy eating, as it is commonly presented as the rational choice to eat healthily - as in the quotation from food bank user Naomi above. Nevertheless people, knowing this, still tend not to eat healthily to th e extent they should (eg. people continue to fall short of 'their' 5 a day - see eg. Bates et al. 2014) - although in Naomi's case this is because she has been 'priced out' of healthy eating. Heal thy eating is also a non-choice for many other people, especially if they find themselves in pa rticular circumstances; take for example a young woman in a recent qualitative study on the use of nutrition information labels (Wahlich et al. 2013: 209): \"If I am having a bad day and feel like eating some chocol ate, that is much more like ly to override any sort of common sense approach I might have to buying a healthy food.\" The study produced many similar testimonies from young women who clearly knew what healthy eating was - and often followed its precepts - but who deviated regularly from it, largely for emotional reasons (which they could then post-rationalise). As in the quotation above, it is clear that healthy eating can often be construe d as rational ('a commonsense approach') while decisions about what to eat are often not made rationally. It is notable that less healthy foods are often the ones which reveal the emotional component in people's decision making. A recent survey for th e fairtrade chocolate company Divine throws up some powerful examples of the role of emot ions in eating behaviour. Respondents were asked about their relationship with chocolate, and t hose who indicated that they 'love' it or 'really love it' were asked to write in (unprompted) what they love about it. Their responses echo the line of questioning by being largely emotional; at the extreme end, they are not just sensory but sensual, for example (Divine 2016: 27): \"The feeling of smooth love in my mouth\" Others are more multifaceted, and weave tog ether the rational, the contextual, and the emotional: \"I go through stages, sometimes I fancy something sweet. I lo ve the taste, the texture and the fact that it is my freedom of choice, knowing that it is bad for me but it is my choice to eat it with the money 21 I work hard to pay for it.\" This response seems closer to the sort of complex answer one might get in a qualitative interview. It recognises that different foods are consumed at different times for different reasons - and that some of those reasons are affecti ve. It is also notable that the whole response sits within a choice frame: having the 'freedom to choose', linked (tellingly, given the discussion above on the cost of healthy eating) with having earned the money, or right, to behave counter to taken-as-rational ways of eating. Finally, wh en taken together, there are many reasons here why the respondent shouldn't give up eating choc olate: presenting a challenge to those pushing for healthier diets, as well as those concerned about the security of future cocoa supplies (the context in which the Divine survey was undertaken). Looking through these respondents' eyes, less health y eating could be seen as perfectly rational, and certainly the norm, from which healthy eating is a new departure. This dynamic is what is emphatically revealed in the three day trial of a he althy diet, undertaken in the study in Scotland (Macdiarmid et al. 2013). The overwhelming res ponse from respondents was surprise, but in a good way (ibid.: 415): ''They were more normal foods than I expected. I kind of expected a bit more nut cutlet type things, but they were more normal.'' ''I honestly thought it would be like lettuce, tomato, cu cumber, all that sort of ty pes. I had potato salad and then I had coleslaw and a cheese roll I thought hmm that is a bit weird.\" While these quotations primarily attest to the un familiarity of respondents with the components of a healthy diet (as defined by government nutr itional guidelines), they also clearly position foods considered less healthy as 'normal'. This ro le reversal for foodstuffs further underlines the gap between 'normal' or lay, and 'expert' (or 'h ealthy' in nutritionist terms) perspectives. Borrowing from Bourdieu, it is clear that the re spondents expected the healthy diet to be close to the distinguished practices characterised by restra int which he associates with the ruling classes (\"sobriety for the sake of slimness\"). Also consistent with a 'Distinction' reading of this evidence, the one thing that respondents in the th ree day trial are most surprised about is that they do not feel hungry after the three days (\" It was quite weird actually cos I didn't feel hungry at all between them [meals]'' ibid.: 414). Interestingly, similar re sponses were reported in another Scottish study, entitled ''What, not just salad and ve g?', exploring the acceptability of government guidance relating to the Eatwell Week of men us (Leslie et al. 2014). There, respondents complained that there was no way they could find time for four meals a day (and no snacks), with some questioning why there appeared to be so many carbs (again, contradicting their notions of healthy diets). The universal sense of surprise in these studies underlines not only how unfamiliar healthy ways of eating are, but how routine and 'normal' less he althy repertoires are considered to be. Habit is a considerable influence on behaviour, and an import ant strand in the food behaviours literature. For example, habit is physiologically connected to liking through the 'familiarity effect': \" Food preference is an increasing function of exposure frequency: the more frequently a food has been tasted the better it is liked\" (Eertmans et al. 2001). More recent qualitative sources reviewed here also attest to the association of less healthy eating with habits and routines. For instance, in a study from Ireland on out of home eating by mothers and their children, one mother comments that \"99% of the time you know what everyone's going to eat before you even go there anyway\" (McGuffin et al. 2015: 105). Moreover, the 'there' that the mother refers to tends to be one of only two or three restaurants 22 which have been tried and tested, such that a moth er knows the meal will be a successful event, and the food will be eaten. One might consider this behaviour logical, although it doesn't conform to individualised models of rational choice. That study also neatly illustrates the social dyna mics around eating together (commensality, in conceptual terms). The food that ends up being eaten is the result of a collective choice, largely proscribed by what the children in the family are known to be willing to eat (ie. are familiar with). We may look back on the survey questions about factors informing purchase decisions and wonder how different the answers would be if the parents with children in the sample were asked to answer in their role as parent, rather than as 'consumer'. Some of the qualitative work reviewed here can help us speculate about how such a reframing would affect the responses. The out of home eating study from Ireland offers a number of examples, as does a further study from Scotland on people's reactions to the possibility of eating less meat (the 'Eating like there's no tomorrow' paper, by Macdiarmid et al. 2016: 491): \"It's not just me that's eating meat in my house. My husband's a bit of a 'it's not a meal unless it has meat in it'.\" That paper includes several examples of people discussing non-meat eating in terms of it being abnormal or weird. It echoes the same authors' th ree-day healthy eating trial study, in which one respondent spoke about being invited to a party du ring the period of the experiment, and feeling obliged to take things from the buffet in order to fit in - although she then did not actually eat them (Macdiarmid et al. 2013). In the same paper, the authors cite a study with school-aged children in Scotland in which the researchers conclude that healthy eating could be considered \"bad for young people's health\" because of the social and emoti onal downsides of deviating from acceptable norms of eating held by their peer grou ps (Stead et al. 2011, in ibid.). That conclusion is supported by a quotation from the study on out of home eating in Ireland (McGuffin et al. 2015: 105): \"Imagine if you never went to McDonalds and told t he child 'No you are never g oing to McDonalds' and then they go into school and say 'I 've never been to McDonalds.'\" This facet of people's eating practices takes us back fu ll circle to the analysis of eating as a social practice, and a way of expressing ourselves and knowing who we are (as identified with the work of Bourdieu, or Fischler). The meal event is a la rge area of enquiry in the social science literature on eating, as first disassembled and taxonomised by Mary Douglas, who broke down the 'daily meal' into its constituent parts (Douglas 1972). Indeed, the family meal as a subject of study has been endowed through research with almost ma gical qualities; for instance, Anne Murcott has followed in Douglas' footsteps by examining th e elements and techniques associated with the 'cooked' or 'proper' meal (as the public calls it), identifying the rules that must be adhered to make a cooked dinner 'proper' (Murcott 1982). Work in this tradition has been brought up to date by recent researchers, including in a paper which performs statistical analysis on a large dataset in an attempt to shed light on which bit of the family meal bestows its protective powers on children: in other words, explaining why child ren who eat 'family meals' report healthier diets than those who do so less often (Skafida 2013 ). While directions of causality are hard to establish in the dataset, it transpires that 'food choice' [sic] is the principal factor explaining the better outcomes: ie. the fact that children are eating the same food as their parents when they eat together means that they consume more healthy foods. 23 Meanwhile a recent secondary study comparing cu rrent eating practices in England and France has found that \" although considerable variation remains... it is premature to report the 'death of the family meal'\" (Gatley et al. 2014). Changes in meal occasions in England across the last fifty years are explored in depth in another paper, by Alan Wa rde and colleagues, who take a social practices approach in their analysis of meal occasions (Y ates and Warde 2015). To do this, they compare the findings from a bespoke diary-based survey of Tesco Clubcard holders with a large dataset (of 4,500 interviewees) gathered in 1955. The details of their analysis (including variations by subgroup) are fascinating; suffice to say here that they conclude that the same general three meal a day pattern pertains in the present day as in th e 1950s, but that there has been a simplification in the formats of each meal. Nowadays \" Breakfast has become a simple ev ent, centred on cereals and/or toasted bread, often accompanied by fruit \", and \" Lunch also is increasingly a simple affair, most involving small dishes, principally sandwiches, sometimes su pplemented with soup or a sweet item \" (ibid.: 307; indeed, they emphasise that the top five lunches recorded in their Clubcard survey are all sandwiches of different types). The evening meal is now the principal meal of the day (where lunch had been predominant in the 1950s) and is more elaborate in terms of dishes, time taken to prepare, to eat, and in terms of eating with others. Yates an d Warde put this shift in emphasis between lunch and dinner largely down to changes in working patterns - particularly among women - and the demise of the cooked lunch in the work canteen. It is informative to compare these patterns to t hose revealed (in rather less detail) in the recent study in Scotland exploring people's experien ce of following the draft Eatwell Week guidance (Leslie et al. 2014). Well aware that people's eating habits are shaped by their available time, the guidance was designed to include a quick breakfas t - although this element immediately proved challenging, as many participants tended to sk ip breakfast. Lunch guidance involved advice on buying appropriate shop-bought sa ndwiches - echoing Yates and Warde's survey findings above. Finally, dinner guidance was the most difficult to follow, despite it involving quick and easy recipes: most participants reported they tended to eat convenience foods, in the week. (Notably, the researchers underline that no respondent found the evening meals too difficult to cook: \" I felt like a gourmet chef \", said one female participant (ibid.: 4)). The value of adopting a social practices approach to understanding people's relationships with food is underlined in the studies highlighted here which concern eating patterns, with their emphasis on convenience foods. As well as re flecting socially-agreed rules for appropriate conduct, social practices are 'tempero-spati al arrangements', which means they happen at particular times in particular places - practices compete with other practices for time and space, and simply have to fit in. Throughout the recent literature, references are made to people being short of time, or tired out from busy days, to the point where they cannot be bothered to cook a 'proper' meal. Indeed, Kantar Worldpanel data from 2014 report that the time spent making the average meal has nearly halved over the last 20 years - from 60 minutes to 32 minutes (Fabian Society 2015). In his evidence to the Commission, Dale Southerton stated that that pattern can be observed relatively evenly across the income distribution. As a corollary of those changes in time use, the UK has become the home of the ready meal: Mintel data from 2010 show that UK consumpt ion of ready-meals was double that of France and six times more than Spain (reported in Jacks on & Viehoff, 2016). The authors of that paper neatly cite the marketing proposition of conven ience food as a 'meal solution', and it is instructive to contrast that with earlier concep tions of a 'proper' meal (as in Murcott 1982). Meanwhile, Alan Warde has described convenience food as \" tinged with moral disapprobation \" (Warde 1999: 518, cited in Jackson & Viehoff 2016). This is not the same 'moral panic' as swept 24 the nation in response to the Roth erham 'junk food mums', but it is more universally applicable, and suggests that for no one is food choice a free choice. 25 4. Publics not The Public Before proceeding any further, this review should pause to highlight the variations across different subgroups and segments of the UK pub lic that are apparent in the evidence base on food and eating. In one sense, this move is a reaction to the tendency in the literature to speak in terms of the public as a single entity. This is a not an unusua l occurrence, as quantitative data enable users to aggregate upwards to see responses across the wh ole dataset - and for ease and speed we look first at the total column, or the national picture. A second motive for inserting this pause is to act as a corrective to those qualitative sources which speak of a single public, paradoxically because their samples are too small for them to say anything with confidence about variation by subgroup. It is notable that the series of four dialogue studies under review (to varying extents) also tend to revert to a single 'public' when they report, presumably on account of their small samples (eg. Which? 2015 comprised 49 people), even though their participants were carefully selected to cover a wide range of subgroups in the population (GFS 2012b; Which? 2013; FSA 2014a; Which? on people's perceptions and pr actices in relation to food and eating is patterned with references to different places, gend ers and ages. Most of these are apparent in the qualitative evidence, and all these play a larg e part in determining food behaviours. This section briefly brings together highlights from the sources under review which demonstrate the wide variations in the perceptions and practices of different subgroups, divided according to 'standard' demographics, and other bespoke wa ys of clustering people into segments. In selecting what data to highlight here, emphasis ha s been placed on points that underline some of the larger differences between types of peopl e on particular dimensions - which argue for treating these groups distinctly in research designs, and wherever possible, in reporting. i) By Income There are no secure estimates of the number of people living in 'food poverty' in the UK. Indeed, one of the key recommendations from the Fabian Commission on Food and Poverty is that meaningful measures are established so the numbers of people living in these circumstances can be tracked (Fabian Society 2015). It should also be noted that the Fabian Commission talks of 'food and poverty', given the current instability of terms. They also prefer the term 'household food security' - which has the additional benefit of bringing the nati onal and global food security agendas closer together. In doing this, they build on the work of Liz Dowler, in defining household food security as \" 'the inability to acquire or consume an adequate qua lity or sufficient quantity of food in socially acceptable ways, or the uncertainty that one will be able to do so' (ibid.: 34). The definition captures both the material lack of access to good food, and the emotional and social losses caused as a result - including that poor people's food futures are especially uncertain (that in itself is a part of food and poverty). The most widely used estimate of the number of people in food and poverty is based on the number of occasions on which people in cris is were provided with food by the Trussell Trust food bank network: this has been stead ily growing from just under 129,000 occasions in 2011-12 to over 1 million occasions in 2014-15 (in Fabian Society 2015; Garratt Glass 2015). However, this is \" the tip of the iceberg \" according to the Commission, as these are emergency handouts, and the underlying levels of those living with food insecurity are a lot 26 higher (it is also noted that there are emotional and social barriers to coming forward and claiming the support from food banks even am ong those who are eligible - see eg. Purdam et al. 2015). A similar measure is derive d from those people who used the Fair Share scheme, which distributes surplus supermarket f ood via 720 charities and organizations to families and individuals in need. In 2013 they served roughly 62,200 people daily, equating to 1 million people per month (cited in Garratt Glass 2015; Wells & Carraher 2014). Other survey-based measures of wider food insecuri ty include that 16% of 522 GPs (surveyed by the practitioners' magazine Pulse in 2013) reported referring patients to foodbanks in the past 12 month, while research by parentin g website Netmums and the Trussell Trust in 2014 revealed that 56% of working families had bou ght cheaper, lower quality food, and 20% of parents had chosen between paying bills and bu ying food in the last 12 months (Garratt Glass 2015). However, in summarising these patchy data the author concludes that the \"prevalence [of household food in security] is typically quite low\" (ibid.: 1). Given their uncertain futures, even in the short term (hence 'living hand to mouth'), it is logical that people in food insecurity should look for the easiest ways to get calories at the lowest cost (one witness to the Fabian Commi ssion described people in this situation as \"true economists \" - Fabian Society 2015: 14). In an example which resonates with the work of Bourdieu described above, Wendy Wills in her evidence described how lower income households are more likely to prioritise \"getting fed\" while those with higher incomes prioritise family health, \" presentation and self-preservation\" (ibid.: 15). Another of the Commission's conclusions is that \" it is not realistic to expect large numbers of people in low-income households to change the way t hey acquire and cook food without a change to their environments \" (ibid.: 15). This chimes with the c onclusions of Fox and Smith, writing about the Rotherham 'junk food mums': obesity cannot be combatted by \" simply asking people to change their habits without understanding their habitus \" (meaning their styles of eating, which reflect their environments) (Fox & Smith 2011: 411). ii) By Age Ageing effects mean that as people grow olde r, so they change what they eat. 2014 data from the Understanding Society panel survey report that 17% of those in their sixties, and 19% of those aged 70 and over avoid certain foods for medical reasons (University of Essex 2014). Meanwhile data from the same sur vey suggest that the proportions of people reducing the amount of meat in their diet increa se with rising age; 7.4% of those in their sixties reported being 'partly vegetarian' - up from eg. 4.7% of those in their forties (ibid.). Ethnographic work from the 'Kitchen Life' study funded by the FSA suggests that older people may be at greater risk of infection from foodborne diseases including food poisoning (Wills et al. 2015). The authors conjecture that this may be because of deteriorating sensory capacity with increasing age (eg. such that it is harder to 'smell test' foods which may be going off). They also point to possible cohort effects, noting that older people grew up in a time of shorter supply chains - such that they ha ve more difficulty in navigating the current food system, with the concomitant risks to food safety. There is also a difference of opinion in the literature on older people's attitudes to food waste. The mainstream view is that, because they grew up with postwar rationing and an ethos of 'waste not, want not' they are much more assiduous than younger people in avoiding food waste. WRAP's analysis across multiple of their own surveys agrees that the pattern of older people producing less food wa ste holds true, but they point to measures suggesting they are no more concerned about food waste than other respondents (WRAP 2014). The authors speculate that their lower levels of food waste may in fact arise from their being more skilled in certain food-related behaviours (also citing cohort effects - eg. 27 taking a list, cooking with leftovers, serving appropriate portion sizes), whilst also stressing they tend to have more time to undertake these and other food practices than do younger people. In their analysis of the findings from the Br itish Social Attitudes survey from 2008, Natcen researchers note that across a number of measures older people were \"substantially more likely\" to be concerned about innovations in food technology than were younger respondents (FSA 2010). Reciprocally, across multiple sources, younger people (especially under 35) are shown to be less interested in food behaviours and less concerned about food science innovations. For instance, in an IGD survey on food technology, they were nearly twice as likely as average to say 'I have no interest in food science' - 34 % saying so, against 18% of the whole sample (IGD 2014). Similarly under 25s were the most likely age range to say during the horsemeat crisis that 'I am not really bothered about th e horsemeat issue' (28% saying so, against eg. (FSA 2013a). The WRAP 'People Focus' analysis shows that under 35s create the most food waste of any age range, especially plate waste (from serving more than they eat; older people are more likely to waste food by allowing it to go past its use by date) (WRAP 2 014). The authors put this down to the time pressures which youn ger people report themselves to be operating under. This picture is confirmed in many other sources, for instance, the study on salt practices and perceptions, in which the authors concluded that younger people lack time, interest, and (as mentioned above) cook ing skills (Kenten et al. 2013). Finally, according to Understanding Society, be ing 'completely vegetarian or vegan' peaks among the young then declines steadily with risi ng age: from 5.4% of under 30s, to 1.5% of over 60s (University of Essex 2014). iii) By Gender According to Understanding Society, one fifth of women report being on a diet to lose weight: 21.4% (which is nearly three times the prevalence among men). Women are also nearly three times more likely than men to report being 'completely vegetarian or vegan': 7.8% said so in 2014, against 2.6% of men (University of Essex 2014). It is reported that women are spending less ti me cooking, with particular evidence that cooking for 'special occasions' (which is when the most elaborate me als are prepared) is increasingly being handled by men (eg. Gatley et al . 2014). As in the earlier discussion, this attests to the time pressures on women and thei r increased role in the labour market (see eg. Yates & Warde 2015). Women tend to be more concerned abou t innovative food technologies than men (according to the BSA 2008 analysis cited a bove - FSA 2010), as well as more concerned about food scares (eg. 19% were 'not really bot hered about the horsemeat issue' at the time of the crisis in early 2013, as opposed to 25 % of men - FSA 2013a). There are suggestions that they put greater store in the 'naturalness' of food (see eg. the salt study - Kenten et al. 2013). iv) Households with Children Having children in the household appears to be a defining characteristic in the evidence base. We have already seen, in a study on ou t of home eating, how what children will accept often determines what food is bought or eaten (McGuffin et al. 2015). A detailed qualitative study involving depth interviews with pairs of mothers and children reveals even more complex dynamics which vary from family to family (O'Connell & Brannen 2013). In some 28 households children are in control, in others pa rents dictate intake, while in others there is an ongoing negotiation (tacitly or explicitly). It is noted that diets are least healthy in households where children are in control. Continuing the patterns among women, res pondents in households with children were shown to be more concerned about food technolog y, and to give a higher priority to healthy eating, based on analysis of BSA 2008 (FSA 2010). They also claim to be interested in food labels at higher than average levels: 47% of parents of under 5s were 'very interested', against 32% of all respondents (IGD 2014). However, these quantitative data can be thrown into doubt by qualitative evidence also gathered by IGD which suggests that parents shopping when accompanied by small children are \" time-pressured, and focused on getting the shopping done quickly \" (IGD 2013). A further strand of evidence to support the time-pressed circumstances of parents with young children comes from the WRAP 'People Focus' analysis, which shows that households with children do indeed produce more food waste than other households (WRAP 2014). While their analysis is not conclusive, it tends to support the view in the wider literature that this is partly a result of children refusing to eat some of the food they are served (resulting in higher levels of plate waste). The particular influence of being in a house hold with children is also apparent in less expected sources, such as the survey on the Future of Chocolate (Divine 2016). There, respondents from households with children wer e much more likely than average to select fairtrade as one of the 'most important' factors in their purchasing choices from a list of prompted options (19% rated it 'most important ', against 12% of those without children). Meanwhile, respondents from households with children were also much more likely to report 'very frequent' chocolate eating (59% vs. 45% of households without children). v) By Ethnicity The Understanding Society 2014 Innovation Panel data include a simple sub-classification into white and non-white respondents. It is notable that 14.8% of the non-white respondents said they avoid certain foods on religious grounds (less than 1% of white respondents reported doing so). These data al most certainly overlap with responses to the question of vegetarianism: non-white respondents are three times as likely to report being 'completely vegetarian or vegan' as ar e white respondents (7.9% vs. 2.3%). Quantitative data cut by faith are not plentifu l in the sources gathered for this review. A notable exception is the Ipsos MORI 12 co untry survey on meat and dairy perceptions, undertaken for Chatham House (Ipsos MORI 2014a) - while largely reflects the characteristics of the global sample including India. It is notable that in this survey 7% of the UK sample reported that 'I do not normally eat meat and do not want to eat this in future'; this was the second highest proporti on of any country in the survey except India (32% of whose respondents chose this response). Finally, it is noted that the majority of blac k and minority ethnic (BME) respondents in the GFS 2012 survey agreed with the statement ' I am confident that our government will take the necessary steps to make sure ther e is enough food in the future ': 53% of BMEs agreed, where only 32% of white respondents did (meaning more wh ite respondents disagreed than agreed with the statement) (FSA 2012a). vi) By Segment It is widely observed that 'standard' demographi cs such as those highlighted in this section do not predict food attitudes and behaviours with equal levels of accuracy. In mind of these 29 limitations, some organisations go on to divide the public into like segments based on those attitudes and behaviours themselves (or the clos est predictors of those outcomes). They often do this in order to make their work in engagi ng with (and 'targeting') these publics more efficient. Of a number of segmentations included in the sources gathered for this review (see eg. National Geographic 2014; Verain et al. 2015), two ar e highlighted here and it is instructive to sketch out their contours, to see how the charac teristics described above come together in distinct sets of people and lifestyles. Again, th ey may provide useful bases for drawing together samples of the public for future research studies in relation to food: 1. IGD Sustainability Shopper Segments (IGD 2013) The following segmentation was developed from a small round of focus groups undertaken by IGD in 2013. Accordingly it is not quantified, nor could it be replicated statistically in future studies. It comprises four segments, described as follows: i) Mainstreamers Pragmatic, driven by and concerned about food quality but readily make quality/price trade-offs Reactive - respond only to prominent issues and scares Largely accept the food choices presented to them Most concerns are latent, only half developed ii) Nutrition Savvy Driven by their own and their children's health needs Self-considered experts in health and nutrition which is reflected in their strong beliefs and decision drivers Think in 'quasi-scientific' way about conten t of food - calories, fats, carbohydrates etc. iii) Ethical Foodie Driven by love of food: flavour, eating, cooking experience Strongly focused on food quality issues, seeking high quality ingredients Pragmatic, realistic rather than idealistic about food production iv) Ultra Ethical Serious about food issues, and are political Consider a wide range of ethical, environm ental and nutritional issues - tend to put environmental/ethical issues ahead of nutritional ones Wary of commercially-driven food producers and supermarkets 2. FSA Consumer Segmentation (FSA 2015b) The FSA segmentation was developed by the Communications team at the Food Standards Agency, and is a fully replicable quantitative model. It is derived from cluster analysis of the Food and You dataset (Wave 3, 2014), which was then fused with the IPA 'Touchpoints' lifestyle database. As a result it contains a wealth of information on each segment, including media consumption, preferred brands, and time use, as well as the core data on food safety- related attitudes and behaviours from the Food and You survey. The segments are derived from 7 core attitudinal questions and 14 reported hygiene behaviours all asked in Food and You, resulting in 8 segments which can be pl otted against those two dimensions, as follows: 30 Although the segments were created in the context of food safety behaviours, they may prove to have value (eg. explanatory power) in other food-related settings. Their potential transferability is enhanced by the breadth of lifestyle data which has been appended to each cluster - although it should be noted that there is an inevitable degree of approximation in undertaking a process of fusion in this way. The resulting segments can be described in many dimensions, though they have been na med after the most representative type of respondent in each cluster (despite women being in the majority in all segments, half have been named after men). In order to show a few of the key differences between segments, a summary table has been created below, for the purposes of this review. 31 [Name] [Size in Population] Worried Average Age 28 60 40 36 43 30 36 46 Average Income \u00a327k 53% 80% - 88% 21% 78% 47% I don't have time to spend preparing and cooking food (agree) 18% 18% - 25% 9% 23% - 33% Top indexing statement I've eaten fast food in the last seven days 31% I don't normally eat between meals 44% I regard myself as a connoisseur of food and wine 22% Eat pink sausages or burgers 62% I regard myself as a connoisseur o f food and wine 24% I've eaten food past its use-by- date more in the last six months due to financial reasons 53% Nutritional information is important when I'm deciding where to eat out 37% I'm not generally interested in food and cooking 37% 32 5. Priorities for Change This review so far has established that people's aw areness of global food security issues is very low, and they have little sense of a deepening crisis in the food system. The review has gone on to show how most people's relationship with f ood is proximal (ie. based on that which they come into close contact with) and immediate - not considering the global or anything beyond the short-term. As the review moves on in the next sections to sketch out the elements of possible food futures, we must keep in mind that the question of what changes the public wants or anticipates is largely a hypothetical one; they are living in and focussed on the present. Apart from the series of four dialogue exercises, th ere is little direct evidence on the public's view of the different food futures that may come about. Instead we need to extrapolate from the wider set of sources whose evidence bears on these questions. In essence, options for change in the food system can be grouped under three headings: changes on the demand side (ie. in consumer behaviour) , changes on the supply side (eg. from producers and retailers), and changes to the system as a w hole - as collaborative action is required if we are to address the challenges of food security eff ectively (see eg. Wellesley et al. 2015; Fabian Society 2015). i) The Food System When the concept of the food system is presen ted to members of the public in dialogue exercises, their first response is surprise. This has already been clearly demonstrated in participants' reactions to the eight 'stand-out pieces of information' used as stimulus in the second of the Which? dialogue programmes ( Which? 2015). Respondents suddenly became aware of what they didn't know about the f ood system; one commented that it was an \" eye opener \" while another remarked on the breadt h of related information presented: \"...it's just everything\" (ibid.: 20). When this evidence was reviewed in the earlier section on the public and food future, it underlined the lack of awareness of the pressing challenges on the food system. Here we might go further and argue that, if the pu blic is not aware there is a food system, there is not much chance of them understanding that it is in crisis. In the citizens forums held to support development of the FSA Strategy 2015-20, convened in early 2014, there was spontaneous discussion of fo od scares such as the horsemeat episode in early 2013 (FSA 2014a). After discussion about authenticity and oversigh t of the supply chain, the conversation moved on to wider issues of food production. The researchers report a similar sense of surprise among participants as we have seen in other studies when discussion moved up a level of scale beyond people's immediate relation ship with the food they eat. Here surprise was experienced as a sense of unease, as participants faced \" the uncomfortable truth... that they have very little knowledge of the journey their food has taken prior to consumption \" (ibid.: 26). Accordingly, the researchers describe the public's perception of the food system as a 'black box' within which production occurs - with little more insight bey ond that. The positive effect of the horsemeat episode was to shed light on the black box - an ef fect also noted in the Which? dialogue of 2015. There, the response to the emerging sense of comp lexity of the system was to associate it with opportunities for fraudulent practices by food businesses (Which? 2015). In the Which? 2015 dialogue the researchers descri be participants' view of the food system as \"very opaque \", which they derive from participants' se nse of food supply chains having become very long and increasingly complex in terms of the number of between the site of production 33 and the point of purchase. Together these gave rise to their feeling that they had become \"distant \" from where there food was produced. Sp arked by this new sense of awareness of stretched and many-stranded supply chains, the researchers implemented a quiz to establish how well participants knew the food system: just over half of participants scored between 0 and 3 out of 10. Researchers in the FSA 2014 forums also picked up on participants' sense of the opacity and complexity of supply chains and production processes (FSA 2014: 13). In that study participants talked about how this sense of di stance was heightened by an awareness of the increasing use of technology in production processe s. Participants expressed a strong feeling that food should be natural, and that this was being compromised by the shift to food production on a global scale. The researchers conclude that, having discussed the issue, the public's view was that current production methods are \" unnatural, mechanised and alien \" (ibid.: 14). These shifts in production practices are associated by the public with the role of 'big business' (eg. Which? 2015). It is widely assumed that production has been moved around the world in order to find the biggest profit margins, and th at technology has been deployed to cut costs. People assume that these practices, being unnatural, in some way pose a threat to public health, and so sometimes respond by calling for more st ate intervention to over see practices all along the supply chain (FSA 2014a). It is notable that 'big business' also includes the retailers, and the supermarkets in particular attract substantial criticism for the negative influence they are perceived to have back up the supply chain ( Which? 2015). Above all it appears to be multinational manufacturers who are most held accountable for changes in the supply chain: making it both longer and more mechanised. Quantitative data to support these views from public dialogues are provided by the Divine 'Future of Chocolate' survey, in which a representative sample of the UK public were asked a question about ownership models for chocolate companies (Divine being fairly traded and part-owned by the farmers' co-operative who grow the cocoa) (Divine 2016). Respondents were prompted with five different ways in which chocolate companies are run, and asked to rank which they would prefer to buy from. The most popular option was 'A company that pays coco a farmers enough to invest in their farms', and the least was 'a company that is owned by a global corporation' (with a mean score of 1.53, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 5 was the top option). It is interesting that the Divine survey then includes a subsequent bank of questions asking people which of a selection of chocolate bars they regularly eat, before asking them which of these they think are fairtrade certified, and wh ich are owned by multinationals (a previous question had stated that over 70% of the chocolate sold in the UK is produced by three multinational companies). Respondents' answers to the ownership question were fairly accurate for the most popular bars, the majority answerin g correctly that KitKat, Galaxy and Cadbury's Dairy Milk were owned by multinationals; there were then a suite of brands owned by multinationals which only a minority of responden ts identified as such (including Toblerone, Milka, and Green & Black's - all owned by Mond elez). The question provides an interesting indication of the patchy knowledge among the public of the ownership arrangements behind popular food brands - although it also highlig hts the fact that in many cases (like Green & Black's) these arrangements are genuinely opaque. The sense that the public struggle to see throug h products to the production processes behind them is further illustrated in the first of the seri es of dialogue exercises, where the case of a KitKat was used as stimulus for a prompted di scussion (GFS 2012b). (It is noteworthy that chocolate again provides the ex ample - first because cocoa is one of the foodstuffs most threatened by global shortages, and second because it is deemed by professionals to be a quick way to engage lay audiences: almost an ad mission that healthy foods are not deemed so 34 mainstream). The KitKat example demonstrates bo th the diversity of ingredients within the bar, and the range of countries and continents they are sourced from. Participants' reactions' are in line with findings already reviewed here, including the Divine data above: first they were \"surprised \" at the range of ingredients, and then at the distances they had travelled. The shock was heighted as they still regarded KitKat as a \" quintessentially British brand \", despite the fact Nestle had bought Rowntree's many years ago (ibid.: 16). That dialogue exercise reports that participants felt \"a particular unease around the long distances food and drink were transported\" , and that this was the initial way that they made sense of the links between food and environment which they had been made aware of (ibid.: 14). While a number of the dialogue exercises talk metaphorically of the 'distance' perceived between participants and food production, for many people this is also a literal problem. Given most people's lack of understanding of the complexity of the food system - in short, its systemness - they tend to look for more linear associations, like a single responsib le entity to blame (usually 'big business'), and in this case a clear source of environmental impa cts. The longstanding discourse around food miles - though now superseded in professional circle s - is still prevalent in public understanding, and it features in all of the dialogue exer cises, from GFS in 2012 to Which? in 2015. Quantitative data support this sens e that the public prefer 'local' food to 'global': for instance, a recent Eurobarometer survey found that 38% of UK respondents reported buying local and seasonal food 'whenever possible' (compared to an EU average of 36%) (Eurobarometer 2014). It is telling that this response comes to a quest ion which asks which actions people are personally undertaking to reduce the impacts of climate change - thus reinforcing the link between food miles and environmental impacts (and notably omitting any other high-emitting aspect of the food system, such as waste and losses, or meat production). This finding is echoed qualitatively in the citizens forums for the FSA Strategy 20 15-20: first, environmental impacts were not deemed a priority topic by participants, but were kept on the agenda by the researchers. Then, when they were raised, the top solution to minimise the impacts raised by respondents was that the government should intervene to ensure reta ilers only stocked foods produced locally (FSA 2014a): \"If there was a supermarket which said that all our meat and all our vegetables came from the local areas of Yorkshire, minimum transportation, I would buy from there' (Leeds, ABC1, Wave 2) However, while the evidence presented here was ge nerated in response to researchers prompting about environmental impacts, for many of the public local food seems to deliver several benefits, and it may not be that tackling climate change is the uppermost. In fact the IGD focus groups in 2013 found that local was used as a proxy, or informal indicator, for quality - and that view is supported by a three-country analysis of consum er preferences for locally sourced lamb, in which local is equated by consumers with fresh (Font I Furnols et al. 2011). In the IGD study, local also means British, and another of the aspects of local food which the UK public values is the potential to support farmers and the UK ec onomy more widely (IGD 2013). In the three- country study on lamb, this tendency is found among each nation's consumers, and is labelled as 'ethnocentrism', a kind of informal protectionism practised by the lay public, and bracketed among ethical shopping measures. It may be helpful to consider these findings in the light of other evidence from the dialogues that people's relationship with food tends to be \" immediate \" and close to the point of purchase (GFS 2012b). Indeed we can conjecture that, with thei r adherence to the concept of food miles and 35 their conviction that buying local is the socially correct course of action - on multiple grounds - that people are attempting to shorten the supply ch ains that have evolved in food production, and to cling to more linear understandings of food production, and a more transparent relationship with the food they eat. This ma y help explain their response when they are confronted in research with the fact that there is a food system. Then when the 'black box' is opened, it can be \" overwhelming \" (GFS 2012b). ii) Demand Side Change In the absence of public awareness of the food system, and hence the need for system change, public priorities for change tend to fall into di screte categories: supply side (eg. new methods to produce more food more efficiently), or demand side (ie. behaviour change by consumers themselves). When this choice becomes apparent in dialogue exercises, people tend to choose demand side measures over changes in production. For instance, in the second round of workshops in the Which? 2015 dialogue exercise, pa rticipants were asked to consider a range of possible 'solutions' to the food system challeng es and they consistently chose the low tech over the high tech - largely to avoid causing any more 'unnaturalness' in production methods. This was particularly the case in a choice between eating less meat, and eating lab-grown meat (Which? 2015). However, these kinds of difficult choices tend only to be presented to the public in the context of dialogue exercises about food futures, and even then only at the end of the engagement process, hence we cannot regard the findings as prima facie evidence of public perceptions, in the same way we might the findings from a conv entional qualitative study. There is as much research evidence that the public would be unwilling to change its food behaviours - and sometimes that contradictory evidence exists in the same study. For example, the Which? 2015 dialogue also finds participants expressing \"considerable cynicism \" that the wider public will change its food behaviours (ibid.: 30). Quantitative data from a representati ve survey support the case that people will tend to resist calls to change their food behaviours. The global Greendex survey included a question about people's intentions 'to change their behaviour in future for environmental reasons' (National Geographic 2014). Despite the potentially leading nature of the question, fewer than half of British responden ts (46%) said they intended to make changes to their behaviour: and this was the lowest proportion in any of the 18 countries surveyed. Given this resistance to change, it is remarkab le that the Which? 2015 dialogue closes with evidence from its follow-up interviews two m onths post-intervention that the majority of participants have reported changing some of th eir food behaviours - and having kept those changes up. Of the 20 participants who were re-contacted, 17 reported having changed their behaviours since the dialogue, with the most common changes being eating less meat, wasting less food, and buying locally produced food ( Which? 2015). On the face of it, this is a remarkable finding, which suggests that effortful pu blic engagement can be effective in triggering lasting behaviour change. Yet we should approach these data with caution, given the small number of respondents in the original sample (4 9), and the self-selecting nature of the subsample (of 20) who responded to the re-contact interviews . We might also recall that some of these behaviours - like eating less meat - are relative ly common in the wider population: for instance, 40% of people in their sixties report having redu ced the amount of meat they have eaten in the last 12 months (Understanding Society 2014) - such that there may be 'attribution effects' at work among the Which? recontact respondents. Aside from such methodological observations, a questioning response to the finding of self-r eported behaviour change at two months post- workshops is that such intensive interventions are not scaleable, or potentially inclusive, enough 36 to effect change across the whole population. Leaving that aside, it is also notable that the dialogue process has clearly transformed the part icipants, to the point where they are able to express considerable cynicism about the potential for behaviour change among the wider public, which they are apparently now less a part of. The Which? 2015 dialogue participants may provide proof that, with increasing familiarity with issues around food security, behaviour change can result - and from this we can infer there is at least potential for similar change in the wider public . It is interesting to note the behaviours that the participants report having changed, as it is likely these are the most appropriate for population-level behaviour change in the context of food futures. We have already reviewed evidence suggesting that many of the public are already buying local 'always' - or trying to (Eurobarometer 2014). We have also seen that people can identify multiple reasons for wanting to do so (IGD 2013). When it comes to reducing food waste, this also appears to be a behaviour which is widely held to be desirable, if not actually normative. In the report on the Which? 2013 dialogue, a few items of omnibus survey data are included, one of which asks about the behaviours most associated with the environmental impacts of food (Which? 2013). Food waste is equal first, associated with environmental impacts by 71% of respondents ('pollution from pesticides' is the other top option) - and it is not able that food miles come next, associated with environmental impacts by 64%. Turning to the dial ogue element of the study, it is stated that some participants reported already having taken steps to reduce their food waste before the dialogue began, ostensibly to save money, given the rising price of food. Then again, when respondents were asked at the end of the sec ond day of workshops whether they intended to change their behaviours, a similar set of respons es came back to those behaviours reported as actually changed by the 2015 participants: eating less meat (and more fruit and vegetables), and wasting less food. One participant commented (ibid.: 31): \"I will buy less. I don't need half of what I bu y but because it's on special I do... and waste it.\" (Glasgow) Turning to the behaviour change most reported by dialogue participants, eating less meat, it is worth noting first that there is growing momentum in the climate change literature that this is a behaviour which is not just desirable but required. For instance, we have already heard about the scenario modelling which has established that de mand side reductions are required - as well as supply-side intensification - if we are to live within the two degree limit for global warming agreed at the COP 21 meeting in Paris (Bajzelj et al. 2014). Reducing meat consumption - especially red meat consumption - is seen as the most direct way of achieving this cut in demand-side emissions, because of the resource intensity of livestock farming, especially red meat and dairy (see eg. Wellesley et al. 2015). Fu rther statistical modelling of impacts, this time based on the relative intensity of different styles of diet based on varying amounts of meat, has established that widespread reductions in meat consumption across the meat-eating public could reduce impacts more than trying to convert smaller numbers of the public into non-meat-eating vegans and vegetarians (Scarborough et al. 2014). Indeed the authors of that study provide the compelling statistic that moving from a 'high meat diet' (100+ grams per day) to a 'low meat diet' (less than 50 grams per day) would reduce an individual's carbon footprint by 920kg CO2e every year - which is roughly equivalent to one ec onomy return flight from London to New York (960kg CO2e). (Were two high meat eaters to become vegetarians, that would generate an emissions saving roughly equivalent to taking a small family car off the road for one year.) The strategy of asking people to reduce the amount of meat they eat, rather than stop eating meat altogether, has also been found to be more enga ging, in a study with the Dutch public (De Boer et al. 2014). 37 Findings from the dialogues reviewed here would cer tainly support that expert contention. It is notable that in the most recent of the dialogues, Which? 2015, several participants not only reported having reduced their own consumption of meat through the dialogue process, but that they felt this was the most feasible way of redu cing the impact of meat production - and without any 'unnatural' innovations to production method s (Which 2015?: 36). For many participants eating less meat felt achievable as they had al ready reduced their red meat consumption over the last few years - usually for health reasons. The researchers conclude: \"Change was possible: \"We are going to start buying Quorn beef as well, because of the cows and the effect it's got on the planet. I'm not going to turn veggie or anything, but I'll just eat less meat.'' (Paisley, Female) But not for all: \"I have my doubts about it. Personal preference. I li ke eating meat. It's good for you. We're programmed carnivores.\" (Paisley, Male)\" The enthusiasm of many participants (shared in pl aces by the researchers) is punctured by the blunt refusal to join in from this male respondent. This interruption allows us to turn to the rest of the ever-increasing body of evidence relating to public perceptions of eating less meat, and note that the vast majority of this literature presents the countervailing case: that most people are unwilling to reduce how much meat they eat. A seminal example is provided in the 'Eating like there's no tomorrow' paper, cited in the early sections of this review (Macdiarmid et al. 2016); indeed, the title of that paper continues '...Pub lic awareness of the environmental impact of food and reluctance to eat le ss meat as part of a sustainable diet'. Among the many unenthusiastic respondents is a man from Scotland who sounds a little like the dialogue participant from Paisley quoted above (ibid.: 491): \"I probably won't eat less meat. I'm aware of the environmen t, I take other steps, fine I do my bit, recycling, driving less but I probably wo uldn't change my diet.\" This respondent is typical of others in the st udy, and the impression that the majority view is against eating less meat is supported by quantitat ive data gathered in the MORI 8-country survey for Chatham House (Ipsos MORI 2014). In one question, respondents are presented with a list of actions which they might undertake 'in order to limit their contribution to climate change', and asked how likely or unlikely they would be to make these changes in the following year. Given the option 'Eating less meat, or replacing the meat in some meals with alternatives such as beans', 14% of UK respondents say they are doin g this already, and another 27% say they are likely to do this in the next year - which is a substantial proportion. However, more than half (54%) say they are unlikely to do this in the next year, and the only other option which is less popular is eating fewer dairy products: 68% of people are unlikely to do this. In considering these particular findings, we should note that the question somewhat gives the game away, by telling respondents that the actions listed contribute to reducing climate change impacts. If anything, we might assume that would ca use respondents to feel more inclined to say they intend to undertake some of the behaviours li sted. Either way, it gives people information which other evidence suggests they do not have. The 'Eating like there's no tomorrow' study has already been cited to show the public's la ck of awareness of the link between food and environmental impacts; the paper is clear that this is particularly the case in the context of eating meat. One male respondent makes the link to health impacts, but otherwise the researchers draw a blank (Macdiarmid 2016: 490): 38 \"Too much red meat, yes, I think has probably been out, we probably all known that well for several years now [related to health], but I've never actually linked it to an environmental issue.\" Again, quantitative data support this finding; for instance, the recent 'Future of Chocolate' survey re-used a battery of attitude statements first asked in the Greendex 18 country survey in 2014 (Divine 2016; National Geographic 2014). On e item asks for agreement with the statement 'Eating meat is bad for the environment'; in the Divine sample from 2015, 20% of UK respondents agree with the statement and 50% disagree (the most popular option is 'strongly disagree', chosen by 28% of respondents - by c ontrast only 7% agree strongly). Given this widespread lack of awareness bordering on denial, it is likely that the Which? dialogue exercise needed to lead with this type of information early on, and give respondents time to assimilate it, before producing the enthusiastic response to th e potential for eating less meat at population level. It should be remembered of course that ther e are many reasons for potentially reducing the amount of meat in one's diet - and that environmen t appears near the foot of the list, if at all, even for those who are already doing it (see eg. Wh ich? 2015). There are also many reasons for not reducing meat, several of which are articu lated in the 'Eating like there's no tomorrow' paper. These reasons will be familiar to those who have read the 'Food Present' section above, and its reflections on food non/choice. The reasons listed in that paper include taste, pleasure, and social influences. We might also add the dialogue participant's objection above about it being healthy and natural (\" we're programmed carnivores \"). These kinds of objection are familiar to researchers in this area and have recently b een brought together in a typology called the 4Ns (Piazza et al. 2015). This typology takes the earlie r '3Ns of Justification' (Joy 2010), that eating meat is... Natural Normal Necessary And adds one further N based on a new set of interviews, that it is... Nice The paper is clear that these are post-rationalisations, the kinds of things people say when asked to deliberate about their food behaviours. Yet these four dimensions occur repeatedly in the 'food choice' literature (and not just in relation to meat eating). All of these resonate with the discussion of the evidence on food futures above, and one could be tempted to go further than these researchers in arguing that meat is central to identity, to the point where not eating meat threatens to sever a person from his sense of who he is. Claude Fischler writes in this mode, not about meat per se, when he notes that we are what we eat (literally, as we 'incorporate' the substances that we swallow) such that eating different things would make us other than who we are (Fischler 1988). Meanwhile Bourdieu makes si milar points about identity but this time very much about meat, and very much in relation to being a man. Men are identified as \" natural meat eaters\" (Bourdieu 1977: 192): \"Meat is the dish for men, the nourishing food par excellence, strong and strong making... the dish for men, who take a second helping.\" 39 We may like to observe that many of the 'unwillin g to change' verbatims cited here come from male respondents. We may also like to recall one woman in the 'Eating like there's no tomorrow' study, whose was cited in the 'Food Pr esent' section above, sa ying (Macdiarmid et al. 2016: 491): \"It's not just me that's eating meat in my house. My husband's a bit of a 'it's not a meal unless it has meat in it'.\" That she observes the social patterns of eating in her household makes this response a good example of the 'Normal' N (to deviate from meat eating could create a rift in their marriage), but it is also notable that her husband's meat eating has an identity and a name all its own: he is \"a 'it's not a meal unless it has meat in it'\". Despite these substantial obstacles and objections , people do reduce their meat eating, and not just when they have taken part in intensive deliber ative research exercises. It has already been noted that among older people there is a clear tendency to reduce meat intake across the lifecourse - indeed we could argue it is part of the identity of becoming an older person. According to a new analysis of the British Social Attitudes 2014 dataset, by Natcen for the Vegetarian Society, 29% of the public reduced th e amount of meat they ate across the previous year (Lee & Simpson 2016). Notabl y these proportions increased stea dily with rising age, from 19% of 18 to 25s to 39% of 69 to 79s (before falling back slightly to 35% of the 80 and overs). YouGov data commissioned by the Eating Better c onsortium in 2014 show a slightly different shape to the age trend: overall 20% of people reported eating less meat than a year ago - though in answer to the same question asked in 2013, the figure was 25% (a difference which Sue Dibb of Eating Better explains with reference to th e horsemeat issue, which occurred in early 2013 and noticeably resulted in reduced sales of meat and meat products - see Dibb & Fitzpatrick 2014). In the 2014 data, meat reducing 'since last year' also increases up the age range (from 12% of 25 to 29s to 28% of 60 and overs) but it is also above average among the under 25s (22%) - which suggests that there may be a groundswell towards meat reducing which is not simply related to the effects of ageing (Eating Better 2014). Further support for such a contention comes from another question in the same survey, which asks people directly whether they would be willing 'to eat less meat and fewer meat products in the future'. 35% of the whole sample say they are willing, and again the proportions increase up th e age range, but 29% of under 25s report being willing, as do 39% of 60 and overs. Notably 41% of women are willing to do so, as opposed to 30% of men. Finally we should note that while 35% of the whole sample are willing to eat less meat in future, 29% say they are unwilling: nearly (but not quite) an even split. Reducing is one thing, but giving up meat altog ether is another, as the experts have observed (eg. Schosler et al. 2012; Scarborough et al. 2014; De Boer et al. 2014; Verain et al. 2015). Many surveys reviewed here collect data on how many pe ople are vegetarian or vegan (often in an initial section about 'special dietary requirements', along with eg. allergies, see eg. FSA 2014b). Most of these surveys ask the question in diffe rent ways, some including being 'partially vegetarian' which others term 'flexitarian'; some also include being 'pescitarian' (eg. FSA 2013a). One simple measure is provided in the 8-co untry MORI survey for Chatham House (Ipsos MORI 2014): asked how they feel about the amount of meat they eat in a normal month, 7% of the sample replied 'I do not normally eat meat '. Meanwhile the YouGov survey for Eating Better reported that in 2014, 6% of respondents sa id 'I do not eat any meat or meat products' (when asked whether they had eaten more or less than a year ago). Notably female respondents (8%) and people under 25 (11%) were the most likely subgroups to report this (Eating Better 40 2014). Finally, a special module of dietary pra ctices was asked to the Innovation Panel in Wave 4 of the Understanding Society study reported that 2.7% of respondents were 'completely vegetarian or vegan', and another 5.4% were 'partl y vegetarian' (University of Essex 2014). As with the Eating Better data, women were much more likely than men (4% vs 1.3%) to be 'completely vegetarian or vegan', while 16 to 29 year olds were the most likely age range to be 'completely vegetarian or vegan': 5.4% reported be ing so. The data also show a smooth decline up the age range - the inverse of the pattern for being partially vegetarian (which we can associate with meat reducing, and thus ageing effects). Reflecting on the differences between some of these percentages, we can observe that survey methodology plays a large part - but related to this we can note that questions which ask 'how much meat' (more/less/any) seem to generate a higher proportion of non-meat eating responses than those than questions which directly invite pe ople to tick a 'vegetarian/vegan' box. In view of the other evidence gathered here, we might specu late that explicitly claiming the identity of a 'vegetarian/vegan' is socially challenging, as it deviates from normal standards of less than healthy eating, and the possibility of eating a 'p roper' cooked meal with meat and two veg. Across many sections of the public, to say you are a 'vegetarian' or 'vegan' is to admit to being abnormal or 'weird'. Notwithstanding what the labels currently signif y, given that young people appear to be much more likely than average to be (and, to admit to be) vegetarian or vegan than other age groups, there is the potential for those patterns to pertai n as they move up the age range, resulting in a normalising of vegetarianism. It is certainly notab le that support for action to reduce meat eating across the population is also strongest in this ag e range. In a question which almost seems like a parody of the public dialogue process, A YouGov omnibus survey in November 2015 asked the following (YouGov 2015): 'A report suggests th e livestock industry produces about 15% of global greenhouse gases, roughly equivalent to all the exhaust emissions of every car, train, ship and aircraft on the planet. Would you support or oppose government intervention to reduce meat consumption in our diets? In response, 33% of respondents supported intervent ion, but 49% opposed it. It is notable that support decreases, and opposition increases, with ri sing age. 18 to 25s ar e the only age range in which more respondents overall support (38%) than oppose (35%) intervention - although 27% also indicate 'Don't Know'. Only among the 60 and overs does the majority overall oppose intervention (56%). In conclusion, while expert opinion is clear on the need to eat less meat, the citizens' jury (as we might say) is out. iii) Supply Side Change In the context of this review of public perceptions and practices in relation to food futures, the question to address about changes to the food system on the supply side is initially one of public acceptability. Put simply, the food industry develops the innovations and makes the changes, and the role of the public is to accept - or rej ect - them. But the actual process of adoption will be more nuanced: for the new technologies to be effective, they will not only need to be accepted but adopted, and applied in appropriate ways which ensure they deliver the designed-for benefits. This realisation is consistent wi th the discussion about 'food present' and 'food choice' above: if we take a practices approach to understanding change, then adoption of new technologies is about fitting them into everyday life, as 'socio-technical arrangements' (see eg. 41 Geels et al. 2008). If this is to be successful there will need to be negotiation on both the social and the technological sides, and ultimately an accommodation between the two - for a successful example, we could think about the 'good fit' represented by convenience foods (Jackson & Viehoff 2016). The obvious alternative to reducing demand is in creasing supply. When the need for change in food systems is made clear in public dialogue ex ercises, participants seem quickly to appreciate these two broad options (eg. GFS 2012b). When pr ompted in quantitative surveys, the public is also quick to endorse the case for producing more food - especially when the question is asked in the context of population growth. Thus in the early TNS survey for GFS, the vast majority of respondents (85%) agreed that 'to meet the ne eds of a growing population we will need to both grow more food and reduce the amount of food we buy and waste', and half of these respondents agreed strongly (52%) (GFS 2012a). Similarly in a Eurobarometer survey also in 2012, the vast majority of UK respondents (8 3%) agreed that the EU should 'help other countries to produce more food'. A similar propor tion of respondents (86%) agreed that the EU should 'produce more food to reduce its dependence on imports' (Eurobarometer 2012). However neither of these surveys made clear the level of resource inputs required to increase production, or the change in land use require d to produce sufficient extra food - and when people are told about this in dialogues, their re sponse (as to so many 'futures' challenges) is surprise (GFS 2012b). The real challenge, as iden tified by the expert modellers, is to increase production without increasing (or while actually decreasing) current levels of inputs (see eg. Bajzelj et al. 2014). Notwithstanding the widespread ignorance of production methods and their resource intensity, when in public dialogues people become aware of the food security challenge, and identify the need to produce more, then they immediately assume this will involve more technologi cal innovation. In the first GFS dialogue, for example, an \"immediate association \" was made between producing more food and introducing more food technology (GFS 2012b: 15). In turn, \" food technologies were often viewed as synonymous with intensive farming practices \". Similar reactions are also reported in subsequent dialogues (FSA 2014a; Which? 2015). What happens after that is interesting: as in the first GFS dialogue, there is a difference of opinion, with people's responses broadly dividing along two lines, what the researchers call a 'Promethean view' (held by \" those believing in the ability of science and technology to transform nature and help overcome scarcity through innovation \") and a 'Precautionary view' (held by \" those concerned about the health, environmental and social impacts of such technologies, seeing their use as part of a wider dynamic of large agri-businesses dominating food production with potentially unforeseen consequences \") (GFS 2012b: 20). It is worth remarking in passing that the Promethean view was more common among participants in rural locations, and the Precau tionary view more common among the urban. A comprehensive review of food technologies co mmissioned by the FSA from Brook Lyndhurst in 2009 concluded that \"the overall tone of public attitudes towards novel food technologies is one of wariness, unease, uncertainty, and sometimes outright negativity\" (FSA 2009b: 11). The authors also suggested this is in part inherent in public responses to food technologies, almost regardless of the technology, citing the example of tinned food, which was regard ed with suspicion for years after it was first introduced (Young 2003 in ibid.). Coming up to date, it appears concerns about food technologies in general may have relaxed somewhat, but caution is still strong. For instance, in 2013 IGD asked a survey question with a numb er of attitude statements which they had previously asked in 2007 (IGD 2014). The bigge st group of respondents (63%) agreed that 'Science has a role to play in producing food but we need to apply it with caution', and this was up from just under half (47%) in 2007. Mean while the numbers choosing the other two 'polar' statements had fallen: in 2013, 16% agreed 'Food should be entirely natural and scientists 42 shouldn't be involved in producing food' (down from 21%), and 12% agreed 'I am confident in the way that science is used by food companies an d I trust in scientists to improve the way that food is produced (down from 16%). Summarising the shift over time, and the position at the time in 2013, we might say that the UK public has become less negative, less supportive, but more uncertain about the role of new technology in food production. This pattern is borne out across responses to specific food technologies (see below): most people lack knowledge and feel uncertain, resulting in a consistently large pr oportion of 'Don't Knows' and 'Neither/Nors'. There is a substantial literature on risk perceptions and much of that relates to food. Some of it follows a behavioural economic tradition, based on ways of understanding decision making under uncertainty (see eg. Slovic 2000). Put simply this explores what happens when people are asked to make choices about things of which th ey do not have sufficient knowledge to anticipate the possible outcomes of their choice with an y degree of certainty. The general economic 'default' process for decision making is to set perc eived costs versus benefits, or in the context of uncertainty, risks versus benefits. Thus across the literature on public acceptance of food technologies we find studies which analyse the calc ulations that people make about the potential benefits from different technologies. For example, a recent paper on non/acceptance of Genetically Modified (GM) foods writes of the ne ed for benefits to be communicated as clearly as risks: \" Why take a risk when there is no percei ved benefit to be gained in so doing?\" (McWilliams 2014: 116). It is also noted, again in the context of GM foods, that benefits to the self count more strongly in the calculation than benefits to othe r (and the main perceived benefit of GM foods is that they can help 'feed the planet') (see eg. FSA 2009b). It is also widely noted that the lay public don't tend to follow the precise calculation process as identified by experts and modellers of various stripes. Instead of using objective information, they draw on personal experience, or in economic terms reach for \" intuitive and experience-based estimates of the risk rather than probabilistic estimates\" (Strachan et al. 2011: 8). One implication of this is that policymakers need to account for the public's less rational processes in trying to anticipate how they will respond to particular new technologies (ibid.). The classic formula for calculating risk perceptions is based on a combination of susceptibility and severity: do people think they will be affected s hould the ill effects arise, and if they are, how bad will the effects be (see eg. Slovic op. cit.). Risks can cause concern on both grounds. In the context of emerging technologies, susceptibility is ev en more unknown than for existing risks, so a construct called 'technological risk' is often substituted in to the calculation (Fischoff et al. 1978). Another way of phrasing the calculation is as a combination of concern and control (with the former roughly relating to severity, and the latter susceptibility); these methods are used in one particular study under review, a modelling exer cise based on large-scale survey data (Erdem & Rigby 2013). The method adopted is 'Best Worst Scaling', in which participants are presented with different combinations of 4 items (from a longer list) and asked to choose the best and worst. This simple technique generates extensive data on respondents' preferences which can then be ranked, and analysed using regression tech niques, so each risk can be positioned in a 'control/worry space' (ie. a matrix). As one ex ample of a result, a house fire is ranked as a greater concern than a heart attack, and this can be explained by it falling into the high control, high worry space (whereas a heart attack is percei ved as much less under an individual's control). It is instructive to look at the ranking resulting from this exercise, which includes a number of food safety risks and novel technologies (ibid.: 17 38). [Note that the table shows mean index scores from analysis using a multinomial logit re gression model; also, that the data on which the analysis is based were collected from c.400 UK respondents in 2009.] 43 [risk] [MNL score] Additives 9.92 Fire at home 8.49 Salmonella 7.30 Mobile phones 7.15 GM 6.67 Being run over 6.57 Depression 6.07 E. coli 5.72 Being burgled 4.68 3.59 Food allergy 2.66 Swine flu 2.48 Climate change 1.70 Struck by lightning 1.30 The researchers reach a number of conclusions ba sed on the results of their analysis. Some of those most pertinent to food futures research include the obvious point that food safety risks (eg. of foodborne infection) cause a lot more conc ern than novel food technologies. This can be explained in part by people's lack of contact with or experience of nov el technologies as against eg. food poisoning. Climate change is the classi c example of a remote and uncertain risk, and as such is calculated to be nearly trivial, appearin g toward the bottom of the list (just above 'struck by lightning'). Risks involving pathogens, the re searchers note, tend to elicit more concern - partly because people feel they should be able to control for them. Meanwhile those food risks with which people have had time to become fam iliar elicit more concern than those that are newer: the example here being E Coli, which the authors note was well known by the time of the survey, whereas Swine flu, which was current at th e time, had yet to be fully assimilated into the public's risk repertoire and so was of less con cern. Finally, the researchers comment that the findings on GM foods are \" quite remarkable \", then go on to speculate that it too has passed the stage of being novel, such that the public feels it is less uncertain (but see below for a fuller discussion on GMOs). In ranking the likely acceptability of different f ood technologies, a number of other scales or heuristics (rules of thumb) are featured in th e sources under review. One such heuristic applied to biotechnology risks is the 'Hierarchy of A cceptability' which finds that biotechnologies cause more concern when applied to organisms higher up the 'tree of life' than when applied at the bottom: for example, applying technologies to microorganisms causes little concern, but applications involving the 'higher' animals an d humans are much less acceptable (eg. Gaskell 2000 in FSA 2009b). A less formalised, but e qually apparent rule of thumb is that based on 'naturalness', whereby technologies that relate to the processing or end use of foods are more acceptable than those which alter its chemical composition. A simple example of such a scale can be found in a paper on the acceptability of responses to campylobacter in chickens (MacRitchie et al. 2014). On-far m hygiene measures are the most widely acceptable, ahead of 44 interventions like steaming, freezing, or vaccination s, which are all preferable to irradiation, and last of all, a chemical wash. The scale of relati ve naturalness seems to be applied by the public time and again across the evidence reviewed here: as in dialogue participants' overall preference for demand side changes, rather than hi -technology interventions (Which? 2015). This informal scale of naturalness has been used to organise the section immediately below, in which highlights from the evidence on public re actions to specific novel food technologies and practices is presented. Thus the section begins with the most acceptable (and natural) - functional foods - and runs through to the leas t acceptable - synthetic meat. Nanotechnology, and personalised nutrition (based on genomics) ar e addressed at the end, not because they are widely unacceptable, but because they are th e newest and least well-evidenced technologies: public responses could yet go either way. Fi nally, GMOs appear as a coda, their extensive literature and longer heritage warranting particular consideration. There is only a limited amount of evidence on some of these technologies, and much of it has been generated through the recent series of public dialogues. Dedicated re views have appeared recently in some of these areas, though they often remark on how little secu re evidence there is of public reactions to some of the newer technologies (see eg. Frewer et al. 2014, on nanotechnologies). There is the ever-present danger of research leading the public, and manufacturing opinion where opinion would not otherwise exist - we should start from the position that most food technologies are of low salience for most of the public (see eg. FSA 2009b ). Note also that recency is critical in this space, as technologies develop quickly, and public responses also evolve. Functional Foods Functional foods are an emerging category and th is adds to their sense of ambiguity. The 2009 Brook Lyndhurst review observed that th ere was little evidence about UK public perceptions available (at least not in the pu blic domain) (FSA 2009b). Work since then points to functional foods being a hybrid category, with benefits positioned on the boundary between healthiness and naturalness (Eden 2011). In this sense they are compared to organic foods (a category to which, in terms of market size, they were comparable at the time) but with a greater use of technology, whereas organic foregrounds natural and unprocessed benefits. Technically, functional foods are also an ambiguous category; some are more natural than others, such that 'plant food supplements' (inc. evening primrose, St John's wort, and ginseng) overlap with 'herbal medical products' - and in different countries the line is drawn differently between them (G arcia Alvarez et al. 2014). Public perceptions similarly need to be judged on a case by case basis (eg. Grunert et al. 2010), with rules of thumb including the level of benefit provided, and the 'carrier' foodstuff involved (staple and healthy foods are the 'carriers' regarded most positively eg. added fibre in brown bread - see FSA 2012b). However, across all cases it is reported that women tend to be more positive than men (whereas on most other food technolog ies, women tend to express more concern - see eg. ibid.). Further light is shed by a paper on probiotics, which describes them as \" on the fringes of healthy eating \" and having health benefits \" beyond nutrition \" - consumption is the result as much of buying into a healthy lifestyl e as seeking specific physical benefits (Koteyko 2010). 'MSP' Meat In the Which? 2015 dialogue, mechanically sepa rated poultry (MSP) meat was deemed more appropriate than other meat-related technolog ies (most obviously lab-grown - see below) (Which? 2015). It was seen as reasonably natural, as the processing did not alter the composition of the meat; respondents acknowle dged they probably also ate it already in 45 other products - although those other products were processed and so tended to be seen as less than ideal in themselves. The downsides were as much about how the processing was explained and the food labelled, otherwise the technology would increase the perceived 'opacity' of the food system (see ibid.: 37): \"The only issue we had there was, great to put a whole ch icken though a blender if you wanted to, as long as you're telling the consumer that's what you're doing. Insects This review opened by noting that the public 's spontaneous discussions of future foods (as evidenced by social media) revolved around eating insects, and that the topic was commonly trivialised and expressed simply in terms of 'yuck factor' (OLR 2014). Eating insects is an innovative practice, rather than a novel technology; it tends to fare better in public dialogues than it does on say Facebook, and in the Which ? 2015 exercise it met with a relatively positive reception, respondents noting that ea ting insects was common in other countries, some of which countries had healthier diets than our own - thus it could be said to be 'natural' if not 'normal' here (Piazza et al. 20 15). In the Which? dialogue, participants were also relatively positive about the idea of using insects as animal feed - eg for chickens, which again was deemed acceptable as it was \" fairly natural for chickens to eat flies \" (Which? 2015: 37). Discussions became more complicated when the process of feeding the insects on waste products was introduced, with some participants worrying that chickens would end up indirectly being fed on their own wastes. Irradiation The 2009 review notes that there was little ev idence available on UK public attitudes to irradiation, although it is also suggested to be an area characterised by low knowledge and misunderstanding (FSA 2009b). It is menti oned for example that one in three consumers deem food labels signalling irradiation as 'w arning labels' (He et al. 2005 in ibid.). The participants in the Which? 2015 dialogue tended to be very cautious of irradiation, which was deemed unnatural, and immediately a threat to health (radiation being a threat to health, so ingesting food which had been irradiated could al so be a threat to health). Direct benefits were apparent, for instance in extending the 'she lflife' of bread (which is a prominent food waste concern in the research evidence - see eg. Which? 2013); however the 2009 review reports evidence that irradiating vegetables tends to be more acceptable than irradiating beef (by the 'Hierarchy of Acceptability' principle discussed above - see FSA 2009b). It is notable that the 2015 discussion moved participants from outright rejection to the more considered position that they would be unlik ely to buy irradiated foods. Plant Biotechnology For participants in the Which? 2015 dialog ue, biotechnological interventions were deemed inappropriate on grounds of unnaturalness - al beit they were seen as relatively less inappropriate than biotechnology used in meat pr oduction. Some participants made the link to selective breeding processes, and used it to argue that traditional farming processes were not entirely natural in any case. In a sense plant biotechnology was seen as the thin end of the wedge in the use of technology in in dustrialised supply chains, as one woman commented (Which? 2015: 44): \"We just thought that it's unnatural and the problem behind that is prob ably deep rooted trust issues with things that we've been exposed to such as mad cow disease, horsemeat, tobacco. It's only taken till recent years to admit that it's harmful to us.\" 46 The time dimension is important to note here: the less acceptable (more unnatural) technologies sparked concerns about the unknow able potential for negative consequences over time: what another participant called a \" Pandora's Box \" effect. It was also the case that the benefits were less clear than the risks - or specifically, the benefits to consumers, as it was presumed that innovative biotechnological applications were being pushed through by big businesses in the interests of maximising profits. Animal Biotechnology and Cloning Objections in the Which? 2015 dialogue to the use of biotechnology in meat production were akin to those in plants, but turned up a couple of notches. Thus it was dismissed outright, on grounds of \" messing with nature \", and as being pursued by big businesses in the interests of profit (Which? 2015: 44). Ha ving engaged in two sessions of discussion, respondents also could not see the need for biotechnological solutions, as they were enthusiastic about simply eating less meat. One participant pointed out that the animals would need to be fed in any case, whatever their genetic make-up. It is interesting to note that, as one of the dialogues was held in Pa isley close to where Dolly the Sheep had been cloned, participants there felt reasonably well informed; however this did not increase their levels of acceptability of the technology, as they were aware that Dolly had gone on to develop health complications. By contrast th e 2009 review found that awareness of cloning was very high (due not least to Dolly) but that understanding was very low - views were \"semi-formed \" but very negative (FSA 2009b: 30). Synthetic Biology and Lab-grown Meat The 2009 review for FSA could find no sources relating to public reactions to the use of synthetic biology in foods - instead they had to extrapolate from other contexts (FSA 2009b). A much more recent study explores perceptions of 'synthetic meat' with the UK public but again finds very little knowledge - suc h that the study became a shared exercise in discussion and 'sense making' (Marcu et al. 2015). In the Which? 2015 dialogue, participants reacted in a similar vein to that for cloning , only more strongly, for example (ibid.: 38): \"There's lots of environmental pros for it. But we were looking at the wee mad scientist in the laboratory, experimenting with things. It 's an unnatural process and we're not used to that.\" Again, the point was raised that the technol ogy was being driven by the profit impetus among big businesses, and that it would be much more straightforward for consumers to reduce the amount of meat they ate. Ho wever, the Which? team note that the public reaction was not made any more positive by the stimulus material for this part of the dialogue featuring a picture of a steak in a petri dish - they note that how novel technologies are presented will have a strong influence on public reactions. Nanotechnology Like synthetic meat, there was little evidence available on nanotech applications in food at the time of the 2009 review, and none of that related to acceptability among the UK public (FSA 2009b). However the wider literatur e on public perceptions of nanotechnology suggests that acceptability may be higher fo r 'nano-on-the-outside' applications (eg. packaging) compared to 'nano-on-the-inside' (eg. food composition). The review authors quote a comment that \" public opinion on nanotechnology is in t he early stages of the issue cycle and -as a result- still very much in flux \" (Lee et al. 2005 in ibid.: 26). The picture has been brought up to date by a dedicated meta-review in 2014 (Fr ewer et al. 2014), but only to the extent of reaffirming the lack of evidence, and the consensus view in what literature there is that public understanding is very low. The authors also note the risk of generating erroneous responses 47 by prompting the public with attitudinal quest ions, and argue that expert-lay dialogue is urgently needed: \" As long as consumer attitudes towards na notechnology remain largely uncrystallised, constant re-evaluation of what the consumer thinks is required \" (ibid.: 106). A more recent study, conducted with staff in agri-food businesses in Ireland, comes to a similar conclusion, but in a more instrumental way (Handford et al. 2015). The authors note that, despite low levels of knowledge, the public has developed negative views of nanotech (as high risk, unnatural, and unethical) and they have done so by basing th eir attitudes on previous high profile issues like GM and horsemeat. They conclude that public engagement will be vital to counteract these misperceptions. Personalised Nutrition Advice Personalised nutrition advice should perhaps not appear at the end of this mini-review of technologies as it does not seem to be the le ast acceptable; however, like nanotech, it is the newest and as such most open to both interpreta tion and misinterpretation. The drawback to personalised nutrition advice is that, in the current context, it refers to bespoke advice which is derived from gene analysis of the consumer in question. Technically it can involve two technologies: nutrigenomics (which explor es the effect of specific nutrients on gene expression) and nutrigenetics (which explores the effect that genetic variation has on the interaction between nutrients and disease) (see Falla ize et al. 2013). In research with people who already have genetically-derived medical conditions, there are early signs that the technology will be accepted (ibid.). These pe ople are subject to regular medical tests and 'screening' so personalised nutrition advice co uld be seen as a bolt-on to that process; however serious (if hypothetical) concerns ar e expressed about data protection (see also Poinhos et al. 2014). A further study by a similar group of authors explores a potential tension in the roll-out of this technology, and whether it should sit within the NHS or not (Fallaize et al. 2015). The conclusion reached in the paper is that NHS doctors and practitioners could make the initial referral to the private sector provider - as paying for the advice was found to increase the chance of people adhering to it. GM foods Finally, it is important to consider the issue of GM foods, which have the longest heritage of the technologies reviewed here, and the largest li terature. GM is thus taken as something of a test case in terms of the journey towards (or away from) public acceptability - although for many, it has cast a long negative shadow over public perceptions of all food technologies (see eg. Handford et al. 2015 on nanotech, discussed above). We have already noted Erdem and Rigby's surpris e at the relatively low concern score given to GM on their table of 'best-worst' risks (Erd em & Rigby 2011). They seek to explain the ranking by suggesting that the initial uncertainty feeding the previously higher levels of public concern may have worn off over the ten or so years of controversy (their data having been collected in 2009). They also speculate that the food price rises which were occurring in 2009 may have provided a different context in which the benefits of GM for increasing production yields were more valued. Either way, their view that this relatively high level of acceptability was \" quite remarkable \" is grounded in the long hi story of antagonism between two sides on the issue of GM (ibid.: 1742). It is notable that that antagonism is still apparent in the current literature on GM, albeit in the views of expert stakeholders not the public. Thus, on the one hand we have advocates writing papers about 'Turning the GM Battleship' (McWilliams 2014) and on the other we have opp onents writing books about 'The Fight for the Future of Food' (Guthman 2011) - the idiom is one of a battle, still raging at the extremes. 48 The wider public's position is less entrenched, and appears to have relaxed in much the way that Erdem and Rigby's 'best-worst' risk an alysis suggests. A bespoke study commissioned by the FSA from Natcen in 2009 (the same ye ar as the 'best-worst' data were gathered) found that opposition had lessened in the ten years since they first started public polling on GM foods: fewer people were ag ainst, and more of them had moved into the uncertain middle ground. Nonetheless, the proportion of 'a ntis' (31%) was still nearly double that of 'pros' (17%) - but the biggest group was in th e middle (39%) (FSA 2009a). As one candid respondent commented (ibid.:22): \"I don't really know anything about it so there's no p oint in me trying to put a point over on it because I really don't know why they'd be doing it.\" A further report for the FSA analysed responses to the 2008 British Social Attitudes survey, and revealed a similar pattern of minority views at the poles, and the majority sat in the uncertain middle ground (FSA 2010). For exam ple, in response to one question, 18% of respondents agreed that the advantages of GM foods outweighed any dangers, whilst 31% disagreed; leaving the majority (51%) in the middle or not knowing. The Natcen authors described the distribution of public opinion as \" a position of moderate support and general ambivalence \", but could not predict which way the neutral middle would be likely to move in future (ibid.: 103). If we fast forward to current surveys, the answer seems to be that little has changed since 2008/09. In a pair of questions ask by IGD in 2014 on the willingness of consumers to buy GM lower fat crisps, 33% of respondents indica ted they were neither more or less likely to buy these than ordinary crisps (IGD 2014). However, 37% were more likely, and 30% less likely, and the researchers make the point th at how the technology and its benefits are presented is critical. Also, in the 18-coun try Greendex study from 2014, respondents are asked to signal their level of agreement with the statement 'I Don't Mind GMOs in Food If It Helps Farmers Produce More and/or Keeps Prices Down' (National Geographic 2014). British respondents are the second most likely (aft er India) to agree with the statement, but it is notable that disagreement st ill exceeds agreement - 28% agree, but 42% disagree - and that still in 2014 - still - 30% neither ag ree nor disagree, or don't know. One of the implications of the l ong-running GM debate for efforts to engage the public in future is that the public needs to be brought into the discussions early, and given a sense of ownership. Continuing low knowledge correlates with indiffere nce at best, and opting out from the public conversation at worst. One of the fault-lines that still drives polarised views (especially among expert stakeholders) is over the balance of po wer, or ownership over, the technology. Thus on the one hand advocates can look on the indifference or neutrality of large groups of the public as an opportunity for engagement with the specific aim of winning them over: \" to tell the truth about biotechnology's potential \" (McWilliams 2014: 117). Meanwhile th e other side of the debate, led on this occasion by the NGO sector, observes that GM technologies have been rolled out from the top down, with no evidence of demand from th e public as end users (eg. Guthman 2011). Labelling of GM foods is mobilised in this de bate: in the EU, where GM foods were labelled, they remain on balance unacceptable to the wider public (although, interestingly, the largest group remain uncertain either way), while in th e States where there was no labelling, acceptance has been higher (ibid.). It is telling that advocates of the technology like McWilliams are now calling for a counter-labelling campaign: \" the documented ambivalence over GM crops among a significant proportion of the population, in addit ion to what seems to be an encourag ing predisposition toward acceptance, suggests that the time is quite ripe for a carefully considered labeling campaign \" (McWilliams 2014: 124). This is unlikely to disturb GM's opponents in the EU. 49 Another key influence on public engagement has been the media - and it may be worth speculating that public opposition has weakened in this country, and ambivalence increased, as GM issues have become less prominent in the media since 2009 (and certainly 1999). The Natcen report from 2009 is clear that public reactions to GM foods were conditioned by the then recent and high profile food scares, both around salmonella and BSE (FSA 2009a). Now we find researchers on new technologies like nanot ech saying similar things about GM (eg. Handford et al. 2015). It is clear that the media has a big role to play in shaping public opinion. A pair of recent studies undertaken with stakeholde rs working in the media find that they have a key influence on how the public makes risk perception calculations (Henderson et al. 2014). When interviewed, the media staff reported that they play two main roles in the context of food 'incidents': one is as a conduit or intermediary, passing information \" between the public and the relevant authorities \" - the example of a product recall is given (Wilson et al. 2014: 4). The other role is as \" public watchdog \", which involves them investigat ing and revealing facts which the 'authorities' might rather conceal. Neutral obser vers might also suggest that they play a third role, which we might call 'firestarter': fanning th e flames of a story such that an 'incident' becomes a 'scare'. This pattern also seems applicable in non-critical food 'incidents' such as the Rotherham 'junk food mums' episode described above, where media activity escalated the story to a case of 'moral panic' (see Fox & Smith 2011). This pattern is also apparent in evidence relating to the recent horsemeat issue - also not exactly a new technology scare so much as a crisis of authenticity and traceability in supply chains (with a dose of fraud thrown in food good measure). The issue was circulating in the US in late 2012 but it was only when FSA inspectors in Ireland found traces of horse DNA in other meat products in early January 2013 that the story be gan to emerge. It was not until February that product recalls happened in UK supermarkets, and the story became prominent in the UK press (see eg. FSA 2013b). As one of the media st akeholders interviewed in the studies above comments: \" if an issue does not exist in the media, then it is not really an issue for decision makers and the larger public \" (Wilson et al. 2014: 1). We may also like to recall the point made by Erdem & Rigby in their 'best-worst' risk study in the context of swine flu: it did not regi ster highly for public concern as it was a new story at the time the sur vey was undertaken (in contrast to E Coli, where public concern had become well established). There is clearly a time-lag effect at work in turning food issues into food scares, and then in those f ood scares influencing public risk perceptions - of that issue, and potentially of related technologie s. In the context of horsemeat, meat product sales data can help to show the actual effects of food scares over time; the following chart from the Kantar Worldpanel shows UK frozen processe d food sales data across the 12 months from mid-2012 to mid-2013 (Kantar 2013). The time lag between the first incidents of horsemeat contamination and the drop in sales is clear. 50 What is also clear is the bounce-back in sales of frozen processed products as the story begins to fade from view. By the summer of 2013, burger s are back in the UK public's shopping baskets and on their barbeques. Amidst all the noise of media debate and public perceptions data, people's eating habits appear to be remarkably resistant to change - whether on the supply or the demand side. 51 6. Trust and Governance The fall and rise of frozen burger sales across th e period of the horsemeat issue could be used as a proxy measure for levels of trust among UK c onsumers in the authenticity of processed meat products - although the relationship between trust an d sales levels is also tied up with product recalls and the removal of processed meat products from supermarket shelves. In this instance, we could either read the crisis as a brief inte rruption of public trust in a system which is otherwise resilient, or conversely, as a mark of the resistance of people's food practices to changes in circumstance. Both views are represen ted in the evidence on the UK public's trust in the food system, which can be characterised in two ways: i) A low trust system In this model, we live in a 'risk society' characterised by fears and threats concealed beneath surface-level order (see eg. Beck 1992). The UK public's relationship with the food system is experienced as a series of shocks and scares (s almonella, BSE, E Coli, the threat of swine flu, avian flu, the horsemeat issue - plus the GM debate rumbling on). Modernisation in the food supply chain has only served to distance the public from food production, and to increase the 'opacity' of the system (see eg. Which? 2015, FSA 2014). Taking our cue from Fischler, we are suffering a collective crisis of identity, because if we cannot be sure what we are eating, we cannot be sure who we are (Fis chler 1988). Meanwhile the dominant rhetoric is of consumer choice, with responsibility pushed onto individuals to achieve the outcomes deemed good for the whole. This 'low trust' model is consistent with Peter Jackson's research on people's relationships with food in an \"age of anxiety\" (Jackson 2010). ii) A high trust system Whatever the incidents, public trust in the saf ety of the UK food system remains consistently high. For instance, a TNS poll in 2012 found th at UK consumers were the least likely of the publics in 7 countries to agree that \" I am at risk of the food that I eat damaging my health \" - only 33% of UK respondents agreed (TNS 2013). The system as a whole is resilient, and incidents represent opportunities for consumers to take stock and re-negotiate their relationship with the system, evolving new sets of practices which further increase their safety. This model is applied in the literatur e in the context of a study on responses to the threat of Avian influenza (De Krom et al. 20 10) where confidence levels in the UK poultry incident were found to have remained high, even in the wake of bird flu cases in 2006-07. There are elements of truth in both models, such that they can both plausibly function in their own spaces in the literature. There are also othe r ways of understanding trust in food which take an institutional approach, focussing of models of governance and modes of consumption, which do not depend on tracking consumer views at a ll (see eg. Kjaernes et al 2007). However, when we turn to the research evidence from this review which touches on public levels of trust in the UK food system, and in the main actors across that system, it appears we are on balance closer to the low trust than the high trust model. Ea ch new incident, or novel technology, is shown to be viewed by the public through their experience of the last incident or scare (see eg. FSA 2009b; Handford et al. 2015; Which? 2015). Although overa ll levels of trust in our food being safe to eat tend to remain high, trust in system actors is a lot lower (as we shall explore below), and people remain reluctant or unwilling to en gage with a system which they see as \" very complex\" (FSA 2012b). Finally, there are signs that the public has bought into the idea of the consumer society with its doctrine of personal responsibility (eg. Which? 2015) - hence the moralising 52 about healthy eating, the guilt associated with less healthy diets, and the vilifying of those individuals who do not comply (eg. Macdia rmid et al. 2013; Fox and Smith 2011). In reviewing this evidence it is helpful to star t with the low sense of agency in relation to the food industry reported by people in response to re search questions - as many of their answers to other questions about who should do what may be seen in the light of their low confidence in their own ability to make change. Thus, in the Greendex 18-country survey we find only one third of UK respondents (34%) agreeing with the statement 'As a Consumer, I Can Influence the Types of Food Available Where I Shop' and 45% agreeing that 'Consumers Have Little Influence over How Food Is Produced' (Nationa l Geographic 2014). In qualitative evidence, these sentiments are explicitly linked with food scares such as BSE and horsemeat, which knock on into crises of confidence in the food system. Again, the increased application of technology along the supply chain is seen as having decrease d consumers' sense of agency to influence it (eg. Macdiarmid et al. 2016). The first of the GFS public dialogues explicit ly makes the link between the public's (new) awareness of the food system as a 'black box' and their subsequent reaction to ask someone else to take charge of it: \" issues framed in this way were seen as the responsibility of others - particularly governments and business. Participants wanted to kn ow whether and how governance was being coordinated\" (FSA 2012b: 25). Faced with a complex system of which they were previousl y unaware, it is an understandable response for people to try to push it away. This tendency is also apparent in the responses of some subgroups of the public who are consistently more likely to say they are not interested, eg. in food science (IGD 2014), or not bothered eg. about the horsemeat issue (eg. FSA 2013b). These respondents often tend to be the younger and more time-pressed, and there is little surprise that those who don't feel they have time to cook from scratch do not now want a role in designing the future of the food system. Starting from the perspective of a low-agency member of the public is helpful in explaining some of the contradictory responses that arise when th e role of different system actors is discussed with the public: some of the responses make mo re sense through the lens of 'anyone but me'. Thus public trust of industry actors all along the supply chain appears very low. First, the public does not tend to differentiate between these actors, for example by dividing them into stages in the food supply chain (producer, manufacturer, retailer). Hence in the first round of workshops in the Which? 2015 dialogue, participants simply talk about 'big business'; it is only later that they start to discriminate between different actors. When they do, it is the supermarkets who come in for the most criticism (we might speculate this is because the supermarket is the point at which they as consumers tend to come into contact with th e supply chain: it is notable that participants in the more rural workshops were more knowledgeable, and positive, about production processes eg. farming methods). We have also heard on numerous occasions how participants in the Which? 2015 dialogue assumed that the application of food technology is predominantly to increase the profits for 'big business' (eg. \" We're only doing this so the top cats can make lo ts of money. Ethically it's completely wrong\" - ibid.: 44 ). However, despite this mistrust in retailers, in the paper on trust in response to Avian flu, respondents argue that it is the retailers w ho should be ensuring the food that they provide is safe for people to eat, as once it is on the shelves it is too late for consumers to tell what's in it (the 'black box' metaphor is used again here - De Krom et al. 2010). In a further example of contradictory reactions to retailers, the IGD surv ey from 2013, 87% of re spondents agreed that they expect grocery companies to be 'constantly checking that their suppliers are providing healthy products and are acting responsibly towards the environment' (IGD 2013). However, a 53 further question suggests that for most respondents that is one way of pushing the responsibility away from themselves, even if it is on to a set of actors who they do not trust: 61% agreed that 'food and grocery companies should just get on with doing the right thing for the public's health and the environment, rather than telling them about it'. Further apparent contradictions surface in the pub lic's response to the role of experts. When confronted with the complexities of the food system during public dialogues (paradoxically, often via the input of expert witnesses and discussants) a common response is for participants to frame the situation as complex, and a problem for experts (eg. Which? 2015: 29): \"Why are they (experts) not all sitting ro und a table like this and discussing it. Why are they not doing something about it?'' However, when specific examples of technological approaches to food system challenges are raised, it is also common for the experts' judgme nt to be doubted. The 2009 review by Brook Lyndhurst presents examples of the public suspect ing that experts might get carried away by the potential of new technologies and overshoot eth ical boundaries (FSA 2009b). Meanwhile we have already encountered the verbatim from the Which? dialogue about \" the wee mad scientist in the laboratory, experimenting with things \" (Which? 2015: 38). Turning to public perceptions of government, a si milar set of dynamics and contradictions are at play. We have seen how, faced with the complexi ty of the food system, the standard response is to call for business and government to take grea ter control (eg. GFS 2012b). In answer to a prompted question in a quantitative survey in support of the FSA 2015-20 Strategy, respondents indicated that their top three priority responsibilities for government in relation to the food system were: food fraud & lack of authentici ty (among 61%), food technology (55%) and food safety & hygiene (53%) (FSA 2014c). Thus in th e citizens forums convened in support of the FSA Strategy 2015-20, the researchers report that \"Consumers fundamentally believed that the Government had a duty to help keep them safe, and also to protect their interests around food more widely.\" (FSA 2014a: 15). However, other dialogue exercises reveal strong negativity towards the government, largely because they were seen to be weak in the face of industry opposition, or worse (eg. Which? 2015: 30): \"I'm a total cynic when it comes to Government - if [a re tailer's] chairman is funding whatever Government is in they are going to let them carry on.\" However, one participant in the FSA Strategy fo rums provided a response that makes some sense of the apparent contradictions in people's relationship with government; the participants' comments neatly embody the passing of responsibility back and forth between state and individual (FSA 2014a: 25): \"Ordinary people's knowledge doesn't allow them an insight to what's really going on, so you really are depending on the government to do that for you -the people who do have the knowledge and are paid to do it. I think that ordinary people do have to place an enormous amount of trust in the government.\" Across the evidence from the various dialogues, th ere is the strong sense of people not wanting to take an active role in the shaping of the food system, and turning to government as the best bet, before demanding that it takes a stronger role. However, as with their grasp of the food system, or of 'big business', so their grasp of the workings of government is pretty weak. The 54 Which? 2015 dialogues are telling in this regard: fi rst participants say there would need to be safeguards in place to ensure that new food technologies are used appropriately to ensure global food security. These safeguards would need a bod y to oversee them, and participants are sure it would have to be independent of industry, because of the profit imperative that people believed was already driving the pace of innovation. Th e Which? team then asked who that independent body might be: \"When pressed for suggestions, participants thou ght that bodies like Wh ich? (an independent organisation) or the Food Standards Agency (which wa s not seen as Government) wo uld provide a non-partisan view\" (Which? 2015: 46). It is clear that, even in the context of a dialog ue exercise, it will take a lot of prompting from researchers to get a response to questions on matters of governance. Returning to the quantitative survey undertaken in preparation fo r the FSA Strategy 2015-20, when the question of government responsibilities for food was aske d with prompted responses, answers in the 60% range were achieved (FSA 2014c). When aske d spontaneously what issues respondents would like to see the Government take greater responsib ility for over the next 5-10 years, 64% gave no answer. (The researchers add \" food safety, cost (each 5%) and promotion of British food (4%) top the list, but the percentages are very low \" - ibid.: 17). When not \" pressed for suggestions \" the public is not forthcoming with answers for who should lead on questions of global food security. It is notab le that in the Which? 2013 report, it is the authors who call for a greater role for the FSA, fo r instance in joining up safety, nutrition, and food security (Which 2013?) - but no evidence from participants is cited to back up these calls. It remains an open question who should lead on advancing global food security issues, but it seems clear that the answer will not come from the public, or not without some prompting. 55 7. Implications - Engaging Publics Given the \" extremely low \" levels of awareness of global food security issues, and the sense of \"surprise \" among participants when the urgency of the challenges to the food system are opened up to them, it is small wonder that the public dialogue exercises end with public participants calling for awareness raising. Thus in the first of the dialogues, participants spoke of how they went home and spoke to friends and family and found that \"no one really knows about it or has thought about it\" (GFS 2012b: 26). Given that the exercise had been such an \"eye opener\" for them, they felt that future dialogues should have a \"core awareness raising component\" . Meanwhile in the most recent of the series of dialogues, part icipants reported how they had changed their own behaviour as a result of what they had learned through the dialogue experience (Which? 2015). Accordingly the participants advocated awareness rais ing activity at every turn, as the first step to enabling others to change their behaviour. Given the very low levels of basic knowledge a bout the food system, how it operates, its impacts on the environment, and the unavoidable need for change, it is hard to disagree that work to put some of this knowledge into circulation am ong the wider public is required. However, awareness raising of the sort the Which? participants advocate is unlikely to be the best approach to public engagement in this space, for a number of reasons: i) Information alone is insufficient This point is well known (and has been learned the hard way) among actors in government, the food system, and researchers. In fact, the Which? participants know it too - hence they call for formal education, lessons in cooking skills, and contemplate (before rejecting) the idea of taxes to reduce meat consumption (Which? 2015). However, their repeated falling back on awaren ess raising as an enabler of behaviour change - as they feel it was for them in the dialogue process - reaffirms their imperfect understanding of food behaviours as the ou tcome of individual choice. We should simply recall the discussion in the section on 'Food Present' above, and the evidence that for many publics their eating habits are a non-choice, illustrated by the conclusion of Fox & Smith writing about the Rotherham 'junk food mums': \" Obesity cannot be combated by simply asking people to change their ha bits without understanding their habitus \" (Fox & Smith 2011: 411). ii) Emerging technologies, uncertain futures While some of the scientific evidence on the environmental impacts of food production and consumption is pretty firm and uncontes ted, there are many areas of the food futures agenda which are much more contested, or inchoate. For example, a large part of the dialogue exercises is focussed on developi ng solutions to food security challenges, and these are both ill-defined and hotly debated in many instances. On the supply side, many of the technologies which are associ ated with increasing production whilst reducing impacts are still ill-defined, whether in the pipeline or still on the drawing board. The example of synthetic meat mentioned a bove is instructive: so unfamiliar was this idea (let alone product) to people in research, that their response was to embark on a process of \" sense-making \" in which they spontaneously constructed scenarios to try to understand how synthetic meat might fit into the food system and their everyday lives (Marcu et al. 2015). A similar dynamic is apparent in a paper on nanotechnology, in which the authors call for a process of \" constant re-evaluation of what the public thinks \" while interpretations of the technology are still \" largely uncrystallised \" (Gupta et al. 2015: 106). 56 iii) Who to engage, and how This review has made a point of foregrounding multiple publics not a single public when exploring people's perceptions and practices in relation to food. This is always good practice in research (as in marketing, policy, strategy...) but particularly so in the context of food behaviours, which vary so widely across different subgroups of the public, and are so bound up with different subgroups' identities. Among some of the subgroups highlighted are those who consistently say they are not interested in engaging with food: whether at the level of food science (eg. IGD 2014), or in responding to food scares (eg. FSA 2013a), or even in the immediate sens e of the food they consume on a day to day basis (see eg. the FSA consumer segmenta tion - FSA 2015). Many of those who respond to research questions in this way are younger adults, who also comment that they are time poor. For groups like these, as well as for those who are poor in income terms, it is a good question how they should be adequately engaged in negotiating the future of the food system. To varying extents, the public dialogues themselves have tried to find answers to these questions: although it is notable how little appears to have changed in participants' responses in each new dialogue - despite the evident changes that the part icipants in each individual dialogue exercise undergo. The earliest of the dialogues, run by the GFS programme, closed by identifying that the public participants and their expert conve nors lacked a common language for discussing the issues of concern (GFS 2012b). They summed up these differences in terminology in a useful table, reproduced here: 57 The table draws our attention to the point that 'GFS' is a professional discourse, and that the 'food futures' agenda needs a new language if the wider public are to be successfully engaged in it. We could argue that this task is even preparatory to the one of 'awareness raising' which the dialogue participants call for, as without a comm on language, it will be hard to share information in a way that is intelligible to the recipients. Yet we should also note that the table is pointing to a clash of 'frames' and not just language. Building on this insight, we could recommend that what is needed are shared meanings, to be reached through negotiation, or what the authors of the study on synthetic meat might call 'sense making'. While the participants in the most r ecent Which? dialogue want a kind of instrumental programme of communication which leads to behaviour change, the evidence arrayed in this review can be used to point to the conclusion that a more fundamental kind of 'dialogue' is required: one which is closer to the or iginal Greek sense of the word, as \" a free flow of meaning between people in communication, in the se nse of a stream that flows between banks\" (Bohm 1996: 7). Such an open-ended enquiry would engage lay people and experts in finding new ways to interrelate, and think and speak about the complexities and ch allenges that we collectively face. As in the synthetic meat study, it would naturally involve the creation of scenarios, which might serve as different visions of potential food futures - ex cept unlike the scenarios that are currently in circulation these would have been co-created with the wider public, and not just be presented to the wider public as stimulus materials in research activities (see eg. Steedman and Shultz 2009). Such stories are vital in helping us make sense of the world, and what we, collectively, want from it - as Tara Garnett recently noted in presenting her own vivid and variably unsettling scenarios for sustainable food futures (FCRN 2015). It is vital the public are prominent in this storytelling project going forward, both because we cannot know what futures are possible without their participation, as well as because to omit them would risk further excluding certain groups from food security going forward (because \"those with most power tend to de termine which narrative dominates\" - ibid.: 2). It is not clear who is best placed to carry this work forward - and, as established above, asking the public directly is unlikely to result in a useful answer. But several actors are already delivering aspects of the food futures work, including: The GFS programme Their programme of dialogue goes back to 2012, and continues through their Public Panel on Food Futures, a body of 600 diverse members of the public who are invited to join in online and face to face dialogue activities, when they choose to do so. Their most recent activities have focused on the food system, and urban agriculture (see GFS 2016 - forthcoming). The governance structure of the programme, involving multiple research councils and government departments, makes GFS well placed to co-ordinate a process of negotiation and sense making around food futu res, incorporating the lay public as equals. The Wellcome Trust Crunch programme The Crunch programme is a high profile pub lic engagement initiative co-ordinated by Wellcome but delivered by a consortium of or ganisations expert in formal and informal education, and public understanding of science, as well as leading partners from media, culture and the arts. The Crunch's focus in on Wellcome's definition of the 'nexus', which includes health alongside food and the environment, and may mean the programme's focus is not so squarely on food security issues - alt hough it may be all the more engaging with the wider public because of it, and lead them to similar places in due course. Running for a year or more in 2016-17, the Crunch is likely to deliver the awareness raising activities which 58 dialogue participants have asked for, and pr ove an 'eye opener' for different publics in relation to the complex and urgent challenges faced by the food system. The FSA 'Our Food Future' programme Work on 'Our Food Future' has just begun, and this literature review is part of the first steps to build the evidence base from which activities can be launched. Thus far, Our Food Future is configured as a process of stakehol der engagement, drawing together actors from across the food system, and including government and civil society organisations. There is a possibility that some of the governance structures called for by dialogue participants and convenors alike may emerge from this network, especially if FSA are to lead on delivering their commitment to give consumers \" the right to the best food future possible \" (FSA 2015a: 4). In conclusion, the 'food futures' project should be approached as one of collective sense-making, telling and retelling stories about our relationships with food over time, in order to create scenarios for viable and sustainable futures which we all can co-exist in. As Tara Garnett says in presenting her FCRN scenarios: \"closer exploration of our gut feelings through the medium of storytelling - which is all that scenarios are - might reveal some unwa nted surprises. Do we really want what we think we want?\" (FCRN 2015: 27). And asking this question is especially urgent, given that what we have is 'not an option'. 59 Annexes i) A Note on Methods The Our Future Foods literature review combined mu ltiple methods, in three phases, as follows: a) The Initial Call for Information The review process began in October 2014, when AD, acting as external advisor to the Wellcome Trust's food and drink initiative (now branded 'The Crunch') sent out a call for information to 60 researchers and practitioners working on aspects of the UK food system. The scope of the call was broad in terms of topics, summed up as evidence on 'where the UK public is at' in terms of food-related perceptions and practices. A relatively tight timeframe was set (sources since 2010 - although this was not always adhered to by contributors). As the principal aim of the re view was to provide benc hmarks to support the development of the Crunch, and track changes in public engagement over time, the emphasis was on quantitative data (though not j ust from surveys). AD was supported in the logging and selection of sources by Clare Curtis , then of the Wellcome Collection. In total, 101 sources were gathered from 42 individuals; 60 were selected as the basis of an internal report to the Crunch programme team and contractors (February 2015). b) The Follow-Up Call for Information As FSA's 'Our Food Future' programme began to take shape in early 2015, it became clear that the evidence base on the UK public's relationship with food, and their role in the food futures agenda, would need to be reviewed (not least, preliminary to the new primary research which FSA was planning to undertak e). The Wellcome Trust agreed to share the assembled body of evidence with the FSA, and AD was commissioned by FSA to update and then synthesise the evidence base. A ccordingly in August 2015 a second call for information was sent out, to all 42 individuals who responded to the initial call (they were also sent a copy of the longlist of 101 sources gathered from the first call). The scope was similarly broad, with the same timeframe set, although the kinds of data searched for were extended, to include more qualitative evidence. The second call's focus was summed up as being on the 'views voices and practices of the UK public in relation to food', now and in future. The call was left open throughout the rest of 2015, and even into 2016, with participants contributing new work as it became available, right up to the reporting deadline in February 2016. In total, 76 individuals contributed to this call, and the total set of relevant sources they contributed across the two calls numbered 131. In the process of reviewing these sources, the relevant content in each was summarised into an Excel spreadsheet, against each of th e longlist of priority topics set for the review. A summary table to show the coverage of sources by topic is included in Annex ii below. c) The Systematic Study In November 2015 the FSA resolved to commission a systematic review to supplement the expert-led calls for information. The aim of the systematic review was to add transparency and robustness to the review process, and ensur e any important gaps had not been left in the coverage of evidence. Valerie Viehoff at the University of Bonn was commissioned to undertake the systematic search, using a sc ope derived from the expert-led calls. Accordingly her search terms were broad, albe it the same timeframe was set, of sources produced since 2010. Relevant publicat ions, published between 2010 and 2016, were identified via searches of web of science, g oogle scholar and science direct databases. The following terms were used in various combinations to the perform searches: 'food' 1,307 sources. A set of filtering criteria were then applied, based on whether the source covered a) the UK b) food, in relation to consumers c) the UK public, whose 'views, voices, and practices' needed to be visible through the source (ie. it included primary evidence relating to them - although th is need not always be new). Applying these filters to the titles of the sources returned , the selection reduced to 528, which was then reduced to 94 on reviewing the abstracts of each paper against the three filters. The full text of each of these sources was then reviewed ag ainst the priority topics of the 'Our Food Future' programme (agreed with the FSA and pa rtners' steering group), with the result that 52 of the systematic sources went forward for final review. These 52 publications were read and analysed again and through a continuous iterative process, information from these publications was extracted into a standardised table and allocated to emerging ts of this allocation are shown in Annex ii below. From the three methods for gathering described above, 183 selected sources were identified - these are listed in Annex iv below. In drafting the report not all those so urces were cited (largely due to constraints of space), while 15 more 'c lassics' were added to provide firm theoretical footings for the commentary. In the final outco me, this review cites 100 sources; these are listed in Annex v below. Finally, it is worth making a few observations a bout the combination of methods used, in order to convey the value of this mixed methods approach. Expert-led calls for information provide a resource-efficient means of identifying the most important sources on a subject at that poi nt in time, based on the expertise of those best placed to comment (in primary research terms, we could call this a 'Delphi' method, reliant on experts' insights). They also provid e access to 'grey literature', the data within which often never make it into peer-reviewed jo urnals - or if so, only after a time lag. Grey literature of this kind often relates to practical questions and applications; this is partly because it is usually commissioned by an organisation for a particular purpose (hence it already has 'impact'). The downside of an expert-led call is that it is untransparent: the relationship between the sources gathered and the wider literature is unknown. A systematic search of peer- reviewed journals provides reassurance that 'nothing has been missed'. However, as was the case with the systematic element of this review, the results from database searches can be exceedingly broad, such that there is a lot of work left to do to filter out irrelevant papers by hand: from their titles, their abstracts, then based on their full text. However, so set narrower search terms would risk missi ng key sources - hence in this review, the broad searching plus repeated filtering by ha nd approach was used. Database searching identifies published journal papers, the main benefits of which are that they tend to be of a good quality as a minimum (thanks to the publication process), and they bring some helpful theoretical context which is often missing from grey literature, including commercial market research. In a study such as this, on a complex and systemic topic which requires collaboration, undertaking a call for information has the added value of building or strengthening the 'community of practice' of interested stak eholders. The network built through the 61 review process can be as of as much value as the evidence base gathered through that network 62 ii) Coverage by Topics a) Allocation of Selected Sources from Initial Call for Information (n = 100) [theme;
