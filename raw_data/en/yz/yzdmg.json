This Office was created by th e Budget and Accounting Act, 1921, and carrie s out several interrelated functions that are as - signed by law : \u2014 Assisting the Congress in its legislative an d oversight activities . \u2014 Providing legal services . \u2014 Auditing the programs, activities, and fi- nancial operations of Federal department s and agencies . - Assisting in the improvement of Federa l agency financial management systems . \u2014 Assisting in the supervision and control o f Federal election campaign expenditures . \u2014 Settling claims and collecting debts . Direct Assistance to the Congres s One of our major objectives is to render maxi - mum assistance to the Congress, its committees , and Members consistent with our responsibilitie s as an independent, non political agency . We vie w all of our work as being of assistance to theCongress in one way or another in carrying ou t its legislative and oversight functions . We, there - fore, make every effort to direct our staff re - sources to work that produces information o n Federal programs and agency operations tha t will be useful to the Congress and in area s which, in our judgment, will fulfill the greates t apparent need and benefit to the Government . We classify certain work as being of direc t assistance to the Congress . This work includes : \u2014 Special audits or studies requested by con- gressional committees and individual Mem- bers of Congress . -- Studies specifically directed by legislation . \u2014 Testimony at hearings . \u2014 Work of GAO staff assigned to congr = sional committees . \u2014 Advice and assistance to committees an d Members of Congress on legal and legisla- tive matters including reports on pendin g legislation . \u2014 Accounting, auditing, and advisory service s for House and Senate financial and admin- istrative operations . \u2014 Liaison activities with congressional com- mittees and individual Members . This category of work does not include th e very substantial amount of work involved i n auditing the affairs of Federal agencies . We mak e these audits either because we believe the result s will be useful to the Congress or because the y are required by law . Even though the commit - tees and Members of Congress may use the in - formation in these audit reports, we do not clas- sify this work as direct assistance . Statistics on the numbers of audit report s completed do not tell the full story of GA O audit operations, but they do provide an indi- cation of the amount of work performed .

Sullivan, Director, Transportation and Claims Division (far left) and Assistant Comptrotlers General Phillip S . Hughe s and E .H. Morse, Jr . (on right) . During the year, we submitted 553 reports o n audits or special studies to the Congress, its com - mittees, and its Members as compared with 50 4 for the previous year . In addition, copies o f numerous audit reports to Federal agency offi- cials were sent to interested congressional com- mittees for their information and use . Under section 236 of the Legislative Reorgan- ization Act of 1970, Federal agency heads ar e required to report directly to the Committees o n Government Operations and the Committees o n Appropriations on actions they take on recom- mendations directed to them in GAO reports . Overall, about 27 percent of our professiona l staff 's time was spent on directly assisting th e Congress during fiscal year 1974 as compared t o about 25 percent for the previous year . Reports to committees and Members--I n response to specific requests for informatio n requiring audit work or special studies, we pro- vided 167 reports to chairmen of congressiona l committees orsubcommittees (including 8 t o officers of the Congress) and 241 reports to indi- vidual Members of Congress during the year . Our general policy is to respond to requests o f individual Members where feasible . Some o f these requests can be met with little effort ;others require major effort . We find in man y cases that some requests are in the same genera l area and we can combine them into one study . For example, several Members of Congress aske d us to examine postal service and operations i n various states . It soon became apparent tha t there was a nationwide pattern in the problem s affecting the quality of' mail service . As a resul t of the work we performed on these requests an d with some supplemental work, we reporte d during the year to the Congress on the problem s causing a deterioration in the quality of mai l services and on corrective actions required . The titles of these reports and the requestin g committees and Members are shown in th e complete listing of all GAO reports for fisca l year 1974 in appendix 5 . Details on many o f them are provided in later chapters of thi s report . In addition to these reports, we provided 80 9 responses to Members on requests concernin g claims by and against the United States . Thes e claims involved such subjects as Governmen t contracts, pay and allowances of personnel , travel, and transportation . Specific studies directed by law\u2014A majo r report directed by law completed during th e 2 HIGHLIGHTS OF ACTIVITIES FOn THE YFA H year was our study of the research, pilot an d demonstration programs for prevention and con- trol of water pollution which are assisted by th e Federal Government . This study, directed by th e Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amend- ments of 19i2, required about 40 man-years o f audit effort and cost about $1 .1 million . (Se e page for further details .) Testifying at heariikgs--GAO representative s testified on 61 different occasions (luring th e year before congressional committees . A com- plete list of these appearances and the subjec t matter is included in appendix 7 . Staff assignments to conimittecs--Oil request , 98 staff members were assigned to the staffs o f 29 different committees or subcommittees .

Improving Congressional Contro l Over the Federal Budge t The intensive studies in the Congress, begi n during the fiscal year 1()73, to revise an d strengthen congressional procedures for dealin g with the Federal budget culminated during ; 197 4 with the enactrnent of the Congressional Budge t and Impoundment Control Ac :t of 1974 (Publi c Law 93-344, approved July 12, 1974) . This significant legislation not only provide s substantial changes in congressional organizatio n and procedures for considering ; the Federal 3 HIGHLIGHTS OF ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEA R budget but also assigns numerous additional se- sponsibilities to the Comptroller General an d revises others . For example, the new act pro- vides that we : \u2014 Provide information, services, facilities, an d personnel ~as mutually agreed) to the ne w Congressional Budget Office established t o assist the new House and Senate Budge t Committees and other committees an d Members of Congress with information o n budget and revenue matters . \u2014 Review and evaluate results of Governmen t programs and activities . \u2014 Assist congressional committees in devel- oping statements of legislative objective s and goals and methods for assessing an d reporting actual program performance . \u2014 Assist such committees in analyzing an d assessing Federal agency program review s and evaluation studies . \u2014 Develop and recommend methods fo r review and evaluation of Government pro - grams . \u2014 Cooperate with the Treasury and the Offic e of Management and Budget in developin g standardized data processing and infonna- tion systerns for fiscal, budgetary, and pro- gram-related information . \u2014 Develop, in cooperation with the Treasury , OMB, and the new Congressional Budge t Office, standard terminology, definitions , classifications, and codes for fiscal, budget- ary, and program-related information . \u2014 Conduct a continuing program to identif y needs of committees and Members of Con- gress for fiscal, budgetary, and program - related information . \u2014 Assist congressional committees in devel- oping their information needs . \u2014 Monitor recurring reporting requirement s of the Congress . \u2014 Develop, in cooperation with the Congres- sional Budget Office, the Treasury, an d OMB, an up-to-date inventory and direc- tory of sources and information system s for fiscal, budgetary, and program-relate d information . \u2014 Assist committees and Members to obtai n information from such sources and t o appraise and analyze it . \u2014 Develop, with the Congressional Budge t Office, a central file of data and infor -mation to meet recurring requirements o f the Congress for fiscal, budgetary, and pro- vra.m-related information . \u2014 Cooperate with OMB and the Congressiona i Budget Office and representatives of Stat e and local governments iri providing appro- priate Federal fiscal, budgetary, and pro- gram-related information to such govern- ments . /, major title of the new act is concercied wit h congressional control of impoundments o f spending authority by the President . The Comp - troller General will be involved in all propose d rescissions or deferrals of budget authority b y reviewing and reporting to the Congress the fact s surrounding each proposal of the President and , in the case of proposed deferrals, determinin g the legality of such action . He must : aiso repor t to Congress when he believes a special messag e from the President has been transmitted unde r the wrong section . If reserves or deferrals are no t reported by the President, the Comptrolle r General is to report on the matter to the Con- gress. He is also empowered to sue in court t o require the freeing of budget authority not mad e available as required . Impact of Other N Legislatio n On GAO Operation s Other legislative actions of the Congress con- tinue to assign new or added responsibilities t o us and, as a result, we are constantly faced wit h the need to adjust our work programs or in - crease our capabilities to accommodate th e increased workload . Some examples of recen t significant legislative actions follow : The Health Maintenance Organization Act o f 1973 requires us to evaluate 50 health mainte- nance organizations after they get into opera- tion and over a period of three years . The Trans-Alaska Pipeline Act of 1973 gave us new responsibilities for reviewing th e questionnaire and information requests of I 1 regulatory agencies that go outside of th e Government\u2014mostly to business\u2014for infor-mation . This is a function that had previousl y been in the Office of Management an d Budget . Amendments to the National School Lunc h and Child Nutrition Acts extended the pilo t 4 HIGHLIGHTS OF ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEA R supplemental food program, increased th e funding level and requires that our evaluatio n of the pilot program be completed by Marc h 20, 1975 . The Defense Approf)riation Authorizatio n Act of 1974 requires us to cooperate wit h Commerce and Defense in assessing the dolla r set-off cost due to our NATO programs . Under that amendment, unless those costs ar c completely offset, the Europeans have t o make up the difference or the United State s reduces its contribution . The Foreign Assistance Act of 1973 require s us to prescribe auditing and reporting stan- dards for the United Nations, the World Ban k and the Asian Development Batik and t o report on their effectiveness . Also significant over the long run is legislatio n which creates new I-c- ',:ral programs or expand s existing programs . `.V will need to audit the m just like we do ocher programs . A few examples : The Federal Energy Administration Act o f 1974 (P .L. 93-276), the Energy Reorganiza- tion Act of 1974 (P .L. 9.3-438), and othe r energy-related legislation establish new pro - grams aidthree new Federal agencies to dea l with the Nation's encrgy problems . Suh- stantial requirements for GAO work wil l result over the next several years . The Employee Retirement Income Securit y Act of 1974 (P .L. 93-4065), i .e.,the pensio n reform act, places nciv responsibilities on th e Departments of Treasury and Labor and estab - lishes a Pension Benefit Guarantee Cor- poration within the Department ofLabo r which the Comptroller General will be re- quired to audit annually . The Agriculture and Consumer Protection Ac t of 1973 (P .L. 93-86) will require increase d audit effort to monitor the price-suppor t programs and their responsiveness to curren t conditions of agricultural scarcities . The Commodity Futures Trading Commissio n Act (P .L. 93-463) strengthens the regulatio n of futures trading, brings all commoditie s traded under regulation, and establishes a ne w independent regulatory commission . Th e Comptroller General is required to conduc t reviews and audits of the commission .Monthly List of GAD Report s F;ach month we send to the Congress, th e committees, and all Members a list o1 'GAO reports completed or released during the pre- vious month . Preparation and dissemination o f these lists is required by sc ;-tion 234 of th e Legislative Reorganization Act of' 1970) . The lists arc also published in the Congres- sional Record through arrangements made wit h a congressional committee . These lists arc useful sources of informatio n for keeping committees and Members of Con- gress nformed about GAO r= :ports . F.ach lis t shows the title of cach report ., date of release , GAG file number, and identity of Governmen t agencies or other organizai ions responsible fo r the activities reported on . Brief digests of th e reports to the Congress or committees are ais o included . Recommendations or Legislatio n As required by the Budget and Accountin g Act, 1921, we include in our reports to th e Congress recommendations '41 Joking to greate r economy and efficiency in public expenditures .\" Sometimes these recommendations require legis- lation . A summary of such recommendations, in- cluded in reports made during the fiscal yea r 1974, together with open recommendation s reported in prior years, is included in appendi x i. Dur;ng the year, we developed a new report i n which we summarize for each congressiona l committee the recommendations for legislativ e action made in our reports that relate to th e responsibilities of that committee and are stil l open . These reports were prepared as of Decem- ber 31, 1973, and we plan to continue them a s of the same date in future years . Legal Services and Decision s Our legal work extends to virtually the ful l range of the Government's receipt and expendi- ture activity . It serves : \u2014 Congressional committees and Members o f Congress ; \u2014 Heads of departments and agencies as wel l 5 HIGHLIGHTS OF ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEA R as disbursing and certifying officers o n legality or, propriety of proposed expendi- tures of Federal funds ; \u2014 Contracting and procuring officers in con- nection with Government contracts ; \u2014 Bidders for Government contracts ; \u2014 Individuals and firms whose claims hav e been disallowed by the Transportation an d Claims Division ; and \u2014 GAO auditors in their audits of agenc y programs . Legal decisions of the Comptroller Genera l are final upon the executive branch and pa}' - ments made contrary to them arc subject t o disallowance . Private concerns and individual s have further recourse to the courts in mos t cases . During the year, our Office of the Genera l Counsel completed action on 4,716 legal matter s (see chapter 3) . Auditin g Auditing the programs, activities, and finan- cial operations of Federal departments an d agencies, and their contractors and grantees, o n our own initiative requires well over half of ou r professional staff resources . The primary pur- poses of GAO audits are to : Evaluate the efficiency, economy, legality , and effectiveness with which Federal agencie s carry out their financial, management, an d program responsibilities . Provide the Congress and Federal agenc y officials with significant and objective infor- mation, conclusions, and recommendation s that will aid them in carrying out thei r responsibilities . In our audits which examine the efficiency , economy, and effectiveness of Government pro - grams and activities, we seek to answer suc h questions as : Is it possible to eliminate waste and ineffi- cient use of public moneys ? Are Federal programs achieving their objec- tives ? Are there other ways of accomplishing pro - gram objectives at lower cost ? Are funds being spent legally?GAO auditors operate in almost cvcry Federa l agency in the United States and in numerou s foreign countries . During fiscal year 1974, w e performed 1,700 audits of Government program s and activities in the United States and 58 othe r countries . \"These audits were in the followin g broad functional categories : Domestic program s Manpower and welfare /.null 213 Resources and economic development /.null 181 General government/.null 176 General managemen t Procurement and systems acquisition /.null 275 1 Logistics and communications/.null 350 Federal personnel and compensation /.null 215 Financial and genera ; management/.null 80 International programs /.null 171 Energy and special projects /.null 36 Total/.null 1,700 The results of much of'the audit wor k performed during the year will be included i n reports to be completed during the next fisca l year . In deciding upon the audit wort : to b e performed, we emphasize federal programs an d agency operations in which there arc : stron g present or potential congressional interest an d opportunities for improvement . Given the size of the Federal Government, w e must be selective in determining which Federa l programs and activities we will review at an y given time . In making this decision, we conside r factors such as the importance and effectivenes s of programs and activities, size : of expenditures , investment in assets, etc . This is done throug h our program planning system . We also keep i n continuing contact with congressional com- mittees to remain abreast of'their interests an d activities and with Federal agencies in th e day-to-day conductof.their programs . Our emphasis, of recent years, on progra m evaluations is continuing and we also encourag e Federal agencies to perform their own progra m evaluations . In our independent role we wil l determine how well the agencies discharge thi s important responsibility as well as their othe r management and program responsibilities . We are making an increasing number of ou r audits on itmultiagency basis so that the result s of our work will be more useful to the Congress , its committees, and its Members . Chapters fou r through fourteen of this report identify th e wide-ranging subjects of our audits and sum- marize the major findings, conclusions, an d 6 HIGHLIGHTS OF ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEA R recommendations of theaudit work complete d during the year . In 1973 we established an Office of Energ y and Special Projects as a result of growin g congressional and public concern over energ y and other shortage problems . These problem s involve numerous Federal agencies and pro - grams . One responsibility of the newoffice is t o identify andrecommend audit work relating t o energy and other shortage area problems tha t other GAO organizations would carry out . In addition, it willconduct special studies ofits own of aGovernment-wide nature . The work of this office ;- which also involve s developing our capabilities to assist the Congres s with economic and budget analyses and review- ingthe information collection activities of Federal regulatory agencies together with late r changes inour organization for carrying ; ou t these functions, isdiscussed in chapter five . Access to Record s If we are to satisfactorily audit the program s and activities of Federal departments and activi- ties, we must have access to their books , documents, papers, and records . The Congres s clearly recognized this need when it enacted th e Budget andAccounting Act, 1921, which cre- ated the General Accounting Office . In that act , it provided us with broad authority to hav e access to Federal ;- agency records and it ha s repeated this authorization innumerous law s enacted since then . Most Federal agencies cooperate sati-factoril y with us on this score .llowcver, inafew cases , we ' still encounter restrictions on what ou r auditors can examine and, occasionally, unwar- ranted delays occur before wearegiven appro- priate access to essential records .Problems thi s year involved the Executive Office of the Presi- dent, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora- tion, the National Credit Union Administration , and the National Aeronautics and Space Admin- istration . Our policy is to keep the Congress informe d on access-to-records problems that wehave an d to seek congressional assistance insolving them . As noted in the last section of this chapter , one provision ' of pending legislation on GA O functions deals with this subject . It wouldempower us to sue in court for the furnishing o f information or records requested and desired . Audit of Transportation Payment s The Transportation Act of 1940 requires u s to postaudit all billings fortransportation unde r standard Government transportation forms . Dur- ing; the year we audited $1 .5 billion intranspor- tation charges of which over $1 .1 billion wasfor 4 million freight shipments and $352 millio n wits for 2 .1 million passenger movcmcnts .A total of 70,032 claims of overcharge were state d against carriers for $11 .3 million . Collection s from carriers amounted to $9 .5 million ; 9,83 $ claims against the United States by carriers wer e settled for $2 .1 million .. We furnished assistance to the Department o f Justice in some 34 suits for $-4,442,350 involvin g 4,104 shipments . Twenty suits were settled' fo r $128,702 or $255,926 less than claimed . To further implement the documentation an d procedural recommendations of the Join t Agency Transportation Study completed i n 1970, we promulgated joint standardsdevelope d with the Treasury Department which will gover n payments made under the \"Transportation Pay- ment Act of 1972 (Public Law 92-550, 86 Stitt . 1163) . We have recommended legislation that woul d transfer responsibility for the detailed audit of transportation payments to the executiv e branch . \"The objective is to make this transfe r effective by July 1, 1976 . Under this 'proposa l we would be moving inthe same direction GA O started moving many years ago when detaile d voucher audits were transferred to the agencies . Our function thc, would be comparable to wha t we do for all other payments, that is audit th e agencies' handling of them . We would retain th e functions of collection, compromise, or termina- tion of transportation debts that are referred t o GAO by other agencies . We would continue t o render decisions andguidance to disbursing and certifying officers and to claimants who reques t the Comptroller General to administrativel y review settlements . We are continuing efforts to automate trans- portation audits and to make our audit system s compatible with agency systems . This approac h will facilitate the recommended transfer of audi t responsibility to the executive branch . 7 HIGHLIGHTS OF ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEA R Transportation audit and related activities ar e discussed in chapter thirteen . Financial Management Improvemen t An important responsibility wehave by law , principally the Budget and Accounting Pro- ccdures Act of 1950, pertains to accounting i n the Federal agencies . Under this law, we : Prescribe accounting principles and stan- dards for the guidance of executive agencies . Cooperate with the agencies in improvin g their accounting and financial managemen t systems . Approve agencies' principles and standard s and accounting systems designs when they ar e determined to be adequate . Work with the Office ofManagement an d Budget, the Treasury Department, the Civi l Service Commission, andthe General Service s Administration in the joint Financial Manage- ment Improvement Program, a Government - wide program begun 25 years ago for stimu - lating improvements inaccounting and othe r financial management practices . During the year, Federal agencies mad e further progress inreshaping their accountin g systems ' so that we could approve them . We approved 2 agency statements of accountin g principles and standards covering 21 systems an d designs for 25 accounting systems . On Januar y 10, 1974, a statement of accounting principle s and standards for the Office of the Secretary o f Defense and Defense agencies was approved . With this approval, principles and standards fo r all of the accounting systems of the Departmen t of Defense now have received GAO approval . Further information on this activity is include d in chapter four . The operations of the joint Financial Manage- ment Improvement Program were strengthene d during the year by creating and filling th e position of a full-time executive director to b e responsible for the day-to-day conduct of ap- proved projects for improving financial manage - ment procedures and systems . Federal Election Activitie s The Presidential 'Election Campaign Fun d Act, approved December 10, 1971, and theFederal Election Campaign Act of_ 1971, ap- proved February 7, 1972, established new pro- cedures concerning the financing and disclosur e of campaign expenditures for Federal elections . Both laws assigned responsibilities to the Comp - troller General, mainly relating to the disclosur e of campaign expenditures for Presidential an d Vice-Presidential candidates . During fiscal year 1972, a separate Office ofFederal Elections wa s created in GAO to carry out these responsi- bilities . The activities of the Office of Federal Elec- tions during the year are summarized in chapte r two. This work has involved the handling of a great volume of reports . For example, 31,68 5 pages of reports were received from politica l committees and candidates during the year an d made available for public examination . We completed 221 audits of political com- mittees during the year and 197 others were in process . At yearend, the Congress was considerin g legislation which would transfer our supervisor y responsibilities in this field to another organi- zation (see page 15 ) . Settlement of Claim s In addition to settling claims involvingtrans- portation carriers, we settle other categories o f claims by and against the Federal Government . Our settlements are completely independent o f the agencies out of whose operations the claim s arise. Hence, aggrieved parties are provided wit h an impartial and independent settlement of thei r claims . Settling these claims without litigatio n also reduces the burden on the courts and th e Department of justice . Claims against the United States referred t o GAO for settlement are (1) those required b y statute to be paid on settlement by GAO and (2 ) those involving doubtful questions of law o r fact. During the year we settled 8,727 claim s against the United States for $142 .4 million . Claims made by the United States are referre d to us for examination and adjudication whe n there is administrative doubt as to the liabilit y of the debtor or the amount of the debt . Othe r claims are referred to usbecause debt collectio n efforts have been unsuccessful . During 1074 w e settled 26,580 such claims resulting inthe collection of $4 .9 million . As of June 30, 1974, 42,952 claims \"totaling $89 .4 million were o n hand, including 9,376 claims amounting to $6 .3- - Million in process of collection by GAO an d 5,426 claims under collection inthe Departmen t of Justice .\" GAO Audit Standard s Our statement ofstandards for the audit o f governmental organizations, programs, activities , and functions, published in1972, continues t o receive widespread attention . We are pursuin g several projects concerned with stimulatin g interest andunderstanding ofthese standards, a particular need in the case of State and loca l governments who receive Federal financial assis- tance . Tofacilitate better communications amon g auditors at all levels ofgovernment, we spon- sored the organization of a national intergovern- mental audit forum, made upof representative s of our Office, other Federal agencies, andState and local governments . Charter signing cere- monies for this forum were held in the Genera l Accounting Office onNovember 5, 1973 . Nin e regional forums have also been established wit h similar objectives, namely, to provide a mechan- ism for exchanging views on audit problems , improve cooperative working relationships, an d promote understanding and acceptance of GA O audit standards ; Savings and Other Accomplishment s It is not really possible to determine the ful l effect of GAO activities in terms of improve- merct in operations and effectiveness of Govern - ment programs and activities . We carry out a great deal of work with the objective of improv- ing Government programs and activities withou t regard to the dollar savings that wemight clai m from ourwork .For the most part, actions take n on our recommendations cannot be measured i n dollar savings . Where wecan identify thos e savings specifically and where the `actions hav e been taken by the Congress or by an agency, w e do, however, keep arecord of them . For fisca l year 1974, such savings amounted to $56 2 million, which was roughly 5 times our expendi- tures for theyear .Appendix 2 contains detaile d information onthese savings .HIGHLIGHTS OFACTIVITIES FOR THE YEA R Even more important, in some ways, are th e recommendations wemake that may not resul t indollar savings but dolead to increase d effectiveness of Government programs . ' Fo r exampl ic,inconnection with one of our reviews , we obtained statistics on hazardous locations - where the highest incidence of serious accident s took place in various States 'highway systems . Then we obtained estimates of what would b e necessary to remove the obstacles or brin g them into conformity with safety standards . Working with the Senate and House Publi c Works Committees, we recommended that a certain amount of money be earmarked t o remove obstacles which were creating seriou s highway hazards . Subsequently, the Congres s earmarked $375 million in the Federal Ai d Highway Act of 1973 to improve high-hazar d locations and eliminate roadside obstacles . Base d on available statistics, use of this $375 millio n fund should save 1,450 lives and prevent 22,00 0 injuries annually over the life of the improve- ments . Operating Expanse s Our operating expenses for fiscal year 197 4 were $106 .4 million, of which about 86 per- cent\u2014$91 .9 million\u2014was for salixies and othe r personnel costs . Financial statements showing our financia l position, summary of operating expenses, and sources and application of funds are presented i n appendix 10 . Staffin g At June 30, 1974, we had 5,188 employees , 226 more than a year earlier . Of the curren t total, 3,564 (about 69 percent) were member s of our professional staff . We are continuing our efforts to furthe r increase the interdisciplinary character of our staff. At June 30, 1974, about 30 percent of ou r professional staff was made up of person s trained indisciplines other than accounting (se e table on page 180) . Such other disciplines cover a wide range of skills, which we feel are increas- ingly necessary to much of our audit work an d particularly to our evaluations of program' re - sults . 9 HIGHLIGHTS OF ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEA R Equal Employment Opportunity Progra m Wecontinued to give priority attention t o improving theemployment profile of wome n and minority persons inour professional staff . Since June 30, 1972, our minority work forc e has grown from 688 to 889 persons and at Jun e 30, 1974, represented 17 .3 percent of all genera l schedule employees . (See page 183 for furthe r information .) Upward Mobilit y Our upward mobility program is designed t o provide avenues of advancement into our pro- fessional range for interested employees wh o lack the necessary qualifications in terms o f education andexperience andwho are in lower - . aded jobs with limited opportunity to ad- vance . This 'program provides such employee s with the opportunity to meet qualificatio n requirements through the completion of work - related courses at approved colleges and univer- sities, career counseling and training in GAO , and carefully planned and supervised' on-the jo b work experience . 'Successful completion of th e program will enable participants to join th e professional staff as management analysts, audi- tors, orclaims adjudicators . A brief descriptio n ofprogress in this program appears on page 183 . Legislation to Revise and Restat e Certain GAO Functions and Dutie s In December 1973, revised bills were intro- duced inthe Congress at the Comptrolle r General's request to revise and restate certai n functions and duties of the Comptroller Genera l and the General Accounting Office . These bill s were revisions of those described in our previou s anneal report (p . 10) and separated the pro - visions relating tolargely routine changes i n activities from the proposed changes involvin g more complex issues .` These bills contain a variety of provisions, al l intended to enable us to more effectively carr y out our assigned responsibilities . Included i n H.R. 12113 and S . 3013 are provisions : Authorizing the Comptroller General t o prescribe limitations onthenumber ofindi- vidual disbursement vouches which maybepreaudited by Federal agencies statis- tical sampling techniques . Transferring responsibility for detaile d audit of transportation payments to the exec- utive branch . Authorizing GAO audits of certain non- appropri-~ ted-fund activities . Authorizing employment of experts an d consultants . Giving the Comptroller General custod y and control over the GAO Building . Reducing frequency of audits required of Government corporations and certain other entities . The Legislative and Military Operations Sub - committee of the House Government Operation s Committee held llLarings on these proposals o n June 5-6, 1974, and reported the bill to the ful l committee on June 26, with certain modifi - cations . A new provision also was added a t GAO's request decreasing the period after a claim accrues when it may be filed in GAO fro m 10 to 6 years . At June 30, 1974, the Senate ha d not yet taken action onthe bill . The other bills (H .R. 12114 and S . 3014 ) include provisions : Enabling the Comptroller General to sue i n the Federal courts when his determination s differ from those of the Attorney General . Authorizing the Comptroller General t o issue subpoenas for negotiated contract an d subcontract records and records of othe r non-Federal individuals andentities . Directing the Comptroller General to assis t the Congress inobtaining budget, fiscal, an d program information . Restating GAO's right of access to Federa l agency records and records of recipients o f Federal assistance and providing procedure s for enforcing those rights . Directing the Comptroller General tomak e profit studies of Government contractors . Title VIII of the Congressional Budget an d Impoundment Control Act of 1974 contain s provisions similar to that which would direct th e Comptroller General to assist Congress in ob- taining budget, fiscal, and program information . Otherwise, no action in the House or Senate ha d been taken on these bills by June 30, 1974 .' 10 CHAPTER TW O SUPERVISION F POLITICA L CAMPAIGN FINANCIN G A REPORTIN G The Comptroller General's authority and re- sponsibility with respect to political campaig n financing and deporting are different fro m GAO's traditional functions . The 92d -Congres s enacted two laws which set' forth these uniqu e functions : (1) the Presidential Election Cam- paign Fund Act (title VIII, Public Law 92-178 , Dec. 10, -1971) and '(2) the Federal Electio n Campaign Actof 1971 (Public Law 92-225, Feb . 7, 1972). The Office of Federal Elections wa s established within GAO in 1972 to perform th e functions assigned by these laws . Presidential Electio n Campaign Fund Ac t This act, title VIII of the Revenue Act o f 1971, as amended, allows individualtaxpayer s to designate $1 of their income tax to th e Presidential Election Campaign Fund . On a join t tax return, each spouse may also designate $l . Funds designated by this procedure will be available, subject to appropriations, toeligibl e candidates in the general election for the Offic e of President beginning in 1976 .Intheorigina l statute, taxpayers could designate the politicalparty of their choice to receive the dollar. Thi s was modified by Public Law 93-53, ,July- 1 , 1973, to require that all designated moneys be deposited in onefund and distributed to candi- dates according to itformula based on popula r votes received . The act requires the Comptroller General to : \u2014Certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the payments to which eligible candidates fo r President and Vice President \"are entitled . \u2014Audit the candidates' campaign expense s after each Presidential election and recove r any amounts used for inelibigle campaig n expenses . -Receive, in the weeks immediately pre- ' ceding the election, periodic statement s from the candidates ofincurred and \"pro - posed campaign expenses and publish asum- mary of such statements in the Federa l Register with any necessary additional in - formation . \u2014Report to the Congress, as soon as practic- able, on operations under the law . \u2014Instruct his attorneys and counsel to partic- ipate in judicial procedures arising unde r this law . Title VIII also establishes a Presidential Elec- tion Campaign Fund Advisory Board to counse l and assist the Comptroller General in performin g the duties and functions assigned to him by th e act. The Board's original members were a s follows : Senator Mike Mansfield, Senate Majorit y Leade r Senator Hugh Scott, Senate Minority Leade r Representative Carl Albert, Speaker of th e Hous e Representative John J . Rhodes, Minorit y Leader of the Hous e George Bush, Chairman of the Republica n National Committe e Robert Strauss, Chairman of the Democrati c National Committe e Bryce Harlow, Counsellor to the Presiden t C. Peter McColough, Treasurer of the Demo- cratic National Committe e Eugene T . Rossides, private attorney an d former Assistant Secretary of the Treasur y Lew Wasserman, Head of Music Corporatio n of Americ a Henry Ford II, Chairman of the Board, For d Motor Company i9 SUPERV L At the first meeding- of theAdvisory Board , on March 1, 1974, 'Mr . Ford was electe d chairman by unanimous agreement of the othe r members present . Since title VIII specifies the composition of the Board by -title of position , the individual members can be expected t o change in the future . Federal Election Campaig n Act of 19713ION OF POLITICAL CAMPAIGN FINANCING AND REPORTIN G 4,004 reports and statements (31,685 pages) . This represents a37-percent growth inpages o f documentation over the previous year. Thes e reports and statements are available for publi c examination, and copies canbe purchased for 1 0 cents a page . The sum of $10,211 was forwarde d to the Department of the Treasury during th e year as a result of the sale of various reports and statements . Report Analysis and Investigatio n This act requires the Comptroller General t o (1) prescribe regulations and perform relate d functions involving communications media usag e as it relates to - elections for President, Vic e President, U .S. Senate and U .S. House of Repre - sentatives, (2) serve asa supervisory officer wit h respect to disclosure of campaign funds, contri- butions, and expenditures of candidates fo r President and Vice President and political com- mittees supporting 'them, and (3) perform a national clearinghouse function for conductin g research and disseminating information on th e administration of elections . Section 308 of the act sets forth the duties o f the supervisory officers in specific detail . Report Processing .and Contro l Title III of the act requires supervisor y officers to supply candidates and reportin g committees with prescribed report and state- ment forms- . During fiscal year 1974 the Offic e of Federal Elections received and processe d approximately 4,000 requests for forms an d instructions . This was a 10-percent reductio n from fiscal year 1973 and reflects the fact tha t although few Federal elections were schedule d until spring of 1974 most committees submitte d the required periodic reports and amende d reports filed in earlier years . To fulfill the requirements of public inspec- tion, each report and statement filed is indexe d with an identification number which is used b y members of the press and the general publi c when requesting copies . From April 2, 1972 , through June 28, 1974, we received 17,60 3 reports andstatements from 2,754 committee s and 37 candidates for a total of 130,597 page s of information . In fiscal year 1974 we receivedEach report is processed to make it availabl e for public inspection, and a preliminary desk audit is made for completeness and accuracy . After the report is made available to the public , further audit and investigation depends upo n specific circumstances . If the report is the subject of a complaint or i f allegations of irregularity have been made, a n immediate audit and investigation may be under - taken to bring out the facts as soon as possible . If not, an audit of the committee filing th e report may be conducted .Our audit progra m provides for audit of all national committees, al l state major party central committees, and a significant sample of other committees whic h report to us . Our 15 regional offices p paicipat e extensively in making these audits . During fiscal year 1974, we completed 22 1 audits and at the end of the year anadditiona l 197 audits and investigations were inprocess . Thirty-two reports involved formal referrals t o the Department of justice for appropriate actio n of \"apparent violations\" of law . Audits and investigations, both special an d routine, are made in accordance with the pro - visions of Section 308(a)(11) and (12) of th e act. Section 308(d) requires investigation o f complaints based onalleged violations of th e act . Automatic Data Processin g Due to the large number of reports submitte d and the detailed reporting requirements set fort h in Section 308 of the act, it is essential tha t automatic data processing equipment be used . The equipment is used for a variety of tasks , including creation of an index of reports an d 13 SUPERV ;SION OF POLITICAL CAMPAIGN FINANCING AN D statements filed and preparation of data for th e annual report required of each supervisory offi- cer. Section 308(x)(7)(E) requires the prepara- tion and publication of a listing by name of al l contributors of more than $100 . The first listin g for 1972 identified 84,337 contributions, loans , refunds, and other payments or transfers o f money in excess of $100 received during th e period April 7-December 31, 1972 . It wa s released August 23, 1973 . A revised listing date d November 15, \" 1973, isavailable from th e Superintendent _ of ' Documents, Governmen t Printing ; Office . The act also requires GAO to prepare an d publish summary information with respect t o Presidential campaign receipts andexpenditures . This report reflecting data derived from report s and statements submitted by 1,785 politica l committees for the period April 7-December 31 , 1972, was released March 24, 1974 . National Clearinghouse o n Election Administratio n Section 308(c) of the act requires th e Comptroller General to establish aclearing - house on election administration informatio n and to make contracts for independent studie s of election administration problems . The studie s are to include, but are not limited to, studies o f voting and counting -methods, registration prac - 'Lices, and training of election boards and per- sonnel . Research -projects either finished or in proces s at the end of the fiscal year included : -A survey of Federal-State election laws com- piled by the Library of Congress in co- operation with the Commerce Clearinghous e which provides asynopsis of Federal an d State election related legislation and liti- gation .

On August8, 1974, the House of Representatives approve d H.R. 16090 which would replace the presen t superviso-y officers with a Board of Supervisor y Officers appointed by the Speaker of the Hous e and the President of the Senate . Both House an d Senate bills were referred to a conferenc e committee for resolution .

Socolar, deputy general counsel , continued to provide a full range of legal service s as dictated by the requirements of the Congress ; GAO ; agency' and department heads ; fiscal, cer- tifying, or disbursing officers ; and individua l claimants . We made staff members available to com- mittees of the Congress as direct assistance , commented on proposed legislation, and fur- nished informal advice andcomments to individ - ualMembers and their staffs.

In fiscal year 1973 we inaugurated a summe r legal intern program w(iich offered employmen t to 16 law school students who had complete d their second year of school . This program wa s primarily designed to provide us with a pool o f competent personnel for future employment . The program was successful ; one-half of the ne w hires reporting in the first quarter of fisc:,1year 1975 were participants in the program . We ar e continuing the program and anticipate contin- ued` success . General Government Law Matter s As the scope and complexity of Governmen t programs expand inresponse to the social, eco- nomic, and political needs which create them , our work on general government matters be - comes more diversified and it includes ever y activity of the Government . This diversificatio n requires continual interpretation of legislativ e enactments to insure that their operation is con - ducted ina manner consistent with the intent o f the Congress . Our attorneys answer legal questions and ana- lyze pending or --proposed legislation for com- mittees, subcommittees, and individual Member s of Congress . These analyses may include advic e on fiscal and administrative aspects of the legis- lation, as well as discussions of legal inconsis- tencies or technical difficulties presented by th e legislative `language . Such analyses may als o include discussions of the prospective effect o n GAO if the legislation were enacted . We also respond informally to literall y hundreds of questions raised by the staffs o f committees and individual Members and provid e legal advice and propose drafts of legislation . We frequently prepare testimony or state- ments for presentation during hearings Wor e congressional committees and prepare decision s to the heads of Federal agencies which involv e the construction of particular statutes and th e availability of appropriated funds for variou s purposes : Finally, our attorneys prepare advanc e 18decisions for certifying officers of Federa l agencies on the legal propriety of certifyin g vouchers for payment and for individual `claim - ants who may request a review of claims settle- ments issued by GAO . The following examples illustrate the man y questions answered within the past year . In January 1971 the Congress enacted legisla- tion, amended in February of 1972, which re- quired that all excess defense articles granted t o foreign countries over and above specifie d amounts be charged against N-lilitary Aid Pro - gram funds . This legislation was further amend- ed in December of 1973 to require that al l domestically generated defense articles b e charged against Military Aid Program funds bu t to require such charging for foreign-generate d defense articles only after a specified ceiling ha d been reached . The Assistant Secretary of De- fense asked the Comptroller General to decide i f the 1973 act, as it related to excess defens e articles, was effective as of the beginning of th e current fiscal year (July 1, 1973) or as of th e date's enactment . We held that the intent o f Congress was to apply that law to the entir e fiscal year . (B-178205, Mar . 8, 1974 .) We sent an advisory opinion to Senato r Richard S . Schweiker on the waiver authority o f section 2 (b) (2) of the Export-Import Bank Ac t which prohibits the Bank from guaranteeing , insuring, or extending credit in connection wit h the purchase or lease of any product by a Com- munist country except \"* * * in the case of an y transaction which the President determine s would be in the national interest * * \"Me con- cluded that the waiver authority was not satis- fied by a single blanket presidential determina- tion that the Bank's participation in any and al l potential transactions involving a particula r Communist country\u2014in this case the Sovie t Union\u2014would be in the national interest . Another matter involved the unauthorize d seizure of the Bureau of Indian Affairs buildin g in November of 1972 . We held that the cost o f providing food to a special group of Federa l Protective Officers who were assembled an d kept ready throughout the emergency could b e reimbursed in view of the danger to human lif e and the destruction of , Federal property in- volved, despite the general rule that in the ab- sence of authorizing legislation the cost of meal s furnished to Government employees may notbe paid with .appropriated funds (B-177900, Aug . 2, 1973, 53 Comp .Gen. 72) . At the urging of two Members of Congress ,the Department of State requested the Comp - troller General to review the legality of an exces s rupee agreement negotiated ; with India . After re - viewing the Mondale-Poage amendment relatin g to excess foreign currencies, we stated that GA O would not object to the agreement but we be- lieved that congressional clarification of th e applicable statutes should be obtained befor e the United 'States entered into anysimilar agree - merits . (B-146749, Feb .' 26, 1974 .) Procurement Law In the past fiscal year, our procurement la w attorneys devoted about 30 percent of thei r efforts to questions relating to the acquisition , lease, sale, or disposition by the Government o f its goods, services, equipment, buildings, o r other facilities . They devoted the remaining 7 0 percent to processing bid protests . In this latte r area, because our decisions are significant t o parties both inside and outside the Governmen t as guides and precedents, we concluded an ar- rangement with two commercial organization s to publish `all procurement law decisions at n o cost to GAO . This arrangement makes the ful l body of our agency-developed law available t o anyone . Procurement Law Bid Protest s GAO bid protest procedures provide an in - dependent and unbiased forum for timely an d inexpensive resolution of complaints by partie s aggrieved by agency procurement actions . Statis- tics on our bid protest work follow .

This act require s Federal agencies to report the actions taken as a result of any recommendations made by GAO t o the head of any agency . The following cases illustrate our work durin g 1974 . Perhaps no bid protest involved a greate r complexity of factual data or caused mor e congressional interest than did the Lockhee d protest of NASA's selection of a contractor fo r the $800 million solid rocket motor phase of it s space shuttle program . Analyzing the volum- inous material leading to NASA's decisio n dictated a novel and unusual approach, with th e formation of a team composed of our attorneys , representatives from the Transportation ` an d Claims Division, the Procurement and System s 19 LEGAL SERVICE S -Acquisition Division, and auditors from our At- lanta Regional Office . Based on the team' s analysis andreview, it was determined that ther e would be \"asubstantial net decrease in probabl e cost difference between the two lower bidder s and that NASA should determine on this basi s whether the selection of the prime contracto r should be reconsidered . (B-173677, ;June to bepublished in53 Comp . Gen .) An Air Force contract for maintenance of th e Presidential aircraft fleet did not include wag e rates required by the Service Contract Act be - cause the procuring agency had determined tha t the contract was notsubject to the act . Fol- lowing award of the contract, the Department o f Labor held that the contract was subject to th e act. We decided the contract was not illegal, not - withstanding Labor's holding since the Ai r Force's determination of nonapplicability wa s made in good faith and on a reasonable basis . How =ever, we recommended to the Secretary o f Labor the development of a regulation whic h would provide for applying Service Contract Ac t wage rates in situations where the Departmen t of Labor, after the award of a contract, dis- agreed with the procuring agency 's good fait h determination ofthe inapplicability of the Act . In another case under the Service Contrac t Act, we were asked to determine whether th e act applied to clerical \"white collar\" employee s and `whether the \"locality\" (the basis for th e wage- determination) was the place of contrac t performance orthe site of the installation whic h procured the services . In 53 Comp . Gen . 370 (197.3), we concluded that the act did not appl y to \"white collar\" employees and the \"locality \" was the place of contractt performance . How - ever, we took no action since we could not stat e that the contrary interpretation by the Labo r Department was illegal . Our interpretations wer e upheld by the U .S. District Court for the Dis- trict of Delaware in the case of Descomp, Inc.v. Sampson . Inasolicitation for bids to perform dredgin g work restricted to small business concerns, w e held that aprovision inthe Armed Service s ProcUrement Regulation requiring a bidder t o certify its -intention to use a small busines s dredge for 40 percent ofthe dredging wor k advertised' was an unauthorized size standar d since, under the `appropriate statutes, the Smal l Business Administration had exclusive statutoryauthority to establish small business size stan- dards . (B-180196, June 4, 1974, to be publishe d in 53 Comp . Gen .) In another interpretation of the Service Con - tract Act, we held that the Department of Labo r could consider the claim of a number of labo r unions that the wage scale established in thei r collective bargaining agreement with a con - tractor, upon which the contract had bee n awarded, was lower than the prevailing wag e scale in the locality and that the Departmen t could also issue a revised wage determinatio n which would apply to the ,contract presently i n effect . We recommended to the Secretary o f Labor the development of a regulation to pro - vide for applying such revised wage determina- tions to existing contracts . (B-179871, Dec . 3, 1973, to be published in 53 Comp . Gen .) In another matter involving NASA, we hel d that the record supported its determination tha t only one source could meet the required de - livery schedule for weather observation satel- lites, upholding the agency's decision to procur e these without competitive bidding . We als o rejected a contention that concern for timel y performance justified a noncompetitive procure- ment only under the circumstances set forth i n 10 U .S.C. 2304 (a) (2) . (B-179815, Mar . 14 , 1974, to be published in 53 Comp . Gen .). Personnel Lo w Civilian Personne l A varied and ever-increasing body of statutes , administrative regulations, and instructions in- sures fair and equitable treatment to civilia n employees of the Federal Government in ques- tions about their rights and entitlements . Thi s body of law controls such matters as severance , overtime, holiday, Sunday, night, and environ- ment differential compensation ; the reimburse- ment of travel, transportation, and relocatio n expenses ; vacation and sick leave ; removal fro m service ; and numerous general personnel manage- ment matters . Agency heads and other Government official s doubtful about the propriety of making an y such payments may seek an advance determina- tion by the Comptroller General . The Comp - troller General provides a convenient an d inexpensive forum where Federal employee s may present their claims for such compensatio n 20 or:benefits and have them adjudicated on th e basis of their legal entitlement . The following examples illustrate the variet y of civilian personnel decisions rendered durin g the past year . In accordance with thetwo-thirds rule, whic h provides that ineach 24-hour period only 1 6 hours may be duty time, we held that employee s who were required toperform overnight standb y duty at aremote facility may receive overtim e compensation, even though they performed n o actual work during non-duty hours . (B-170264 , Dec .1973 .) We decided that an employee was entitled t o environment differential pay when he wa s obliged to work in a cold storage area, eve n though hisagency supplied protective clothin g to alleviate his discomfort . (B-180109, Apr . 24 , 1974, to be published in53Comp .Gen .) We held, in a case involving 3,000 claims by past and present members of the Federal Protec- tive Service, that these officers were to be al - lowed amaximum of 15 minutes in which t o change their uniforms, with an additional 4 minutes to draw their weapons on each shif t where their work required this in preparation fo r their tours of duty . (B-158549, Jan . 22, 1974 , to be published in53Comp .Gen .) When aFederal employee had been reinstate d following his separation, which was later deter - mined tohave been unjustified, we decided tha t income which he had received from the publica- tion of abook during his separation need not b e deducted from salary owed him by the Govern- ment, provided that he was engaged in writin g and preparing the hook before the date ofhis separation . (B-162578, May 6, 1974, to b e published in 53 Comp . Gen .) Inacase involving a claim for travel, we deter - mined that the responsible agency official wh o had ordered anemployee : to perform non-duty- time travel for which overtime was not author- ized must record his reasons for such an order . (B-179503, Jan . 21, 1974) . In answer to requests by Senate and Hous e committees tocomment on pending legislatio n which -would ' increase mileage and per die m allowances for Federal employees, we recom - mcnded considering a new procedure to adjust , on a contin~ .:ting basis, the maximum authorize d travel allowance without further and particularLEGAL SERVICE S legislation for each future increase . (B-5019 , June 4 and June 26, 1974 .) Military Personne l The complex system of statutes, regulations , and military instructions which govern the en- titlement of members of the U .S. Armed Force s to pay and allowances also applies to the U .S. Coast Guard, commissioned officers of th e Public Health Service, and commissioned of- ficers of the National Oceanic and Atmospheri c Administration . Since the Armed Forces stil l comprise the largest single institution in th e Federal Government, the pay, allowances, an d benefits of its members continue to be asub- stantial and vital expenditure of Federal funds . Our decisions in the military personnel are a involve such matters as marriage, divorce, an d inheritance rights under domestic and foreig n statutes and deal with a variety of questions re- lating to pay, allowances for travel and transpor- tation, and retirement benefits for members o f the Armed Forces and their dependents . Thes e questions are often prompted by court decision s which establish a broad mandate in a relate d field . Thus, in Frontiero v . Richardson, 411 U .S. 677 (1973), the U .S. Supreme Court held tha t certain provisions of laws relating to allowance s and benefits provided to military personnel un- constitutionally discriminated between th e sexes . This case produced many military fisca l questions ; in 53 Comp . Gen . 148 (1973), w e held that the non-discrimination policy shoul d be broadly applied . When a candidate for the Air Force Academy , before being sworn in as a cadet ;had been give n a physical examination which disclosed a sickl e cell anemia trait prohibiting his admission, w e decided that he wasentitled to the appropriat e travel allowances, even though these were no t specificially authorized by law, since such a n individual should be accorded the same allow- ances as any other applicant rejected for-admis- sion to the uniformed services . (B-179331, Oct . 19, 1973, to be published in 53 Comp .Gen .) In a submarine pay case, we held that th e statute which authorized submarine pay to th e off-ship crew of a nuclear-powered, 2-crew sub - marine also permits payment of this allowanc e to a special 14-man augmentation crew whic h LEGAL SERVICES It/.null Wilcox (seated), Victor B . Goddard, Douglas Faulkner, and Brian Harris research an article for The GAO REVIEW . had \"come aboard to allow regular members of domestic and international movement of Gov - the on-ship crew to remain ashore for training ernment shipments and personnel by air, motor , and rehabilitation .

This isa broad-scale first step in re - vitalizing surface transportation inthe Unite d States and affects railroads, the motor carrie r industry, barge lines, and freight forwarders . Our comprehensive report included a suggestion tha t the bill include an amendment to the Interstat e Commerce Act to facilitate the recovery o f reparations against carriers . Similarly, we;reported on the Rolling Stoc k Utilization and 'Financing Act of 1973 (H .R. 6777) which would deal with the freight ca r shortage problem in the railroad industry b y increasing the supply of rolling stock and im- proving itsuse. - Our contract work 'included a case involvin g the movement of a tug and barge under a con - tract that was cancelled because the contracto r did not have therequired Interstate Commerc e Commission operating authority . We held tha t the amount paid out by the contractor for serv- ices performed before the cancellation was no t reimbursable because there is noauthority fo r agents of the Government towaive provisions o f statutes .Further, we held that nobenefit ac- crued to the Government which would warran t payment onaquantum meruit basis . (B-178307 , Feb. 1974, to bepublished in 53 Comp . Gen .) An unusual case which we decided involved a claim against a carrier forthe value of antiqu e Imari and Kutani Japanese porcelains lost in th e transit of an Air Force : officer's househol d goods . The value of the porcelains ($11,000 ) was recovered by setoff against the carrier, wh o denied liability because the porcelains were no t declared to have extraordinary value . We als o found that a judicial decision that silverware i s an article of extraordinary value within th e meaning of the exclusionary provision of th e carrier's tariff was consistent with our decisio n and afforded noauthority for a holding that antique oriental porcelains had the same charac- teristics of negotiability incommerce as silver o r silver products .

Gen .)LEGAL SERV ICE S Our attorneys made a substantial contributio n to the successful resolution of alandmark cas e involving the so-called port terminal charge . On January 17, 1974, the U .S. Court of Appeals fo r the District of Columbia affirmed the judgmen t of the U .S. District `Court forthe District o f Columbia and stated that it agreed with the re- sult reached by the Interstate Commerc\u00b0 Com- mission inthe case of United States v. S ? here Pacific Company, 337 I .C.C. 504 (1970) . Th e Commission had held that export rates ina transcontinental tariff slid not apply to shipsid e on shipments which had moved through a U .S. Government facility at a Pacific Coast port an d therefore the port terminal charge was not appli- cable . This case may successfully be used as a precedent in settling the freight charges on thou - sands of other shipments exported throug h Government facilities at Pacific Coast ports . Special Studies and Analysi s The primary purpose of our Special Studie s and Analysis group has been toprovide a com- plete in-house counsel service to the 3,50 0 professionals inGAO's offices and divisions . In the past year these attorneys have provided lega l advice to GAO 's increasing contracting effor t considered the legal implications of responses b y executive branch agencies to the recommenda- tions of the Commission on Government Pro- curement, helped prepare and support the firs t bills in nearly 25 years to make major amend- ments to GAO's statutory authorities and pre - pared study papers on various legal and polic y topics . The variety of legal matters handled b y these attorneys is as diversified as the work o f the offices and divisions which comprise GAO . Some examples of this work follow . The Joint Committee on Internal Revenu e Taxation requested GAO to review the policie s and procedures of the Internal Revenue Service . Our attorneys worked with General Governmen t Division staff members to identify legal issue s and analyze legislative histories concerning the , intent of Congress with respect to certain pro - visions of the Internal Revenue Code . We als o provided legal advice in response to various ques- tions raised by the audit division . For instance , we advised that cashing and collecting a chec k tendered by a taxpayer in full settlement of a 23 LEGALSERV ICE S tax claim does not constitute an accord an d satisfaction under the -Internal Revenue Code, s o astocut off the taxpayer's rights of appeal or t o bar the Internal Revenge Service from assessin g an additional deficiency . A GAO operating division brought to ou r attention certain facts which it had gathered i n response to a congressional interest in the rat e setting practices of the Federal Power Commis- sion. We believed that these facts indicate d possible \"violations of the Natural Gas Act an d also that 'financial interests held by some Com- mission employees violated the Commission 's conflict-of-interest regulations . A GAO division informed us of the circum- stances of asettlement by the Veterans Adminis- tration of a $10 million claim . The legal issue s presented ' by these facts ultimately resulted i n legislation which constrained the agency 's use o f appropriated funds by installing safeguards t o insure the legitimacy of claims before fina l settlement . Our attorneys provided continuing legal sup - port in a `review of the implementation of th e Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 by th e Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms of th e Department of the Treasury . The conclusio n which wereached about the intent of Congres s led to a change inregulations by the Burea u which governed applications for licenses to dea l inexplosives . Legg!Reference Service s The Index-Digest, Index and Files, and th e Legislative Digest Sections of Legal Referenc e Services provide a complete support service t o assist our attorneys and the staffs of other GA O divisions and offices in carrying out their dail y work . Legal Reference Services issues numerou s periodicals to keep GAO personnel, Governmen t agencies and departments, and private secto r organizations informed of legislative or lega l developments pertaining to GAO which woul d affect their special interests . Thus, we distribut e adv~uice copies' of decisions and digests, prepar e monthly pamphlets summarizing decisions i n particular areas, prepare an annual volume o f decisions' which illustrate novel and significantS{~/.null i 041 . Index-Digest Section ofLegal Reference Services . points of law or which otherwise are of wide - spread interest and applicability throughout -the Government, and serve as a clearinghouse for th e distribution of legislation introduced and bein g considered by the Congress . On a regular basis we make copies of ou r procurement law decisions available for com- mercial publication . The text of all publishe d decisions and digests of all unpublished ones ar e systematically sent to the Air Force Accountin g and Finance Center in Denver, Colorado, fo r inclusion in its computerized research service . Project LITE (Legal Information Through Elec- tronics) . Our Index-Digest Section annotates an d cross -references all decisions, maintains a n elaborate card index file, and provides telephon e and personal research services . In the ;past yea r its employees processed 3,912 research inquirie s and distributed 40,307 copies of our decisions . The Index and Files Section logs, indexes , cross-references and processes all incoming an d outgoing correspondence and prepares dail y reports of all these matters to inform GAO' s offices and divisions about our activities . Thi s year its personnel processed 67,361 pieces o f incoming correspondence and sent out 17,63 5 decisions, reports, and letters . During fiscal year 1974 the Legislative Diges t Section prepared 9,999 legislative history file s on all public and private bills introduced in th e first and second sessions of the 93d Congres s and processed requests for reports on 533 bill s froin committees and individual Members o f Congress . 24 General's accounting principles and standard s and settling the accounts of accountable o f ficers, except for military disbursing officers .

This division is under the supervision o f Donald L . Scantlebury, director, and Fred D . Layton, deputy director . Its organization char t appears on the following page . HNAN I A GENERA L MANAGEMENT STUDIE S Responsibilitie s The F i nai,cial and General Managemen t Studies Division has the following principa l functions :` Cooperating with the Treasury Departmen t and the Office of Management and Budget i n improving and standardizing the fiscal, budg- etary, and program information systems o f the Federal Government in servicing congres- sional andexecutive branch needs . Establishing and testing methods of progra m evaluation and `helping committees to defin e their needs in legislation for evaluation . Providing expert technical and advisory serv- ices in thefields of automatic data processing , systems analysis, actuarial science, and statis- tical science . Participating intheJoint Financial Manage- inent Improvement Program . Helping Government agencies develop ac - counting systems that meet the principles an d standards prescribed by the Comptrolle r General . Reviewing agency accounting systems in oper- ation forconformity with the ComptrollerIn fiscal vear 1974 the division received a total of 114 congressional requests for assist- ance, 41 from congressional committees and 7 3 from Members of Congress . Improving Fiscal, Budgetary, an d Program Information System s Sections 201 and 202 of the Legislative Re - organization Act of 1970 as they existed at th e beginning of fiscal year 1974 required the Secre - tary of the Treasury and the Director of th e Office c,f Management and Budget, with GA O cooperation, to develop, establish, and maintai n (1)a standardized information and data pro- cessing system for budgetary and fiscal data an d (2)standard classifications of Federal programs , activities, receipts, and expenditures . As agent of the Congress, GAO insures tha t congressional interests are adequately repre- sented and considered by the Office of Manage- ment and Budget and the Treasury in developin g the required information and classification sys- tems. This developmental effort requires th e coordination of allelements of the Federa l Government in serving congressional and execu- tive branch needs . We notified the Congress in fiscal year 197 3 that the ongoing and planned efforts of th e executive branch would not fulfill the informa- tion needs of the Congress and suggested severa l actions that could be taken by the executiv e branch including the development ofa compre- hensive plan for coordinated systems develop- ment .Congressional Assistance In response to the congressional needs re- ferred to in ourreport, the Office of Manage- ment and Budget and the Treasury formed th e Legislative Reorganization Act Implementatio n Planning Team in June 1973 . That team for - warded its plan to the Congress on March 7 , 1974 . We monitored the team's activities an d the plan included some of our suggestions . Wecontinued- our attempts to define th e specific requirements of congressional users o f fiscal and budgetary data and to develop con- sistent program structures for reporting o n various Federal activities . The initial require- ments for information about programs of th e Department of Housing and Urban Developmen t have been completed . Asimilar attempt to con- sider the congressional information needs o n activities ofvarious programs of the Departmen t of Agriculture is well underway . The Congressional Budget and Impoundmen t Control Act of 1974 included amendments t o the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 an d shifted primary responsibility to the Comp - troller General for developing standard classifica- tions and for assisting the Congress to obtai n and use data . We are building the capabilities t o carry out these new responsibilities to mos t effectively, meet the needs of the Congress , especially the new congressional budget com- mittees and the new congressional budget offic e created by the act . Several related efforts were performed durin g the year pursuant to congressional requests . Examples of this work follow . Usefulness ofReports Submitted t o The Congress by Executive Agencie s In response to arequest of the Chairman , House Committee on Government Operations , westudied and recommended improvements i n orelimination of certain recurring reports sub- mitted to the Congress by executive depart - merits or agencies . We identified 747 recurrin g reports based oninformation provided by 6 8 executive departments, agencies, councils, an d commissions . We identified 54 reports which th e congressional committees _indicated they n o longer needed . Cost data provided by the pre - paring agencies indicated that eliminating 39 o f the 54 resorts would save about $222,000 aFINANCIAL AND GENERAL MANAGEMENT STUDIE S year. The agencies did not giveus cost data fo r the other 15 reports . (B-115398, Oct . 26, 1973 .) Budget Scorekeeping Report Documente d In January 1974, we completed a descriptio n of the scorekeeping process ofthe joint Com- mittee on Reduction of Federal Expenditures . Since 1968 this committee has produced th e \"Budget Scorekeeping Report\" which is de - signed to show the dollar impact of \"congres- sional actions or inactions in the current sessio n on the President's budget estimates for ne w authority, outlays and receipts .\" In this stud y we documented the specific' budget scorekeepin g activities of the joint Committee . Ina followo n effort we provided assistance tothe Comi :.ittee in its efforts to assess the feasibility of applyin g automated techniques to the process . S- to 5-Year Projections of Outlays Studie d At the request of the Chairman, House Com- mittee on Appropriations, we are surveyin g various agencies to determine the availability o f 3- to 5-year projections of selected major Fed- eral outlay programs, primarily those for whic h annual appropriation action by the Congress i s not necessary . The House Committee onAppro- priations wants to keep `better track of th e Federal Government 's fiscal commitments over a 3- to 5-year period . We also provided assistance to the Hous e Information Systems staff in obtaining and utilizing Federal budget and Federal outla y computer tapes from the Office of Managemen t and Budget . Feasibility of Linking Authorizations , Appropriations, Committee Jurisdictions , And Agency Program s At the request of the Chairman, Select Com- mittee on Committees, House of Representa- tives, we participated ina task group, comprisin g representatives of GAO, the Committee, an d selected experts, which was formed to study th e feasibility of creating a_ system of classificatio n codes for linking authorizations, appropriations , committee jurisdictions, and agency programs . 27 FINANCIALAND GENERAL MANAGEMENT STUDIE S During fiscal year 1974 the task group issue d two progress reports to the Chairman . The firs t progress report (July . 1973) concluded that th e creation of the capability to link authorizations , appropriations, committee jurisdictions, an d agency programs to the basic statutes was feasi- ble. The second progress report (Decembe r 1973) provided . an example of a cross-refer- encing, or linking, capability .The task group wa s directed to continue the study to determine th e costs andresources that would be necessary fo r such a-system to be developed, established, an d maintained . Program Evaluatio n Our systems analysis staff is responsible fo r special studies concerning program evaluatio n and for making related reviews at the reques t of congressional committees and Members o f Congress .For example, this staff has assiste d congressional committees, in cooperation wit h theOfiice of General Counsel, to formulat e language for establishing legislative requirement s for evaluation by the executive agencies an d reporting to the Congress or its committees . Other work of this staff relates to the locatio n and organization of information on the state o f the art inanalysis and evaluation . For example , information has-been collected on the scope an d possible uses of a number of computer model s available on such subjects as energy, transporta- tion, and logistics which have been designed b y various public agencies and private firms . A star t has als~ been made on suggested criteria an d methods for the conduct of evaluation studies . Views of various experts and representatives o f professional societies and Federal, State, an d local units of government are being obtained t o insure that this work isresponsive to the need s of the various users of program evaluation . <Federally Chartered _Organization s Several organizations such as the Civil Ai r Patrol, the National Safety Council, the Unite d States Olympic Committee, and the Boys' Clu b of America were established under Federa l charters and must comply with the financia l reporting requirements of Public Law 88-504 . These organizations are audited by public ac- 28countants and the reports are submitted to th e Chairman of the House Committee on the Juai- ciary . Under an agreement with the Chairman , GAO reviews these audit reports and comment s on their compliance with the statute . We re - viewed 11 such audit reports in fiscal year 1974 . Technical Assistance Service s In March 1974 the Technical Assistanc e Group was established to centrally combine al l staff members in this division who are primaril y responsible for providing expert technical ad- visory services to other GAO divisions an d offices . This group provides a central analytica l capability which supports work of other divi- sions in accordance with Section 204 of th e Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970, a s amended, which requires GAO to conduct re - views and evaluations of Government programs . Such services are in the fields of system analysis , automatic data processing, actuarial science, an d statistical science . This group also keeps abreast of new develop- ments in these specialized areas and promotes a n internal capability to apply new methods an d techniques to the GAO auditing role . The grou p also provides instructors and materials fo r training auditors in the uses of systems analysis . Joint Financial Managemen t Improvement Progra m The Joint Financial Management Improve- ment Program, which has been in operatio n since 1948, is a Government-wide cooperativ e effort of all Federal agencies to promote th e development and maintenance of useful finan- cial management systems . Leadership is provide d by the five principals of the program\u2014the Comp - troller General, the Secretary of the Treasury , the director of the Office of Management an d Budget, the Chairman of the Civil Service Com- mission, and the Administrator of General Serv- ices . These principals furnish broad policy guid- ance.

These chaptersFINANCIAL AND GENERAL MANAt r-MrN 1 - I LJUI - contain the pay, leave, allowance, and fisca l procedures to be observed by Federal agencies . The Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950 requires GAO to review executiv e agency accounting systems in operation fro m time to time . The objectives of these reviews ar e to (1) ascertain whether accounting system s comply with the principles, standards, and re- lated requirements prescribed by the Comp - troller General, (2) identify areas needing im - provement and cncourage fui then developmen t by the agencies, (3) identify ways to improv e overall financial management, and (4) settle th e accounts of accountable officers . Adequate accounting information is an impor- tant tool for effective management . Therefor e we are concerned that the information produce d by accounting systems be useful to, and he use d by, management . Also, after an accounting system design i s approved, we follow up on the agency's installa- tion and operation of the system . If the syste m isnot put into operation promptly or has bee n adversely modified, werecommend that th e agency take corrective action . When specifi c financial policies needing corrective action hav e been identified during our followup work, the y are frequently made the subject of separat e reports . We sent 42 reports to executive agency of- ficials and 1 report to the Congress on selecte d aspects of accounting system operations durin g fiscal year 1974 . In these reports werecom- mended actions designed to (1) improve th e Department of the Treasury's program forthe safekeeping ofU.S. Savings Bonds, (2) improv e the efficiency of the Small Business Administra- tion's loan accounting operations, (3) reduce th e cost of Treasury borrowing by reducing ; th e amounts of cash kept onhand by military fi- nance offices, (4) improve the accounting for , funding, and disclosure of the costs of main - taming unutilized and underutilized plant an d equipment in the Department of Defense, and (5) improve controls in Defense automated civil- ian payroll systems . 31Review of Accounting System s in Operation FINANCIAL AND GENERAL MANAGEMENT STUDIE S Approval date designs standard s CIVIL DEPARTMENTS .AND AGE-N 70ES INDEPENDENT AGENCIES - Department of Agriculture : Environmental Protectio n Soil Conservation Service /.null 3.29-74 Agency/.null 12.12-73 National Science Foundation -Department of Health, Education Payroll/.null 5-16-7 4 and Welfar e Food and Drug Administration /.null 6-18.74 Smali Business Administration-Pavi oil/.null 6-28-7 4 MILITARY DEPARTMENT S Department of the Interior : Bonneville Power Administration /.null 12.21-73 Department of the Air Force Medical Materiel/.null Bureau /.null 6-26-74 Uniformed Services Saving s Deposit Program/.null 1-'.'8-74 Department of Justice : Academy Cadet Pay/.null 3-18-7 4 Bureau, of Prisons/.null 6-25-74 Joint Uniform Military Pay System /.null 6- 6-7 4 Department ofTransportation : Department of the Army : Office of the Secretary /.null 3-18-74 Joint Uniform Military Pay System/.null 10.24-73 Department of the Navy : Public Works Centers /.null 3-29-7 4 Department of the Treasury : Working Capital Fund /.null 2-19-74 Office ofthe Secretary and Defens e Internal `Revenue Service : Agencies : Tax Lien Revolving Fund /.null 3-21-74 Principles and Standards /.null 1.10-74 Revenue Accounting /.null 6-27-74 Defense Supply Agency - Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Standard Automated Materie l an(' Firearms ` :/.null 5-17-74 Management System /.null 12-12 .71 At Jli ie 30, 1974, reviews of 15 'accounting initiated a program of safekeeping, on request , systems in operation were in process .

An - other objective is to strengthen capabilities in this highly technical area to enable usto bette r serve the Congress, assist other Federal agencies , and provide technical assistance in the audit o f Federal programs and operations . Our automatic data processing staff is respon- sible for performing such studies and for pro- viding instructors and materials and developin g generalized and specialized training in compute r system auditing . Examples of reports completed in this com- plex field follow . Tools and Techniques for Improving Computer Efficienc y Increasing the operational efficiency of com- puters can produce significant savings . We re - viewed 43 computer installations to identif y how modern tools and techniques could be use d to improve efficiency and reduce operatin g costs . We found several installations which re- duced their operating costs substantially b y improving the efficiency of their computers . We believe that the managers of all Federa l computer installations should be provided wit h specific information andguidance on improvin g the efficiency of their operations . To provid e this information ; we prepared a report discussin g sorne tools and `techniques forimproving com- puter efficiency and pointing out the saving s achieved by several installations .We also recom- mended that the General Services Administra - tion (1) issue detailed guidance -to agencies onmethods to improve computer systems' effi- ciency and (2) consider whether an agency ha s tried to improve the efficiency of its computer s before approving additional acquisitions . The General Services Administration generall y agreed with our recommendations and is takin g steps to implement them . (B-115369, June 3 , 1974 .) Efforts to Standardize Data Element s And Codes for Computer System s Despite advances in computer technology , most data is exchanged between Federal agen- cies inhard-copy form (paper) . Data collecte d for computer-based systems can beused in man y ways . Once collected and deposited in a Federa l computer system, it can be transferred from one agency to another . Rarely is data transferred i n total to another Federal computer system . How - ever, it can be transferred if originally collecte d and recorded in astandardized agreed upo n fashion .. Standardization of data elements and code s could help reduce high costs of Federal com- puter operations by eliminating unnecessar y duplication and incompatabilities in collecting , processing, and disseminating data . We suggested that the Secretary of Commerc e (1) determine where standards would be mos t beneficial and establish standardization prior- ities, (2) issue policy statements to agencie s delineating accepted theory and terminolog y and provide for preparation of guidelines , methodology, and criteria to be followed b y agencies in their standardization efforts, (3 ) assign to specific agencies responsibilities fo r developing standard data elements and codes i n specified areas, and (4) monitor implementatio n of data standards to insure their uniform adop- tion and use . (B-115369, May 16, 1974 .) Information Systems of th e Social Security Administratio n Need Redesig n We reviewed the Social Security Administra- tio*i's information systems to determine whethe r they have remained current with technologica l developments . These systems process claim s which result in the issuance of benefit checks 36 the only income for many aged ordisable d people ; Changes inlegislation have greatly increase d the workload of this agency's information pro- cessing `systems . Its inventory of computers ha s grov!n from 3 in 1960 to51 in 1973 . Its equip- ment had an installed value of $61` million as o f March 1973 and the annual cost to operate th e systems exceeded $60 million . We concluded that its information system s could bemade more efficient if, they were rede- signed to take advantage of modern compute r technology . To achieve this, werecommende d that the agency (1) establish long-range goal s and objectives to guide system designers, (2 ) establish a systems planning group todesign a new information processing system, and (3 ) direct the system designers to examine alterna - tive methods for storing, maintaining, an d processing files and programs . (B-164031(4 ) Apr. 19, 1974 .) The `Department of Health, Education, an d Welfare, agreed to pursue these matters . Computer-based Information System s We are continuing our efforts to bring to- gether governmental, private sector, and publi c interest groups concerned with computer-base d information systems tohelp us develop guide - lines for managing, controlling, and evaluatin g these systems .Our current emphasis is onthe cost accounting forcomputer-based informatio n system development and operation . Also we are developing and testing new ap - proaches to the evaluation of computer system s using GAO personnel from several divisions .For example, a study now nearing completion wa s made of the computer-based systems at th e Government Printing Office . We made numerou s proposals formodernizing major systems in- volving inventory control, financial manage- ment, and printing operations . Audit Standard s The issuance by the Comptroller General o n August 1, 1972, of the statement entitled \"Stan- dards for Audit of Governmental Organization , Programs, Activities, and Functions\" was th e :first step in the long process of strengthening theFINANCIAL AND GENERAL MANAGEMENT STUDIE S audit of governmental programs and activities a t all levels of government . Intergovernmental Audit Cooperatio n During the year a review of 10 Federal agen- cies in 15 States was performed to assess th e degree of cooperation existing between Federal , State, and local auditors inreducing duplicativ e audit work. We found several instances wher e Federal agencies did use State audits tosatisf y their requirements . For themost part, however , coordination of Federal and State auditing wa s far short of what is attainable .We reported on this situation explaining that greater intergovern- mental cooperation was needed for more effec- tive and less costly auditing ofgovernmen t programs . We recommended that the General Service s Administration take positive steps to promot e useof State and local audits tosatisfy Federa l requirements . The Administrator responde d affirmatively by issuing a government-wid e policy statement endorsing the GAO standard s and strengthening the requirement forintergov- ernmental audit coordination . Under the ne w provisions Federal agencies are required to rel y on State and local audits made in accordanc e with the standards . Furthermore, agencies ar e required to report on their progress in com- plying with the new provisions . (B-176544, Apr . 8, 1974 .) Other Project s State auditors are frequently requested b y Federal agencies to supply information on thei r organizations . The number of questionnaires , often requesting the same information, has be - come an annoyance and GAO has established a central data file to help solve this problem an d make current information on State audit opera- tions readily available from a single source . We are continuing to work on several project s designed to interpret and illustrate the standard s and promote their use and acceptance . Fo r example, aseries of booklets has been publishe d to promote auditing of the scope contemplate d by our audit standards .

Although this staff is GAO's focal point fo r energy matters, most of GAO's divisions an d regional offices are involved in reviews of energy - related matters . Section 12 of the Federal En- ergy Administration Act of 1974 makes th e Comptroller General specifically responsible fo r monitoring and evaluating the operations of th e Federal Energy Administration ; the act give s him access to data from public or private source s in th_ nossession or control of the Administra- tion . We have identified six areas through our audi t and analytical review work in which we believ e we can make a positive contribution to solvin g the Nation's energy problems : \u2014 Federal role in energy conservation . \u2014 Federal role asa proprietor of energ y resources . \u2014 Energy research and development . \u2014 Federal collection and analysis of energ y data . \u2014 Federal role in implementing and adminis- tering emergency energy programs . \u2014 International energy problems . 39 I_NERCY AND SPECIAL PROJECT S Our plans included preparing a series of \"energy ty energy-related reports were completed\u201417 t o advisory\" documents on these six areas designed the Congress, 'Members of Congress, and com - both to wide GAO's overall work on energy mittees and 3 to agency officials .

We reported that : For the most part, energy data is collecte d in connection with themissions of numer- ous individual agencies and is only inciden- tally related to current energy problems . Until very recently there was no centra l point of consolidation or analysis . Much' of the data, including some of th e most important, is voluntarily reported b y the energy industries . There is little verification of data . With limited exceptions only aggregate dat a isreported ; company data is\"confiden- tial. The only complete andcurrent informatio n onoiland gas reserves, including reserve s on Federal lands, is provided by non - Federal sources. - Reporting of energy data is not timely . \u2014' Terminology anddefinitions for reportin g arenotstandardized . We concluded that it would be feasible to estab- lish _an energy information system within th e executive branch to collect, analyze, and repor t current information onenergy supply and de- mand . Such a system would take several years t o establish and would require enabling legislation . (B-178205, Feb . 6, 1974 .) Solar Heating and Coolin g At the request of the Chairman, Subcom- mittee on Energy, House Committee on Scienc e and Astronautics, we collected information o n Federal and private solar energy activities \u2014 primarily solar heating andcooling . We reported on(1) Federal funding of sola r energy research development and demonstratio n activities, (2) objectives and goals of Federa l solar heating and cooling activities, (3) inter - agency coordination of Federal activities, (4 ) private-sector activities, and (5) economic eval- uations that have been made' of solar heating an d cooling, including - an examination of th e methods and data used . We concluded that determining the futur e economic feasibility of solar heating and coolin g is-a complex task which must be based on aENERGY AND SPECIAL PROJECT S number of factors . Two of the more importan t factors are conventional fuel prices and solar col- lector costs . (B-178726, June 18,1974 .) Foreign Sources of Oi l For the United State s This report discussed (1) the State Depart- ment's role in international petroleum matter s before hostilities in the Middle East inOctobe r 1973 and Arab curtailment of petroleum export s and (2) critical problems facing the Departmen t in resolving issues connected with current an d future availability of oil from sources outsid e the United States . Traditionally, the State Department has use d its influence and programs to promote an envi- ronment conducive to U .S. private investment in foreign countries . It generally has avoided direc t involvement in the nature, substance, and behav- ior of private industry . The report brings out that the State Depart- ment must play amajor role in developin g national energy policy and in influencing oi l negotiations . Its responsibilities in protecting th e Nation's interests in the rapidly evolving worl d energy situation obviously are important . It should, therefore, improve its capability to dea l effectively with energy-related problems . (B-179411, jan . 23, 1974 .) Experimental Technique s For Recovering Natural Gas Our report to the Congress contained infor- mation on the economic, technical, and environ- mental aspects of nuclear stimulation, massiv e hydraulic fracturing, and chemical explosiv e gas-recovery techniques . We identified severa l problems affecting the development and use o f energy resources-the resolution of which wil l depend upon the evaluation of reliable dat a which does notnow exist .These problems in- volve uncertainty about whether (l) fracture s created by nuclear explosives close, (2) recover y of gas using nuclear stimulation is compatibl e with underground mining of oil shale, and (3 ) enough water is available for massive hydrauli c fracturing and development of other minera l resources in the Rocky Mountain area . 41 ENERGY AND SPECIAL Giant tankers carrying crude oil and refined petroleum products crisscross the seven seas .

Both oil and oil-derived wealth were pote n tirl economic weapons of growing strength . (B-175334, Aug . 29, 1973 .) Fuel Conservation, inGovernmen t We surveyed Federal efforts to conserve fue l when moving men . and material since suc h efforts affect the Government's ability to pro - vide leadership in influencing private users t o conserve fuel .: During fiscal year 1973 the D e Tense Fuel Supply Center spent $1 .5billion to purchase 333 million barrels of petroleu m products-fcr military and civil agencies . Our sul-vey indicated` that genuine effort s were being made inthe Government toconserv e fuel. We did observe certain program manage - Yrent problems which required attention o r where improvements were possible . They in- cluded the need for (1) more adequate data t o measure the success of conservation actions, (2 ) an improved information system for collectin g this data, (3) abroadened role for individua l agencies' energy conservation officers, and (4) ' efforts to reduce motor ve'Zicle fuel consurnp - MD . We reported our observations and recom- mendation s tothe .\"Idministrator, Federa l Energy Administration, who generally agree d and stater! that corrective action was underway . (1,1-178205, Mar . 29, 1974 .) 44Audit Work in Proces s We are continuing to monitor the operation s of the Federal_ Energy Administration for th e Subcommittee on Reorganization, Research an d International Organizations, Senate Committe e on Government Operations, and continuin g work on Federal energy data activities for th e Senate Interior Committee . In the international energy area we wer e working on two reports at yearend-on U .S. activities related to the emerging Arab oil - monetary problem and on the natural gas impor t issue . Also, reviews were underway on : - Federal efforts to maximize the discover y and development of energy resources o n Federal lands and the Outer Continenta l Shelf , - Federal coal research programs , - Bureau of Reclamation 's geothermal devel- opment program , - Actions by Government contractors to im- prove the efficiency or minimize the con- sumption of energy, an d - Government actions to encourage th e procurement of recycled products to sav e energy . `testimony a- Hearing s In December 1973 the Comptroller Genera l testified before the Subcommittee onLegisla- tion and Military Operations, House Committe e on Government Operations, on the propose d Federal Energy Administration Act . We testified before the Subcommittee o n Activities of Regulatory Agencies Relating t o Small Business, House Select Committee o n Small- Business, and the Senate Committee o n Interior and Insular Affairs in January an d February 1974, respectively, on Federal energ y data collection . We also testified in Tune 1974 before th e joint Committee on Atomic Energy on th e future structure of the uranium enrichmen t industry to assist the Committee in its considera- tion of the possible need to establish an indepen- dent Government-owned uranium enrichmen t corporation . AWstan\u20ac a tothe Congres s In year 1974 provided astaff assis - tant tothe Subcommittee on Multinationa l Corporations, Senate Committee on Foreig n Relations, who testified onthe results of ana- lyzing the total earnings, profits, taxes, an d other expenses of the Arabian American Oi l Company (the world's largest oil-producing com- pany owned by Saudi Arabia andfour U .S. oil companies) . In July 1973 we assisted the joint Committe e on Atomic Energy inanalyzing various ap- proaches to the operation of uranium enrich- ment activities and onthe balance of payment s implications of sales of enriched uranium t o foreign users . The Committee referred to ou r analysis during hearings on the future structur e of the uranium enrichment industry . Regulatory Reports Revie w The Regulatory Reports Review Staff carrie s outthe responsibilities given GAO by sectio n 409 of Public Law 93-153 . This law, enacte d November 16, 1973, amended the Federal Re - ports Act to require usto review the collectio n of information by independent Federal regula- tory agencies to insure that information is ob- tained with a minimum burden on those busi- nesses\u2014particularly small businesses\u2014and per - sons ` required to provide the information . Th e amendments also seek to eliminate duplicat e data collection efforts and to insure that col- lected information is tabulated to maximize it s usefulness . The law requires GAO to revie w existing information -gathering _ practices of th e independent regulatory agencies as well as re - quests for additional information . The legislative history of the law identifie d seven agencies as independent Federal regulator y agencies \u2014Atomic- Energy Commission, Civi l Aeronautics Board, Federal Communication s Commission, Federal Power Commission , Federal Trade Commission, Interstate Com- merce Commission, andSecurities and Exchang e Commission . Since enactment, five additiona l agencies have been identified as being subject to the act\u2014Consumer Product Safety Commission , Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,ENERGY AND SPECIAL PKVJtt ;10 Federal Energy Administration, Federal Mari - time Commission, and National Labor Relation s Board . We published proposed regulations relating t o our new responsibilities in the Federal- Registe r for February 11, 1974, and solicited comment s from interested and affected parties . The fina l regulations were published on July 2, 1974 . Between November 16, 1973, and the end o f the fiscal year, we received 96 requests fro m various agencies for approval ofproposed re- porting or recordkeeping requirements . By Jun e 30, 1974, 79 of these had been approved an d the rest were pending . Testimony at Hearing s On April 24, 1974, we testified before the Subcommittee on Budgeting, Management an d Expenditures and the Subcommittee on Inter - governmental Relations of the Senate Com- mittee on Government Operations on the collec- tion and tabulation of information by Federa l agencies . Federal Trade Commission's Propose d Annual Line-of-Business Repor t The most significant of the submissions fo r clearance was the Line-of-Business report pro - gram which we received on March 27, 1974 , from the Federal Trade Commission . The Line- of-Business report will initially require 50 0 businesses to report by product line (line-of- business) those assets used in their manufac- turing process, their profits, their media adver- tising, and any research and development costs . The report had been under development for3 or 4 years and was the subject of extensive debat e andtwo public hearings . Upon receipt of the Commission's request, w e gave public notice of the submission and solic- ited written comments from all interested per - sons, organizations, public interest grou ps, an d affected businesses on the proposal aid prmride d time for oral comments . In addition, we sough t the advice and counsel of a number of experts . On May 13, 1974, we gave approval to th e report but limited the initial collection of dat a to 1 year . In addition, we directed the Corrlmis - 45 Economics and Budget Staf f In fiscal year 1975` the thrust of the ne w formed Economics and Budget Staff willbe I expand efforts in (1) the delineation of itwort :- program with initial emphasis in the energy are a but with alonger term focus designed to provid e appropriate support tothe budget evaluatio n and review needs of the Congress, including ; those most recently identified in the Congres- sional Budget and Impoundment Control Act o f 1974, (2) the development of an ongoing an d effective relationship with appropriate congres- sional committees, the new Congressiona l Budget Office, other components of the . legisla- tive branch, the executive branch, and relevan t organizations and groups within the privat e sector, (3) the hiring and training of professiona l staff .GNERGY AND SPECIAL PROJECT S S1011 to () ) conduct intensive discussions toad- vance the ease ;-and accuracy of the reporting an d (2) explore with other -Federal agencies th e possibility of fulfilling its needs withdata to ll- lected by those agencies .

Materiel Managemen t Department of Defense Stock Find s In Fiscal year 1972, Department of Defens e stock funds controlled inventories amounting to about $8 .5 billion and reported net sales o f about $10 .4 billion . Thesc funds finance an d hold inventories of repair parts, subsistence , fuel, and other consumable supplies for sale t o military units . Along with improved communications, trans- portation, and electronic data processing, stac k funds have contributed to better supply manage- ment . Significant reductions ininventory can b e directly attributable to stock fund management . Since stock funds operate with money_ gener - ated through sales, they should have greate r financial flexibility than programs funde d through direct appropriations . However, thi s flexibility has not been fully used ; Most stoc k funds are still subjected to appropriation-typ e controls .Moreover, purchasing constraint s imposed through apportionment of funds hav e interferred with the ability of stock funds t o provide effective customer support and have forced stock fund managers to resort to suc h poor business practices as buying less than optimum quantities and canceling purchas e orders . Stock funds should become revolvin g funds, enabling them to be more responsive to inventory requirements .Funds can be ade - quately controlled by means other _ than thos e for appropriations . 47 LOGISTICS AND COMMUNICATIONS iJ 46 DIRECTOR PROGRAM SUPPO P F.3SHAFERANDEVALUATIO N DEPUTY DIRECTORH.

MAINTENANCER 'CORDSMANAGEMEN TPROPERTY USE DISPOSAL The Department has urged the military serv- icestodiscontinue using a horizontal stock fun d system and to use instead a vertical stock fun d system . However, only the Air Force has in - dicatcd a willingness . The vertical system offer s several advantages over the horizontal system . \u2014Inventories can be reduced since the use r would get direct support from wholesal e stocks . \u2014Duplicate inventory functions can be elimi- nated . \u2014Specialized support depots operated by th e Defense Supply 'Agency can be eliminated . In recent years the military services hav e greatly expanded their stock ` funds by trans- ferring to -them ownership of materiel already i n thesupply system .Nevertheless, at least 74,00 0 additional items worth about $541 millio n should be instock funds .Many items not in- cluded are ofa reparable nature and have bee n excluded because the military services, excep t theArmy, were reluctant to include high-cos t items-in stock funds . Current policy allows customers to retur n materiel ifit (1) is needed elsewhere and (2) i s worth more than the cost- ofreturning it. Th e volume of returns-materiel totaling about $4 .5 billion was returned in fiscal years 1970, 1971 , and 1972--makes it essential that both factor s are considered . The Department of Defense agreed with ou r recommendations but asked for some additiona l time to comment further on the vertical stoc k fund concept . Implementation of this concep t would have far-reaching impact on current serv- ice structures . (B-159797, Apr . 2, 1974 .) Numerically Controlled 'Equipmen t Numerically controlled industrial equipmen t includes drills, mills, lathes, etc ., controlle d automatically by punched tape . It is expensiv e andcomplex but offers tremendous productivit y increases and savings inindustrial operations - particularly for small-lot production . We sur- military industrial activities' managemen t ofnumerically controlled industrial equipmen t and found they did not giveenough attention t o its use .The activities did not adequately pla n for, manage, or 'follow up on theuseofsuchLOGISTICS AND COMMUNICATION r holding 60tools .Itmachines, contours, and works on five side s of a part with only one setup . It costs at~out $450,000 . equipment and did not take advantage of re- ducing inventories of low-demand items . One o f the biggest problems facing users was a lack o f standardization in equipment . These conditions suggested that a more coor- dinated, active Department of Defense role was needed . We therefore suggested that the Secre- tary of Defense establish a centralized group t o coordinate the services' use of this type o f equipment and to work with private industry i n developing this field and in encouraging 'stan- dardization of hardware and software . Th e Department replied that it planned to establish a triservice group to improve numerically con - trolled equipment management and use and t o devote attention to standardization . We inten d to monitor this group . (B-140389, Sept . 24 , 1974 .) Central Control of Ammunitio n In ammunition logistics the Army and Nav y have the predominant Department ofDefens e management roles . They control Government - owned a m mtmition production plants an d storage facilities .Our review of key logistic s functions\u2014requirements determinations, procure- ment, production scheduling, and storage an d distribution\u2014showed that management was no t satisfactory in terms of economy and efficiency . We noted that : \u2014Improved exchange of information on avail - able ammunition could reduce funds appro- priated for procuring ammunition . 49 LOGISTICS AND COMMUNICATION S \u2014llore accurate budget requests could reduc e funds appropriated for procuring ammuni - Lion . \u2014Improved procurement operations coul d avoid interservice competition for th e Iimited private industrial capacities . --Defense-wide perspective in schedulin g production, modernization, and could eliminate ;competition for appro- priated funds . Improved storage and distribution manage- ment could reduce transportation an d handling costs . These objectives canbe reached by Defense - wide planning and by matching total require- ments with existing capabilities . Stronger centra l management could help attain this Defense-wid e perspective . We recommended that the Secretary o f Defense establish central management for all am - munition either by creating a new ammunitio n organization orby 'assigning this responsibilit y to one service . The Department agreed that Defense-wid e perspectives in_ ammunition management nee d improving . It believes that this can be attaine d by establishing a joint conventional ammunitio n production organization, consisting of a coor- dinating group and working committees oper- ating under the joint logistics commanders . Although it recognizes the inherent disad- vantages of such an organization, the Depart- ment wants to givethe organization an opportu- nity todemonstrate fully its managemen t capability before considering alternatives . Several alternative organizational concept s could be used to improve ammunition manage- ment, but we believe the organization describe d could work if it were given theresponsibilit y and staffing needed to obtain effective centra l control of ammunition . However, we strongl y recommended reconsideration of our suggestio n for a single ammunition manager . Sub.\u2014cquent to our report, the Assistant Secre- tary of Defense (Installations and Logistics ) directed (by memorandum dated June 4, 1974 ) that the joint logistics commanders draw upa plan to designate the Army as the single manage r for conventional ammunition . (B-176139, Dec . 6, 1973 .) soCancellation of Backorder s The military services could save more tha n $100 million annually in transportation an d handling costs and in material purchases b y more frequently and effectively validating un- filled orders and removing past demands, tisso- ciated with invalid orders, from requirement s coinputatioils . Unnecessary transportation and handlin g costs of about $15 .6 million were identifie d during itquarterly validation . These costs wer e incurred because invalid orders were not de- tected or were detected too late to stop ship- ment . Also, $22 million worth of material wer e purchased unnecessarily because invalid order s identified during the quarterly validations wer e not eliminated from past demand histories use d in requirements computations . The Department of Defense agreed with ou r findings and has taken or planned correctiv e actions which, it' properly carried out, shoul d bring about needed improvements . In fact, a one-time automatic cancellation of requisition s over ityear old canceled material orders value d at $45 million . (8-162152, May 24, 1974 .) Transfer of Items from the Arm y to the Defense Supply Agenc y Our tests of 35,000 items transferred fro m Army to Defense Supply Agency inventor y managers showed that, in fiscal years 1971 an d 1972, Agency managers made unnecessary buy s of about $3 .9 million worth of these items . Also , Agency managers experienced lengthy delays i n filling several thousand high-priority requisition s for these items\u2014some of which were needed b y combat troops in Vietnam . The unnecessary buys and delays occurre d because : \u2014The Army unnecessarily retained stock o r substantially delayed furnishing inventor y data to Agency managers . \u2014The Army furnished the Agency with inac- curate supply demand data on items trans- ferred . \u2014Agency managers either lost ordid not re - cord accountability data for inventories o f transferred items stored at Army depots . As a result of our review, twoArmy inventor y commands have provided theAgency with ac- countability information on about $12 .6 millio n worth ofinventories previously transferred . One of the Agency managers located $1 .2 millio n worth of needed stocks in an Army depot . The Dcpartnivrtt of Defense generally con- curred in our findings and cited -itnturnbcr o f actions taken or planned which should result i n many improvements . (B-1 6828, jan. 3, 1971 .) Realignment of Army Depot s The phascdown of operations in Southeas t Asia and the withdrawal of U .S. Forces resulte d in decreased activities atmany installations . We reviewed the functions atSharpe Army Depots isittest case to demon- strate that consolidation or realignment of depo t functions wits practical, feasible, and woul d result in savings . Other depots 'could absorb most of Sharpe' s workload, and savings could be achieved withou t disrupting logistical patterns . Ilowever, Sharpe i s a candidate fora consolidated maintenanc e center in the event that depot maintenance facil- ities in the h`ar last are closed in 1974, its an- notinrcd by the Army . Notwithstanding thi s possibility, the Army could still save an esti- mated $14 million annually inpersonnel cost s alone by transferring only the storage of missio n inventories and related administrative function s from Sharpe to the Sacramento Depot . The Army, responding for the Secretary o f Defense, agreed that economics could be real- izcd through realignment, consolidation, an d transfer of depot missions and functions . (B-172707, Mar . 4, 1974 .) Property Disposal Operation s A new Army logistics concept, initiated in 1969, and the Vietnam retrograde program , which bean thesame year, caused anow of vas t quantities -of excess =materials into Departmen t of Defense disposal facilities . This surge of ma- terial frustrated disposal operations\u2014particularl y utilization screening-and_ appears to have re - stilted in loss of millions of dollars of usabl e property .LOGISTICS AND GOMMUNICA,i ION S For example, during 1972 over $2 ;Millio n worth ofdeclared excess material wits reclaime d and redistributed for Department use as a resul t of utilization screening . However, only $5 00 million, or approximately 24 percent, ofthis property was redistributed before being move d to disposal yards . The remaining ; $1.G billion wit s redistributed from disposal yards, increasin g; multiple handling, transportation, and paper - work costs . This in-and-out inoverneilt of prop- erty between Department supply and disposa l facilities not only increases casts but frequentl y frustrates recovery of needed items . In January 1974 the Defense Supply Agenc y became the central manager for allDefens e personal property disposal operations, includin g 232 holding ; activities and sales orficcs through - out the world . We reportcd to the Secretary o f Defense that this centralization should improv e management of the Department's disposa l program . We also made specific ; rccommcncia- t.ions design(-(( to correct the wcal-nesses ob- served in Dcpartinctit's disposal operations . (B-161507, May 30, 1974 .) Requirement s Air Force Nonexpendabl e End-Item Equipmen t The Department of the Air Foree has itnew highly mechanized system to manage nonex- pendablc equipment, such as gencrators, veh - cles, and test equipment . The Air Force rise s data from the system to make decisions to bu y for present needs, budget for future needs, re- tain or release excess equipment, and suppor t requests for funds from the Congress . The data used in requirements computation s contained major errors . As it result, equipmen t needs and assets available to meet these need s were grossly misstated . Because unreliable dat a was used to compute requirements, the need t o buy equipment . valued at $532 million, as deter - mined by the AirForce, was questionable . The Air Force acknowledged that errors c x isted and refinements were necessary and said i t was taking action to modernize the system . Specific actions to date have saved $4 .9million .\" (B-133361, Feb . 26, 1974 .) 51 LOGISTICS AND COMMUNICATION S Coflea P~ocurer ents by the Military Service s At the request of Senator Charles H . Percy , wereviewed coffee ; procurements by the Depart- ment of Defense . Since about 1950, the groun d roasted coffee used by the military services ha s been a blend of 70 percent Brazilian and 30 per - cent Columbian coffee . The services annua lly purchase about 25 .5 million pounds of gree n coffee beans atvarious prices, dependent on th e types of beans . We determined that, by developing cne o r more alternatives tothe 70 :30 blend, qualit y coffee could be procured at more favorabl e prices . In contrast tothe services' consistent us e of the 70 :30 blend for more than 20 years, th e private sector has used a substitute technique t o balance cost and quality .Developing acceptabl e alternative blends could strengthen the com- petitive base by better enabling small businesse s tocompete forGovernment contracts . The Department of that selec- tive changes tothe blend requirements woul d not significantly alter quality and said it wa s adopting a flexible formula that would allow processors to provide the least expensive blen d tinder the formula and the existing market con- dition . (B-175530, Nov . 5 1973 .) Additional work was performed to determin e whether' the Department ofDefense was takin g advantage of market conditions on othe r products . Specifically, we reviewed procuremen t practices, requirements, specifications, pack - aging, and inspection requirements . We hav e caIlcd our observations in these areas to th e attention of the Department : Use of Economic Order Quantit y Principl e The economic order quantity (EOQ) principl e is a mathematical device for determining th e purchase quantity that will result in the lowes t total costs for ordering and holding inventory to meet expected supply requirements . We sur- veyed the use of this principle at the Depart - merit of Defense, the Department ofTransporta- tion, the General Services Administration, an d the Veterans Administration . We found that the Government is not savin g as much as it could in operating costs and re - ~jttc e d inventory investment because mostagencies are not applying the principle properl y orfully . In one or more of these agencies : \u2014The principle was not used . \u2014Cost factors used to compute economic > order quantities were not current . \u2014An inadequate number of factors were use d to accurately reflect costs . \u2014Price discount information for quantit y purchases was generally not obtained o r used . f \u2014Constraints were placed on EOQ computa- tions ; therefore true EOQs were not deter - mined . \u2014The principle was generally not applied t o reparable items . Recommendations to each agency were gen- erally concurred in and corrective actions initi- ated, except for Veterans Administration . (B-133396, June 27, 1974 .) Industrial Managemen t Industrial management reviews attempt to evaluate the efficiency of an organization's over - all performance as it relates to the cost of item s produced . In February 1971 wereported to the Con- gress that industrial management reviews coul d identify ways to reduce Government contracto r costs anti that it wasfeasible for us to make such reviews . Because of the similarity betwe\u00b0n con - tractor and Government industrial maintenanc e operations, we are now making these reviews a t Government-operated industrial facilities . Tw o are summarized below . Maintenance Directorate, SanAntoni o Air Materiel Are a We reported to the Secretary of Defense tha t the Maintenance Directorate (the depot), Sa n Antonio Air Materiel Area, Kelly Air Forc e Base, Texas, could improve its use of direc t resources for repairing, overhauling, and modi- fying end items . Thedepot's work measurement system, whic h was intended to improve labor productivity an d provide better decisionmaking information ., fel l short of its objectivesbecause of inflated or in- appropriate labor standards and incomplet e 92 productivity analysis . Correction of a singl e labor standard for the repair of B-52 wing flap s resulted in estimated' annual savings ofabout $400,000 . The depot was experiencing exceptionall y high absenteeism due to sick leave . Reducing th e depot's sick leave rate to the national averag e would provide about $1 million of additiona l productive labor a year .A more effective pro - gram to reduce this loss is needed . There were opportunities forreducing ac - cumulations of unneeded parts in maintenanc e shops- by improving material standards and con - trol of parts ! The depot's 36 percent general-purpos e machine-use rate indicated unneeded machine s were on hand . From a random sample of gen- eral-purpose machines infour machine shops, we made four equipment-use studies . The followin g chart shows the results of our studies . After our review, almost $1 million worth o f machines were identified as excess and wer e being offered toother agencies . Many have al - ready been claimed . Although the depot was supposed to compar e repair costs with new part prices before repairin g items, we found the cost of repairing some itemsLOGISTICS AND COMMUNICATION S exceeded catalog prices . Discontinuing repair o f 16 sample items saved the depot an estimate d $200,000 over a12-month period . The potential savings from strengthening man - agement controls were notfully measured .How ever, it could amount to several million dollars . The Air Force has taken action on most o f the problems and plans to act onothers . (B-159896, Apr . 11, 1974 .) Puget Sound Naval Shipyar d U.S. naval shipyards are major shore activitie s whose missions include repair, modernization , overhaul, conversion, and construction of ship s for the active fleet . Although the number o f active ships decreased from 917 in 1968 to 52 3 in 1973, the Navy continued to operate 1 0 shipyards until the April 1973 decision to clos e 2 of them . Shipyard employment decrease d from over 90,000 in1968 to less than 70,000 a t the beginning of 1973 . Shipyard costs, however , remained relatively constant at about $1 .25 billion a year . In view of the overall decline in shipyar d activity, we undertook an industrial manage- ment review at Puget Sound to identify ways t o 18 18/.null 64 c gwWOE FOR y st 22 22/.null 5~ _ LOGISTICS AND COMMUNICATION S improve or enhance productivity in the ship - yards . Managing the shipyard efficiently and eco- nomically was difficult because workload a t Puget Sound had decreased 40 percent durin g the 1968 to 1972 period .As a result, shipyar d facilities had been greatly underutilized ; much equipment was underused oridle; manpowe r could notbe quickly adjusted to workload ; and the `labor force had become less productive . Improvements could be made by improvin g machine-use data, the work measurement Sys- tem, the labor' standards program, and th e quality assurance program . However, since th e most critical constraint on shipyard operatio n appeared to be the level and predictability o f workload, the greatest opportunities for im- proving overall shipyard productivity require d stabilizing and increasing the workload an d developing a means of balancing manpowe r requirements with the workload . We developed a mathematical model to relat e labor resources consumed to the number of day s that available docks and berths were used . Our test results of the model were quite favorabl e andindicated that itcould be used to gage ship - yard activity and level of employment . However , wepointed out tothe Navy that the mode l needed further refinement and should be use d with other indicators of performance, particu- larly ; when program results, complexity of work , effectiveness, and quality were involved . (B-118733, Aug ._5, 1974 .) Develop and submit, with their budget re - quests for aircraft modifications, backup dat a in a standardized format that shows a pro- jected installation schedule, considers modifi- cation workloads that have already been ap- proved and funded, andforecasts capabilitie s for installation .Maintenanc e Management of Aircraft Modificatio n Programs in the Army, Navy, andAir Forc e The Army, Navy, and Air Force continue t o be faced with numerous problems in managin g their aircraft modification programs . We foun d that : \u2014Not enough emphasis was given to using th e capability and capacity that exist belo w depot level . \u2014Management data is frequently unreliable . \u2014Modifications were not adequately teste d before materiel was purchased, causing de - lays in the correction of equipment defect s and the accumulation of unusable materiel . \u2014Programs slipped because modification s were not installed when aircraft came to th e depot for repair or, in some instances, be - cause aircraft did not come to the depot a s scheduled . \u2014Modification kit accountability and contro l procedures were inadequate . Although the services are still confronted wit h these and other similar longstanding manage- ment problems, the aircraft modification pro - grams of the Army, Navy, and Air Force ar e generally at acontrollable level . The relationshi p between the procurement funds provided to th e Army and Air Force over the past 3 years an d the inventories on hand at June 30, 1973, in- dicate-that these services have acquired materie l and installed modifications at a reasonable rate . The Navy's inventory of modification materiel i s relatively large . We suggested that the Secretary of Defens e require the Navy toevaluate its backlog o f modification materiel to insure that the modifi- cations are still warranted and that the high cos t of installation is justified . In addition, the Secre- tary of Defense should require each service to: Puget Sound Naval Shipyard - 54 Consider the modification capability an d capacity that exists below the depot leve l when identifying the level of application . rn'phasize improving the accuracy an d reliability of modification management data . The Secretary of Defense said that the serv- icesgenerally agreed with our suggestions an d that steps were being taken toimplement them . Maintenance `training for Republi c ofVietnam Armed Forces Personne l U.S. contractors held 34 Iogistics support co n tracts, valued at $43 .3 million, as of Septembe i 1973 to provide training for Republic of Viet - nam Armed Forces (RVNAF) personnel . Thes e contracts are administered by the Defens e attache office inVietnam . Inour report to the Congress on nine of thes e contracts, valued at $13 .1 million, we pointe d outthat the effectiveness of U .S. contracto r training was limited and RVNAF self-sufficienc y delayed because : -Not enough people were being trained i n specific skills .\u2014Sufficient attention had not been given to training supervisory or middle-managemen t personnel . -High percentages of trainees andthose wh o completed training were absent from as - signed duties . \u2014Poor logistics support by the RVNAF sup - ply system had impaired the training pro - gram and caused delays in equipment repai r and overhaul . We recommended that the Secretary of De- fense direct the Defense attache office to : Obtain a commitment by RVNAF to insur e that an adequate number of trainees ispro- vided when required and to reduce the hig h level of absenteeism . Have an adequate number of middle-manage- ment personnel trained in areas involvin g introduction of new functions . Require U .S. contractors to alert the Defens e attache office to supply problems so it ca n communicate these problems to RVNAF an d find satisfactory solutions . The Department of Defense agreed with ou r conclusions and recommendations and initiate d actions to correct the deficiencies noted . (B-159451, June 11, 1974 .) Jetengine overhaul \u2014Bien Hoe, Vietnam LOGISTICS AND COMMUNICATION S Analysis of Air Force Rites ofAircraf t NotOperationally heady Due toSupply (HORS ) During the past few years the Air Force ha s used the NORS rate to justify reprogramin g funds into maintenance . Because ofthis, th e House Committee on Appropriations directed u s tolook into the(1) causes of HORS, (2) applica- tion of funds to the most critical maintenanc e problems, (3) cost effectiveness of reducin g HORS to 3 percent, and (4) impact of NORS o n Air Force readiness .In our report to the Com- mittee, we pointed out that : \u2014NORS was usually caused by unexpecte d part failures, late repair of parts, and modifi - cation of parts for new aircraft systems . \u2014The Air Force recognized and was willing to live with ahigh HORS rate on new systems , such as the C-5A . Funds were being spent primarily on ex - changeable spares for high-priority aircraft sys- tems . In addition, even though some systems ' NORS rates decreased when funds increased, th e impact on the overall NORS rate was marginal . Furthermore,' nostrong correlation existed be- tween funds expended and NORS rates forgive n weapon system s It would not be cost effective to reduce th e overall NORS rate to 3 percent because a direc t relationship does not necessarily exist betwee n exchangeable repair funds and NORS rates . Also, the expense of buying and stocking addi- tional spares at many locations is prohibitive . The impact of an increasing NORS rate on Ai r Force readiness cannot be quantified . In summary, we pointed out that the use o f an overall HORS rate as a readiness indicato r was overemphasized and - was not sufficien t justification by itself to request reprograming o f funds. (B-179264, Mar . 29, 1974 .) Transportatio n _Our transportation reviews included land, sea , and air activities involved inthe movement o f personnel, household goods, and all types o f supplies and equipment . Loading and Unloading ; Ship s Delays in unloading and loading U .S. ships a t Far Fast military- ports cost the Governmen t 56about $10 million or more a year . Reduce d operating hours was one reason, another wa s lack of coordination among the terminals . These reasons can be traced to the fragmente d funding of ocean shipping (commands (-on - trolling port or terminal budgets do not bear an y ship-delay costs) and to the fact that no singl e authority is responsible for ship dispatch at th e various terminals . We recommended that the Secretary of De- fense snake the port operators accountabl e financially for ship delays over which they hav e control . The Department also should conside r placing overseas ocean terminals wider a singl e authority capable of establishing common polic y and coordinating activities . The Department did not question on r findings, the estimate of savings, or the reason s for delay It did cite other causes for delay an d agreed to seek solutions of the sort we recoltl- mended . (B-179260, Aug . 16, 1973 .) Management of Air Export s Asa part of our continuing assessment of th e effectiveness of military transportation systems , we reviewed the military air export cargo man- agement functions of' the Military Traffic Man- agement and Terminal Service (MTMTS) and th e Shipper Service Control Offices ofthe Army , Navy, and Air Force . Military air exports ar e cargo originating inside the continental Unite d States and terminating outside . The military departments are unnecessaril y duplicating MTMTS functions in varying de- grees, because they are reluctant to relinquis h control over cargo movement . We estimated tha t over $1 .5 million annually could be saved b y eliminating duplicated efforts and by restrictin g management authority to a single agency . We reported our findings to the Secretary o f Defense and later, at the request of the Assistan t Secretary of Defense (Installations and Logis- tics), we participated in a briefing on the matter . As a result of our report and subsequent brief- ing, the Department of Defense took action t o eliminate the duplication . (B-133025, Oct . 18 , 1973 .) Passenger Sedans in the Governmen t Concerned about the proliferation of pas- senger vehicles within the Federal Government , the Ad Hoc Subcommittee on Government Vehicle Use, Senate Committee out Appropria- tions, requested its to review the matter . 'Man y congressmen also expressed an interest and r e quested that they be informed of the results o f our work . A GAO task group found that : -Individual departments and ag-itcies gen- erally do not keep central inventories o f vehicles by type and location . ---Once a year the General Services Adinmis- t rat ion accumulates a Govertnnent-wid e inventory ofvehicles, by department an d agency, without verifying its reliability . The inventory was incomplete andinaccurate .

Most -agencies stake nointernal reviews o f the management of their passenger vehicles . Our report to the subcommittee included th e group's findings on \"these -matters and on th e effect of new energy conservation policies u n Government vehicle use . (II-158712, Sept . 6, 1974 .)LOGISTICS AND COMMUNICATION S New Negotiation Procedures for Obtaining Transportation Rate s In May 1969 we reported to the congress that . (1) the Department of Defense cot.tld realiz e savings by rising space on military aircraft to transport unaccompanied baggage and (2) th e rates charged by forwarders fo garranging the transportation of baggage were high ill relatio n to serviccs provided . ti'e madea folk wup revie w to determine what action had been -taken oil recommendations in the earlier report .. Forwarders' rates were still high i \"relation t o the cast of services provided, at-td the Depart - meat's negotiation pzactices had not . created a truty competitive cnvirontnent . The Departmen t concurred in our findings and suhsequentl y changed its negotiation practices on shipment s from five points in the Pacific to it more cottr - pctitive method resulting in rate reduction s ranging from 35 to 4r percent . We estimate tha t savings of $1 9 million annually willresult fron t these reductions . We reported the rest-dts of our followup re - view to the Secretary= of` Defense and recom- mended that the new negotiation procedures h e adopted in other areas . In response, the Depart- rttent stated that it was planning ; to expan d procurement- of' Competitive notes on a world- widc\u00b0 basis . (13-133025, Apr . 29, 1971 .) Department of Defense Cargo Security Prograr n During our survey of the Department o f Defense's cargo security program, we identifie d weaknesses in accounting controls al . all levels o f the supply line . Bccaiise of these wca :kncsscs, w e could not dcterminc the extent of cargo losse s nor evaluate the overall effcct .iveness of th e program . In response to several interim reports w e prepared during the survey, the Eighth U .S. Army, Korea, reported that corrective actions , taken after our -survey was completed, reduce d U.S. Government losses in Korea abou t $876,000 annually . This saving is based onthe difference between calendar year 1972 losses o f $1,208,000 and calendar year 1973 losses -of $332,000 . We have not learned the results o f corrective action in other areas . We reported the results of 'our overall surve y to the Secretary of Defense . In response, th e 57 LOGISTICS AND COMMUNICATION S Dep~trtmeitt cited the 'actions already taken o r programed to correct the weaknesses . (B-130220, Jan, 23, 1974 .) Transportation of Armed Force s Exchange Good s The Congress is aware of, and apparentl y approves, the use of appropriated funds to pa y some ofthe transportation costs of militar y exchanges . But we could find nothing to in- dicate that the Congress is aware that such fund s are being spent to procure transportation solel y for exchange goods . Statutes governing the Army and Air Forc e permit appropriated funds to be used for trans- portation CostE of exchange cargo when it i s carried onpublic transportation not required fo r other purposes. Although there is nolegislativ e history defining \"public transportation, a rea- sonable interpretation would be those convey- ances owned, leased, or chartered by the Gov- ernment for which the Government is alread y obligated to pay for the space whether it is use d or not . After reviewing the matter and evaluating th e various interpretations of the pertinent statutes , we believe there is considerable doubt as to th e intent of the Congress on using appropriate d funds to finance theexchanges' transportatio n costs . Because of :the `amount of appropriated fund s being used for transporting exchange good s (about $60 million a year), we recommende d that the Congress consider whether it isappro - priate for the Government to continue payin g these costs when the facilities arenotowned b y Indiana Army ammunition plant \u2014 manual bag sewing . 58the Government and the Government is no t otherwise obligated to pay for there . (B-169972 , Aug. 6, 19 7 3 .) Acquisition and Managemen t ofFacilitie s Army's Program to Moderniz e Ammunition Plant s In a review requested by the Chairman, Hous e Committee onAppropriations, we found tha t $94 million of $195 .4 million requested fo r modernization and expansion of ammunitio n plants by the Army in fiscal year 1975 was ques- tionable because the Army may not be able t o effectively use these funds . This was the thir d year that we reviewed the Army's budget re - quests for its ammunition modernization pro - gram . The Army initiated several management im- provements, such as revising mobilizatio n requirements and planning maximum output o f its modernized production lines during mobiliza- tion. The Army also has pilot and prototyp e projects for new manufacturing technology . These changes, when fully implemented, shoul d result in an improved modernization and expan- sion program . (B-172707, July 15, 1974 .) Value Engineerin g Although several construction agencies wer e actively seeking to promote value engineering , all agencies needed toincrease their efforts t o benefit from the value engineering cost-savin g Indiana Army ammunition plant \u2014automated bag sewing . technique . Of the 10 construction agencies w e reviewed, 4 had had value engineering incentiv e programs for about 10 years, 2 had recentl y initiated programs, and 4 had no programs . Of the sixagencies -having incentive programs , four were using unwieldy and complicate d incentive clauses that didnot provide specifi c sharing ratios forsubcontractors, four had n o procedures for handling subcontractors' cost - saving proposals, two excluded a large portion o f their construction contracts from their incentiv e ;programs by restricting the incentive clauses t o larger contracts, and most needed to increas e their efforts to promote contractor and subcon- tractor participation . Also there was a need to circulate prove n value engineering proposals within and amon g Federal agencies-a major benefit of avalu e engineering cost-saving proposal is its potentia l for use on other projects . Federal construction agencies generally agree d with our findings, conclusions, and recommen- dations for corrective action . The General Serv- ices Administration said that steps were bein g taken to explore with the construction agencie s the feasibility of developing a uniform incentiv e clause ; for construction contracts awarded by al l Federal construction agencies . The Administra- tion also said it was willing to develop asyste m to circularize proven value engineering cost - saving proposals . (B-163762, May 6, 1974 .) Air-Conditioning Militar y Family Housing inHawai i We;reported that the Department of Defens e directive requiring air-conditioning of all ne w and existing military family housing in Hawai i was unnecessary . Such across-the-board air - conditioning was unwarranted -because of th e cooling effect of the trade winds and the consis- tently moderate' temperature and humidit y conditions that exist inHawaii . The three mili- tary services in Hawaii, the U .S. Coast Guard , the Federal 'Housing Administration, and privat e builders all agreed with our position that ce-ltra l air-conditioning was not needed except in cer- taro locations with unusual weather or excessiv e 1101se . The Department of Defense disagreed wit h our conclusions and stated unequivocally tha t - central air-conditioning was needed for militaryLOGISTICS AND cOMMUNICA IIuN S family housing in Hawaii . We reported ou r findings, conclusions, and recommendations t o the Congress, including the fact that, if th e Department does not revise its policy, as much as $100 million will be unnecessarily spent fo r central air-conditioning in Hawaii . (B-172376 , May 20, 1974 .) Effectiveness of Public Law 92-55 2 Because of requests from several Members o f Congress and because of our own continuin g interest, we are reviewing the effectiveness o f Public Law 92-552, which requires that archi- tect-engineer contracts be negotiated with firm s selected by virtue of demonstrated competenc e and qualifications . We are evaluating, amon g other things, whether the law has (1) increase d competition among prospective architect - engineer firms and (2) resulted in increasing th e number of new firms being considered and/o r awarded contracts . The selection methods o f Federal agencies are being compared with th e policies and practices of various States, cities , and private corporations in obtaining architect - engineer services . A report on our findings, conclusions, an d recommendations will be issued to the Congres s in fiscal year 1975 . Selling Excess Properties and Acquiring Public Building Site s Under competitive bidding, the Governmen t would be better assured of receiving the highes t value for excess property than it would unde r negotiated exchanges based on appraised fai r market value . . Appraised values do not insure that the Gov- ernment is receiving the highest value obtainabl e because_ participation in an exchange is limite d to one individual . In some cases, former Govern- ment property was sold shortly after an ex - change at prices much higher than the appraise d value at which it had been exchanged . To provide all interested parties an opportu- nity to acquire excess Government property in exchanges, we recommended that the Congres s amend the law to permit the General Service s Administration to offer such property at coin- petitive bid and to deposit the cash proceed s into a building fund to be used, subject to 59 LOGISTICS AND COMMUNICATION S annual appropriation acts, for acquiring publi c building sites . We also recommended that th e Congress amend the lawto eliminate the pro- visions authorizing the acquisition of propert y by the exchange method . (B-165511, Feb . 15 , 1974 .) Communications an d Navigational System s Proliferation of Radio Navigation System s Inareport to the Subcommittee on Coas t Guard! and Navigation, House Committee o n Merchant Marine andFisheries, we discussed th e growing proliferation of radio navigation sys- tems, the need for a comprehensive nationa l navigation plan, and the need for closer coor - dination between Government and civil users i n order to eliminate duplication and reduce costs . For example, the Coast Guard was pursuin g development of three distinct radio navigationa l systems\u2014one each for the (1) high seas, (2 ) coastal confluence, and (3) rivers and harbors . Although no system could provide the coverag e and accuracy required, a proper mix of two o f the systems could meet stated requirements wit h substantial savings accruing to Government an d users alike . The Coast Guard agreed with ou r suggestions and decided to proceed with devel- opment of two systems instead of three, re - sulting inan `immediate savings of $1 .3 millio n inresearch and development funds . We agreed with the Coast Guard's actions an d suggested some ways in which the implementa- tion could be improved . However, much mor e interagency coordination is needed to arrest th e proliferation of navigation systems, and t o decide , upon the minimum number of system s consistent with Government and civil require- inents . (B-180715, Mar . 26, 1974 .) Communication Center Consolidatio n We suggested that the Navy consolidate 1 2 communication centers inthe San Diego area t o 2. Navy officials have informed us that as of March 1974, five communication centers hav e been closed or consolidated at an annual saving s of $460,000 . Their goal is to continue the effor t until only two centers remain . (B-169857, Jul y 17, 1974 .) 60Data Processin g Wrapetition\u2014Key to Reducin g ADP Procurement Cost s Federal outlays for automatic data processin g equipment exceed $600 million a year . Becaus e most of this equipment was still being acquire d without competition, we reviewed procuremen t procedures of the General Services Administra- tion and various agencies . Our report to th e Congress showed how significant savings coul d accrue to the Government if agencies followe d regulations and replaced equipment leased unde r Federal schedule contracts with equipmen t acquired on a competitive basis . In many in - stances orders were placed to renew leases or t o purchase equipment without seeking competi- tion or making a determination of lowest overal l cost. The Administrator of General Service s agreed with our recommendations which, h e said, would aid his agency in its efforts t o achieve greater economy in the procuremen t process . (B-115369, May 7, 1974 .) Printing and Records Managemen t Public Documents Department , Government Printing Offic e The Government Printing Office is widel y known to the American public through its Publi c Documents Department . The Department re- ceives about 4 .8 million orders annually fo r Government publications . It also receives ove r 600,000 customer service complaints annually , of which it estimates about 40 percent are re- lated to nonreceipt of publications . A survey we made revealed several problem s in the order-processing system, which contri- buted to errors and -delays in filling custome r orders . These problems were lack of adequat e control over orders and inventories and th e excessive time spent attempting to deciphe r inadequately described publications . We als o reported on personnel-related problems, whic h could be affecting employee motivation an d resulting in delays to customer orders . Because the Government Printing Office has a task force working on customer service prob- lems, we did not conduct a comprehensive review . We did, however, present our findings t o the Public Printer . (B-1`24829, June 14, 1974 .) Regional Printing Procurement Office s The Federal printing procurement progra m completed its first full year of operation in fisca l year 1972 . This program was established after a joint Committee on `Printing study showed tha t decentralized printing services and more exten- sive use of commercial printing were needed . As a result of the study, the Committee authorize d the Government Printing . Office to establish 1 4 regional printing . procurement offices and re- quired the Federal agencies to obtain their com- mercial printing through these regional offices . At the request of the joint Committee o n Printing, we reviewed the program and con - eluded that its success is difficult to measur e because there is no standard on how much com- mercial printing should be obtained, and com- prehensive information on past commercia l procurement is not available . We did, however , identify the following areas for improvements . The Government incurred additional cost s because the regional printing procuremen t offices did not always offer printing to th e lowest responsive bidder . This was caused b y these offices manually evaluating orders an d also evaluating large orders on the basis o f experience . The regional offices spent inordinat e amounts of time in processing low-value con - tracts . The prices charged to clients were no t sufficient to cover costs incurred in obtainin g this printing . Customer agencies complained about lon g delays inreciving bills for printing services . We found that a portion of the billing proces s was involved in duplicate verification of in - voices and billings . We developed a computer program for ana- lyzing bids and recommended that the Govern- mcnt Printing Office install such a program in al l r c gi o> n al- printing _procurement offices . Th e Gcwernment Printing Office has since tailore d otirprogram to the needs ofthe regional office s and is installing it in 11 of the 14 regional of - (iccs . The Government Printing Office has als o issued instructions to regional printing procure -LOGISTICS AND COMMUNICATION S ment offices to use simplified purchase proce - dures for procurements of less than $2,50 0 when the end product is conducive to tha t method . We recommended that the surcharge be ana- lyzed to determine if small, medium, and large value printing orders are charged aproportionat e share of cost incurred, and if not, -adjust th e surcharge rates accordingly . The Governmen t Printing Office is making such an analysis an d plans to modify its billing practices to appropri- ately recover costs on the basis of individua l jobs, as well as in the aggregate . We also recommended that the Governmen t Printing Office reduce reviews of contracto r invoices and customer billings and provide for a sample postaudit of both reviews . The publi c printer subsequently ordered the implementa- tion of statistical sampling in the regiona l printing procurement offices . (B-114829, Feb . 20, 1974 .) Records Managemen t Since 1966, estimated Federal costs of paper - work have increased from $8 billion to$15 bil- lion a year . Similarly, Federal Records Cente r holdings have increased by more than 2 .8 mil - lion cubic feet and now total over 11 .6 millio n cubic feet . The National Archives and Records Servic e has had limited success in persuading Federa l agencies to correct weaknesses intheir record s management programs . One reason is that th e Service identifies needed improvements an d makes sweeping recommendations without demonstrating corresponding savings . In our report tothe Congress, werecom- mended that the Service assume a stronger rol e byattempting toconvince agencies that sug- gested changes could save time and money . If this does not work, the Service must exercise it s authority (which has never been used) to repor t to the President, the Congress, or the Office o f Management and Budget those instances whe n agencies do not take action . Additionally, th e Service could be more effective in minimizin g the time that records are retained in Federa l Records Centers and in insuring that records ar e destroyed when their period of retention ha s elapsed .

In addition, this division reviews the overall-, policie s and practices of the Federal Government relat- ingto procurement- -and research and develop - ment, including-but not limited to\u2014th e acquisition of major hardware systems . The division isunder the supervision of Richard W . Gutmann, director, and James_ H . Hammond, Harold . H. Rubin, and Jerome H . Stolarow, deputy directors. An organizatio n chart appears on the following page . Volume : of Federal Procuremen t Procurement of goods and services by th e Federal Government in fiscal year 1973 involve d some 16 million transactions and totaled abou t $56.8 billion . The major portion of this amoun t 62was spent by the Department of Defense and th e military services . Significance of Program s For Acquiring Major System s The investment necessary in acquiring majo r systems continues to have a heavy impact on th e Nation's resources . While these systems ar e dynamic with the acquisition process for ne w systems starting and some systems completin g each year, the estimated costs of 104 majo r systems being acquired by the Department o f Defense at the beginning of fiscal year 1974 wa s more than $162 billion. Another 300 acquisi- tions by civil departments and agencies wa s estimated to cost more than $125 billion . Significance of Researc h and Development Program s Federal research and development program s not only have an impact on the Nation' s economic situation but also shape the Nation' s future security. In fiscal year 1973, $16 .8 billio n of the approximately $30 billion spent fo r research and development inthis country wa s funded by the Federal Government . Departmen t of Defense outlays for research, development , test, and evaluation programs amounted t o about $8 .4 billion infiscal year 1973 . Audit Report s During fiscal year 1973 we submitted 2 1 reports to the Congress relating to research an d development, Federal procurement practices , and the acquisition of major weapon systems . These reports are summarized in this chapter . In addition, we submitted 105 reports to specifi c committees and Members of Congress . Thes e reports included special -reviews made at thei r request and individual reports on the status o f 53 major systems being acquired . The special reviews concerned such matters a s (1) cost-effectiveness studies for variou s programs, (2) contractor efficiency, (3) full-scal e development, (4)contract provisions, such a s escalation, termination costs, and use of mailing PROCUREMENT AND SYSTENis ACOUISITIO AND MANAGEMENT COUNCI L SCIENCE &TECHNOLOG Y DEPUTY DIRECTO R H.H.

These reports contain our assessment Hughes AAH Mockup PROCUREMENT AND SYSTEMS ACQUISITIO N of the system's current status as to cost ; schedule for development, production, and de- ployment ; and technical performance . Science and Technolog y We submitted four reports to the Congress o n various aspects of research and developmen t activities-an appraisal of the development an d use of flight simulators ; the development o f aircraft engines ;' duplication in the developmen t of new military equipment ; and the pros an d coins for participating in international researc h and development programs . Work' in process at the end of the yea r includes reviews of (1) aircraft collision avoid -ante systems technology, (2) the Army's ballis- tic missile defense programs, (3) the use o f aircraft simulator technology, (4) Government - wide laser research and development programs , (5) Department of Defense policies and pro- cedures for insuring the propriety of inde- pendent research and development allocations i n accordance with Armed Services Procuremen t Regulation requirements, and (6) value of an d alternative approaches for independent researc h and development .

Without the cost an d risk of actual flight, pilots can \"fly\" takeoff s and landings, hear engine noise, and feel the pul l of gravity from sharp turns or other maneuvers . Increased use of simulators could lower fligh t training costs greatly, save fuel, and provid e safer training . After our report the Congress the militar y services ' took several constructive steps to in - crease simulator development and use for pilo t training . (B-157905, Aug. 9, 1973 .) Managing the Development of Aircraft Engine s 'File acquisition and maintenance of aircraf t engines by the Department of Defense is a majo r undertaking . It owns about 90,000 aircraf t cngirnes costing about $9 Billion . Of this amount,$6 billion is for engines installed on aircraft an d the remainder is for spare engines . During 197 1 the Department spent about $1 billion t o maintain these engines, with some 29,00 0 engines being either overhauled or repaired . An engine usually is not fully developed a t the time it passes the model qualification tests . It requires extensive and complex developmen t effort concurrent with production . This may b e attributed to the practice of awarding develop- ment c ontracts based on specification s somewhat below the capability ultimately de - sired . Over a 17-year period, about $3 .3 billio n has been used for component improvemen t programs to attain, the engine performanc e desired . In our report to the Congress in May 1974 , we recommended that the Secretary of Defens e modify the method of developing and acquirin g aircraft engines to reduce the extent of concur - rent development and production . (B-179166 , May 23, 1974 .) 67 We reviewed Defense policies and practice s for avoiding unnecessary duplication in equip- ment development. We selected laser applica- tions, laser-protective goggles, and scatterabl e mines \" for detailed review . We found tha t duplicative development programs were bein g conducted . At the time of our review, al? three service s were developing duplicative laser-guided missiles . A departmental ad hoc group examined thi s problem and concluded that as much as $ 7 million of research and development funds an d up to $50 million of procurement funds coul d be saved if duplication were eliminated . The Army and the Air Force each contracte d for development of laser-protective goggles an d had spent over $660,000 in these developmen t efforts through fiscal year 1973 . A total o f $280,000 was budgeted for continuing thei r development efforts in fiscal year 1974 . In 1971 thethree services approved separat e requirements for similar air-scatterable land - mines . A departmental committee, establishe d to look into duplication of air munitions , subsequently terminated the Navy 's progra m after the Navy had spent about $6 .5 million an d estimated it would need an additional $1 6 million to complete the project . The Army an d Air `Force development efforts then require d $28.5 million to complete . In October 1972 th e services signed, a,joint requirement and a join t development plan was prepared . Although each of the services had a system t o coordinate development programs with the othe r services, we 'found they had not coordinate d effectively .Duplication in developmen t occurred because (1) key documents were no t made available, (2) key documents were no t written clearly enough to compare requirements , (3) the services did not respond to requests fo r comments, and (4) effective action was no t taken to eliminate duplication even when recog- nized . The director of Defense Research and Engi- neering did not agree with our recommendatio n in our report to the Congress in June 107 11 requiring interservice coordination and state d that other management systems existed tha t provided opportunity for the services to preven tPROCUREMENT AND SYSTEMS ACQUISITIO N Unnecessary Duprication in Developin g New Military Equipmentunnecessary duplication . We recognize that thes e systems may indicate potential duplication ; however, they were not designed to specificall y identify duplicate development which did occu r in the programs we reviewed . Therefore, w e believe that additional actions are needed t o avoid unnecessary duplication among the serv- ices. (B-133313, June 10, 1974 .) Benefits and Drawbacks o f Participating in International Cooperativ e Research and Development Program s The Department of Defense participates i n cooperative military research and developmen t programs with allied countries to strengthe n military alliances and to better use free-worl d technical and economic resources . We found that as of September 30, 1973 , there were 29 ongoing international cooperativ e programs involving the United States and 1 2 other countries . Because agency records wer e incomplete, we could not determine the exten t of U .S. investment in all of these programs ; however, our investment in 21 ongoing program s totaled $172 .1 million . In addition, we ide n tified 15 terminated programs in which the U .S. investment ranged from $30,000 for an explor- atory development program to $523 .7 millio n for an engineering development program . We found that the Department can achiev e some of its goals for international cooperativ e programs by obtaining foreign-developed equip- ment through (1) interdependent research an d development programs, (2) licensing agreement s with foreign developers, and (3) direct pro- curement of foreign hardware . We concluded that the future for inter - national cooperative research and developmen t is much more promising for basic research an d exploratory development programs than fo r engineering development programs . We believ e that, since the Department of Defense can realiz e favorable cost and technical results, it shoul d continue to emphasize licensing U .S. productio n of existing foreign equipment which will mee t firm U .S. requirements . In our report to the Congress, we -recom- mended that the Department prepare a forma l annual summary of international cooperativ e programs and submit it to the Congress with the budget . `T'hc enefits of each . The director of Defense Research and t ;ngincerin g stated that the Department of Defense concur s with our recommendation . (B-167034, June 4 , 1974 .) implementation of Legislatio n Involving Contractor Independen t Research and Developmen t Section_ 203 of Public Law 411-441 require =s, aunong ether thinks, (flat tile Department o f Defense (l)not pay coutractors for independen t research and development or hid and proposa l costs unless t he work has itpotential relationshi p to a-military function or operation, (2) ne} otiatc . advance agreements to establish dollar ceiling s with all companies that received more than $ 2 million of independent research and develop- naeht or bierand proposal paytnews from the , Department of Defense in the preceding year , and (3) base the independent research an d development portion of the agreements er n company plans that are technically evaluated la y the Department of De\"ense before or during (Foe fiscal year covered by the agreements .

In our report to the Senate Committee o n Armed Services, we reported that the I epart- tnent of Defense had issued a series of mem- orandums which provided new guidance to th e military services inall the areas covered by ou r recommendations .The new guidance, if prop -PROCUREMENT AND SYSTEMS ACQUISH IUN erly implemented, should improve tire servict-s ' administration of independent research and dv- veloptuent and bits and proposal programs .

We believe that ally ;acticn on this matter shotnl d be deferred until the task group's shady has haver c'orrnpleted and (lee executive branch position i s finalized . (B-164912, May 1, 1971, ) Planning for Innovative Researc h We made it survey within the i)cpa rlincrrt o f Defense and the military Scrvic ;es to examine th e ITIationship between their support of Iong-tcrrrt , high-risk, inventive (innovative) research pro , grams designed to produce entirely new militar y equipment, systems, and processes and th e support of low-risk (cvolulionary) rescare h pro - grams designed tc.solve relatively short-ter m technical barrier problems . The services inuo- vaativc aad short-N .rna cvoltationar`y rct ;ca.rch bai make no attempt to distinguish Ill(exte ,,(,J r '-ffort going iron() such research or to maintai n the desired balance Ictwcc ;n them . We believe ;it need exists For increased visibility and account - ability For the support of innovative research . Although : we were unable to ascertain i :hc adequacy of the Department 's support . for irat( ) vative research, support for research, in general , had decreased about . 30 percent . over the last 1 t years . To aggressively starch out . altc ;rnat .ivc;s to existing products, systems, and proccsscs, a conscious and determined effort must . be mad e tosupport innovative research . Therefore, in a report to the Secretary of Defense in Februar y 69 PROCUREMENT ANDSYSTEMS ACQUISITIO N 1974, we recommended, that the Director o f Defense Research and Engineering develop mor e explicit policies and procedures for support o f innovative research designed todevelop th e technology base fornew ideas and capabilities . We further recommended that innovative an d evolutionary research' be defined and distin- guished and that the research be categorized fo r measurement purposes . (B-167034, Feb . 14 , 1974 .) The Department replied that it was not abl e to form- a quantitatively useful definition o f innovative research and therefore could no t establish management control in this area . However, this area would continue to receiv e attention at all levels and would be carefull y assessed : Use of Technology Coordinating Paper s Technology coordinating papers, initiate d within the Department of Defense in 1970, wer e intended to be long-range planning documents , to bring together the exploratory developmen t goals of the military services in given technolog y fields, and to provide acloser coupling betwee n military requirements and the selection of ex- ploratory development programs . Most service officials regarded the technolog y coordinating papers asmerely another reportin g requirement solely for the use of the Office o f the Director, Defense Research and Engineering . They stated that there were probably som e coordination benefits, but little use was made o f the papers inplanning and managing thei r technical- programs . Service officials stated tha t they need more specific information concernin g requirements, needs, . and priorities presented i n a format` compatible with the way their respec- tive services plan and manage technical activities . We concluded that the technology coordinat- ingpaper process offers the military services a continuing opportunity to improve the plannin g and coordination of their technology-base activi - ties. To better realize the potential benefits o f - the technology coordinating papers, we recom- mended that the Secretary of Defense : 1. Emphasize the preparation and use o f the technology coordinating papers inorde r toresolve service opposition to establishin g the new management relationships . 702. Establish a formal, direct, andvisible re- lationship between the technology coordinat- ing papers and the military services' plannin g and management documents and processes t o promote the paper's accuracy, credibility, and use. (B-164912, Afar . 14, 1974 .) Defense officials agreed that emphasis o n technology coordinating papers\" should be con- tinued to overcome service opposition but dis- agreed with the need to establish adirect an d visible relationship between technology co - ordinating papers and the services' planning an d management documents . As an alternative, th e services are being instructed to provide an analy- sis of their fluid allocations for each establishe d technology area beginning in fiscal year 1976 . General Procuremen t Our general procurement audits resulted in si x reports to the Congress on (1) ways to reduc e administrative costs for awarding negotiate d contracts, (2) use of formal advertising for pro- curement, (3) a build and charter program fo r nine tanker ships, (4) pricing of contracts wit h foreign firms, and (5) borrowings under th e Emergency Loan Guarantee Act (two reports) . At the request of the Chairman, House Com- mittee on Government Operations, weprepare d two reports on the progress of executive branc h action on recommendations of the Commissio n on Government Procurement . We also prepare d a report at the request of the Architect of th e Capitol, furnishing an analysis of a price pro- posal received by the Architect . Work in process at the end of the fiscal yea r included : (1) Government support of the ship - building industrial base, (2) Air Force expendi- tures for a\u00b0rospace ground equipment used t o repair, maintain, overhaul, and operate aircraf t and related subsystems, (3) areview of the ef- fectiveness of Department of Defense purchasin g offices in negotiating noncompetitive contracts , (4) a survey of thefeasibility and economies of ' the Government's policy of self-insurance, (5 ) determining ways in which the General Service s Administration can become more effective i n making commercial goods and services availabl e to civil executive agencies, (6) identifyin g actions that could be taken by Government or contractors to improve ;the efficiency, or mini- inize the consumption, of energy, and (7) de- termining %vhat theGovernment is doing to em - phasize orencourage agencies and activities t o buy recycled products . Reducing Administrativ e hosts on Negotiated Contract s The Department of Defense spent $35 Millio n in fiscal year 1972 forgoods and services pro - cured under negotiated contracts . Individuals i n and out of Government frequently express th e view- that the Department could improve its ne- gotiated buying without weakening numerou s laws, rules, and regulations designed to safeguar d the taxpayer 's dollar . Weexamined the Department's policies an d practices forbuying parts and components b y negotiation, to identify opportunities for im- proving procurement methods . We then inquired into flow business firms throughout the countr y bought similar parts and components . We foun d many similarities however, the `main differenc e is that, in addition toobtaining materials an d services, the Department-in response tocon- gressional desires attempts to get maximu m competition and to meet certain nonprocure- ment objectives '(such as small ` business pro - g=rains, labor surplus area programs, the Bu y American Act, equal employment opportunit y programs, etc.).In seeking competition, industr y generally solicits proposals from a limited num- berofcarefully selected firms_ while the Depart - ment ofDefense generally solicits many firms t o achieve maximum competition and to avoi d charges of favoritism and collusion . In our report to the Congress, we did not con- sider industry policies and practices to be thos e which` the Department should follow . However , we did use industry methods asguides in identi- fying ways to reduce costs . Millions of dollars in administrative cost s t:auld be saved annually without sacrificing ade- quatc competition, reasonable prices, or th e nonprocuremcnt goals of the Congress . For ex- aunple ; About $900,000 could be saved annually o n procurements over $10,000 by a 50-percen t reduction in the number of pages insolicit a time documents and a reduction in the num- ber of documents ina solicitation packagePROCUREMENT AND SYSTEMS AL;uUlal iIVN prepared by the Navy andthe Defense Suppl y' Agency from three to two . A substantial annual saucing could be realize d by preparing fewer solicitation packages , Costs of up to $30 million annually might be avoided at procurement centers by raising th e ceiling price oilpurchases subject tosimpli- fied negotiation procedures from $2,500 t o $10,000 . About $150,000 could be saved annually i f the requircinent for preparing certain de - terminations and findings was repealed . We recommend that the Department en- courage greater use of master solicitations an d require its procurement centers to include onl y two copies of the solicitation document in eac h solicitation package . Since the llepartment' s buying system is tied to legislation, certain ad- ministrative costs cannot be reduced withou t congressional action . We therefore recotn- mended that the Congress enact legislation : Authorizing agencies to solicit proposals fro m a competitive, rather than a maximum, num- ber of sources . Raising the ceiling price of procurements sub- ject to simplified procurement practices . Repealing ; the requirement that contractin g officers prepare determinations and finding s for certain procurements . The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Installa- tions and Logistics) agreed with the genera l thrust of our recommendations, and stated tha t the Armed Services Procurement Regulatio n Committee was working on those matters tha t could be resolved within the Department . (B-168450, Sept . 17, 1973 .) On May 21,1974, we testified before th e Subcommittee on Legislation and Military Oper- ations of the house Committee on Governmen t Operations on our position on a bill (II .R. 14494) that would raise to $10,000 the ceilin g for Government procurements subject to simpli- fied purchasing procedures . Improvements Needed in Use of Forma l Advertising for Government Procuremen t Government agencies procure material fro m private industry by two basic methods\u2014forma l 71 PROCUREMENT AND SYSTEMS ACQUISITIO N advertisin'? and negotiation . Procurement b y negotiation permits discussion of a proposa l while formal advertising requires inviting sup- pliers to submit afirm bid price for a specifie d product or service : Historically, the Congress has believed tha t Government interests are best served by a maxi - mum amount of competition for any particula r procurement . Procurement by formal adver- tisin , when feasible ,offers the best opportunit y for full and free competition . Congressional hearings, speeches, and article s frequently cite problems Government agencie s face in using formal advertising for procurement . With this in mind, we reviewed formal adver- tising procedures andpractices used by procure- ment offices inthe Department of Defense, th e General Services Administration, and th e Tennessee Valley Authority .We reviewed pro- curement records for 138 formally advertise d contracts awarded from September 196 7 through May 1971 and valued at about $97 mil- lion . Inourreport to the Congress, we -identifie d problems that limit competition and increas e costs to the Government and offered suggestion s for more effective and less costly use of forma l advertising for procurement . For the 138 contracts examined, we foun d that 3,956 suppliers were solicited ; however , only 8 percent submitted bids . Fifty-three of th e 138 contracts were :.warded on the Basis of 3 o r fewer bids .Sc tie of the causes for low respons e were Bidders lists were based on broad categorize s Of items and did not reveal the relatively fe w sources capable of bidding for aspecific item . Previous bidders were not regularly solicited . Advertising in the Commerce Business Dail y wasnottimely, and the published descriptio n . Causes forthe .lov, ,number of bids were no t evaluated to increase competition for futur e procurements . Rcstric_tive specifications or purchase J he from bidding . ;iveri insufficient time to bid rejected because of minor dis- crepancies . `vVeconcluded that routinely followin, ; pro- cedures for formal advertising ; does not alway s insure effective competition . Procurement of- ficers need to give closer attention to how wel l their formal advertisinpractices achieve maxi -0competition ./.null We recommended that the Department of fDefense and the General Services Adminis -/.null tration, the major agencies responsible for pro-/.null f curement pokey, Instruct their procurement of - fives and agencies lei : Establish prog ;rauis to selectively review th e extent of competition achieved under forma l advertising ; and take aggressive action to stimulate competition where it appears to b e restricted . Establish work simplification progra ills to reduce administrative cast by (1) soliciting ; only previous bidders or suppliers and firth s that request an invitation for bid, (2) sitapli- fying and shortening ; invitations for bids, an d (3) reevaluatin ; Ike reduirements for disu-ib- utirtg invitations 1e prol always agree with our stigg ;este d solutions . Both agencies were concerned abou t the additional regulation andcont rolthat w e se<-nied to be suggesting . While the Departmen t of Defense said many of the sugj .,esdo ns ha d been considered previously, would be costly , would add to ptoc-urement time, and would er e ate additional paperwork, the general Service s Administration said that these problems coul d be solved by educating ; psrsc,nncl at the oper- ating but . we also believ e Government agencies should achieve snore germ- ane competition in formal bidding ; at lower a d ministrative costs . (B-176418, Aug ;. 14, 1973 .) Lease Versus Purchase of Navy Tanker s One of the responsibilities oa rthe.'navy is t o 'irrange ocean transportation of bulk petroleum , oii, and lubricant products for the Departmen t ol' Defense . In June 1972 the ?navy entered into a buil d and charter program to acquire the use (4 9 new tankers . Private interests were to provide the f i rtaucin for their construction, with a-commi t ment from the Navy, that it would lease th e tankers, with renewal previsions, for 20 years . T'he cost to the Government to lease these- tl.cnkers ill undiscounted dollars would be$314 million, while tirecost to purchase in undis- counied dollars would be $136 million .How - ever, whether leasing or purchasing is the more eco n o nt i c a l alternative depends upon th e discount rate used to calculate the present valu e of future payments . Our analysis shows that i t N~'ould be more economical to purchase th e tankers using a 6 percent discount rate under th e Criterion contained in Office of Management an d Budget Circular A-76, and that it would be Wor e advantageous to lease the tankers using a 10 per - rent;discount rate under the criterion containe d in Cii-cular A-94 . The Department did not concur in m netidation . Therefore, we stated inour repor t that Defense, along with Office of Managemen t Mid Budget, should determine the appropriat e discomit rate to he usect nlease-versus-purchas e anal~'ses . Since the Navy's build and charter program i s similar to Government programs for leasin g buildings, We suggest that the Congress conside r evaluating the rived for legislation -similar t o Public Law 92-313 of ]title 16, 1972 . This law amended the Public Building Act of 1959 tore- quire congressional approval of all leases ityear andto require that itpro- spectus containing the details of the transactio n be provided to tire Congress . Similar legislatio n imi N,be ippropi-late for long-term leasing of suc h assets its ships . (13-17 =1839, Aug . 15, 1973 .) Contacts with Foreign Firm s Should be Priced in Local Currenc y The Department ofDefense has not establish . rd itformal policy for determining whether de - fense contracts with foreign firths should b e priced in dollars, local currency, or a combi- nation of tooth . Since selection cifcurrency i s left to the_ judgment of local contracting offi- cers, itnumber of different practices exist, some- tHues within the=saine country or continent . The kind of currency used is oflittle inip or- tance when the rate ofexchange is stable . Whei i the exchange rate has ithistory of significantPROCUREMENT AND SYSTEMS ACQUISITIO N fluctuation oris expected to change during th e contract period, the kind of currency used be - comes important . We found that theDepartment of Defense re- frained from formulating a uniform policy oi l the basis that its contracting officers neede d flexibility to insure that (1) current-%! fluctu - ations did not result inunjust_ train or less t o either the U .S. Government or the contractors , and(2) payment arrangements did not provid e incentives for contractors to speculate on cur- rency fluctuations . We believe this approach ha s not accomplished the intended- purpose ; ill fact , the opposite appears to have occtu-red in auntll- ber of instances . While there -is a diversity in tir e practices being employee(, generally (lie area or local practices follow the contractors 'wishes . In our report to the Congress we recon-n7end - ed that : The Secretary of Defense establish a polic y requiring that local currency be used to Bric e and pay foreign contracts unless there is a compelling reason to use dollars ;_ such as a recluireme-rnt for purchases ill tile 1-jilife d States .

(B-178845, Apr . 16, 1974 .) On June 10, 1974, the Chairman, Senat e Committee on Armed Services, asked us to re - view the Department of Defense ongoing cost - effectiveness study of the B-1 when it i s completed ; to provide an independent assess- ment of the assumptions, as well as the con- clusions and recommendations ; and report ou r findings and recommendations to the committe e as early as possible, but not later than Octobe r 1, 1974 . Outlook for Production o f Two Shipbuilding Program s As part of our continuing review of majo r acquisition programs, we examined the status o f two of the Navy 's largest shipbuildin g programs\u2014the general-purpose amphibious as- sault ship (LHA) and DD-963 destroyer . Much controversy developed over these con - tracts, particularly over delivery delays and cos t growth of the LHA program . Contractor cos t estimates for the LHAs are more than ceilin g price, and delivery has been delayed 2 years o r more . In our report to the Congress, .ve noted tha t the principal concern ofLitton and the Nav y regarding these programs was the unintendedsimultaneous construction of' the LIIAs an d DD-963s and the adverse effect that itslippage i n the construction schedule ofone progrsun coul d have on the other . \"There was little docrbt tha t Litton and the _Navy rrnderesIInctIcd th e problems involved in (1) starting a new shi p building facility, (2) obtaining an adequate wor k force, (3) designing ships 2,000 miles from i -hc construction site by a completely new organ i zation, and (4) using aerospace produc :t_ion 1cch - niqucs . Unique contracting ; concepts also contribute d to the problems . For the first time, the Nav y delegated to the contractor almost complet e responsibility for decisions on program cxc- cution and complete design responsibility . Th e effects of these concepts will not be known unti l all contractor claims are resolved . Both partie s have made charges on actions or inactions . Serious problems have been encountered i n getting the LHA program underway . Both th e Navy and Litton project cost increases on th e LHA contract, but Litton's estimate is hiuhe r than what the Navy considers allowable unde r the contract . They disagree on who is responsi- ble for the problems and resulting cost growth . The cost and schedule estimates of' th e DD-963 program have changed little since th e contract was signed in June 1970 .

(B-163058, Mar . 7 , 1974 .) Status of Selected Major Weapon System s In 1969 various congressional committee s asked us to report periodically on the progres s and status of various system acquisitions . Prio r to fiscal year 1974, we reported the status o f major systems annually as of June 30 . In fisca l year 1974 we began semiannual reporting wit h status reports as of December 31, 1972, an d June 30 and December 31, 1973 . Evaluations o f selected management functions will now be re - ported as they are completed in lieu of com- bining an assessment of management actions an d financial status in a single annual report . Th e schedule and performance data on variou s systems will continue to be reported in our an- nual staff studies on individual systems . During hearings before the Subcommittee o n Priorities and Economy in Government, Join t Economic Committee, in November 1973, it wa s suggested that we include schedule and per- formance data in addition to the financial dat a in the semiannual report on the status of select- ed major weapon systems . Our third semiannual report, submitted to th e Congress in May 1974, included financial data, a listing of systems 12 months or more behind th e planned schedule for delivery of the first incre- ment, and a listing of systems which, in ou r opinion, have experienced significant changes i n planned performance . We reported a net increas e of$7 billion in estimated costs of 55 majo r weapon systems for the 6 months ende d December 31, 1973 . In addition, we include d schedule data for 24 systems behind the planne d schedule for delivery, and performance data on15 systems that have experienced significan t changes in planned performance .

Thes e laws (1) provide for payments to the C-5 A contractor--the Lockheed Aircraf t Corporation\u2014through a special bank account , (2) contain certain restrictions on the payments , and (3) require us to audit payments from th e special bank account and submit quarterly rz- - ports to the Congress . Since June 16, 1971, the Department of th e Air Force has paid Lockheed $634 .1 rnilliol l from the special bank account against the tota l appropriated amount of $657 .5 million . In ou r four quarterly reports to the Congress in fisca l year 1974, we found no payments from th e special bank account to Lockheed that wer e contrary to the laws . In our previous reports we questioned th e propriety of payments to [hi ,contractor fo r contributions to employees' retirement fund s well before the contractor needed them . In response to our recommendation, the Depart- ment issued Defense Procurement Circular 11 4 in July 1973 which includes regulation change s designed to encourage regular payments b y contractors to pension funds .

Size and Cost of th e Federal Work Forc e In June 1974, the Federal Government em- ployed about 5 million persons : almost 2 .8 mil -Nearly 40 percent of the audit work of thi s division during the year was performed in re- sponse to congressional requests . The number o f requests received increased markedly over th e preceding year, from 52 to 93 . At June 30 , 1974, we had ti7 open requests on which w e were vvorking . In addition to sending reports to committee s and Members of the Congress to respond to thei r requests, we inforinally provided informatio n they requested through briefings, staff papers , and descriptive data . In several cases, tine information provided wa s used by the Congress to substantially reduc e Federal expenditures . For example, tLe Hous e Appropriations Committee used such informa- tion (1) to make a $1 .5 million reduction in th e fiscal year 1974 Defense appropriation reques t for the Uniformed Services Savings Deposi t Pro4g ari and (2) to recommend that, except fo r the accounts of military personnel missing i n action, the program be terminated . The Depart- ment of Defense terminated the program a s recommended, and this action should annuall y save more than $25 million . Our policy is to assign staff members to com- mittees of the Congress that ask for staff assist- ance, provided that manpower and funds ar e available to permit such assignments . At Jun e 30, 1974, two of our senior staff members wer e assigned to committees\u2014one to the Manpowe r and Civil Service Subcommittee of the Hous e Post Office and Civil Service Committee ; the other, to the House Foreign Operations an d Government Information Committee . 80 FEDERAL PERSONNEL AND COMPENSATIO N DIRECTO R F.

R. DEBAISE FEDERAL PERSONNEL AND COMPENSATIO N Audit Report s During fiscal year 1974, we prepared 4 0 reports on Federal personnel and compensatio n matters . Of that number, 8 were submitted t o the Congress and 18 were submitted to specifi c committees or Members of the Congress on re - views made at their request . The remaining 1 4 reports were sent to heads of departments an d agencies . Most of our reports contained recommenda- tions to promote greater effectiveness, effi- ciency, and economy through improved per- sonnel management and controls . Agenc y officials were generally responsive to ou r reports, indicating agreement with our finding s and intention to take corrective action . Specifi c actions taken during the year on our report s resulted in one-time savings of abort $14-8 mil - lion and estimated annual savings of more tha n $28 .5 million . The remainder of this chapter summarizes th e principal audit work completed during the yea r and in process at the end of the year . Acquiring and Managin g The Work Forc e Apportionment Requirement Fo r Federal Service Appointment s The Civil Service Act requires that appoint- ments to competitive civil service positions i n the departmental service in Washington, D .C., be apportioned on the basis of population amon g the States, territories, and the District of Colum- bia. By Executive order, the requirement wa s extended to positions in the Washington metro- politan area . Apportionment was based on th e belief that all parts of the country should b e represented in Government operations at th e national level . We reported to the Congn-ess that the effect o f apportionment had been minimal . Only 1 5 percent of the 326,000 civilian Federal em- ployees in the Washington area in May 197 3 were counted against the requirement . Th e remaining 85 percent were either employee s whose appointments were not subject to appor-tionment (such as veterans) or were employeesin positions for which the requirement had bee n waived . For jobs that were apportioned, equita . ble distribution had not iCSLIRC(l . We concluded that apportionment had out - lived its usefulness . Accordingly, we recom- mended that the Congress act favorably upo n proposed legislation to e!iminate the require- ment . (B-84938, Nov . 30, 1973 .) Seiection of Support Activity Source s As stated in Office of Management and Budg- et Circular A-76, the Government 's policy Fo r obtaining commercial or industrial products an d services is to rely on the private enterprise sys- tem unless the national interest requires itGov- ernment agency to provide them directly . Eac h agency is required to maintain an inventory o f commercial or industrial activities and to revie w each activity at least once every 3 years t o justify i n house performance . I'he review s should include cost studies whenever in-hous e performance is based on economy . We reviewed implementation of Circular A-7 6 at seven civil agencies whose annual operatin g costs of inventoried commercial or industria l activities totaled about $300 million . We foun d and reported to the Congress that six of' th e seven agencies had not complied with the r( - -- quirements of the circular for one or more o f the following reasons . They had not : -Supported justification for in-house per- formance of activities . \u2014Completed reviews when required . Further, we reported that . conversion of activ- ities to contract -)erformance had not bee n carried out as prescribed by Circular A-76 ; internal audit groups had not reviewed agen' :ics ' implementation of the circular ; and agencies ' instructions implementing the circular did no t provide sufficient guidance . Our recc,mmendations, which generally paral- leled those of the entire Commission on Govern- ment Procurement, were that a new approac h and stronger implementation were needed in th e application of the circular policies . We recom- mended that a senior member of the Office o f .Management and Budget be assigned full time t o this matter and that he be assisted by a n 82 FF,DERAL PERSONNEL AND COMPENSATIO N itrter-agency task rorce . Such a task force w .Ls est31)lisltcd under . ','his group is its o achieve stronger implenneniation of Cirrula r A-76. (13-158685, 1 Illy:l I, 1973 .)

We recommended that the Office of Manage- ment and Budget, delegating appropriate respon- sibilities to the General Services Administration : \u2014Develop and furnish agencies with commo n criteria and guidelines for implementing th e tes, of managing through fiscal controls . \u2014Encourage agencies to test the use of fisca l controls to manage operations . \u2014Monitor actions taken and results experi- enced by the agencies . We also recommended that the Secretary o f Defense authorize continuation of the project a t the service laboratories . The Department of Defense concurred in cu r report and endorsed the recommendations . While agreeing with the project objective, th e Office of Management and Budget suggeste d that objective measures of productivit y_ be devel - oped before expanding the project to othe r agencies . (B-165959, June 21, 1974 .) Army Enlisted Evaluation Syste m In April 1974 we reported to the Secretary o f the Armv the results of our study of the Army' s Enlisted Evaluation System . The system pro- vides data used as a basic for individual per- sonnel actions and other management actions , such as c_*ablishing training plans . The evalua- tion process, which cost about $7 .5 million i n fiscal year 1970, consists of (1) tests of an in- dividual's ability to perform assigned tasks an d (2) one or more Enlisted Efficiency Report s representing a supervisor 's assessment of certai n professional characteristics, duty performance , and advancement potential . We reported that test absenteeism appeared t o be a problem ; about 50,000 soldiers (14 per - cent) missed their scheduled tests in fiscal yea r 1972 . The number of test compromises (i .e. , tests being acquired by unauthorized persons ) seemed to be rising, increasing from about 1 2 cases a year in the 1960s to 35 cases during th e first 6 months of calendar year 1973 . Moreover , while a purpose of the evaluation system is t o provide an objective measure of personnel com- petence, the system did not appear to hav e much impact on enlisted promotion decisions . Itaccounted for only 15 percent of all factors con- sidered for promotions . Actions taken by the Army should improv e the system 's operation, but we concluded tha t the active support of field installation and uni t commanders was needed . (B-177952, Apr . 5, 1974 .) Pay and Fringe Benefit s Need to Revise Method o f Increasing Military Pa y The objective of Public Law 90-207 is to pro - Vide rnilitary members with pay increases com- parable to Federal civilian pay increases . W e reported to the Chairmen, Senate and Hous e Armed Services Committees, that military com- pensation adjustments made under this law an d laws which adjust the quarters and enlisted sub- sistence allowances separately had not achieve d that objective and had caused : \u2014Overstatement of military basic pay . \u2014Understatement of quarters and officers ' subsistence allowances . \u2014Ir tlation of other pays, such as retired pay , related to basic pay . --Increased take-home pay for military mem- bers living and eating in Government facili- ties over that of members residing in civilia n corn munities . We recommended that the Congress chang e the method of determining military pay increases . We pointed out that either of two alternative s would correct the most significant pay adjust- ment problems and save the Government a n estimated $2 .9 billion during the next 5 years . One of the alternatives had been proposed b y the Department of Defense ; the other had bee n suggested by the Brookings Institution . W e preferred Lhe latter, called the equal percentag e method, because it was simple to explain, eas y to understand, and uncomplicated to administer . The report also identified the following prob- lems inherent in the military compensatio n system which tend to frustrate accurate trans- lation of civilian pay increases into military pa y increases : \u2014There is no agreed-upon external standar d for military pay . 84 FEDERAL PERSONNEL AND COMPENSATIO N \u2014Regular military compensation, the sum o f basic pay, quarters, subsistence allowances , and tax advantage, is not a precise equiv- alent of a civilian salary . \u2014The military compensation system is no t interrelated with the General Schedule a s are other Federal pay systems for the pur- pose of determining pay adjustments . \u2014Equal, across-the-board regular militar y compensation increases, when desirable, ar c virtually impossible to achieve . Since solutions to these problems require exten- sive study and consideration, we recommended that they be addressed by the Defense Man - power Commission . The Department of Defense withdrew it s original proposal and submitted a new proposa l recommending that the Congress adopt the GA O preferred equal percentage method . This pro- posal was passed by the House of Representa- tives on July 1, 1974, and was awaiting actio n by the Senate . (B-163770, Afar . 14, 1974 .) Need for Executive Pay Increas e And Reform of Pay-setting Proces s In February 1974, we sent to various cOngres- sional committees, Members of the Congress, an d agency heads a report containing informatio n and observations on the need for adjustment o f Federal executive pay and reform of the pay - setting process . The report was prepared i n response to requests from itcommittee chairma n and a number of Members of Congress . We reported that the quadrennial procedur e for adjusting the pay of officials in the exccu- tive, legislative, and judicial branches, as pro- vided by the Salary Act of 1967, was failing t o achieve its objective, These officials 'salaries ha d not increased in 5 years . Moreover, senior employees in pay system s other than the Executive Schedule were losin g significant comparability salary increases an d retirement benefits because the salary rate o f Execu tive Level V had placed a $36,000 ceiling ; on these pay systems since January 1971 . Thi s adversely affected, not only the employees, bu t also the Government, because it had made it in- creasingly difficult to hire and retain senior leve l personnel . We concluded that (1) the President's Febru- ary 4, 1974, recommendations for increasingexecutive, legislative, and judicial salaries shoul d be accepted and (2) major reforms were neede d in the process for adjusting Executive Schedul e salaries . The Congress did not accept the President' s recommendations . However, several legislativ e proposals were subsequently introduced in th e Congress to adjust executive pay and to mak e major chariges in the pay-set sing process to cor- rect or help alleviate the p_oblcm . We submitte d specific comments and testified on these pro- posals . (B-101892, Feb . 19, 1974 .) Approving Extended Sick Leav e For Retiring Employee s Federal civilian employees earn 13 days o f sick leave a vear, and any unused sick leave in - creases employees 'service time in computin g retirement annuities . Nevertheless, it is finan- cially advantageous for employees touse th e leave before retiring, because they generally ob- tain a larger annuity and receive full pay whil e on leave . We reported to the Secretary of Defense that in an examination at five military bases w e found that (1) on May 31, 1973, 246 employee s were on extended sick leave pending optiona l retirement and received approval for an averag e of 222 clays of sick leave valued at about $2 .7 million and (2) during the previous 6 months , 139 of the 263 employees who optionally re - tired used an verage of 172 days of sick leav e valued at over $1 million after their last day o f work . At three installations, requests for extende d sick leave were approved routinely, usually with - out adequate medical evidence supporting th e employees 'incapacity for work . One base re- quired such evidence, and the other prohibite d extended sick leave in connection xvith optiona l retirement . These varying practices may hav e occurred because the Department of Defens e had not issued guidelines to administer thi s aspect of sick leave . Employees on extended sick leave remain o n the payroll, and limitations on ful,ds and man - power spaces have prevented their being replace d by hiring additional permanent employees . Consequently, work was deferred, the workloa d of other employees increased, and overtime an d hiring temporary employees were required . 85 FEDERAL PERSONNEL AND COMPENSATIO N = 5 7 The Comptroller General testifying before the Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee on executive, legislative, and judicial pa y bills. Left to right are Assistant Director John S . Emery, Comptroller General Elmer B . Staats, and Director Forrest R . Browne . Because about 300,000 D :fensc employee s either were or would soon be eligible for op- tional retirement, the widespread use of ex - tended sick leave could become a major prob- lem. We recommended that Uniform policies b e established requiring adequate medical evidenc e before approving extended sick leave and tha t Defense installations review existing cases o f employees using st,ch leave pending optiona l retirement . The Department of Defense in- dicated that our recommendations w rould b e implemented. (B-152073, Feb . 19, 1974 .) Paying Compensation Claim s Of Disabled Federal Employee s During fisctd year 1972, the Governmen t processed nearly 27,000 injury and fatalit y claims submitted for Federal employees andpaid over $186 million against such claims . Ou r report to the Congress highlighted the need for it faster way to pay these claims . We pointed ou t that, on the average, fr(1 49 days to 70 day s elapsed between the time an employee was in- jured and stopped work and the time his corn - pensation claim was approved forpayment b y the Department of Labor 's Officc of Federa l Employees 'Gonpensation . A ,,itgeneral rule, th e compensation check was mailed to the employe e 2 or 3 days after the claim was approved . Agency representatives attributed this tim e lapse to itnumber of factors, including (1 ) understaffing at both the employing agencie s and the Office of Federal Employees' Corn- pensation and (2) employees and supervisor s being lax in completing required form ;, sub- mitting incomplete or inaccurate data, and no t knowing their rights and responsibilities . 86 FEDERAL PERSONNEL AND C ;OMPENSAT IO N We recommended that the Conoress favorahl y consider prndin Ic\"isfatiun that would h ;avc rednccd the lag, in contpcnsatiort payments b y permitting each a\"cticy it)pay its employees ' claims rather than the Office Federal 10\" . ployce s'Cortipcitiation . of the clainis had heat ap- provcd in the Mast . \\t\"wen paynu ms made o n clanncs subsequently disapproycd by the Offic e of federal Employe cs' Compensation could hav e been recouped by the Government by with - holding ,salaries, rctircralcrlt benefits, or Icac c balances after employees returned to work . That lcJsl atioit was not enacted by the Coi l cress. However, at the close of the fiscal sca r the Congress was considering ntiv, very simila r legislation directed at iee!uci ig the time rctl dw d to pay compensation claims to disabled Federa l employees . (B-157593, Nov, 21, 1973 .)We believed that, ahhous ;h the proYra111 WAS terminated, tttc results ofstir reyic\\v would b e beneficial to the Dcparlment of Defense i n planning future,proti runs haying, obicctivcs sint i la to those of the T-r ansltion Program .

During ,fiscal yea r1971, we concluded a lollowup review to evaluate the program at th e installation level . While the review was unde r way, the Defense Subcommittee, house Com- mittec on Appropriations, requested its to pro - vide it information we had developed on th e program . The sub :-onnnittee used the informa- tion extensively during its hearings on the fisca l year 1974 Defense appropriation regricst . At th e conclusion of the hearings, the subcommitte e recommended termination of the program . In response, the Depart .mcnt of Defense terminate d the program on May 31, 1974 . The phaseout o f the program resulted in (1) savings in fiscal yea r 1974 estimated at $30 .8 million and (2) futur e years 'savings estimated at more than $[ :100 million .4 't/.null y ~ t do.is t 3 1 t .q F - X/.null -I Transit on Program job training in the Navy . 87 FEDERAL PERSONNEL AND COMPENSATIO N services . The Army program wits 36 weeks lo n and included 210 flying hours in helicopters a t Fort Wolters, Texas, and Fort Rucker, Alabama . Air Force students were being trained by th e Army . The Army pianned to close its trainin g site at Fort Wolters and consolidate training a t Fort Rucker in fiscal year 1974 . The Navy program, conducted at Pensacola , Florida, was 44 weeks long and included a tota l of 216 flying hours in fixed-wing aircraft an d helicopters . Marine Corps students were bein g trained by the Navy . Although the gravy pro - gram was 8 weeks longer than the Army ':;, bot h programs provided essentially the same numbe r of flight and academic hours of training . We recommended to the Secretary of Defens e that he direct the Navy to discontinue th e fixed-wing training and move toward consoli- dating undergraduate helicopter pilot trainin g under a joint, all-helicopter program because : \u2014After the Army consolidates its program a t Fort Rucker, that installation will be used a t only 55 percent of capacity and could ac- commodate all I)efense undergraduat e training requirements through 1976 . \u2014The Navy could discontinue the filed-win g portion of training without degrading it s training program . Such action would enabl e the Navy to cancel plans to buy 93 ne w fixed-wing aircraft costing $18 million . --The Army had 565 excess t raining heli- copters that could be used in it consolidate d training program . \u2014The Navy,could cancel plans to construc t training facilities costing S1 .5 million . Army officials did not object to our proposal fo r consolidation. Navy officials were generally op - posed to this recommendation . (F1_-157905, %la y 3, 1_974 .) Full-time, Fully Funded Educatio n Of Military Personne l The Department of Defense spent over $17 0 million during fiscal year 1973 on full-time , fully funded graduate and undergraduate . educa- tion programs for military personnel . The result s of our survey of these programs were reporte d to the Secretary of Defense . We reported that, in the graduate educatio n area, officers were enrolled in disciplines forwhich there were no validated requirements or- for which a sufficient inventory of officers wit h advanced degrees ahcady existed . Conversely , shortages of officers with advanced dcgrec s existed in other disciplines, and in sonic eases , positions validated its requiring an advance d degree were being filled by officers without suc h degrees . In the undergraduate education area, th e Navy was using its enlisted personnel progr .un t o satisfy educational aspirations of enlisted me n rather than to fill job requirement~ . The Department of Defcnsc informed us tha t it concurred in our recommendations for come c ;ivc action and that they would be implcnrentcd . (is-1757 73, Mar . 6, 1974 .) Intersevvice Training in th e Department of Defens e We reported to the Secretary of Defcnsc tha t economies and efficiencies obtainable throug h consolidating common Befcnse training rcquirc- ments had not been achieved . This occurre d because each military service had decided ho w its training requirements could best he mel with - in its own resources. Neither the Office of' th e Secretary of Defense nor the service hcad- quarters had assessed efforts by training com- mands to promote interservicc training . After learning of our findin gs, the service s began a joint review of training programs an d resources to identify interservicc training op- portunities .The prospects for meaningfu l progress were encouraging because of the serv- ices 'apparent willingness to relinquish parochia l interests and to join in a concerted effort t o promote interservice training . We made recommendations directed at havin g the Office of the Secretary of Defense monito r the services 'interservicc training efforts . kV c were informed that action wits being taken t o implement the recommendations .

Our report included several recommendations t o improve the delivery of health services t o Indians . The Department agreed with most of ou r recommendations and reported actions taken o r planned to implement them . We reported tha t further action is required in certain progra m areas involving 'maternal and child health, otiti s media, and tuberculosis . (13-164031(2), Mar . 11, 1974 .) Impact of Comprehensive Healt h Planning in Selected Area s In our report to the Congress on compre- hensive health planning carried out by State an d DISTRIBUTION OF DEATHS BY AGE DURING 197 1areawide agencies in three States, we conclude d that the agencies had abeneficial impact on th e health care delivery system mostly by (1 ) reviewing and commenting on federally finance d projects for delivery of health services, (2) reviewing and approving proposed health facilit y construction projects, and (3) reacting to healt h problems brought to their attention by variou s sources rather than through a systematic plan- ning process . We recommended that the Secretary of HE W direct the development of legislative or adminis- trative action to alleviate such problems as dif- ficulties in raising required matching funds, lac k of adequate staffs, selection and participatio n of volunteers in planning activities, prope r relationships between State and areawid e agencies, and lack of an implementation proces s for developed recommendations . INDIAN The Department concurred and said it wa s working to alleviate the problems noted and t o develop a significant legislative proposal . (B-164031(2), Apr . 18, 1974 .) Prevention andControl of Diseas e status ofCommunicable Disease Control Effort s The Center for Disease Control assists Stat e programs to control communicable diseas e directly through grants and indirectly throug h in-house and other research . We reviewe d programs covering about 25 percent of th e Nation 'stotal population to decide if Federa l control programs could he improved . In our report to the Congress, we discusse d the incidence of (1) venereal diseases, particular- ly gonorrhea which has increased to epidemi c proportions, and ,(2) tuberculosis, which still ac - counts for two-thirds of deaths caused by al l communicable diseases . We commented also tha t immunization for avariety of communicabl e diseases was below medically necessary level s The `Department agreed with our recom- mendation that it foster more economi c procurement of vaccines by encouraging th e States to (1) use the Center's centralize d procurement system and (2) accept vaccines sup - plied by the Department instead of financial as- sistance . HEW indicated that our recom- mendation forperiodic reviews of results bein g achieved under gonorrhea control projects - .nigh t not be appropriate for measuring the effective- ness of the projects . (B-164031(2), June 10 , 1974 .) Testimony before Congressional Committe e In February 1974 we testified before the Sub - committee on Public Health and Environment , House Committee inn' Interstate and Foreig n Commerce, onthe results of our review of th e community mental health centers program . Audit Work in Proces s Audit work in process at June 30, 1974 , included audits of the effectiveness of (1 ) federally supported` rat - control programs, (2 ) f o_r m u la grant programs for comprehensiveMANPOWER AND WELFAR E public health and maternal and child healt h services, and (3) financial administration o f grants and contracts with afamily plannin g organization . In addition, the Health Maintenance Act o f 1973 (Public Law 92-322) requires the Comp - troller General to evaluate and audit th e operations of at least 50 Health Maintenanc e Organizations ; to evaluate the economic impac t on employers of including HMOs in health benc- fits programs ; and to evaluate and compare th e operations and health impact of HMOs by cate- gories and as a group compared to other form s of health delivery . Because of the scope an d complexity of these and closely related evalu- ations, we anticipate that GAO will be involve d in this work for a ntunbcr of years . Food and Drug Administratio n Supervision Over Investigational Use of Selected Drug s At the request of the Chairman, Subconunit- tee on Reorganization, Research and Inter - national Organizations, Senate Committee o n Government Operations, we reported on FDA' s supervision over selected investigational ne w drugs . FDA is responsible for monitoring th e drug's safety and efficacy during - clinica l (human) tests . We reported that (1) FDA faile d to halt human tests after receiving indication s that certain of the drugs were unsafe, (2) dru g companies (lid not always report adverse -_lru g reactions occurring in animal studies to FD A promptly, and (3) FDA did not rcduire recces- sary patient followup in several instances afte r receiving such reports . We recolnmcnded that FDA (1) make a writ - ten determination that a drug 's benefits Out - weigh the possible risks of its experimental us e before allowing clinical_ *csts to begin o r continue when serious safety drrestioi-Is concern- ing testing drugs in humans arise, (2) institute a program to insure prompt reporting of anima l studies, and (3) establish patient followu p policies and requirements . The Department concurred in our reconr- - mendations ~;ndadvised usthat it had starte d actions to implement them . (B-1 .64031(2), Jul y 23, 1973 .) 99 MANPOWER AND WELFAR E FDA's Handling ofdeports on Adverse Drug Reaction s 1 1DA is responsible by law for regulating an d insuring, that, drugs' invol ved in interstate com- mci ce are safe and effective . Advising the publi c and doctors of adverse reactions caused by drug s is a fuirdanlental hart of this responsibility . To identify information on adverse drug reaction s and to assistin drug regulation, FDA created a n advcrsc drug reaction reporting system . FDA' s monitoring-unit is to develop sources of advers e drug reaction reports and to collect, analyze , centrally store, and forward the information to FDA 's regulatory divisions .- \"These divisions ar e responsible for taking needed action to regulat e marketed drugs . We reported to the Congress that the syste m errs not adedttatelj- used to re ;elate drugs . Som e medical officers in the regulatory divisions (1- ) did not use it, (2) did not know it existed, or (3 ) were uncertain whether FDA had the burden ci f proving whether a specific drug caused advers e reactions .Also, the system was deficient in tha t the miiniton 'n(Tunit (1) received only a limite d number of adverse reaction reports, (2) .did no t always obtain additional information needed t o evaluate reports received, (3) did not stor e centrally= all information available -within FDA , and (4_) did not send complete information t o the regLtlatory divisions and did not send it on a systematic basis . We made anumber of recommendations t o improve the system and its use as an aid in dru g regulation . 'Thc Department agreed with ou r recornmendatic,ns and -outlined several action s which it had Laken orplanned to take t o improve the system and its use . (B-164031(2) , Mar. 7, 1974 .) Audit Work in Process - Audii \\%ork in process at June 30, 1974, in- cluded reviews ofFDA's (1) program for regu - I a t i ng and controlling the manufacture o f diagnostic nrc)ducts ; (2) implementation of th e Fan Packaging and Labeling Act, (3) monitorin g ()f clinical investigations of new drugs, (4 ) pio ,(ram for regulating sanitation conditions i n restaturan~ts, and (5) radiological healt h 1)r()~ rails . 100National Institutes of Healt h Federal Loans and Scholarships to Health Professions Student s We reported to the Congress that the ob- jcctives of the Health Professions Student As- sistance Program to alleviate expected shortage s of doctors, dentists, and other health profes- sionals were not being met . The program wa s expected to improve the duality of s udents , encourage graduates to practice in shortag e areas, and increase the proportion of student s from low-income families . We recommended that the prograuu goals h e accomplished through other existing Federa l programs, such as Federal ..assistance in con- struction of teaching facilities, federally insure d loans, and the Shortage Area Scholarshi p Program . If the Congress decided to continu e the program, we offered suggestions to improv e its effectiveness . These included (1) combinin g scholarship funds with loan funds, (2) providin g loans at interest rates that are coulparahle t o those available to the Government in view of th e high-income potential o1 't.he. students, (3 ) increasing the number of health profession s students from low-income families, and (4 ) coordinating the various Federal programs pro- viding aid to health professions students . In ad- dition, we cited weaknesses in the adminis- tration of the program and made recommen- dations for improvement . The Department subsequently announce d plans to improve the program's administratio n arid agreed that the program has not had muc h impact in influencing doctors and dentists t o practice in shortage areas . IIEW disagreed, how - ever, with our views on the program 's impact o n increasing the number and improving the qualit y of health professions students . On May 29, 1974, wetestified on our repor t before the Subcommittee on Public Health an d Environment, House Committee on Interstat e and Foreign Commerce, which was considerin g legislation to extend the program . (B-] 6403] (2) , May 24, 1974 .)

The organizaticur s involved could not show that most of ,the ne w educational products and practices -that_ they dcv(lol)ed net desired objectives or were readil y and cconumic_idly available For classroom use . We reported that the programs could hav e been more affective had the organizations (1)MANPOWER AND Mt-FAR E ill N for bull) Illy long Icrn~a, anti (' ;) dcnronsl rated m Congress tjpward might be njotivatitl l 101 MANPOWER AND WELFAR E s l udents to enroll in college, the Office o f Education sloes not know how effective th e program has been -inachieving its goal of equip - ping; low-income, disadvantaged students wit h the academic skills and motivation necessary fo r succ.-ss in college .Available data indicates tha t the prograrn` apparently has not achieved thi s goal . Contrary to HEW guidelines, the Office o f Education did not develop specific, measurabl e objectives of improving academic skills an d increasing motivation . The program 's manage- ment information system was not providin g progra nmanagers with the data needed to develop, plan, and evaluate the program . Projects were not required to (1) develo p comprehensive need assessments on all students , including motivation levels, (2) design a cur- riculum to meet identified needs, and (3) per- iodically measure progress made in meetin g these needs . We also reported that the program's monitor- ing system should be strengthened to insure tha t all projects operate in accordance with nationa l intent and that the Department's regional office s should insure that projects select students inac- cordance with guidelines and document the basi s used . The Department generally agreed with ou r recommendations and outlined actions to carr y them out . (B-16=1031(1), Mar . 7, 1914 .) Administration of Student Financial Aid Program s At the request of the Chairman, Special Sub - committee oilEducation, House Committee o n Education and Labor, we reported on th e Guaranteed Student Loan, the National Direc t Student Loan, the College Work-Study, and the . Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant s programs . Generally, financial aid officers at educationa l institutions and loan offices at lending insti - tutions we visited administered the programs i n accUrdance with program regulations and guide - lines and awarded aid on the basis of individua l student need. However, aid was occasionall y a~~-~rt ded` on thc basis -of sex, -marital status, age, participa!ion i n <+thlctics, and academic ability . We also reportea that applications submitte d by educational institutions often did not sho w 102student need environments of the requestin ginstitution . HEW regional review panels did rio talways identify and make appropriate adjust ,ments to these applications . We recommendeO that HEW develop guide- lines and instructions for financial aid officer s that will preclude individual student character- istics and other factors from affecting the awar dof aid . We also recommended that HEW stud y alternatives for improving the process throug hwhich educational institutions receive allo- cations of student aid funds . (B-164031(1), Apr . 4, 1974 .) Supply and Demand for Teachers an d Implications for Federal Program s We reported to the Congress that the Federa l Government had initiated extensive financial as- sistance programs for college students during th e early 1960s to meet the growing need fo r elementary and secondary school teachers bu t that these assistance programs may now b e contributing to teacher surpluses . There is no central source for identifying th e programs affecting the teaching profession . Also , complete and consistent data about teacher sup - ply and demand is not available . t-Ve conducted a survey of teacher supply and demand at selected school districts, colleges o f teacher education, and all 50 State department s of education . The survey showed a genera l surplus of elementary and secondary schoo l teachers with the surplus varying amon g geographic areas and teaching subject fields . Some school districts reported a need for ad- ditional . teachers in such fields as education o f the physically or mentally handicapped an d vocational education but lacked suitable ap- plicants . The organizations surveyed cited lack o f adequate counseling in the colleges and uni- versities and a lack of communication within th e education community as major causes of th e surplus . Suggested remedies for the situatio n included retraining teachers and changing cur- riculums to better meet the needs of prospectiv e employers . The Department agreed in our recommenda- tions and stated that corrective actions would b e taken . (B-164031(1), Mar . 6, 1974 .) Audit Work in Proces s At June 30, 1974, we were examining (1 ) Federal programs foreducation of the handicap- ped, (2) reading projects funded under title I o f the Elementary and Secondary Education Act o f 1965, (3) the Follow Through program, (4) th e Bilingual Education program, (5) selecte d aspects of the Impact Aid program, (6) th e Adult Basic Education program, (7) federall y funded library support programs, (8) the Federa l program forstrengthening developing insti- tutions, (9) career education activities, (10 ) vocational education programs, (11) th e National Institute of Education's Experimenta l Schools program, and (12) paperwork require- ments placed' on State and local educationa l agencies by Office ofEducation programs . Office of Human Developmen t Assistance to the Congres s In April 1974 we provided an oral and vide o tape briefing to staff members of the Hous e Committee onEducation and Labor and th e Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfar e on the results of our ongoing review of Projec t Head Start . The briefing was given to assist th e committee staffs intheir deliberations on legis- lation toextend Project Head Start's authorizin g legislation before it expired on June 30, 1974 . Medicaid Progra m The estimated number of persons receivin g medical assistance under the Medicaid progra m was 23 .5million in -1973 and 27 .2 million i n 1974 and is expected to be 28 .6 million in 1975 . -HEW made grants to States for medical assis- tance totaling $5 billion in 1973 and $5 .6 billio n in 1974 and has requested $6 .6 billion for medi- calassistance grants in fiscal year 1975 . Administration Improvements Needed to Provide Medicar e Benefits for Welfare Recipient s We reported to the Congress on section 184 3 of the Social Security Act which provides au- diority to enroll recipients ofcash payments un- dcr public assistance programs or -those entitle d to medical assistance under Medicaid in the sup- plcmcntary medical insurance program estab -MANPOWER AND WELFAR E lished under Medicare . This program cover s physician 's services and a number of other medi- cal and health benefits, in addition to thos e covered by Medicare 's _ -~spital insurance or b y Medicaid . Premiums paid by or for enrollees i n the supplementary program are matched by Fed- eral funds . As of December 1971, about 2 million enroll- ees under section 1843 were participating in th e supplementary insurance program . Since th e program began it had experienced major admin- istrative problems resulting in (1) not all eligibl e persons under section 1843 being enrolled, (2 ) some States receiving overpayments for pre- miums that should have been paid entirely b y the States, and (3) premiums being paid for per - sons several months after they became ineligible . The Department generally agreed with ou r recommendations to improve the program . (B-164031(3) Aug . 14, 1973 .) Implementation of the Illinois Early an d Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, an d Treatment Program Under Medicai d At the request of ReprP ,!Pntative Ralph H . Metcalfe, we reported on the administration o f the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, an d Treatment program in Illinois under its Medicai d program . The Illinois program was late in start- ing, primarily because the Department did no t issue regulations for more than 2 years after th e program became a required service . The lat e start delayed the identification and treatment o f physical and mental problems in many children . (B-164031(4), Mar. 12, 1974 .) Testimony at Hearing s On June 11, 1974, we testified before th e Special Studies Subcommittee, House Commit - tee on Government Operations, on our review o f firesafety in nursing facilities under Medicar e and Medicaid . The review, which was made a t the request of the Subcommittee Chairman, wa s directed principally to (1) validity of the construction classifications of the facilities as \"fire resistive\" and \"protected noncombustible \" and (2) verification of compliance with the re- quirements established by HEW for the issuanc e of waivers to the automatic sprinkler require- ment of the 1967 Life Safety Code . The Lif e Safety Code is promulgated by the National Fir e Protection Association . 103 MANPOWER AND WELFAR E WC testified also onthe results of HE W reviews of Life Safety Code enforcement wit h respect to all skilled nursing facilities which wer e then participating :nMedicare and Medicaid . Ourtestimony included data and informatio n concerning various Life Safety Code deficiencie s found in our review and in that made by th e Department .Afull 'report on our review wa s being prepared for the Subcommittee at th e close of the fiscal year . Other Report s In a report to the Secretary of Health, Educa- tion, and Welfare Nyeinformed him that State s were cor-tinuing to expend significant amount s of Medicaid funds for drugs FDA classified as ineffective and possibly ineffective . We recom- mended- that - he issue regulations to prohibi t such payments . Additional 'work, the results of which wer e informally reported, was completed during fisca l year 1971 forcongressional committees an d Members of Congress . These reports included a n evaluation of certain aspects of the administra- t on of the ;4le_dica d program- in Prince Willia m County, Vir ginia, for Congressman Stanford E . Parris (Virginia) and an ev=aluation of provision s forthe -mentally retarded under Medicajd fo r Senator Jacob K . Javits (New York) . Audit Work in Proces s At the close,of the fiscal year, ive were corn- pleting reviews of(1) home health care unde r 1lcdicare and Medicaid, (2) nursing ]ionic com- pliance with Federal health and safety require- ments, (3) controls ove rMedicaid ( =1) by States of Medicaid Managemen t Information Sy'stern, and, (5) reimbursement t o hospitals for Medicaid inpatient services . Othe r major \"reviews in process were (1) simplifie d method for determining eligibility of the medi- cLdly needy, (2)evaluation of Nledicaid Healt h ;Maintenance Organizations costs, and (3) effect s ofMcdicaud on delivery of health services to th e medically indigent . Income Security Operation s Vending Operations on Federally Controlled Propert y At the request of' the Chairman, Subcorn- roainittee on the Handicapped, Senate Committe e on Labor and Public Welfare, we obtained opera- ting data on vending operations at federally con - trolled locations and determined whether blin d persons were receiving preference in operatin g vending stands at such locations as required b y the Randolph-Sheppard Act enacted in 1936 . :'e reported that, with respect to Stat e agency ,operations, the program was carried out differently from State to State . The quality an d quantity of services provided to participatin g blind persons varied . HEW had not develope d minimum standards of program operations fo r State agencies . Officials recognized the need fo r providing program guidelines or standards an d for making more evalutations of State agenc y operations but said these actions could not b e undertaken because HEW lacked the necessar y personnel . On vending operations at Department of De - Tense and Postal Service installations and othe r federally controlled property, among othe r things, we reported that (1) few blind vendin g operations were on military installations, (2 ) most tending operations at postal facilities wer e near work areas and were controlled by em- ployee associations although blind vendors wer e generally limited to operating in some pos t office lobbies, and (3) blind vendor operation s were more prevalent in other federally con - trolled buildings than at Postal Service or De- fense installations, although certain activitie s compete with the blind vendor program at thes e locations . In November 1973 we testified before th e Subcommittee on the results of our review an d provided comments regarding provisions unde r consideration for amending the Randolph - Sheppard Act . (B-176886, Sept . 27, 1973 .) Effectiveness of Project FIN D At the request of the Chairman, Senat e Special Committee on Aging, we reported o n Project FIND, a campaign to contact and enrol l eligible elderly citizens infood stamp and coin- modity distribution programs . We reported that an increase in enrollment s for Federal food assistance programs did occu r in late 1972 and early 1973 ; however, not all th e increase could be attributed to Project FIND . In addition, the elderly identified asneeding othe r services consisted of avery small percentage o f those - contacted . When such cases were identi- fied they were referred to the local agencie s which : provided such assistance . Wenoted various Project FIND problems . Among the factors affecting the project's succes s were incorrect eligibility information in bro- chures mailed to the elderly residing in som e States, limited training provided tovolunteers , and a lack of effective coordination between vol- unteers and food assistance office staff . Problems of the `type encountered during th e project could be'reduced in future similar pro- jects by (1) better advance planning, (2) estab- lishment of reasonable time frames for comple- tion, and (3) development of project monitorin g and evaluation procedures during the plannin g stage . (B-164031(3), Apra 5, 1974 .) Developmental Disabilities Progra m At the request of the Chairman, Subcom- mittee on the Handicapped, Senate Committe e on Labor andPublic Welfare, we provided exten - sive information on the operation and admin- istration of the Developmental Disabilitie s Services and Facilities Construction Act o f 1970 . The information wasused by the staff i n drafting legislation for extending the program . (B-164031(3), Jan . 23, 1974 .) Other Report s Other reports covered such matters as (1) in- quiring into vocational rehabilitation progra m management in one State and (2) advising o f improper delegations of authority concernin g programs of the Administration on Aging . Audit Work in Proces s As of June 30, 1974, we were working towar d completion on reviews concerning (1) an evalu- ation of the child welfare program, (2) the effec- tiveness of the child support program, (3) th e adequacy ofHEW's quality control over the Ai d toFamilies With Dependent Children Program , (4) reimbursement to States forcosts associate d with public assistance programs, and (5) the re - liability and use of data published by th e National Center forSocial Statistics .MANPOWER AND WELFAR E Medicare Programs The Medicare program provides, foreligibl e persons aged 65 and over, (1) hospital insuranc e for inpatient hospital services and post hospita l care in skilled nursing care facilities or in th e patient's home, and (2) a supplementary` in- surance to cover physician's services . For fisca l year 1974, Medicare had a funding level of about $9 .5 billion and covered about 20 millio n aged persons . Improving Solicitations for Claims Processing Proposal s At the request of the Chairman, Sub - committee on Intergovernmental Relations , House Committee on Government Operations , we reported onthe procurement policies an d practices in subcontracting for electronic dat a processing services by an insurance compan y which pays Medicare claims in two States unde r contract with the Social Security Administra- tion . We reported that sound and competitive pro- curement practices were not followed by th e contractor in developing specifications orin so- liciting and evaluating proposals . Factors whic h would normally be used to evaluate the pro- posals and their relative weights were not ade- quately disclosed and some were changed or no t used without notifying the offerors . Also , changes in subcontract terms and condition s were negotiated with the successful offeror with - out giving the other offerors the opportunity to respond . We reconunended that offerors be advised o f (1) the evaluation criteria which will be used t o evaluate their proposals, (2) the precise weight s which will be given to price and total costs, an d (3) the method of eomputilig the cost factors, over and above the quoted prices . The Depart- ment agreed with our recommendations.(B-164031(4), Aug . 2, 1973 .) Testimon y We testified in September 1973 before Sub - committee No . 4, House Committee on the ju- diciary, on the results of our review on com- pliance with the antidiscrimination provision o f the Civil Rights Act by hospitals and other facili- ties under Medicare and Medicaid . Our testimony provided updated informatio n 105 MANPOWER AND WELFAR E on matters -contained in our report on com- pliance with the \"antidiscrimination provision . (B 164031(4), July 13, 1972 .) We testified that most hospitals, skilled nurs- ing facilities, and nursing homes participatingi n Medicare and Medicaid in the four major metro- politan areas where we made ourreview were i n compliance with title V1 of the Civil Rights Ac t of 1964 . We noted that, although discriminatio n inproviding health services to minorities migh t notbe totally absent, it did not exist in an over t form subjectto objective analysis and detection . In summary, wereported that (1) an apparen t dual health care system continues to exist, (2 ) HEW had taken action onone of the four area s where our report rioted it had planned to tak e action, ; (3) HEW had increased its complianc e monitoring activity at the institutional level an d decreased its activity at the State and local level , and (4) the incidence of `complaints agains t specific institutions had not materially in - creased . Other Government Health Program s During fiscal year 1974 we reviewed Depart- ment of Defense health programs and the Federal' Employees `Health Benefits Program ad - ministered by the Civil Service Commission . During the fiscal year, Defense spent about $2 .5 billion for the provision of _direct and indirec t patient care to members of the military services , retirees, and military dependents . The Federa l Employee Health Benefits Program provide s health care insurance coverage for about 3 million enrollees and 5 million dependents . Gov- ernment employees contributions to various in- surance plans amounted to about $1 .6 billion i n fisc~d year 1974 .- Need to Improve the Procurement an d Supply of Drugs inthe Federal Governmen t We reported to the Congress several ways i n which the Department of Defense, the Veteran s Administration, and other Federal agencie s could improv e_; their activities relating to the pro - curement and supply of drugs . We recommende d to these agencies that there was a need for (1 ) greater coordination of Federal drug procure- ment activities, (2)specifications and centra l management inprocuring drugs, (3) auniformreporting system for locally purchased drugs , and (4) improved coordination of quality assur- ance activities . The agencies involved expresse d agreement with our findings and have starte d actions to carry out our recommendations . (B-164031(2), Dec . 6, 1973 .) On February 20, 1974, the Con,otroller Gen- eral testified before the Subcommittee on Mon- opoly, Senate Select Committee on Small Busi- ness, on our work relating to the procuremen t of, and reimbursement for, prescription drugs b y the Federal Government . Eliminate Reuse of Catheter s and Guidewires in Vascular Studie s We reported to the Secretary of Defense tha t some military hospitals were reusing disposabl e catheters and guidewires in vascular studies an d that DOD should establish guidelines concernin g the appropriate use of these devices . In Apri l 1974 the Assistant Secretary ofDefense for Health and Environment issued a policy that such devices should be used only once and the n discarded to avoid potential infections and othe r health problems . (B-161475, Mar . 14, 1974 .)A similar report was sent to the Administrator o f VA who took immediate action to insure tha t the practice of reusing disposable catheters an d guidewires would be discontinued . (13-133044 , Nlar. 14, 1974 .) Hospital Charges to Military Dependent s for Inpatient Health Car e The Civilian Health and Medical Program o f the Uniformed Services provides civilian medica l care benefits to dependents of service member s and retirees . The Department of Defense ha d not, since 1956, increased its charges to militar y dependents for inpatient health care . In Octobe r 1973 we met with Department representative s to discuss the need for increasing the dail y charges and were informed that an increase wa s warranted and was being discussed within th e Department . Subsequent to our inquiries, th e daily charge was increased from $1 .75 to $3 .50 per day on the basis of military pay increase s between 1966 and 1973 . In a report to the Secretary of Defense, w e noted the Department's recent actions and als o pointed out that the Department's minimum hospital charge of $25 tomilitary dependent s treated in civilian facilities had not been in - creased since 1956 . We, therefore, recommende d that the appropriateness of the $25 charge b e studied and, if warranted, the Congress be give n sugvestcd legislative changes to increase it . Th e recommcnded study was initiated and Sub- sequently, aDOD- official said an increase wa s justified and legislative- changes were being pre - pared . (B-133142, Apr . 10, 1974 .) Uniform PlanofHealth Insurance for Federal Employees who Retired Before July 1, 196 0 We reported to the Congress_ that the Aetn a Life Insurance Compimy premiums for the Uni- form Plan,_ Linder the Retired Federal Employee s Hc,,ilth Benefits Program, were unnecessa rily high and were not reduced to levels showing th e cost of benefits provided . As a-result, the Pla n acclilnulated reserves inexcess of the amount s needed to, protect- the interests` of 'the Plan an d Aetna .Also, benefits of the Plan and those un- cl c r_ :Medicare overlapped .

Public Employment Programs of th e Emergency Employment Act of 197 1 In fiscal year 1974 we completed our eight h and ninth of itseries of reports over a 2-yea r period initiated at the request of the Chairman , Subcommittee on Employment, Poverty, an d Migratory Labor, Senate Committee on Labo r and Public Welfare . These reports were on th e operation of public employment programs in se- lected rural and urban areas and on the progres s of agents in permanently placing participants i n nonsubsidired jobs and revising hiring require- inents . Program agents generally selected their job s on the basis of public service needs and urba n agents generally exceeded the national average i n hiring participants who were minority member s or were classified as disadvantaged .

ACTIO N _During fiscal year 1974 we began our firs t major audit effort atACTION, an independen t agency that came into being July 1, 1971, bring- ingtogether a number of volunteer program s sponsored by the Federal Government (e .g. Peace Corps, VISTA, Foster Grandparents, etc .). Our work is being directed toward providing in - formation to the Congress and the public re- garding ACTION's progress since July 1, 1971 . Audit Work inProces s At Jane 30, 1974, we were reviewin g ACTION's accomplishments intesting and de- veloping new volunteer programs ; developin g and providing opportunities for more part-tim e volunteers ; bringing together programs appealin g to younger Americans with those appealing t o older Americans so that the skills of each coul d be `brought to `bear on specific problems ; open- ing the doors to afuller exchange of ideas an d experiences between volunteers from oversea s and domestic programs ; opening new channel s to use the abilities of business and professiona l volunteers in areas other than those provide d through the Small Business Administration ; and providing a more effective ; system forrecruiting , training, and placing VISTA volunteers . Veterans Administratio n Our work at this agency during fiscal yea r 1974 was directed primarily to(1) assessing th e closed circuit television systems in VA hospitals , (2) identifying needed improvements in certai n VA hospital laboratory service activities an d specialized medical treatment programs, (3 ) documenting the medical complications incurre d due to delays in transferring patients to V A Spinal card injury treatment centers, (4) iden- tifvin ,~4improvements needed in VA's efforts t o discharged veterans ; (5s , ssisting' a congi-cssicinal subcommittee, (6) responding t o iec luests from the Congress, and (7) conductingreviews of VA 's health, education, and incom e security functions . Medical Care for Veterans With Spinal Cor d Injur y In a report to the Congress wepointed ou t that spinal cord injury patients, particularl y servicemen, were not being transferred to V A specialized treatment centers as soon as possibl e or within 30 days, to reduce medical com- phcatlons . We reported that spinal cord injury patient s were detained at military hospitals for adminis- trative processing and VA had done little to ad - vise non-Federal hospital officials on availabilit y or need to promptly obtain specialized care . Records of 177 patients admitted to 4 spina l cord treatment centers showed that only 24 ar- rived at the centers within 30 days of injury . We recommended that the VA Administrato r (1) require VA hospitals to justify in writing al l cases taking more than 30 days to transfe r patients, (2) work with the military to expedit e transfer of patients, and (3) inform non-Federa l hospital officials and veterans of the medical ad - vantages and availability of specialized care . VA agreed with our recommendations an d planned to use them . The Department of De- fense agreed to revise military procedures to ex- (B-133044, pa SrV A VA physical therapist instructs a paraplegic in the operation o f a hand-controlled automobile . 117 Effectiveness of Laboratory Service Coul d Be Improve d Inareport to the Administrator, we pointe d out that, although users were generally satisfie d with test results, VA's laboratory program pro- viding services in support ofhealth care could b e improved by (1) coordinating blood bank activi- tics with themilitary to take advantage of avail - able volunteer blood when needed, (2)' detcrmin - ingpresent electron microscope requirements o n the basis of program objectives for diagnosti c and training applications, and (3) developing a method for informing hospitals oftests availabl e throughout theVA system in its general refer- ence laboratories . The Administrator agreed with our recom- mendations and stated that VA would act t o increase program effectiveness.

We reported that VA could improve th e management and operation of its specialize d medical programs and recommended that th e agency establish, maintain, andperiodically re - view criteria' and guidelines for development o f specialized programs, enforce the criteria an d guidelines, and provide information necessary t o periodically evaluate theprograms' effectiveness . VA agreed with our recommendations an d commented on actions taken and planned t o carry them Out . (B-133044, June 19, 1974 .)MANPOWER AND WELFAR E Veterans Benefit s We reported to the Administrator onthe wa y VA had carried out its mandate to assist recentl y discharged veterans, especially the educationall y disadvantaged . We concluded that the results o f VA's contact and assistance efforts could be im- proved by more frilly coorriinating these effort s with those of other Federal, State, and loca l agencies and with veterans organizations . (13-114859, Jan 7, 1974 .) Assistance to the Congres s At the request of the Subcommittee o n Housing and Urban Development, Space , Science, Veterans of the Senate Appropriation s Committee, we provided information to th e Subcommittee on certain areas of VA's budget , for the Subcommittee's use during hearings o n VA's fiscal year 1975 budget . At the request of the Senate Committee o n Veterans' Affairs -,ve provided information o n (1) the extent of certain benefits available t o educationally disadvantaged veterans and (2) th e impact of certain provisions of' the Vietnam Er a Veteran's Readjustment Assistance Act of 1973 , Public Law 92-540 . Audit Work in Proces s At the close of the fiscal year we were review- ing the psychiatric treatment program, alcoho l treatment program, and drug treatment pro - gram ; recruitment and retention of professiona l staff; pharmacy service ; and prosthetic ap- pliances .

The 19-7 2 airicndrnents to the federal Water Pollutio n 116Control Act directed the Comptroller General t o study arid report on Federal research aii d demonstration programs to find new ways t o make the waters of the United States cleaner . We concluded that these Federal program s had contributed to improving the quality o f some of our waterways, but tha t \u2014much more remained to be done to achiev e national water quality goals established b y the Federal Water Pollution Control Ac t Amendments of 1972 , \u2014at current funding levels, it was doubtfu l that the 1985 national goad of' eliminatin g the discharge of pollutants into navigabl e waters would be met, an d \u2014both management and coordination of Fed- eral research and demonstration program s needed to be improved .

Need toIncrease Useof Woo d Felled onFederal Forest Lan d I?ach year the Department of Agricttlttire' s Forest Service and the Department of th e Interior 'sBureaus of Land iNlanagement an d Indian Affairs sell standing timber to purchaser s who are required to cut designated trees i n timber sale areas . The Purchasers that decid e which felled wood to rcrruove, leave large vol- umes of c(10110mically usable timber in the sal e areas . This often caused-delays-in planting ne w trees, created serious firehazards, caused air an d water pollution, and led to cost increases i n various forest management practices . ` We recommended in our report to the Con- gress that the agencies (1) modify timber sal e procedures - to require ` removal ofall eco- nomically usable- wood, (2) establish methods)mac River, Alexandria, Virginia . and procedures which recognize economic an d environmental benefits to file Government fro m increased use of felled w(od, and (3) idcntil 'y \"where local processing facilit .ics inadequat e to ins(irc optimum use iuid e~i~lOre Federa in increasing timber processing capa- . 'rbe Forest Service agreed with these recom- mendations and, in October- 1973, advised us that it had revised its (l) regulations to rcquir e sill e-approviu officers to insure, among othe r things, that timber sale contracts reduirc cons - plete use of the timber as may be obtained wit h available technology and (2) timber salecontrac t forms to require removal of usable portions o f Felled trees . Interior cited several problems and condition s which it believed would have tohe considered i n implementing the recommendations with respec t to land held by the Bureau of Land Manag e merit .

Such trees, if ' promptly sal vaged, are as good as, or bette r than, some live '.roes -for making lumber, pl y WOOd, and other products . Iii April 1974 the Forest Service advised u s that, in line %with our recommendations, it ha d made acommitment to increase sale offerings of ' dead, dying, ordamaged material ; it had set a tentative national goal for fiscal year 19 .75 o f harvcsting 900 million board feet of such ma tonal ;andit had suggested ideas on simplifyin g sale procedures and techniques to its fiel d officcs .

We reported to the Congress that this backlo g hadpersisted for many years because (1) fund s collected from timber purchasers to refores t harvest areas` were limited, (2) appropriation s were not sufficient to both offset deficits inthe collections and reduce the backlog, and (3 ) special legislation authorizing additional ap- propriations had not been used .Also, the Fores t Service's land inventory data and fund allocatio n procedures did not insure optimum use o f available funds . We recommended that the Secretary of Agri- cUltUre include in subsequent c `,\" .nual reports o n reforestation needs, submitted tothe Congres s in accordance with \u00b0a 1972 act, information o n timber stand improvement needs, progres s toward rneetng these needs, and progress in improving land inventory data and fund allo- cation, procedures . We also presented for con - sideration by the Congress three possibl e methods forincreasing funds to accelerate re - forestation and timber stand improvement . The Forest Service agreed : with our recom- mendations and said it was taking action t o implement them . (B-125053, Feb . 14, 1974 .) Food and Nutrition Activitie s Special Supplemental Food Progra m Public Law 92-433, approved September 26 , 1972, established a ;pilot program of cash grant s to States toprovide supplemental foods t o pregnant or nursing women and to infants an d children up to 4 years ofage determined to b e nutritional risks because of inadequate nutritio n and-=income . The act required that we submit t o the Congress a preliminary evaluation of th e program by October 1, 1973 . We reported that no projects had been starte d and that people working in the fields of-nutri -RESOURCES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMEN T tion and maternal and child health had told us that (1) the Food and Nutrition Service 's planned 6-month evaluation of participant s would not provide a basis on which to decide i f the program should be continued or expanded , (2) the Service's plans did not allow enough tim e for training local staffs to take uniform measure- ments ' and (3) it was questionable whether a n evaluation of the programs effects on menta l development of infants, as called for inthe legislative history, would be possible in any study of this kind . We said that pending legis- lation to extend the program for 1 year could b e beneficial in terms of increased program partici- pation and more meaningful evaluation data . The Food and Nutrition Service told us that i t recognized the problems inherent in the tim e available for medical evaluation, that con- troversy existed among medical researchers re- garding measurement of mental development , and therefore, that it supported the pendin g legislation . On November 7, 1973, Public Law 93-15 0 was approved which extended the program . Thi s law also requires us to submit to the Congress a n interim report by October 1, 1974, and a fina l report with recommendations regarding con- tinuation of the program by March 30, 197 5 (B-176994, Sept . 28, 1973 .) Marketing and Consumer Service s Administration of Intrastat e Meat Plant Inspection Program s Under the Wholesome Meat Act of 1967 , States must maintain inspection and sanitatio n requirements on intrastate meat plants equal to those on federally inspected meat plants . The Department assumes inspection responsibilit y for plants in States that do not comply with thi s requirement . We reported to the Congress that the Anima l and Plant Health Inspection Service needed t o (1) improve and clarify its criteria for rating sanitation and other conditions at intrastat e meat plants and (2) develop definitive standard s and criteria for determini .ig whether State pro - grams are comparable to the Federal p-ogr_a m and when a State should benotified th ;~+il:: plants may be designated for Federal inspection , Also administrative costs could be reduced an d 119 RESOURCES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMEN T other, benefits could result if the Departmen t reviewed State-inspected meat plants on a sta- tistical' sampling basis to determine if Stat e inspection and sanitation requirements are equa l to Federal requirements . The Department issued a directive, effectiv e January 1, 1974 ' to implement our recom- mendations ..(B-163450, Nov. 2, 1973 .) Commodity Exchange Authority an d Commodity Futures Tradin g In an interim report to the Congress on ou r review of the Commodity Exchange Authorit y we recommended that, because- of the unpre- cedented growth of commodity futures trading , the need to instill fullpublic confidence, and th e need to remove any appearance of conflict o f interest, the Congress establish an independen t agency separate from the Department to regu- late all futures trading . We also recommende d the enactment of several amendments to th e Commodity Exchange Act to provide for mor e effective regulation of futures trading . To correct administrative weaknesses, we rec - ommended that the Secretary of Agricultur e direct the Commodity Exchange Authority Ad- mirlistrator to ,(1) giveexchanges a time limit t o implement the regulation on self-enforcement o f trading rules, to listpenalties if deadlines are no t met, and to aggressively monitor the exchanges ' enforcement programs, (2) establish standard s for exchanges' enforcement of financial requir e rr_Pnts and state penalties to be imposed fo r failure to meet the standards within a specifi c period, (~) investigate trade practices to seek ou t abusive practices on a ; planned high-priorit y basis, (4) regularly review adequacy of or nee d forspeculative trading and position limits o n regulated commodities, (5) consolidate guidanc e documents on price` manipulation investigation s and make them available to regional offices, an d (6) consider giving exchanges primary respon- sibility for audits of brokerage firms . The Commodity Exchange Authority Ad- ministrator agreed ingeneral with these recom- mcndations, but disagreed that the exchange s should be given responsibility for audits o f brokerage firms because of the specialized na- tore of such audits and the expense that smalle r exchanges might have to incur .Wesaid w e would comment further onthis matter in ou r final report . (13-146770, May 3, 1974 .) 120Testimony at Hearing s In July 1973 we testified before the Sub - committee on Rural Development, Senate Com- mittee on Agriculture and Forestry, on th e results of our review of the economic oppor- tunity cooperative loan program administere d by the Farmers home Administration and way s to improve the effectiveness of rural busines s loan programs authorized by the Rural Develop- ment Act of 1972 . (B-1 14873, May 2, 1973 .) We also testified in May 1974 before th e Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestr y on our interim report on the Commodity F,x- change Authority and on commodity future s trading . (B-146770, Nlay 3, 1974 .) Audit Work in Progres s At June 30, 1974, we were continuing ou r review of commodity futures trading and wer e reviewing the possibility of the Government 's assuming insured warehousing risks ; the impac t of Federal programs on it12-county rural area i n South Dakota ; the procedures and policies o f Federal departments and agencies in locatin g offices and facilities in rural areas ; the specia l supplemental food program for women, infants , and children ; and the summer feeding progra m for children . Department of the Arra y Corps of Engineer s (Civil Functions ) The civil functions of the Corps of' Engineer s relate principally to the control and develop- ment for beneficial use of water resources in th e United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgi n Islands . The functions include engineering, de - sign, construction, andoperation and mainte- nance of navigation projects ; beach erosio n control projects ; flood control projects ; multipl e purpose projects, including those with powe r installations ; and recreation facilities at com- pleted projects . The Corps employs abou t 28,500 people in carrying out its civil functions , and for fiscal year 1974, the Congress appropri- ated about $1 .5 billion for these functions .

Observations onHousing Allowances and th e Experimental Housing Allowance Progra m In 1972 the Department began implementin g one of the largest social experiments ever under - taken in the United States\u2014the Experimenta l Housing Allowance Program . The program , which wasauthorized by the Housing and Urba n Development 'Act of 1970, was intended t o provide low-income families with housing allow- ances to help them rent housing of their choic e in existing standard' housing units . X e evaluated this program, analyzed othe r similar programs, and provided the Congres s with this information and observations on th e costs and likely effects of a national housin g allowance program . Because the impact of a direct cash assistanc e program is unknown and because of the grea t cost invol ved 'estimated to range from $7 bil- lion to $10 billion annually\u2014we recommende d that the Congress, in considering future legisla- tion authorizing a national _housing allowanc e program, wait until the Experimental Housin g Allowance Program is complete and more info r mation is available on the likely impact of th e program .Also, because the sites selected for th e program were average orabove average in term s of both housing quality and vacancy rates, w e recommended that the Congress require th e Department to provide assurances that the re - salts_ achieved are representative of what migh t occur at other locations which have low housin g quality and low vacancy rates . (B-171630, Nlar . `'8, 1974 Insuranc e Protection toFlood-Prone Communitie s We reported to the Congress that improve- rnents were needed : in the National Floo d Insurance Program administered by the Federa l Insurance Administration .

The Administrator agreed that improvement s in these areas were needed and took action t o implement our recommendations . (B-178737 , July 19, 1973 .) Testimony at Hearing s We testified in July 1973 and March 197 4 before the Legal and IN'lonetary Affairs Subcon r mittee, I-louse Committee on Government Oper- ations, concerning the status of insurance fund s of the Federal Housing Administration . We testified also in July 1973 before th e Subcommittee on Housing and Urban Affairs , Senate Committee on Banking, IIousing, an d Urban Affairs, on Senate bill 2169 5whic h provides for the direct financing of low-incom e lousing programs under sections 235 and 236 o f the National IIousing Act . We testified in tNlarch 1974 before the Lega l and ;Monetary Affairs Subcommittee, 1Ious e Committee on Government Operations, on th e findings, conclusions, and recommendations i n our March 14, 1974, report onHUD 's manage- ment of its acquired multifamily mortgages . (B-114860, Mar . 14, 1974 .) Audit Work in Proces s Audit work in process at June 30, 1974 , included reviews of the Department's program s for new communities, leased housing, and oper - ating subsidies . Department of the Interio r The Department of the Interior's activitie s include the administration of over 500 millio n acres of Federal land and trust responsibilitie s for approximately 50 million acres of land , 124 mostly Indian reservations ; the conservation an d development of mineral and water resources ; the prOlrlQUOn U1mine safety and culclui%yj sh e conservation ; development, and use of fishand wildlife resources ; the coordination ofFedera l and State recreation programs ; the preservatio n and administration of the Nation 's scenic, histor- ic, and recreation areas ; the reclamation of ari d lands in the West through irrigation ; and th e management of hydroelectric power systems . The,Department is also concerned with th e social and economic development of the terri- tories . of the United States and of the Trus t Territory of the Pacific Islands and administer s programs providing services to Indians and Alas- ka datives . During fiscal year 1974 the Department 's 21 agencies had a work force of about 50,000 and a budget_ of about $1 .7 billion . -Need for Better Construction Cos t Data for the Garrison Diversion Uni t We reported to the Conservation and Natura l Resources Subcommittee, House Committee o n Government Operations, that the Bureau o f Reclamation' had notfollowed its procedures fo r controlling and estimating total Federal obliga- tious ` for the Garrison unit, a multipurpos e water' resources development project being con- structed in North Dakota . As a result, th e Bureau probably underestimated, from abou t $42.1 millionto about $66 .1 million, the tota l Federal obligation to be incurred . Since th e Bureau may have to adopt an alternative plan t o settle a water quality dispute with Canada, th e Bureau should formally advise the Congress o f the dispute and its possible effects on projec t costs . '(B-164570, May 15, 1974 .) California's Central Valley Projec t Proposed Power Rate Increas e We reported to the Conservation and Natura l Resources Subcommittee, House Committee o n Government Operations, on the reasonablenes s of1 I contentions made by opponents of it power rate increase of5I.G percent proposed b y the Dcpartrnent of the Interior to be charge d customers if the Bureau of Reclamation's Cen - tral Valley -Project in California\u2014a large nru1 - tipurpc>sc water resources project .RESOURCES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMEN T We stated that four of the contentions ha d merit . These involved the procedures used b y the Bureau in preparing rate and repaymen t studies, and the need for using updated hydrol- ogy studies . In making the rate and repaymen t studies, the Bureau had planned to avoid a deficit in any year of the repayment period an d to have a surplus at the end of the period ; it ha d not planned to capitalize replacement costs . If the Bureau were to change its procedures t o recognize thcse matters, the studies would show need for a rate increase substantially lower tha n the 51 .6 percent increase proposed by th e Department . (B-125042, Nov . 19, 1973 .) On January 22, 1974, we testified before th e Conservation and Natural Resources Subccun- mittec, House Committee on Government Op- erations, on the information in our report . Implementation of the Federal Coa l Mine Health and Safety Act of 196 9 At the request of Representative Ken Hechler , we reviewed the progress made by the Depart- ment of the h .terior 's Bureau of Mines i n implementing the federal Coal Mini_ Health an d Safety Act of 1969 . The review was concerne d with updatil .g inforn .ati-on and statistics we ha d presented in a 1971 report . Effective July 16, 1973, the Departmen t transferred the responsibility for enforcing th e act from the Bureau of Mines to its newl y established Mining Enforcement and Safet y Administration . The Bureau made progress in 1971 and 197 2 in carrying out the safety and health inspection s and other activities required under the act and i n monitoring the actions taken by the min e operators . To obtain full compliance with th e statutory provisions, however, continuing effort s by the Bureau were needed, especially in makin g certain types of health inspections, obtainin g operator compliance with certain self-inspectio n requirements, and making semiannual reviews o f roof control and ventilation plans . (B-170686 , July 5, 1973 .) Later in the year, in testimony before th e Conservation and Natural Resources Subcom- mittee, House Committee on Government Op- erations, we ' provided (1) `information onthe matters discussed in our report toRepresenta- tive Hechler and (2) updated information on 125 RESOURCES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMEN T matters discussed -in July 1972 report to th e Subcommittee on assessment and collection o f penalties under the act .

Department ofTransportatio n The Department of Transportation is respon- sible fordeveloping national transportation pol- icies and programs forproviding fast, safe, an d efficient transportation . The Department ha s 104,000 employees--68,000 civilian employee s and 36,000 U .S. Coast Guard personnel . Abou t 12649,000 of the civilian employees are used t ooperate and maintain airport and airway sys- tems. The principal expenditures of the Depart- ment are payments to States, municipalities, an dother recipients under programs for the con - struction and improvement of highways, air - ports, and mass transit systems . The Depart- ment's total expenditures amounted to about $ 9 billion in fiscal year 1974 . Our reviews completed during the fiscal year , which were undertaken principally in respons e to requests by committees or Members of th e Congress, related to such matters as the growt h and resources of the Federal Aviation Adminis- tration, Federal requirements for electroni c equipment on general aviation aircraft, Federa l funds provided for airport development, an d Federal Highway Administratic,rr progress i n establishing procedures for States in requestin g financing of mass transportation projects unde r the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973 . Potential for Reducin g Highway Deaths and Injurie s In line with recommendations in our Ma y 1972 report to the Subcommittee on Investiga- tions and Oversight, House Committee on Publi c Works, and in our March 1973 testimony befor e the Subcommittee on Transportation, Hous e Committee on Public` Works, the Federal-ai d Highway Safety Act oI 1973 authorized $37 5 million from the Highway Trust Fund to im- prove high-hazard locations and to eliminat e roadside obstacles . This program has the poten- tial of annually reducing highway deaths b y about 1,450 and highway injuries by abou t 22,000 . Audit Work inProces s At June 30, 1974, w\u00b0 were reviewing th e costs of airport equipment and facilities require d by the Federal Aviation Administration, th e actions taken by that Administration in respons e to flight safety recommendations made by th e National Transportation Safety Board, the pro- cedures established by Federal Agencies t o insure that public views are effectively obtaine d and considered in planning and developing pro- jects, the Coast Guard's progress in establishing vessel traffic systems forports and harbors, an d the effectiveness ofthe National Traffic Safe y Administration 's automobile safety program . Atomic Energy Commissio n The Atomic Energy Commission is responsi- ble for the, development, us e, and control o f nuclear energy for military and civilian purposes . Its programs include the development of nuclea r reactors for civilian ; military, and space use ; safety 'research ; and basic and applied researc h and development inthe biological, medical , physical, environmental, and engineering sci- ences . AEC licenses and regulates the civilian uses o f nuclear materials and facilities to insure tha t their use does not endanger the public healt h and safety, environmental quality, or nationa l security and areconsistent with the antitrus t laws . AEC 's annual operating expenses are abou t $2.5billion .Most of itswork is performed i n Government-owned facilities under contract s with industrial and educational or other nonpro- fit organizations .At the end of fiscal year 1974 , these contractors had about 95,000 employee s engaged' in carrying out AEC programs an d about 14,000 employees engaged in constructin g AEC facilities . AEC had about 7,400 full-tim e permanent employees . Insuring the Safety of Containers Use d ToTransport Radioactive Material s We reported to the Congress that AEC ha d not defined_ the (1) scope of its reviews o f container design, (2)extent of documentatio n required to support its decisions, and (3) type o f expertise required by its review staffs . As a result, the review scope, support documentation , andexpertise of the review staff varied signifi- cantly among the various AEC organizations . We made recommendations designed to insur e that (1 ;) container designs meet AEC's perform- ance standards, (2) the fabrication of container s conforms with the approved designs, ar ..d (3) al l contamination problems resulting from th e transportation of radioactive materials tha t might %v~trva nt an `AEC investigation are re - ported .RESOURCES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMEN T Problems in Protectin g Special Nuclear Material a t AEC Licehlsee/Contractor Facilitie s We reported to the Congress that the physica l protection systems were inadequate at two o f the three licensee/contractor facilities examine d during our review . We identified such condition s as weak physical barriers, ineffective alar m systems, ineffective guard patrols, lack o f automatic-detection devices, and lack of a pla n of action in the event of a special nuclea r material diversion . There were differences be- tween AEC 's protection requirements at con - tractors' facilities and the propose d requirements at licensees 'facilities . Improve- ments . AEC: generally agreed with improving the inplant physical protec- tion of special nuclear material and said that i t had taken or was taking actions to carry the m out. (B-164105, Nov . 7, 1973 .) Protecting Special Nuclear Material In Transi t We reported to the Chairman, Joint Commit - tee on Atomic Energy, that (1) although thre e large shipments of special nuclear material b y AEC licensees/ contractors were made in accord- ance with AEC requirements, the protection o f the material was inadequate to prevent o r quickly detect a diversion and (2) AEC's lack o f authority to predetermine the trustworthiness o f drivers and guards involved in transportin g special nuclear material was a weakness in th e protection system . Shortly after we began our review, AECtoo k action to strengthen the protection of specia l nuclear material in transit . If AEC finds tha t these new protection methods are inadequate, i t should, as recommended by an AEC stud y group, consider using a Government-operated o r Government-controlled system for shippin g special nuclear material .AEC established new regulations and proce- dures to carry out our recommendations . (B-164105, July 31, 1973 .) RESOURCES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMEN T kVc made no recommendations to AEC bu t suggested that the joint Committee on Atomi c I?nergy might wish to consider amending th e Atomic Energy Act to give AEC the authority t o predetermine the trustworthiness of drivers an d guLu-ds .(B-164105, Apra 12, 1974 .) Improper Useof Contractor-Furnishe d Employees at AEC's Regulatory Organizatio n We reported to the Chairman, AEC, that AEC's use of 98 contrtctor-fUrnished employee s to increase its in-House capability in the licensin g and regulatory area rather than securing th e necessary services through employment was no t only improper, but costly\u2014about $1 .8 millio n more than if Federal employees were used . :SEC agreed that its use of contrac- tor-furnished employees was more costly, but i t justified its actions in light of the backlog i n licensing applications and the energy require- meeits of the Nation . AEC terminated the use o f 21 of the 98 employees . It plans to keep th e i emaining employees for their planned 2-yea r terms . AEC agreed, however, to (1) get authori- zation from the Congress if AEC decides t o extend the terms of these employees or to us e additional contractor-furnished employees an d (2) take steps to improve administrative control s over the useof these employees . (B-164105 , Nov .1,1973 ) Need to Inform Fertile Female s of Potential Radiation Hazard s The National Council on Radiation Protectio n and Measurements recommended in Januar y 1971 that radiation exposure to the fetus o f pregnant women who workwith or near radia- tion not exceed an amount which was one-tent h the amount AEC 's standards permitted .AEC' s policy has: been to adopt the Council' s recommendations but, inthis instance, over 3 years had elapsed sincethe Council made it s recommendation and AEC still had not adopte d it. )n September 1973, AEC requested the Coun- cil to reexamine its recommendation becaus e more restrictive exposure limits could be viewe d by Nvomen's groupsas an -attempt to establish a discriminatory occupational qualification based . on sex . Although AEC officials expect th e 128Council to reaffirm itsrecommendation, the y said it could take up to 12 months to implemen t the recommendation if AEC decides to adopt it .In a report to the Chairman, AEC, w e recommended that, when the Council finishe s reexamining its previous recommendation, AE C expedite its decision on accepting and carryin g out the recommendation . As an interim meas- ure, we recommended that AEC inform al l female employees who may be exposed t o radiation in its contractor and licensee facilitie s of the Council's recommendation and the pos- sible adverse effects on .offspring . AEC advised us that it was studying certai nadministrative, scientific, and legal question s related to carrying out our recommendation s and that, upon completion of its study, woul d promptly consider the action needed based o n the studies 'conclusions . (B-164105, i%1ay 17 , 1974 .) Audit Work in Proces s Audit work in process at the end of the fisca l year included reviews of' AEC's (1) managemen t of radioactive waste and (2) environmenta l protection program in licensing nuclear powe r plants . Environmental Protection Agenc y The Environmental Protection Agency's over - all mission is to protect and enhance ou r environment by conducting environmental re - search, establishing and enforcing environmenta l protection standards, and providing financia l assistance to States and municipalities to con- struct sewage treatment plants . The agency also underwrites administrative costs of local pollu- tion control agencies and helps finance the cos t of local planning forpollution abatement_ an d control . During fiscal year 1974, this agency spen t about $2 .6 billion for environmental protectio n activities and employed a staff of about 9,200 t o administer its programs . These programs relate d to water, air, solid waste, pesticides, noise, an d radiation . pesticides :Actions Needed to Protec t The Consumer From Defective Product s In the second of a series of reports on th e shortcomings of EPA's pesticide program, we reported to the Congress that consumers had no t been adequately _protected from defective pesti- cides . Because of an inadequate program, som e pesticides were repeatedly sampled while other s were never sampled ;inthe 3 regions included i n our review, about 64percent of the mitnufac- turers `did not have any of their pesticide s sampled during a 4-'/2-year period . The impor t sampling program also needed improvement . EPA (lid not have the capability to test mos t of the samples it collected,-only 19 -percent ha d been tested for safety and 32 percent had bee n tested for effectiveness . It found, however, tha t 16 percent of the samples tested for safety an d 28 percent tested for effcctiveness were dcfec- tivc. Thus the number of unsafe and incffcctiv c pesticides offered for sale to consumers could b e significant . In additio -n,-the -agency had no t normally notified tile public when itdiscovcre d an incffective'- or chemically_ deficient_ pesticide , and it had not used the enforcement alternative s of c~mcclling =rcgistrat i*ons and recalling product s toprevent marketing ; of repeatedly ineffectiv e pesticides . We also pointed out that the effectiv e life of 'decomposable pesticides should be dctca- - ntincd and shown on `labels, and the types of pesticides which have been repeatedly found t o be defective, especially disinfectants and roden-t- icidcs, Should be tested by EPA before bein g registered . EPA agreed with our findings and recom- mendation and said it had already taken step s either to carry uut new programs or to chang e existing programs intitre with our suggestions . ETA hits .:tarted cancelling registratioris found t o be ineffective and has issued guidelines providin g for the prompt public release _ of informatio n concerning its enforcement activities . (13-133192,-May 23, 1974 :) _ Control of Air Pollutio n From Stationary Source s We reported to the Congress that EPA an d seven States covered by our review had reliedRESOURCES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMEN T heavily on voluntary compliance, with laws and regulations to control air polluti-n from station- ary sources, such as industrial smoke stacks an d municipal incinerators . The States are responsi- ble for carrying out plans to control air pollu- tion and for vigorously enforcing cotnplialic c when polluters do not meet clean-air rc(p -IIre ntents, but the Federal Government assumes thi s responsibility when the . States fail to act . Bot h levels of Government, however, had been reluc- tant to enforce air-pollution-control laws an d regulations . The agency agreed that the States had no t effectively enforced air-poll -utiorr-control law s and regulations but stated that lord air-pollu- tion-control urgencies had . It stated also that i t had begun to implcnent and enforce nationa l standards . (B-166506, Aug . 23,197 :3.) Need to Insure thePurity and Safety of Drinking Wate r Initreport to the Congress regarding Federa l and State proffams dcsianed to insure th e acceptable quality of drinking water, we pointe d out Willi respect to the State and local govern- ments that (1) potentially dangerous water wa s being ; delivered to some consumers, particularl y by small water treatment systems, (2) in man y instances, water supply systems had not bee n tested as frequently as recommended by guide - lines issued by FTA, (3) over half of the interstate carrier water systems reviewed had no t been inspected by the States in1972, (4) EP A had not always reclassified water supplie s promptly from \"approved \"to \"provisionall y approved \"when deficiencies were noted durin g inspections, and (5) the Federal Government di d not have a formal program for monitoring th e quality of bottle water . _The agency generally agreed with-our recom- mendations for improving ; its administration o f the interstate carrier water supply program . (13-166506, Nov . 15, 1973 .) Audit Work in Proces s Audit work in process atJune 30, 1974 , included reviews of EPA 's (l) implementatio n and administration of the Federal Water Pullu Lion -Control Act Amendments of 1972, (2) RESOURCES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMEN T research programs to determine the harmfu l effects of air pollution on man and ecology, an d (3) program to register pesticides to make sur e that they are safe and effective . National Railroa d Passenger Corporation (AMTRAK ) AMTRAK\u2014a private, for-profit corporatio n created by the Congress to operate and revitaliz e intercity rail passenger service\u2014uses the facilitie s of 13 railroads to provide service to 44 state s and the District of Columbia . It has a work forc e of about 5,400 and operates 208 trains a day o n s< me 26,000 route miles . AMTRAK receive d Federal financial assistance through grants an d Jowl guarantees from the Department of Trans- portation . AMTRAK began operations on Ma y 1, 1911, and lost $401 million through \\Marc h 31, 1974 . During the fiscal year, we completed review s of sonic of AMTRAK's operations for th e Snhcoznmittee on Transportation and Aeronau- tics, House Committee on Interstate and Foreig n Commerce . NeEd to Improve Reservation , Information,' andTicketing Servic e We interviewed 1,900 AMTRAK passenger s concerning reservations on 340 train trips i n ,june and July 1972 . About 60 percent of thes e passengers commented on their difficulties i n getting train information, making reservations , and obtaining tickets . i`\\t two of ANITRAK 's major reservatio n offices (Chicago and New York), about 3 0 percent of customers' telephone calls during a n 8-week period in the summer of 1972 were no t completed because= Ofinsufficien=t- telephon e equipment andpersonnel . Unserviceable cars frequently were remove d from trains, and cars with differen t capacities were substituted .Without promp t notification of' such changes, AMTRAK reserva - 130tion and ticket offices were uncertain of th etrain 's capacity and sold space on the basis o fthe smallest car . As a result, many AMTRA K trains operated with vacant coaches or sleepin g spaces, although there had been many request sfor those accommodations . Space was alsounderused because of no-shows . Reservatio n offices did not enforce AMTRAK's reservatio n cancellation policy . AMTRAK took a number of actions t o improve passenger service and said it believed it s new system would eliminate many of the prob- lems experienced in 1972 . however,AMTRAK did not expect to achieve full benefits from th e new system until it was completely operationa l in late 1974 . (B-175155, Aug . 22, 1973 .) Causes of Extensive Delay s Of AMTRAK Train s Trains had fallen far short of AMTRAK' s objective of ar riving at their destinations on tim e 90 percent of their trips . Overall, one of ever y four trains was late in 1972 and one of ever y three trains was late in the first half of 1973 . This poor performance did not generate publi c confidence in the reliability of AMTRAK' s trains and tended to discourage riders, decreas e revenues, and increase costs . Most AMTRAK train delays were caused b y track conditions and maintenance work, freigh t train interference, locomotive and passenger ca r malfunctions, awaiting arrival of other passenge r trains, and servicing at stations . AMTRAK 's contracts with the railroads for trackage an d train operations did not require the railroads t o meet the 90 percent ontime objective an d needed to be amended to include reasonable , definitive, and enforceable ontime performanc e standards and to clearly fix the responsibilitie s of contracting parties . AMTRAK stated that negotiations were un- derway with the railroads to amend the con - tracts to provide performance standards , incentives, and penalties . As an initial result, o n April 3, 1974, AMTRAK worked out a ne w arrangement with the Penn Central Railroad tha t included a provision for incentives and penaltie s in determining the amount of compensatio n AMTRAK willpay to the railroad . (B-175155 , Dec. 28, 1973 .) Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authorit y The Washington Metropolitan Area Transi t Authority was created in1967, by an interstat e compact between 'Maryland, Virginia, and th e District of Columbia authorized by Public La w 89-774, approved November 6, 1966 .The Authority's primary function is to plan, develop , finance, and operate the Washington Regiona l Rapid Transit System, commonly calle d METRO . The Authority receives Federal assist - ance -inconstructing METRO through appropri- ations, guarantees of its;revenue bonds, an d interest subsidies from the Department of Trans- portation . The estimated cost of METRO i s about $3 billion . Passenger service is schedule d to begin in June 1975 . Improved System of Reporting METRO' s Costs and Construction Progres s ~Vc reported to the Congress that the cost an d construction status reports prepared by the staf f of the Authority had not provided a completeRESOURCES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMEN T picture of the METRO project .Reports submit- ted to the Authority 's board of directors ha d not included estimated cost increases for wor k not yet under contract, amounting to abou t $232 million as of June 1973, and operationa l delays of several months that were known to th e staff. The inclusion of these estimates instatu s reports would have alerted the board to the nee d for planning to obtain the additional funds orto consider if alternatives were available .The Fed- eral Government and participating local govern- ments also need such information since they wil l be called upon to finance increased costs o r accept reduction in service . On March 21, 1974, the board passed a resolution that the METRO reporting system b e expanded to provide quarterly status report s containing comparisons between original an d total current cost estimates and planned an d actual progress . The first such report was issue d on May 2, 1974 . This report forecast an increas e of over $480 million in the cost of NMETRO . OnApril 2, 1974, Nyetestified at hearing s before the House Committee on the District of Columbia on this matter .

Audit work in process at June 30, 1974,i11- chided reviews of efforts to revitalize the fishin g -industr yby developing new fisheries from un- derused fish resources, an evaluation of fisher y resource management prog rams, and a review of ' Federal programs related to marine scienc e activities and oceanic affairs . Department of Justic e The chief functions of the Department o f justice are to enforce the Federal laws ;represen t the Government in legal matters ; help State an d local governments reduce crime ; confine, sup - port, and rehabilitate Federal offenders ; admin- ister the immigration and naturalization law s relating to the admission, exclusion, deporta- tion, and naturalization of aliens ; and contro l narcotics and dangerous drug abuse . The Depart- ment has about 49,000 employees and it s projected expenditrlres were about 1 .9 billio n during fiscal year 1974 . Our.tuditsat the Department of Justice con- ceriied principally law enforcement assistance , rehabilitation of - Federal offenders, narcotic s and dangerous dings, and entry and deportatio n of aliens .Alarge part of qur work was done i n response to congressional requests . Law Enforcement Assistanc e Development and Use of Computerize d Criminal History Informatio n At the request of the Chairman, Subco m lnittce on Constitutional Rights, Senate Judi- ciary C :ommittec,we reported on the develop - rncnt and use ofa nationwide cornputcrize d criminal history information system . The syste m i~ operated by the Federal Bureau of hwestiga- tion and Supported by the Law Enforcemen t Assist\"-once Administration through the fundin g of Stet,- systems .Data was not available to illdlcatc how ennl- puterized criminal history infornr,itiun had bcc n used and questions regarding the extent ofink )r- elation which should be retained in the FBI'so1.

(B-171010 , Mar. 1, 1974 .) Assessing Results of Projects to Reduce Crim e One purpose of LEAA is to encourage th e development of new and innovative projects t o fight crime ; but without information on whethe r such projects worn :, dacrmining 11'funds hav e been spent effectively is not possible . We reported to the Congress that cvaluation s of four types of projects -alcohol detoxificatio n centers, youth service bureaus, group homcs fo r juveniles, and drug amts%Brig centers\u2014were in - consistent and did not provide sufficient data t o allow LEAA and the States to make objcctiv c decisions regarding project success . We recommended that the agency and th e States establish uniform program goals, inform a tion reporting systems, and evaluation method s for each type of LEAA-funded program . Although LEAA has taken steps to improv e its evaluations, these actions were not adequat e to provide the Congress with needed account - ability for Federal funds spent by States . There - fore, we recommended that the cognizant legis- lative committees further discuss the matte r with Officials . (B-171019, Mar . 19 , 1974 .)

GENERAL GOVERNMENT OPERATION S The Department of Justice gencrally agree d with our recomiendations and either started o r planned to implement them . (B-171019, May 8 , 1974 .) Audit Work in Proces s Audit work in process at June 30, 1974, in - eluded reviews of (1) the pilot cities progra m established and funded by LEAA, (2) the La w Enforcement Education Program, (3) progress i n deterinining types of approaches which work i n the criminal justice System, (4) the need to i .n- prove the long-term impact of the LEAA gran t progl`am, (5) the operations of halfway house s for adult offenders, (f) Federal efforts to pre - vent or educe juvenile delinquency, and (7 ) Federal, State, and local use of criminal histor y information .- Drug Abuse Contro l The<primary _ responsibility for Federal dru g abuse enforcement and control programs lie s with the Drug Enforcement Administration, al - though several other Federal agencies are in- volved, including, the U .S. Customs Ser\\7ce, th e U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service , and the State Department . During fiscal yea r 1974, the -Drug Enforcement Administratio n had about 2 .200 agents and compliance invcsti- gai ors and a5112 million budget to identify an d disrupt the sources of narcotics and dangerou s drugs through various enforcement and i-egula- tory activities -. Dangerous Drugs The abuse of dangerous drugs--includin g barbiturates, amphetamines, and such hallunci- nogens as problem . Drug Enforcement_ administration estab- lished some programs for identif} .ring and in- vestigating illicit sources of -dangerous drags . These programs have brought about arrests of ' national and international drug traffickers an d have closed illicit dangerous drug laboratories . Weaknesses in several areas, however, hav e limited the programs' effectiveness, The agenc y needs to increas e - enforcement efforts which have been rela- tively low Hicomparison to heroin enforce- meni and snnug- glinL~ tl.rouvh Nlcxico, land- the effectiveness of its program for coll- trolling the ingredients used in manufa c taring illicit dangerous drugs . The Department of Justice stated that dan- gerous drug enforcement had received a lesse r priority until earl' 1973 because the entir e Federal community had emphasized heroin a s the primary drug problem and because darn- gerous drug enforcement is it new and highl y innovative endeavor . Therefore, it could no t provide definite comments on our recommenda- tions without further analysis . (B-175425, littl e 7, 19 7 4 .) Difficulties in Immobilizing Major Narcotics Trafficker s A grog am to immobilize major narcotics traf- fickers and to stop the flow of drugs into the United States was started by the Bureau of Nar- cotics and Dangerous Drugs and was continue d bv~its successor aocncyT, the Drug Fnnforcemen t ~~L1171211-1Str~ttl OIn . We reported to the Congress that obstacles i n arresting the selected major traffickers were : (1) thcv did not personally handle illicit drugs,- (2 ) they lived or operated outside the United State s \\,\\,here the Bureau activities and authority wer e limited, or (3) their cases wtrc not being in- vestigated due to lack of informants, intelli- gence, and/or Bureau resources . Other factor s were : (1) sonic individuals had been erroneousl y identified as major traffickers, (2) written plan s for investigation were lacking, and (3) bette r coordination between the Bureau and `othe r Federal law enforceitient agencies was needed . Also, arrested narcotics traffickers were not being effectively immobilized because, for th e most part, the),were (1) released oil bail fo r long periods and thus were free to continue thei r operations, (2) sentenced to short prison term s which tended to negate the deterrent effect o f prosecution, (1)acquitted after trial or had thei r11cases dismissed because of inadequate develop - ment or presentation of cases, or (4) permitte d to plead to it reduced charge and thus ir n mobilized for a mach shorter period of tim e than might have been the case if processe d further . We made several recommendations to th e Attorney General . The Department of justic e agreed with our findings and said individual rec - ommendations that had not already been irnple - rented were being studied to determine thei r feasibility . (B-175425, Dec . 21, 1973 .) GENERAL GOVERNMENT OPERATION S aliens located by the Service : increased fro m about 200,000 in fiscid vear 1968 to abou t 790,000 in fiscal year 1974 . We concluded in our report to the Congres s that the Service did not have tile illegal_ alie n problem under control and that the problen ha d reached severe proportions .WCreported tha t navy employcrs continue to -hire 111c,nl alien s for jobs even after repeated Service visits to dis- courage such employmert, and that, since n o Federal law prohibits such employment, sanc- tions were needed to disc'ollrage such hi l-irg.

Need for Improvements in Management of th e Immigration and Naturalization Servic e At the request of the Chairman, Legal an d Monetary Affairs Subcommittee, House Com - mittee on Government Operations, and Con- gressman John W . Wvdlcr, we examined certai n management _operations of the Immigration an d Naturalization Service . We`recommended that the Attorney Genera l have the Service (l) establish a plan to increas e effectiveness of the record system in providin g accurate data for followup on aliens who over - stay their permitted time, (2) study the feasibil- ity of periodically reissuing Mexican borde r crossing_ cards, explore alternatives to periodi- calljl reissuing the cards, and initiate a syste m for more effective monitoring of Nlexicaul alien s allowed` to extend their visits, (3) examine it s procedures for requestin gfingerprint searches o n illegal aliens toeliminate searches which serve n o useful purpose, (4) revise the alien address re - port forms to allow useof excess forms fro m year toyear and evaluate the managemen t benefits of yearly filings of address reports, (5 ) request illegal aliens to pay their transportatio n cost on-Ser-ice-owned buses which could resul t in considerable savings to the Government, an d (6) require aliens to pat the postage on alie n address reports . The Seri-ice agreed with our findings and con- clusion, and actions have been or will be take n to carr yout our recommendations . Requirin g that aliens pay thepostage on alien address r e parrs resulted in estimated savings for calenda r yc ~ r 1974 of $346,000 for postage an d $245 ;000 which would have been charged b y _he U .S.

We recommended that the Attorney Genera l (1) establish a system which would bring all foreign agent files up to date and require tha t filings be made on time, (2) review supplementa l statements to identify and revise all question s \\\\-Inch confused the registrants, to reduce o r eliminate the high incidence of insufficien t responses, and (3) assess the Registrations Sec- tion's needs and establish a review system t o Insure that the registration and enforcemen t activities of the Department are carried ou t effectively . (B-177551, !filar . 13, 1974 .)

We briefed the Subcommittee on Equal Op- portunity, House Committee oil Education and Labor, on Federal efforts to coordinate juvenil e delinquency programs . Subsequently, we pro- vided information to the Subcommittee to hel p in drafting proposed legislation intended to re - place the expiring juvenile delinquency lcgisla- tion . At the request of the Chairman, Subcom- mittee on Crime, House Judiciary Committee , we briefed the Subcommittee on the Operation s of LEAH and the results of `our work there . Be - cause of a reorganization of ' Subcommitte e responsibilities, the Subcommittee on Crime ha d gained oversight responsibility for LEAA activi- ties and our briefing provided assistance to th e Committee in assuming its oversight role an d planning future hearings .

Collection of Taxpayers 'Delinquent Account s The Internal Revenue Service had an inven- tory of 659,227 taxpayers' deliquent account s representing assessments of about $1 .9 billion a s of little 30, 1972 . Operating in the capacity o f agents of the Joint Committee on Internal Rev- enue Taxation, we reviewed IRS 'handling o f 1 ,096 delinquent taxpayers accounts-of whic h 670 were being pursued for collection and 42 6 were classified as uncollectible . We reported t o the Joint Committee that IRS had effectivel y collected taxpayers 'delinquent accounts ; tax - payers were treated equitably ; and procedura l safeguards it,Classifying a taxpayer 's delinquen t .tccoullt as Ilncollectible insure that collectio n action is not prematurcly suspended . We reported also that IRS statistics were in- flated by multiple assessments, included assess- nlents for marihuana taxes although these assess- ments are traditionally uncollecublc, and wer e inflated by invalid delingtietlt accounts . We recommended that the joint Committe e initiate legislation to establish interest rates oi l deferred estate tax payments which would b e closer to the Government's cost of borrowit w funds, deny credit toward social securit y benefits when such taxes are not paid cmself- employment income, and exclude from dis- charge through bankruptcy taxes assessed withi n 3 wears before a bankruptcy petition isfiled .

Assessment of Federal Regional Council s Federal Regional Councils were established t o develop closer working relationships betweci i large Federal grant-making agencies and Stat e and local governments and to improve COMAIrla- tioll of the categorical grant-In-aid systrin . We reported to the Congress that most offi- cials of States and larger units of local govern- ments know about the councils but that repre- sentativcs of smaller units of focal governmen t generally were unfamiliar with them . State an d local governments mead information oil Federa l grant-in-aid progranis .and on the opportnnitic s for securing assistance from the councils . The councils were impeded From being more effective by such factors as : (1) inember agen- cies' lack of, or variations in, decentralize d decisionmaking authority, (2) limits on th e authority of council chairmen, (3) division o f time and effort by council members, staffs, an d task force members between Council and agenc y affairs, (4) insufficient participation by non - member Federal agencies in council activities , and (5) absence of formalized standards fo r planning work and reporting progress . We concluded that, although these factor s impeded the councils' effectiveness, they could , within their existing' framework, more ei'fec- tively accomplish their purposes with stronge r management direction bythe Under Secretarie s Group forRegional Operations .The Office o f Management and Budget, the Under Secretarie s Group, and council chairmen generally agree d and concurred in our recommendations fo r making the councils more effective .

During fiscal year 1974, we completed 1 3 reports on international security programs . The reports covered a wide range of military assis- tance, such as anevaluation of the effectivenes s of Our assistance to Korea (one of the primar y rcinaining recipients of grant aid) and specia l assistance to Israel resulting from the recen t Arab-Israeli War and an analysis of the balance- of-payments effect of NATO forces . Security Assistance to Korea : Accomplishments and Constraint s Inrecent year s_ Korea has been one of th e largest recipients of U .S military assistance . Most of the assistance is for .a 5-year $1 .5 billio n modernization program . In June 1974 we re - ported to the Congress on the effectiveness o f this assistance . Studies had indicated that Korea was finan- cially capable of assuming the cost of operatin g and maintainin gU.S.-provided equipment . We recommended that the Secretaries of State an d Defense develop a plan for Korea to assume al l operation and maintenance costs and identity a transition period for converting equipmen t transfers from grant aid to sales . We also mad e certain proposals for congressional consideratio n in future authorization and appropriation hea r ings. (B-_1 64264, Jttly 1, 1974 .) How Ship Transfers to Othe r Countries are Finance d Over the last 25 years the United States ha s given, loaned, sold, or otherwise transferre d 3,900 naval vessels to other countries . Publi c Law 92-270, requiring that all expenses be pai d by the recipient country or from militar y 150assistance funds, was the most recent atthe time of' ourreview . Ilowevcr , the Department of Defense excludes repairs an d overhauls from its definition of' costs associate d with the transfers . We found that the Navy spent (without _ reimbursement) about $13 million to overhau l and repair vessels transferred under this legis- lation . Another $5 million in equipment, ou t fitting, and services and an indeterminate a - mount of small arms and ammunition was als o provided without reimbursement . In our report to the Congress, we rccom- mended that the Secretary of Defense no t transfer ships that have recently been overhaule d and that, in the case of exceptions, he requir e the Navy to be at least partially reimbursed b y the recipient country or the military assistanc e appropriation for the cost of such overhauls . We also recommended that the Navy be reimburse d for the costs of' outfitting and services associate d with ship transfers . (B-163742, June 25, 1974 .) Status of Emergency Securit y Assistance to Israe l As a result of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, th e Emergency Security Assistance Act of 1973 wa s passed to provide Israel with $2 .2 billion i n assistance to maintain a balance of power in th e Middle East . In a classified report to Representative Harol d Runnels, we presented the status of the fundin g and equipment deliveries under this act and o f other U .S. assistance provided to Israel . (B-180356, May 20, 1974 .) Restrictions on U .S. Procuremen t Activities in Thailan d Because of indications that the Thai Govern- ment was restricting U .S. procurement activitie s in Thailand, we made a review to determine th e extent and effect of the lack of competition an d reported the results to the Congress . Thai Government decrees allow the Unite d States to contract only with the Express Trans- portation Organization of Thailand\u2014a govern- ment-owned monopoly\u2014for transportation an d stevedoring services at Thai ports . The Unite d States has spent $86 million on sole-sourc e procurements with this organization since 196 6 at rates which we found to be excessive . We also found other instances in which U .S. firms had been prevented from competing on U.S.contracts because they were denied acces s to Thai bases, thus making them unable t o perform . Werecommended that the Secretaries of Stat e andDcfense attempt to negotiate with the Tha i Government a settlement of the sole-sourc e procurement and access-to-bases problems . We suggested that, barring 'resolution Ofthe pro- blems, the excess costs be considered as assis- tauce to Thailand and funded from foreig n assistance appropriations : (B-133258, June 5 , 1974 .) The Military Assistance Pipelin e In connection with the 1974 Senate appro- priation hearings, we -provided a statement fo r the record on the potential for recouping prio r years military assistance obligations . We pre - seated a brief explanation of military assistanc e funni> g procedures, the magnitude of obligate d but unexpended prior , years' funds, selecte d examples of the -transactions involved, and th e likc=iihood of-dcob'ligation orthese funds (Fisca l Year 1974 Senate Hearings tance and Related Programs Appropriations , Ph. 1572-84 .) Audit Work in Proces s Work in process isgeared toward the changin g makeup of Our security assistance ; for example , a review of our military activities in Iran ( a major purchaser of U .S. defense equipment) an d areview of our overseas administration o f assistance and sales activities . U.S. Participation inthe {North Atlantic Treaty Organizatio n Congressional and public attention has fo- cused with growing intensity on the financia l and political- aspects ofU.S. obligations t o NATO . In addition to the large U .S. balance- of-payments -deficit resulting from stationill( T forces in L ;urope and efforts to ease the deficit , other factors, such as domestic pressures to reduce defense spending, thawing of -Unite d States-Soviet relations, andunilateral policies i n the Middle 1, ast have placed the United States a t odds with its allies .INTERNATIONAL OPERATION S NATO Balance-of-Payments Defici t The Department of Defense had stated in congressional testimony that $4 .1billion of it s total NATO expenditures in 1972 and 197 3 were offset by other balancing factors, leaving a net balance-of-payments deficit of only $40 0 million . At the request of Senator Harry F . Byrd, jr: , we analyzed the accuracy of titer $4 .1 billio n figure, and computed the U .S. balance- of-payments deficit to be $1 .7 billion for 197 2 alone . (B-156489, Aug . 8, 1973 .) Work inProces s In anticipating all increasing congressiona l need for timely, comprehensive information o n the. NATO alliance, we have begun a series o f reviews to identify the cost and assess th e effectiveness of United States-NATO activities . We are presently looking into U .S. staffing of ' NATO, military assistance costs to less econom- ically developed NATO countries, and othe r U.S. costs which might be reduced or shared b y the NATO allies . Economic and Financial Assistanc e Multilateral Developmen t Assistanc e Much development assistance is provided to developing countries through the internationa l financial institutions, the United Nations Sys - tern, and other international organizations . The World Bank Group and the regional bank s administered a $4 .7billion lending program in 1973. The agencies of the United Nation s System provided about $1 .3 billion worth of ' assistance . The United States is the largest singl e contributor of the resources of these organiza- tions . During the fiscal year we completed two reports on multilateral assistance to Members( f Congress, and two additional reports were in process at yearend . We also made considerabl e progress toward establishing independent revie w and evaluation systems inthe major inter - national development organizations . 151 INTERNATIONAL OPERATION S Independent Review and Evaluation System s IntheInternational Organization s Although the executive branch favors con- tinuing and further expanding multilateral devel- opment assistance programs, the Congress ha s expressed concern over the level of U .S. partic- ipation ininternational organizations and th e management of funds by these organizations .In view of this concern, we have spent considerabl e effort during the -past several years to obtai n legislation that would assist in establishing a n independent review and evaluation system in th e international financial institutions and in th e United Nations System . This review syste m would provide anindependent and continuou s program of selective reviews of all major pro - grams and activities of these international or- ganizations . InDecember 1973 the Foreign Assistance Ac t was amended by Public Law 93-189 to requir e that the President, acting through the U .S. representatives to the World Bank Group, th e Asian Development Bank, and the United Na- tions System, propose the establishment of a n independent review program in each of th e organizations . The act also required that state- ments of auditing and reporting standards b e .prepared by the Comptroller General of th e UnitedStates and presented for consideration o f the organizations' governing bodies to assist i n formulating terms of reference for thi s independent review system . In accordance with the provisions of Publi c Law 93-189, inJune 1974 we presented our firs t statement of auditing and reporting standards t o the Secretary of the Treasury for use by the U .S. Executive Director of the World Bank Group i n proposing the establishment of an independen t review and evaluation system for the Bank Grou p (B-161470 and B-175281, June 24, 1974) . Our current ' work' includes the drafting of auditin g and reporting - :standards for use in proposing th e establishment of independent review groups i n the Asian Development Bank and the Unite d Nations System . The value of independent review systems i n the international organizations is evidenced b y our report inprocess on the effectiveness o f independent and comprehensive audits of th e inter-American Development Bank . The estab- lishment of this independent review system,Group of Controllers, was initiated by a 196 7 Amendment to the Inter-American Developmen t Bank Act . Our current review showed that th e Groups since it was created in 1968, has mad e considerable progress in developing into a n effective independent review body to evaluat e the management of the Bank's operations . Social Progress Trust Fun d At the request of the Chairman, Subcom- mittee on Inter-American Affairs, House Com- mittee on Foreign Affairs, we reviewed th e current status of the Social Progress Trust Fun d and the uses made of funds appropriated for it . As of June 30, 1973, the Trust Fund , managed by the Inter-American Developmen t Bank, had net assets of about $560 million \u2014 about $51 million in cash and liquid assets an d $509 million in outstanding loans . About $4 0 million annually is being repaid on these loans . Since 1965 the United States has not par- ticipated directly with the Bank in directing the use of the bulk of these resources, although th e United States did specify that these fund s should be used for basic Trust Fund purposes . Moreover, since 1965 most Trust Fund resource s have not been directed to specific end uses base d on a planned program designed to meet priorit y social development needs of Latin America . Our review identified a need to reasses s current operations and to (1) devise new pro - grain(s) to direct Trust Fund resources t o specific projects for assisting the priority socia l needs of Latin America or (2) seek othe r disposition of these resources in consultatio n with the Congress, such as using Trust Fund repayments to defray U .S. Government oper- ating expenses .Our report contained recom- mendations to this effect . The State Departmen t agreed that new approaches could be found t o direct the Fund's resources to more productiv e end uses, and it was ` attempting to do so . It disagreed, however, with our suggestion tha t some Fund resources be used to meet U .S. Government operating expenses . (B-161470 , Mar. 21, 1974 .) Conservation Practices Applie d inWorld Bank Project s At the request of Congressman Henry S . Reuss, we surveyed three foreign developmen t 152 t fps_,,/.null ..il/.null Y Ft Ilk Anarea of Jengka Triangle, Malaysia, inprocess of being cleared . projects involving timber harvesting . The pro- jects, supported by, international Bank for Re - construction and Development (World Bank ) loans, were located inMalaysia, Kenya, an d Zambia . These loans totaled about $68 .4 millio n and represented about 50 percent of the pro- jects' estimated costs . Congressman Reuss wa s concerned with the forest_ conservation practice s being applied . The Bank in 1970 established an environ- mental `office to review and evaluate ever y investment project for its potential effects o n the environment and public health ; however, th e :Bank is outside our direct audit authority so w e do not `know how effectively it has carried ou t this review in recent years . For the thre e projects we surveyed, which were initiated i n 1968 and 1969, the ` Bank did not conduc t formal ecological impact studies or prescrib e other specific measures to insure the environ- mental integrity of the forests . However, th e countries themselves were undertaking certai n conservation practices to accomplish thei r objectives . (B-161470, Apr . 4, 1974 .) Audit Work in Proces s In 1973 weinitiated a comprehensive revie w of the world food situation .Initially we inten d toidentify themagnitude of the food problem s and the general level of effort being applied to resolve the problems . In subsequent reviews weINTERNATIONAL OPERATION S will examine whether the programs devised t o solve both short-and long-range food problem s are adequately designed and effectively admin- istered, We hope to promote an increase d awareness of the worldwide food problem an d improve program performance . Bilateral Development Assistanc e Many agencies of the U .S. Government partic- ipate in administering bilateral developmen t assistance programs . Principal among these is th e Agency for International Development whic h manages U .S. economic assistance program s under the Foreign Assistance Act . Other agen- cies administering bilateral development assist- ance programs include the Export-Import Bank , the Peace Corps, and the Overseas Private Invest- ment Corporation . During the fiscal year, we completed 2 3 reports on bilateral assistance programs\u20144 to th e Congress, 14 to committees or to Members o f Congress, and 5 to agency officials . We als o worked on 10 other assignments .Our report s included such topics as legislative expenditur e ceilings exceeded in Laos ; payment of phanto m troops in Cambodia ; effectiveness of U .S. assist- ance to developing countries ; U.S. support o f International Planned Parenthood Federation ; use of SS Manhattan as a floating silo during th e Bangladesh crisis ; information on voluntar y foreign aid programs ; and problems of war vic- tims in Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam . U.S. Programs in Lao s We reported to the Congress that congres- sionally imposed limits on U .S. expenditures i n Laos were successful in reducing costs, but we found that the fiscal year 1972 ceiling of $35 0 million was exceeded by about $28 million . The State Department had reported to th e Congress that the Department of Defense, th e Central Intelligence Agency, and the Agency fo r International Development spent $349 .8 millio n on aid to Laos in fiscal year 1972 ; however, w e identified an estimated $28 .2 million in assist- ance-related expenditures not reported or in - adequately reported b the ` three agencies . If these costs had been reported, the $350 millio n ceiling would have been exceeded by $2 8 million . 153 INTERNATIONAL OPERATION S We did find that the ceiling legislation had a definite positive impact on program ul nhagc- rnent . Program manmgemcnt efforts were intensi reduced, and the Con- gess-was -g iven additional lnforiliatlon for use i n dischargihg its oversight responsibilities . ($-1:33003, June 6, 1974 .) Payment of Phantom Troops for th e Cambodian Military Force s At the request of Congressman Michae l Harrington, we reviewed certain aspects of th e payroll practices of the -Cambodian militar y forces . In 1971 and 1972 the United States pro- vided the .-heal currency equivalent of about $5 6 million to suppo rt military payand allowance s for the Cambodian military forces . `hhe loca l currency contribution was generated throug h :sales of commodities provided by the U .S. com- modity impart andPublic Law 480 programs, a cash grant, and the U .S. contribution to the Lx - change Support Fund . Both American and Cambodian officials wer e 'aware that corrupt payroll practices existe d tSllthin the Cambodian military forces, but th e exact' extent of payments for phantom troop s was unknown . flowever . eve estimated that i n January 1973 ` the Forces Aimee Nationa l Khmeres commanders may have drawn the loca l currency equivalent of ro750,000 to $1 .1 millio n for phantom-troop pay . report that, h U .S.-contrib- uted funds_ were commingled with Governmen t of Khmer Republic resources and could not b e identified as payments to specific troops o r units, the availability of such large amounts un- doubtedly facilitated corrupt pay practices . An additionally significant factor was the rapid ex- pansion of the Cambodian armed forces from a largely ceremonial force of between 28,000 an d 35,000 to over 200,000 inless than 2 years . (B-1 69832, July 3, 1973 .) U.S.Assistance tothe Khmer Republic (Cambodia ) The goals` and objectives of ,U.S. economi c and military _ assistance programs in Cambodi a have been related to the military effort in Indo- china . During fiscal years 1970-73 the Unite d States provided $516 million inmilitary an d ,S216 -million ineconomic assistance t o 154Cambodia ;not including costs of combat air operations . Our report to the Con gress provided in - formation concerning rile administration and Cf. fectiveness of U .S. economic and military assist- ance . We reported that military nhenhbers twcr e not assigned as advisors but were actin~ beyon d their primary function of auditing deliveries . Additionally, while executive branch cx- pcnditures probably did not exceed the 197 2 ceiling, all costs were not reported . We also reported that All) requested mor e money for economic assistance than the countr y could absorb and that [lie Cambodian tax poli- cies delayed some commodities from being use d in the economy . We recommended that the executive agencie s more fully inform the Congress of the type an d organizational level of advisor assistance given to the Cambodian military and provide more com- plete reports on expenditu res for all assistanc,e- relatcd activities . (11-169832, Oct . 10, 1973 .) Development Assistance to Kore a During fiscal years 1968-72, direct U .S. Ill - lateral economic assistance to Korca totale d $1,194 million and direct military assistanc e totaled $2,635 million . Korea benefited als o from the substantial U .S. expenditures made t o support U .S. military forces in Korea arid fro m additional sums received for sending itstroop s to Vietnam . We reported to the Congress that, althoug h U.S. assistance had undoubtedly stimulate d Korea 's economic expansion, it also nrhy hav e inadvertently contributed to Korea's economi c problems . For example, U .S. conccssional ai d has helped to make it _possible for Korea to ge t large amounts of nonconcessional credit whic h has caused Korea's external debt situation t o worsen . In addition, subsidization of food and fiber programs has built up Korean demand fo r imported products, thus adding to its trade gap . We recommended that the Congress inquir e into (1) Department of State and AID plans fo r terminating the development loan program fo r Korea and (2) reasons for the increased- Publi c Law 480 program in Korea and uses to whic h the sales proceeds are being put.

We concluded the U .S. Government does no t have all cl ,fcctivc planning, policy analysis, an d policy formulation system for basic conuivadi- ties. We made a series of recommendations t o strengthen the executive Kirsch departments , agencies, and policy councils concerned with tic conrimodity policy process . We said that the Congress, in its legislativ e deliberations, should consider (1) executiv e hnnich agency actions being taken, (2) renmi- tnctidations for improving agency capability fo r coping with coniniodity prohlcills, and (3) nee d for legislation to establish a centralized mechan- ism for developing and coordinating li ng-tern police planning .

(B-179342, INIar .21, 1974 .) Foreign Visitor Travel to th e United States-Can be Increase d Programs of the United States Travel Servic e were reviewed to find out if they could be mad e more effective in encouraging people of othe r nations to visit the United States . Travel receipts from foreign visitors to th e United States were considerably less than thos e from Americans traveling abroad . This so-calle d travel gaphas been aleading contributor to th e U.S. balance-of-payment problems in recen t years . We found that international travel competi- tion is `difficult- and that the Travel Servic e needed todevelop a variety of package tours fo r the United States to compete more effectivel y with other travel destinations . This ' reportshows the Congress that muc h work needs to be done by the Travel Service t o offset the increased travel gap and its significan t addition to theoverall U .S. balance-of-payment s Ways toImprove U .S.Foreign Trade Strategie s This report to the Congress focused on th e Departments ofState, Commerce, and Agri - culture, the principal agencies involved inplan- ning andcarrying out U .S. commercial activitie s abroad . These agencies have not developed clearl y stated objectives for foreign markets whic h reflect coordinated consideration of U .S. trad e 158objectives and activities needed to attain them . As a result, foreign markets are not analyze d systematically to identify areas of prime com- mercial importance nor are export strategie s adapted to the peculiarities and special oppor- tunities of individual markets . (B-172255, Nov . 23, 1973 .) Management of Investment Insurance , Loan Guarantees, and Claim Payments by th e Overseas Private Investment Corporatio n This report to the Chairman, Subcommitte e on Multinational Corporations, Senate Commit - tee on Foreign Relations, indicated that th e Overseas Private Investment Corporation ha d made progress in initiating procedures to obtai n more comprehensive information on the devel- opmental effect of projects . The Corporation's concern, as it attempts t o conduct its insurance program with due regar d to principles of risk management, logically fo- cuses on its vulnerability to catastrophic losses . The potential for such losses is contingent o n theconcentration of insurance by country an d industry and un the size and form of invest- ments insured . The Corporation's efforts t o reduce its risk include coinsurance with invest - ors, participation with foreign nationals an d organizations in insured projects, modificatio n of contractual terms, and seeking to increas e the number of countries participating in th e insurance program . Setting limits on the concentration of insur- ance coverage in individual countries is desirabl e inorder to avoid increasing the potential for a catastrophic loss . However, even with the lim- ited concentration, catastrophic losses woul d compel the Corporation to ask the Congress fo r funds to satisfy claims, since the Corporation' s insurance reserve and unrestricted retained earn- ings are much less than the potential liability in these countries . The Corporation's assessment of political ris k in countries with insured projects forms the basis for decisions to suspend or terminat e insurance programs . The Corporation's monitoring system appear s adequate to provide access to the most curren t and complete information available to asses s political risk in program countries .

United States Oversea s information Activitie s In view of the significant -changes in the worl d and its peoples, a reform may be needed in th e policies and operations of the United State s Information Agency tocommunicate America 's story to the world more effectively . Such refor m must be predicated on the long-range U .S. objectives to be achieved in this and futur e decades . We believe that the Congress, with its over - sight responsibility for Government activities, i s 159 INTERNATIONAL OPERATION S ina good position to evaluate varied aspects o f the overseas information program and relate d political -,economic, and strategic ramifications . Accordingly, we suggested that the Congres s might wish to`assess the objectives and goals o f the program, determine the types of peoples t o bereached, and establish policies and prioritie s necessary for telling America 's story to th e world . We also believe that the Congress shoul d require the Agency to develop a formal progra m evaluation system and to report annually th e results of its `evaluation efforts .

The contractual arrangements, including th e hiring of 1,000 local personnel, were entere d into because of the limited authority placed o n the U .S.Embassy by the Department of State . The Embassy had authority to hire up to 8 4 local employees . U.S. Embassy personnel' did not comply with State Department regulations because they di- rectly supervised the contractor personnel an d retained the right to hire and fire individua l employees .

Legislation introduced in the 93d Congres s to revise and restate certain functions and dutie s of the Comptroller General (I I .R. 12113 an d S.3013) included itseparate title providing fo r this transfer . Hearings on this legislation Wert - held by the llousc Committee on Governmen t Operations un June 5 and Gand by the Sedat e Committee oil Government Operations o n August 7, 1_I74 . A steering committee has been established t o facilitate the transfer of the rate audit, twolct' t the rights and safeguard the interests and well - being of rate audit personnel, streamline rat e audit operations, and provide for the organiza- tion and management of residual transportatio n functions . State Department Overseas Payment s As at result of Our survCy, weatithor[Mi ti le Secretary of State to audit the Department' s foreign transportation payments and retain all transportation vouchers and related document s paid by the Department at overseas offices . hn- plementing regulations of the State Departmen t established January 1,1974, as the effectiv e date for the changeover .:'AO has retained over - view responsibility for the audit of these pay- ments .

GAO has retained overview responsibility fo r this audit . (B-114435, B-155021, Oct . 23 , 1973 .) Transportation Payment s The Federal Government spends about $1 . 5 billion annually for commercial transportatio n services directly procured on standard forms . GAO audits the charges for these services on th e basis' of paid bills submitted by Governmen t agencies . Expenditures for other directly pro - cured commercial transporation services, con- sisting primarily of contract services covering th e transportation of mail, commercial ocean serv- ices paid bN1 the Military Sealift Command, an d transportation services paid by Governmen t corporations, are audited onsite . The Government also spends several billio n dollars annually for operating military transpor- tation fleets, moving civilian employees' house - hold goods onacommuted basis, reimbursin g transportation charges incurred by cost-typ e contractors, and other indirect transportatio n services . These expenditures arc covered in ou r re-6ews of selected activities and programs of th e various agencies . Federal agencies are required to pay the bill s of carriers upon presentation and before audi t by GAO . Because accountable officers ar e exempted by law from liability for any over - charges by carriers improperly applying rates o r charges on services procured by standard forms , paid transportation bills are submitted to us fo r central postaudit, for determination of over - charges, and for recovery of overcharges direc t from the carriers . During the fiscal year we audited 4 millio n BILLS OF LADING AND TRANSPORTATION REQUESTS AUDITED DURING FISCAL YEAR 197 4 f/.null d Numbe r Bills oflading 4,034 1 Total .. 6,148,25 0 164bills of lading covering freight shipments fo r which the Government had paid over $1 .1 billion and 2 .1 million transportation request s procuring passenger transportation services fo r which the Government had paid about $35 2 million . As a result, we issued 70,082 overcharg e notices to commercial carriers requesting re - funds totaling $11 .3 million . Collections fro m carriers, totaling $9 .5 million, were credited t o the pertinent basic appropriations of the pro - curing agencies or, when this was not possible , deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneou s receipts . A summary of this activity for fisca l year 1974 is shown below : The amount of the payments audited wa s about 7 percent more than that in the prio r year, whereas the amount of the overcharge s detected and reported to carriers was about 5 percent less . Our audit work was performed wit h 15.5 percent fewer man- .hours than were used in fiscal year 1973 . A schedule showing transporta- tion audits and collections for fiscal year s 1965-74 is included in appendix 9 . Our audit work also includes examining cer- tain types of carriers' bills before payment b y agency disbursing officers to fully protect th e Government's interest . During the year w e examined 754 original unpaid bills for $ 1 million on which we disallowed about $105,00 0 as being in excess of the proper contract and/o r tariff rates . In our transportation audit, we identifie d hundreds of shipments involving transportatio n services which, although procured at the lega l rates, resulted in excess costs that were not re- coverable from the carriers . These traffic man- agement errors resulted from the selection of un- economical routes, modes of carriage, or type s of service . We brought the errors to the atten- tion of proper agency transportation officials fo r necessary corrective action .

During the fiscal year, we also took fina l action on 570 additional claims which wer e Payment Claims barred because of the 10-year statute of limita - tions on filing claims in the General Accountin g Government agencies have primary responsi- Office . bility forpaying obligations incurred in connec - tion with their operations . Two classes of claims , however ; must beadjudicated by GAO before Debt Claim s payment can be made or denied : (1) those i n v;hich such reasonable doubt exists as to pre- Government agencies are primarily respon - elude action by the administrative agency in the sible for collecting debts arising from their activ - absence of specific statutory authority and (2) ities, The agencies are required, however, to those inwhich the law specifically prohibits pay- report to us valid debts onwhich they have bee n ment by the administrative agency before our unsuccessful in their collection actions and can - adjudication . We also consider those reclaims of not obtain compromises or suspend or terminat e items previously denied by administrative agen- collection actions .

Debtors who can - notpav the entire amount of their debts at on e time may slake payment in monthly install- ments commensurate with their ability to pay . When our efforts to obtain payment of a deb t areunsuccessful, we refer the case to the Depart- rnent of justice for suit, pro\\icled that th e debtor's financial circumstances warrant suc h actioIl . We adjudicate debt claims submitted by othe r agencies because of doubt as to the amount due , the legal liability of the parties involved, oi- th e action to be taken . We similarly adjudicate dis- puted -claims against debtors when such is re - quested by the debtors, their representatives, o r the agencies concerned . On july 1, 1973, we had on hand 29,68 0 claims by the U Cited States with a face value o f approximately $59 million . Du ring fiscal yea r 1974, we disposed of 26,580 debt eases resultin g in collections ;totaling $4 .9 million . Oil June 30, 1974, 42,952 claims (other tha n waiver cases) with a total estimated value o f $89.4 million were oil hand or under referral t o the Department of Justice .

Thus, 14,802 claims with a combined value of' $12 .2 nulltcnl were unde r collection . We have authority to arrange compromis e settlements on claims which do not excee d $20,000, exclusive of interest . Compromis e offers involving claims for larger amounts ar e referred to the Attorney General with our rec- ommendations for disposition . During fiscal year 1974, wesolicited 16,17 6 compromises from debtors and made 386 com- promise settlements in which $224,728 wer e accepted in liquidation of debts totalin g $525,755 . Compromise settlements accepted b y GAO are final and are conclusive on the debto r and on all U .S. officials, agencies, and courts . Executive agency heads are authorized to waive claims for overpayment of pay to civilia n employees and military personnel in certai n cases involving less than $500 . Only GAO ca n waive claims for more than this amount o r claims that are the subject of an exception mad e by GAO in the 1I000tlrlt of any accountabl e officer . During fiscal year 1974, we processed 54 7 requests forwaiver of erroneous payments o f pay totaling $610,534 . We granted waiver re - quests for the full amount in 323 case s amounting to$309,836 and denied 181 request s totaling $221,156 . The remaining 43 cases wer edenied in part-$59,098 were waived an d $20,444 were denied . Agency Reviews and Assistanc e During the year we prepared nine report s covering reviews of Federal agency transporta- tion and traffic management activities and pay- ment and debt claims activities . Six reports wer e submitted to individual Members of Congres s andthree to agency officials . Transportation andTraffic Managemen t Government Use of Section 22 Quotation s At the request of Senator Philip A . Hart, w e investigated the use of rates and charges unde r section' 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act . We prepared tworeports onthe subject : the first, t o suggest' language to be used should legislation b e introduced toinsure that section 22 rates woul d be compensatory 'while retaining flexibility an d the second, to summarize our analysis of rai l carload freight moving during a7-month perio d for the Department of Defense . We reported that the Department of Defens e had utilized rates under section 22 for shippin g about 5 .3 billion pounds of rail carload freigh t for which the related dine-haul transportatio n charges totaled about $80 .8 million . These ship- ments constituted 77 percent of the total car - load weight ; shipped during theperiod and 8 1 percent of the related line-haul charges . On the basis of rail carload cost scales pub- lished by the Interstat e`Commerce Commission , we estimated that the carriers' fully allocate d -costs of transporting the 5 .3 billionpounds wer e about $37 .2million and the variable costs wer e about -$29 .4 million . The charges paid unde r section 22 were $43 .6million above the carriers ' fully allocated costs and $51 .4 million above th e carriers 'variable costs .` Had payment for thes e section 22 shipments been made on the basis o f available tariffs, thecost to the Governmen t would' have been increased by about $105 .6 inilliou . The tariff charges ; however, wer e ,+149.2 million above the carrier s'fully allocatedTRANSPORTATION AUDIT AND CLAIMS SETTLEMEN T costs and $157 million above the carriers 'vari- able costs . Our study clearly showed that the overal l charges for rail shipments under section 22 wer e not only compensatory but also well above th e carriers' costs of providing the service . We ar e continuing our investigation and will report on our analysis of motor and household goods ship - ments . (B-177692, July 23, 1973, and Apr . 9, 1974 .) Consolidation of Freight Shipment s At the request of Congressman Wayne Owens , we investigated the extent of consolidation o f air freight shipments moving from Ogde n Defense Depot, Utah, to points in California . We reported that about 27 percent of th e shipments reviewed could have been con- solidated with other shipments . Although th e savings from each consolidation would hav e been small, the savings over a period of tim e could have been significant . We are continuin g this review to determine the validity of the rea- sons for nonconsolidation of the shipments an d to see what actions can be taken to resolve th e situation . (B-180616, Apr, 5, 1974 .) Unjust, Unreasonable, or Discriminatory Rate s Congressman E . de la Garza requested that w e investigate rail rates for shipping manufacture d products, agricultural commodities, and ra w materials between various points inthe con- tinental United States to determine whethe r such rates were unjust, unreasonable, or discrim- inatory . We informed Congressman de la Garza tha t the Interstate Commerce Commission and no t the General Accounting Office had this responsi- bility . We did, however, analyze various com - parative domestic and import rates and reporte d that there was no consistent pattern to the rate s from specific origins to the same destinations . (B-179218, Apr . 4, 1974 .) Controls and Procedures for Unused Passenger Ticket s We reported to the Director, ACTION, tha t Government funds were being lost because o f that agency 's inadequate controls and proce - dures for recovering the value of unused passen - 157 TRANSPORTATION AUDIT AND CLAIMS SETTLEMEN T ger tickets from carriers . Tlnis inadequacy stil l existed even though the agency had promised , after each of our two prior reports on th e matter, to take corrective action . ACTIO N officials have now issued written instructions fo r Handling and controlling unused tickets and fo r forwarding documentation to the Genera l Accounting ;Office and have assi need full-tim e personnel to carry- out the instructions . (B-153862, Sept . 20, 1973 .) Payment and Debt Claim s Procedures for Recovery of Defaulted Student Loan s A request by Congressman Samuel L . Devin e concerned the defaulting of loans made unde r the 01-laranteed student loan program adminis- tered by the Office of Education, Department o f Health, Education, - and lVelfare . We reporte d that, as of _ tioust 3-1, 1973, commitments ha d been made bv the Office of Education to guar- antee 2 .5 79.725 student loans annountimg t o over S2 .6 billion and that the Office had no t yet formulated a national tuition refund polic y because of recent complexitic s that required a n intensive -Nov . 5, 19/3 .) Repavrnnent mad e within 10 rears, CXCIUSiVe of ant- defermen t period, and must be initiated no later than 9 to12 months after the date on which the studen t leaves school or ceases to carry the prescribe d academic workload . All of a debtor's remit- tances are applied to the outstanding principa l until it has been repaid, with subsequent remit- tances applied to accrued interest . This policy is predicated on the Office of Education's interpre- tation of the legislative history of the Highe r Education Act of 1965 and the policy applied t o reinsured loans . In the first 5 fiscal years of the program , 30,453 loans were defaulted and, in fiscal yea r 1973 alone, 35,366 were defaulted, for a tota l of 65,819 loans amounting to over $61 .9 nnil- lion. As of July 31, 1973, the agency had onl y 22 field employees assigned to collecting de - faulted student loans, although 41 additiona l positions were allotted to the 10 regional office s during fiscal year 1972 . These 22 employee s actually spent about 57 percent of their time o n collection activities . For several years we have been concerne d with the need for a strengthening of efforts b y this agency to collect defaulted loans tinder thi s program . As early as January 1971, we calle d attention to the inadequacy of the collectio n program ; we have also reported the situation t o the Congress in several reports . After our audit of the fiscal year 1973 finan- cial statements of the student Advisory Council of the Transportation andClaims Division, a gro .ip of nonsupervisory employees organized in1971 , serves as a communication -medium between management and nonsupervisory employees of the Division .

(B-117604(7), Nov . 30, 1973 .) Other Traffic Management and Transportation Activity Assistanc e During the year, our assistance to variou s Government agencies inother aspects of thei r traffic management and transportation activitie s included : \u2014Assisting the General Services Administra- tion in seminars and workshops held i n Washington, D .C.; Baltimore ;New York City ;Los Angeles ; and San Francisco t o inform `Government, contractor, and com- mercial carrier personnel on the revise d Government bills of lading and attendan t procedures and assisting GSA in revising it s handbook, \"How To Prepare and Proces s U.S. Government Bills of Lading .\" \u2014Providing guest lecturers at the Arm y Transportation School, Fort Eustis, Vir- ginia, and at the-Traffic i1flilitar y Rlanagement and Terminal Servic e in Oakland, California . \u2014 Considering andacting onvarious request s from administrative agencies for permissio n to deviate from established procedures t o provide more economical and efficient traf- fic management . \u2014 Furnishing passenger fares and other trans- portation data to the Department of Labo r for preparing the monthly consumer pric e index . Furnishing ;information on freight rates , household goods rates and passenger fare s and charges to the Department of Defense .We continued to provide technical assistanc e to the Department of justice in its prosecutio n and defense of transportation suits by or agains t the United States and in proceedings before th e Interstate Commerce Commission . As part o f this assistance, transportation specialists partici- pated in numerous conferences with Departmen t members . As noted before, our assistance to th e Department regarding general claims is limite d to referring debts and adxlsing on compromis e offers . We reported debts against carriers in volvin g 567 items totaling $117,957 to the Departmen t for collection . During the fiscal year, similarl y reported debts covering 485 items totalin g $128,050 were settled by collecting $59,43 4 through judgments, compromises, or otherwise . The Department of justice notified us tha t carriers had filed 77 suits covering 18,406 ship- ments . Of that dumber, 41 suits, covering abou t 16,000 shipments, involved international move- ments of household goods by the Department o f Defense, for a total of 895 shits involvin g approximately 928,000 shipments in litigatio n in the Court of Claims . No additional suits hav e been filed in this case subsequent to August 15 , 1973, in accordance %with an agreement con - firmed by the attorney of record for th e plaintiffs . Folloxving the filing of a \"Stipulation o f Counsel \"in connection with two suits to facili- tate the audit and disposition of the househol d goods claims, representatives of the plaintiff an d the Government agreed to use sampling pros e dures in settling claims on shipments movin g from March 1, 1963, through September 30 , 1970, subject to the terms ofmilitary basi c tenders . Applying this system to 700,00 0 Government bills of lading in the univers e produced itmaximum of' 16,000 Governmen t bills of lading for . sampling . Damages are bein g computed on 8,000 sample shipments by appli- cation of the court's decisions and the stipula- tion of counsel, with a target of a 95-percen t confidence level and sampling error not t o exceed 10 percent .

Following a successful test by the Genera l Services Administration of the use of a 5-par t Government bill of lading for shipments b y motor carriers from its Federal Supply Servic e depots, we approved use of the form on -a permanent basis . The success and approval o f this system was a prerequisite to GSA's syste m concept of providing automatic payment t o motor carriers on a computer-printed Govern- ment bill of lading, prepriced with the trans- portation rate and charge . 171 ' FIELD OPERATION S CHAPTER FOURTEE N FIELD OPERATION S Responsibilitie s The Field Operations Division, through it s headquarters staff and regional offices in princi- pal cities of the United' States, performs ac - counting and auditing work assigned by th e directors of all GAO operating divisions . Staf f members of this division participated in almos t all of the audits and other studies described in previous chapters of this report . In addition, i t performs assigned audits under the Governmen t Corporation Control Act and similar legislatio n and the audit and settlement of accounts of mili- tary disbursing officers . Asof June 30, 1974, the professional staff o f this division totaled 1,790 or 50 percent of GAO's total professional staff at that date . Thi s division is under the supervision of John E .

The National Credit Union Administratio n also took a position similar to the Federa l Deposit Insurance Corporation -in that we wer e denied access to examination reports prepare d on the credit unions it insures . As a result, xv e could not determine (1) if the Administratio n had taken effective action on all findings dis- closed by its examinations and (2) the si gnifi- cance of any possible adverse effect of proble m credit unions on the financial position of the . Administration . Because of these serious obstacles to ou r audits, we could not express an overall opinio n on the financial statements of' the Federa l Deposit Insurance Corporation illidthe Nationa l Credit Union Administration for fiscal year 1973 . We reconunended in out- report onthe fed- cral Deposit Insurance Corporation (B-114831 , May 23, 1974) as we did in previous reports tha t the Congress amend thr : Federal Deposit In- surance Act to clarify _ our authority to hav e access toexamination reports, files, and othe r records used by the Corporation . Ill our rcpor t on the National Credit Union Administratio n (B-16=1031(4), IN-lay 21, 1974), we reconimende d that the Administration grant GAO access toall books, documents, riles, and other Adniinistr a Lion records including all sections of the credi t union examination reports . Government Printing Offic e In the report on the Government Printin g Office for fiscal year 1973, we expressed th e opinion that the financial statements, except for materials and supplies inventory, presente d fairly its financial position . We were unable t o satisfy ourselves as to the actual value of th e materials and supplies inventory because physi- cal counts were improperly changed during thew Crunching through broken ice, the Canadian Menihek Lak e launched the earliest seaway opening in history on March 28 , 1973. The seaway systemis a United States-Canadian venture t o provide deep water navigation inthe St . Lawrence River fro m Montreal, Canada, to Lake Erie by a series of locks an d channels _ four of the activities audited . The reasons fo r the cliLdilied opinions included : (1) tile Federa l Deposit lusitrance Corporation's and th e Natiolldi Credit Union Administration 's denia l of access to c oci nlents considered necessary i n the conduct of our audits, (2) the need t o improve inventory procedures at the Govern- rnent Printing Office, and (3) !rte failure of th Panam a_ Canal `Company toaccount foi- deprecia - tion of certain assets . Federal Deposit Insurance Corporatio n And National Credit Union Administratio n As in prior years, wedid not have unrestricte d access to bank examination reports and relate d docLIIII entation_ prepared by the Federal Deposi t Insurance Corporation onthe banks it insures . Because of this, we could notascertai n 17\" FIELD OPERATION S The Company has since reevaluated its posi- tion on this matter and now considers that ther e is nothing in the legislative `history of the Com- pany that shows the Congress 'intent to exclud e depreciation charges from the cost of opera - tions . Beginning with fiscal year 1974, the Com- pany plans to initiate the depreciation charge s we have advocated since 1952, as a principle o f sound accounting . This policy change will ad d about $8 .3 million to the annual sta ged cost o f operations . (B-114839, Mara 6, 1974 .) Organizations Outsid e The Federal Governmen t During the year we examined financial state- ments of several organizations outside the Fed- eral Government . Reports were issued totheyear to agree with perpetual inventory records . Wecould notpracticably verify independentl y the inventory balance because there were ove r 22,000 different types of inventory items with a reported book value of $3 .1 million.-(B-114829 , Apr. 15, 1974 .) Panarna Canal Compan y our opinion on the financial statements o f the Panama Canifl' Company and the Canal Zon e Government for fiscal year 1973 was qualifie d because the Company's policy of not depre- ciating or amortizing the cost of certain assets , represented by titles, treaty rights, excavation s of channels, harbors, and basins, valued at abou t $332 million, resulted in understating the cos t of operations .

The examirations of the financial statement s of the Disabled American Veterans and th e Gorgas Memorial Institute are required b y statute, while our work involving Governmen t Services, inc ., is performed at the request of th e Corporation . Audits of Military Pay And Allowance s Military personnel expenditures, includin g pay and travel, represent a significant part o f defense 'spending . About $20 billion, or 2 7 percent of the Department ofDefense budget, i s paid annually to over 2 million servicemen b y some 900 disbursing officers located throughou t the world . Historically, service members have been over - paid and underpaid\u00b0 millions of dollars ever y year. Error rates have fluctuated upward an d downward as well as between and within th e services for a number of reasons ; namely\u2014lac k of training, poor supervision, excessive rotatio n of personnel, carelessness inpayroll operation s and the complexity of the military pay system . Through our sta ffs at the four militar y finance centers-Cleveland (Navy), Denver (Ai r Force), Indianapolis (Army), and Kansas Cit y (Marine Corps)- --wetest the accuracy and legal- ity of payments made, review finance cente r operations, and make servicewide reviews o f various types of pay and personnel activities . During the year we sent 96 reports mostly t o station and ship commanders dealing with the accuracy of payments by individual disbursin g officers . These reports are identified in appendi x 5 . In November 1966, the Department o f Defense directed the military services t o develop, test, install, and maintain a joint Uni- form Military Pay System (JUMPS) . The JUMP S project was to be the first major step of a long - range, evolving, program for continuous improve- ment of the military pay system . JUMPS was t o be operational in all the services by July 1,1969 . This date was soon recognized as bein g unrealistic in view of the system's problems and complexities . Although millions of dollars have been spen t in the design, development, and implementatio n stages of JUMPS, progress has been slow .Arm y JUMPS, covering most pay entitlements, becam e operational in 1971 . The Marine Corps imple- mented its version of JUMPS in 1973 . The Ai r Force and Navy estimate their JUMPS will be - come operational in 1974 and 1975, respec- tively . JUMPS as conceived today should bring th e services closer to the goal of paying serviceme n accurately, but JUMPS will not be a cure-all i n overcoming past problems . Being a pay system , JUMPS will have little effect in coping with th e complexities associated with the administratio n of travel entitlements .

(B-180570, May 10, 1974), that the militar y services paid reenlistment travel payments to- taling $67 .5 million during the past 5 years, al - though 96 percent of our random sampl e showed no travel was required or performed b y the individuals who reenlisted . We advised th e chairman that, in our opinion, while the pay Inents were legal, they were permissive in natur e and not mandated by law and could be termi- nated by a change in the joint Travel Regula- tions. The Department of Defense budget esti- mates show that such payments will cost ;bou t $22 million during fiscal year 1975 . During the year, the Comptroller General sent a letter to the Secretary of Defense commendingFIELD OPERATION S the Air Force Accounting and Finance Cente r for developing anexcellent comprehensiv e program for the administrative examination o f Air 'Force : accountable officers' accounts . In view of our responsibilities for settling suc h accounts, weregard such examinations as an essential part of a good ;financial managemen t system . Properly made, they serve to verify th e legality, propriety, and correctness of cash receipt and disbursement transactions\" reporte d by accountable officers . They help provide as- surance that financial systems are operating ade- quately and identify problems in need of solu- tion.' The new AirForce program is tobegin in fiscal year 1975 .

Eleven persons completed the program and were immediately placed in jobs requiring their new skills . Equal Employment Opportunit y Improving the employment profile of wome n and minority persons in the professional work - force continued to receive priority attention i n fiscal year 1974 . Since June 30, 1972, ou r minority workforce has grown from 688 to $8 9 persons, up from 14 .4 percent to 17 .3 percen t of all general schedule employees . Much of thi s growth occurred in grades GS-9 and above wher e the number of minority personnel almos t doubled . In September 1973, William N . Conrardy , director, Office of Program Planning, was als o appointed director, EEO . He is charged wit h fully integrating equal opportunity considera- tions into the total management syste n . Thi s effort was facilitated when the Civil `crvic e Commission permitted GAO to submit its 197 5 and subsequent annual affirmative action plan s on a fiscal instead of calendar year basis .

A full-time Federal Women 'sProgra m coordinator was appointed and a 30`-membe r Women's Committee composed ofheadquarter s and regional employees was established . Ou r Spanish- .speaking program was accelerated with the appointment of coordinators in eight re- gional offices located where there are large con- centrations of Hispanics . The program's na- tional coordinator deputy direc- tor, EEO, Alexander A. Silva . Five persons were employed full-time i n administering the equal opportunity program i n fiscal year 1074 . Another 104 served in part - time positions,' including EEO counselors, com- plaint investigators, and elected representative s to our EEO Advisory Council . In June 1974, the Office of Internal Revie w completed an evaluation of the program's effec- tiveness and made recommendations for im- provement . This review has given the EEO pro - gram wide visibility throughout GAO an d brought important issues andemployee concern s directly totop management's attention . Progra m effectiveness was also enhanced through EE O briefings for all mid-leve land senior managers . Administrative Planning and Service s The Office of Administrative Planning an d Services, under the direction of Clerio P . Pin, i s responsible forproviding a wide range of sup - port services to all divisions and offices withi n GAO . During the year, several organizationa l changes were made in this office . An organiza- tion chart as of the end of the year appears o n the following . page . Organization and Management Planning Staff The Organization and Management Plannin g Staff (1) makes studies of organization and procedural problems and (2) designs and test s new internal management systems and assists th e implementation and followup of these systems .Durin g_ the year weworked ondeveloping a uniform control andreporting system for con- gressional requests and analyzed audit assi4n- ment history records, published a booklet o n lessons learned during audit assignments, revise d report distribution procedures, developed a functional telephone directory ofoperatin g groups, analyzed job matiagement agreement s between Washington staffs and field offices, and analyzed elapsed time between the signing and distribution ofreports . The Organization and Management Plannin g staff also manages GAO's programming, sched- uling, and reporting system, provides overal l control over GAO's management informatio n system, and responds to the increased emphasi s placed on GAO's management improvemen t program . Management Services Branc h This branch provides many of the service s which enable the rest of the organization t o operate more efficiently . During the year, th e branch continued its efforts to renovate an d improve the working environment of GAO staf f members in the GAO headquarters building, i n audit sites in the Washington area, inregiona l offices and suboffices throughout the country , and in one of the overseas branches . In Washington, over 110,000 square feet o f space was renovated in the headquarters buildin g and over 30,000 square feet of new space wa s obtained, designed, and occupied .These renova- tion projects benefitted nearly 600 GAO staf f members . The regional offices in Denver, Kansas City , and San Francisco and the suboffice in St . Pau l were moved to new quarters . Also, the Bosto n regional office, the Cleveland and New Orlean s suboffices, and the Frankfurt, Germany, offic e were renovated during the year . The Supply and Services Section entered int o nearly 5,200 purchasing actions during the yea r to satisfy the agency's nationwide needs . Thi s section also monitors the receipt of purchases , maintains accountability records, and perform s the full range ofproperty management and dis- posal activities . A contracts group establishe d during the year processed 135 contract trans - actions . 184 185 ADMINISTRATIO N ThP Travel :Unit operating under this sectio n assumed the international' travel functions fro m the International Division and added to its Uni t \u00a3our Class C agent cashiers . A new GAO directives system was institute d during the year . This system--based on the GA O Operations Manual--is now the primary means o f issuing policies and procedures for all adminis- trative operations within GAO . The Records Information Section service d nearly 1,400 requests from Government agencie s and private individuals for information from an d copies ofGovernment records. The Section als o was made responsible for receiving and filin g confidential financial statements of Senators an d certain officers and employees of the Senate a s required by Senate Rule 44 and it furnished a report relating to the receipt of 1,533 state- ments to the Senate Select Committee onStand- ards and Conduct . Responsibility for making the initial distribu- tion of audit reports was transferred to th e Distribution Section during the year .Tobette r respond to itsincreased workload, the sectio n was reorganized into three unique operatin g groups :the Special Activities Group whic h handles the initial and subsequent distributio n ofallaudit reports, the On-Call Group whic h handles all requests for copies of GAO publica- tions, and the `Standard Group which distribute s GAO andother agency publications . TheMail andMessenger Section provides mai l delivery and special services daily throughou t the GAO building and to some 65 audit sites i n the Washington Metropolitan area . An offic e appliance repair staff and a carpenter staff als o provide necessary services for the Washingto n offices . Intherecords management area, we issued a major policy statement which precisely define d thecontent of accountable officers 'accounts , ending confusion which had existed since th e siteaudit program began in 1950 . Agencies wer e asked to follow the new standards beginning i n fiscal year 1975 . We began aseries of visits to the 15 Federa l Records Centers to reexamine their GA O holdings . Asaresult of our visits infive centers , we have saved about $40,000 by applying th e new definition of accountable officers' account s and by on-the-spat approvals forthedisposal of GAO records .Management Information Systems Branc h This branch develops long-range internal AD P plans, develops and maintains officewide in- ternal ADP systems, and assists line managers i n developing information systems for their specifi c needs . The branch also reviews andrecommend s action to the ADP Steering Committee on al l new management information systems, majo r changes to ADP hardware, and major problem s in the development of ADP systems. In addition , the branch prescribes data processing standard s for officewide internal use . Budget and Financial Planning Branc h This branch prepared financial plans for eac h of the divisions and offices in fiscal year 197 4 based on their requests analyzed in light o f historical data and expected increases in staffin g and costs . Using a financial plan to manage avail - able resources emphasizes dollar control, and w e expect this emphasis to improve our manage- ment effectiveness . In fiscal year 1975 we pla n to refine our program budgeting techniques i n GAO to assist program managers intheir anal- ysis, planning, and decisionmaking processes . The refinement of budgeting techniques wit h the use of financial plans as a management too l is designed to increase awareness and involve- ment of lime managers in the budget process . Accounting Operations Branc h The Accounting Operations Branch is respon- sible for : Preparing accounting reports on payroll an d related financial matters for the Office o f Management and Budget, Civil Service Com- mission, and the Treasury Department . Maintaining the central administrative ac - counting and financial reporting systems, in- cluding summary accounting control an d deposit of all GAO collections involving Gov- ernment agencies . Examining and certifying administrativ e vouchers and invoices covering operatin g expenses . Preparing, examining, and certifying payroll s and preparing ormaintaining related record s and reports . 186/.null - Providing the above- services, on a reim- _ b u r s a b l e basis, to the Cost Accountin g Standards Beard and theOffice- of Technol- ogy Assessment . An interim automated system to speed the processing and payment of miscellaneou s vouchers and to provide applicable summar y data was installed at the beginning of the fisca l year . A fully automated financial management in- formation system is being designed to replac e the manual and interim systems . Installation wil l begin in fiscal year 1975 . Greater useof AD P techniques are expected to improve the time - and usefulness offinancial reports b y providing information pertinent to current man- agenient decisions . Also, we expect to combin e financial data with data from other subsystem s to provide useful information related to produc- tivity and unit costs . Publishing and Graphic Sera+ice s The principal work of Publishing and Graphi c Services is editing, typing, proofing, illustrating , and printing GAO _audit reports . Assisting wit h other publications is, 'however, becoming a n important part of the workload . This work in- clude s Editing manuscripts and coordinating th e printing of The GAO Review, aquarterl y magazine for GAO's professional staff, an d the Comptroller General's annual report . Editing` services are also provided fo r speeches, testimony, special GAO publica- tions, and other products .

Printing manuals, Comptroller General dc- cisions, special publications ; and press release s or contracting through > the Governmen t Printing Office to have them printed . Thi s section also prints memorandums, audit pro - grams, internal policies, etc ., for in-house use . GAO Library Syste m The Library System with 40;446 volumes , binders, and pamphlets serves all GAO office s and divisions .ADMINISTRATIO N Staff members continued to usethe Congre s sional Research Service Selective Disseminatio n of Information System . The library assists b y handling staff requests for copies ofCRS mate- rials. Over 250 such requests were receive d during the year . During the year the library borrowed 2,02 8 books and periodicals from other librarie s through the interlibrary loan service . The library continued to publish its monthl y accessions list as well as one special bibliograph y which have generated considerable interest i n the library facilities . Polic y The Office of Policy advises and assists th e Comptroller General on policy formulation , guidance, and review with respect to all GA O functions . During fiscal year 1974 the Offic e was under the direction of Allen R . Voss . In July 1974 Mr . Voss became manager of th e Philadelphia regional office and Donald J . Horan was designated acting director . The office (1) develops auditing policies , standards, and procedures for the guidance o f GAO's operating divisions, (2) conducts o r sponsors research in auditing theory, objectives , practices, and techniques, (3) furnishes polic y advice on accounting and auditing problems, (4 ) participates in reviews of audit assignment s proposed or in process, and (5) reviews propose d reports for the Comptroller General 'ssignature . It also advises and assists in developing operatin g policies and guidance for GAO's legislative, legal , claims, and administrative activities . Program Plannin g The Office of Program Plannning, under th e direction of William N . Conrardy advises an d assists the Comptroller General on long-rang e GAO objectives, budget formulation, resourc e requirements, and overall direction-of-effor t planning . The office also monitors and evaluate s the operational plans andperformance of GAO ! divisions and offices and promotes effective ADMINISTRATIO N planning throughout GAO by providing guid- ance and counsel -in the office plans . Interne) Hevi e The Office of Internal Reviewis under th e direction of Lloyd G . Smith, and is responsibl e for reviewing the operations and performance o f all divisions and offices in GAO . Reports \"pre - pared by the office on its reviews and examina- tions are submitted directly to the Comptrolle r General and the Deputy Comptroller General .Information ;Offic e The Information Office is the focal point o f contact between GAO and the various inedii l services . Other services include assistance in preparin g digests of audit reports, pre paration of th e :Monthly ListofGAO>Report s,which the Comp _ troller General sends to the Congress as require d by the Legislative Reorganization ; Act of 1970 , and publication of the GAO Management News , a weekly information bulletin for the GAO staf f begun inSeptember ; 1973 . LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATION S The Budget and Accounting Act, 1921, requires our Office to make recommendations to th e Congress \"looking togreater economy and efficiency in public expenditures .\" In cases where an audit shows that corrective legislation is required or desirable, our report will include anappropriat e proposal for legislative consideration .Inother cases, we may recommend that the affected agenc y sponsor a legislative proposal . Furthermore, we bring proposals for legislation to the attention of th e committees of jurisdiction . In February 1974 we submitted to the chairmen and ranking minority members of the responsibl e congressional committees summaries of recommendations for legislative action which were open asof January 1, 1974 . We plan to submit similar reports in future years at the beginning of each session o f Congress . Recommendations for consideration by the Congress included in reports completed during th e =ear, togCt hey with certain recommendations ca rried forward from prior years, are discussed in thi s appendix . Recommendations to the Congres s During Fiscal Year 197 4 Agriculture and Rural Developmen t Afeed to EstaNish Indepe?ide?it .dgency Sepa- rate oni the Department ofAgriculture t o Regulate COMModity Futures Trading-Th e Congress was considering several major bill s introduced in 1973` addressing the question as t o Nvhere the regulation of commodity future s trading belonged in the Federal bureaucracy . We recommended that the Congress establis h anindependent agency, separate from the De- p,utnient of Agricultun-, to regulate all future s trading because (1) any appearance of a conflic t ofinterest' woutd be removed, (2) future s markets, vital tothe ?ration's economic well - being, should be regulated by a strong ; indepen- dent agency,:and (3) Federal regulation could b e extended toalltypes of futures trading encom- passing commodities, such as metals and foreig n cur rencies, inwhich the Department has little o r no expertise . (Interim report onthe Commodit y s 13-146770, Nlay3, 1974 .)This recommendation is for consideratio n by the following committees : Senate : Agriculture and Forestr y House : Agricultur e Need toAmend the Commodity Exchang e Act to Provide Effective Regulation of Com- m o d i t), Futures Trading \u2014To close gaps in the Commodity Exchange Act and to provid e for the Government to regulate futures tradin g effectively, we recommended that the Congres s amend the act to provide authorty for (1 ) regulating all futures trading, including future s of such commodities as copper, silver, an d foreign currencies, which are not now regulated , (2) restricting trading of floor brokers an d brokerage firms for their own accounts while trading for the accounts of customers, (3 ) seeking injunctions to deter, and imposing civil money penalties to punish, violations of theact, (4) establishing margin requirements in emer- gency situations to facilitate orderly trading i n or liquidation of any futures market, (5)' re- quiring exchanges to designate additional point s 189 v,-herc ~tcnn- m4)clitv may be delivered to fulfill' a ;uiTic such points to al l PL-:`)r=s handling customers' accounts atld o r s ds.

To insure that the Comptroller General ha s access to the records necessary for aneffectiv e evaluation, lye recommended that he be given access . to the same records as the commission . This recommendation isfor consideratio n by the following committees : Senate : Agriculture and Forestr y House :Agriculture ' Commerce and Transportatio n Transportation ofArmed Forces Exchang e Goods\u2014Congress isaware of, and apparentl y approves, the use of appropriated funds to -pay some ofthe-transportation -costs _of the militar y exchanges .

These officials 'salaries have no t increased in 5 years . In our report to a committee chairman and a number of Members of Congress, we concluded ' that (1) the President's February 4, 1974 , recommendation for increasing executive, legis- lative, and judicial salaries should be accepte d and (2) major reforms were needed in th e process for adjusting executive schedule salaries . The Congress did not accept the President' s recommendation . However, several legislativ e proposals have subsequently been introduce d which would make major changes in the pay - setting process to correct or alleviate the'prob- leni. (Information and Observations on Need fo r Executive Pay Adjustment, B-101892, Feb . 19 , 19:'4.) This recommendation is for consideratio n by the following committees : Senate : Post Office and Civil Servic e House : Post Office and Civil Servic e Veed for Sanctions to Discourage Hirin g Illegal Aliens\u2014No Federal law prohibits em - ployers from hiring aliens who are in the Unite d States in violation of the Immigration an d Nationality Act . Because jobs lure and em- ployers repeatedly hire illegal aliens, a law i s needed to discourage such employment .. We recommended that the Senate give favora- ble consideration to House bill 982, passed b y the House on May 3, 1973, which makes' i t unlawful to hire illegal aliens . (More Needs to b e Done to Reduce the Number and Advers e Impact of Illegal Aliens in the United States , 8-125051, July 31, 1973 .) This recommendation is for consideratio n b-,the following committees : Senate : Judiciar y House : judiciar y Tax Liabilities of High Income IndiLidual s Discharged Through Bankruptcy--Taxpayer s oath high incomes have avoided the Interna l Revenue Se-vice's efforts to collect taxes b y taking advantage of the Bankruptcy Act (1 1 L.S.C. 1). Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act (I I U.S.C. 35) provides for the discharge in bank- ruptcy of debts for t :axts which becarne legall y due and cjv .,Lng more than 3 years precedin g bankruptcy . IRIS and the courts have determine( ] that the - ear Der nod starts on the due elate fo r 1~3 HFrtNOIX 1 filing a return rather than from the date of a subsequent assessment . This substantially re- duces the time that the IRS has to collect th e taxes . To make the Bankruptcy Act 's credito r preference given to the Federal, State, and loca l governments more meaningful, we recom- mended that the joint Committee on Interna l Revenue Taxation initiate legislation to amen d the Bankruptcy Act to exclude from discharg e through bankruptcy taxes assessed within 3 years before a bankruptcy petition is filed . (Collection of Taxpayers' Delinquent Account s by the Internal Revenue Service, B-13776 2 Aug. 9, ,1973 .)

(Collection of Taxpayers ' Delinquent Accounts by the Internal Revenu e Service, B-137762, Aug. 9, 1973 .) This recommendation is for consideration by : joint Committee onInternal Revenue Taxa- tion Need for Change in Extended Payment Estat e Tax Interest Rate\u2014During the last 6 years, th e annual average rate of interest on the publi c debt has exceeded the 4-percent interest rat e charged onestate taxes due from estates whic h have been granted apayment extension .Thu s the Federal Government incurs additional inter- estcosts' which the Congress may not hav e anticipated when it established the 4-percen t rate in 1938 . We recommended that thejoin t Committee onInternal Revenue Taxation initi- ate legislation to amend section 6601(b) of th e Internal Revenue Code to establish interest rate s on deferred estate tax payments which would be closer to the Government 's cost of borrowin g 192funds . (Collection of `Taxpayers' Delinquen , B-137762, Aug . 9,1973 .) This recommendation is for consideration by : Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxa- . tion Need for Improved Coordination and Uni- formity of Federal Disaster Assistance Pro . grams\u2014Although the Office of Emergency Pre- paredness (now the Federal Disaster Assistanc e Administration) is responsible for coordinatin g Federal disaster relief, we found little coordi . nation of the several programs involving larg e Federal expenditures. Also, greater uniformity i s needed in Federal disaster assistance programs . We suggested that the congressional com- mittees may wish to consider (1) providing fo r uniformity among Federal disaster loan pro - grams, (2) assigning to one agency disaste r responsibilities which are now divided amon g various Federal agencies, (3) clarifying con . gressional intent regarding the applicability o f local codes, specifications, and standards, (4) th e policy of following State laws in the establish- ment of fair market value, and (5) including th e victim's losses for disaster-related projects i_ i relocation payments . (Information on Federa l Disaster Relief Programs, B-178415, Nov . 1973 .) This recommendation is for consideration b y the following committees : Senate : Public Work s House :Public Work s Expenditure of Federal Funds for the Pro- tection of Presidents, Vice Presidents, Forme r Presidents, and others\u2014As aresult of publicit y regarding Federal expenditures on the Presi- dent's two residences, we received letters fro m Members of Congress and others expressing a common concern about the magnitude of th e total reported expenditures, and with respect t o specific expenditures, questioning whether th e work performe d \u2014related to the protection of the President . \u2014provided a nonprotective benefit to th e President . Werecommended that the Congress enact legis- lation along the following lines : \u2014Appropriations for expenditures at privat e residences for protective purposes should be made tothe Secret Service, and no othe r funds should be available forthat purpose . -The accounting system of the Secret Servic e should require that expenditures at privat e residences for protective purposes b e authorized by the ;Director or Deputy Di - rector of the Service and that all costs fo r this purpose besegregated and accumulate d ona current basis . -The Secret Service should make an annua l public report tothe Congress showing in as much detail as security will allow expendi- tures made on private residences for pro- tective purposes . -The report made bythe Secret Servic e should be subject to audit by GAO an d GAO should be given complete access to al l records, files, and documents supportin g expenditures made by the Service . -Appropriations for expenditures at privat e residences of the President, not of a pro- tective nature, should be made to the Whit e House . The White House should account fo r any such expenditures and make an annua l report to the Congress, subject to audit b y GAO in the same manner suggested abov e for expenditures by the Secret Service fo r protective purposes . (Protection of th e President at Key Biscayne and Sa n Clemente, B-155950, Dec . 18, 1973 .) These recommendations are for consideratio n by the following committees : Senate : Government Operation s House :Government Operation s Real Property Exchanges-The Federal Prop- erty and Administrative Services Act of 194 9 and the Public Buildings Act of 1959 authoriz e the General Services Administration to exchang e Government-owned property . Property exchanges are negotiated on th e basis of appraised fair market value . However , appraised values do not assure that the Govern- ment is receiving the highest value becaus e participation in an exchange is'limited to on e individual .:In some cases former Governmen t property wassold, shortly after an exchange, a t prices much higher than the appraised value a t which it had been exchanged . Under competitiv e bidding the Government would have more as- surance of receiving the highest, value for exces s property than it hastinder negotiated exchange s based on appraised =fair market value .APPENDIX 3 To give all interested parties an opportunit y to acquire excess Government property inex- changes, we recommended that the Congres s amend the Federal Property and Administrativ e Services Act of 1949 to permit GSA to offe r such property at competitive bid and to deposi t the cash proceeds into a building fund to b e used, subject to annual appropriation acts, t o acquire public building sites . We also recommended that the Congres s amend the Public Buildings Act of 1959 t o eliminate the provisions authorizing the acqui- sition of property by the exchange method . (Changes in Law Recommended to Enable GS A to be More Effective in Selling Excess Propertie s and inAcquiring Public Building Sites , B-165511, Feb . 15, 1974 ) These recommendations are for consideratio n by the following committees : Senate : Public Work s House : Public Work s Access to Records-Federal Deposit Insuranc e Corporation-As in previous years, we wer e unable to make a complete audit of FDI C because it would not permit unrestricted acces s to examination reports, files, and other record s relative to the banks it insures . Without suc h access, we were unable to express an overal l opinion on FDIC's financial statements . FDI C believes that the basic concept of confi - dentiality, regarding open bank data, is essentia l to the proper supervision of banks and to th e functioning of deposit insurance . In order that we may effectively carry out ou r audit responsibility, we recommended that th e Congress amend the Federal Deposit Insuranc e Act to clarify our authority to have access t o examination reports, files, and other records o f FDIC, the Federal Reserve banks, and th e Comptroller of the Currency on insured banks . (Audit of Federal Deposit Insurance Corpo- ration for the Year Ended June 30, 1973 , Limited by Agency Restriction on Access Lo Bank Examination Records, B-114831, May 23 , 1974 ) This recommendation is for consideratio n by the following committees : Senate : Banking, Housing, and Urban Affair s House : Banking and Currenc y Need to Reduce Number of Reports Sub- mitted to the Congress by the Executiv e 193 APPENDIX 9 Branch\u2014Our study of the usefulness of r\u20ac-furrin g reports submitted\" to theCongress by executiv e departments and agencies, requested by th e House Committee onGovernment Operations , identified . -747 recurring reports submitted to th e Congress by the executive departments an d agencies (544 required by statute and 20 3 initiated by committees and Members o f Congress) . -54 reports nolonger needed by the Congres s including 30 statutory reports and ~ 2 4 nonstatutory reports . We recommended improvement action on 2 5 reports, . 21 required by statute and 4 non - statutory reports, and identified 102 additiona l reports -that offer potential for further elimi- nation 'and/or improvements . We advised th e Committee that we would perform the require d followup action on these reports . We recommended that the Committee intro - duce legislation to change the statutory re - porting requirements identified in Appendix I V of the report . (Usefulness to the Congress o f Reports Submitted by the Executive Branch , B-115398, Oct. 26, 1973 .) On November 5, 1973, we provided th e Committee draft legislation which would effec t the required statutory changes in reportin g requirements . The Committee reported out H .R. 14718 on July 24, 1974, implementing ou r recommendation and the bill passed the Hous e on August 5, 19 74 .

Government under seven programs . The systems for ;providing health services in these health centers did not provide a District - wide coordinated' approach and noone organi- zation had 'authority over all centers. Con - 194sequently, each of the nonprofit organization sand the District planned individually for th e location of health centers, resulting in (1) a n imbalance in the locations of the outpatient r health centers, (2) some areas providing more 1 health care capability than residents wer e seeking, and (3) a lack in other areas 01 - sufficient health care . We suggested that the Congress conside r whether categorical Federal grants for healt h may lessen the opportunity for localities t o develop an effective comprehensive action pla n for delivering outpatient health services . Th e Chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor an d Social Services, House D . C. Committee, has thi s matter under consideration .

The act also requires that an emergency temporary standard be superseded b y a comprehensive permanent standard in 6 months . We reported to the Chairman, Senate Com- mittee on Labor and Public Welfare, that agenc y officials stated that, except in a few cases, it wa s virtually impossible to develop and issue a comprehensive recommended standard withi n the required 6 months . We stated that th e Committee should `consider asking Congress t o amend section 6(c)(3) of the act to allow th e Secretary of Labor more time to issue a compre- hensive permanent standard after issuing a n emergency standard .

The en- rollees covered under both plans receive reduce d benefits under the health' benefits program whil e the others derive the full benefits of the pro- grarn . We recommended that the Congress conside r including the retired Federal benefits progra m ender the provisions of section 210 of Publi c Law 92-603, which requires that Federal em- ployees and retirees, eligible for both the Feder - al health benefits program and Medicare, b e provided supplemental coverage or reduced pre- miums ; because of the overlap between the tw o programs .

This recommendation is for consideratio n by the following committees : Senate : Labor and Public Welfar e House : Education and Labo r Questionable Need for Federal Loans and Scholarships to Health Profession s Students\u2014The Congress created the Health Pro- fessions Student Assistance Program to partiall y alleviate expected shortages of certain healt h professionals, improve the quality of healt h professions students, encourage practice i n shortage areas, and increase the proportion o f students from low-income families . Our repor t on the effectiveness of that program describe d why those objectives were notbeing met . The program's appropriation authority ex- pired June 30, 1974 . We recommended that th e Congress consider whether the program's goal s could better be accomplished through othe r existing Federal programs . We recommended that, if the program i s continued, the Congress consider : \u2014Whether its goals could be served as well i f scholarship funds were added to loan fund s and the scholarships eliminated . \u2014The necessity of continuing to provide loan s at interest rates lower than those availabl e to the Government in view of the very hig h earning potential of medical and denta l school graduates . \u2014Whether the goal of increasing the numbe r of health professions students from low - income families could be better served if th e program was directed to a specifically de - fined income group . \u2014The need for providing overall coordinatio n of the various Federal programs providin g aid to health professions students .

The Department i s responsible for complying with th e Anti-Deficiency Act (31 USC 665) for each fun d source . Our review showed that legislation is neede d to simplify-the Federal funding of administrativ e expenses of State agencies, estimated at $ 1 billion for fiscal year 1974 . Without this legis- lation the Department is faced with the dilemm a of either (1) requiring that State agencies cor- rectly report the use of funds and run the risk o f violating the Anti-Deficiency Act for particula r fund sources or (2) allowing the State agencie s to incorrectly report fund usages to avoi d recording and disclosing violations . We recommended that the Secretary of Labo r request and the Congress consider legislation t o simplify the funding of administrative expense s for State employment security agencies . We suggested several alternatives to accomplish thi s objective : \u2014Limit the Department's responsibility unde r the Anti-Deficiency Act to total fund s available to State agency administratio n instead of each available fund source . \u2014Establish an administrative operations fund . \u2014:Provide one appropriation for all Stat e agency administrative expenses . \u2014Provide some other type of joint funding .

Another 2 o r 3 days passed, after claims were approved , before compensation checks were mailed to th e employees . We recommended that the Congress conside r legislation that would reduce the lag in com- pensation payments .

Problems have occurred inthe development an d testing of the sensors . Wesuggested that, because of the importan t role which the sensors play in the effectivenes s of the aircraft and the inherent limitations o f current sensor systems against high-performanc e nuclear submarines ; the Congress might want t o question whether the Department of Defens e was placing `sufficient emphasis onthe develop- ment of needed `sensor capabilities in com- parison with the production of the new antisub- marine warfare aircraft .

That law amended the Public Build- ings Act of 1959 to require congressional ap- proval of all leases greater than $500,000 a year .

We reported to the Chairmen, Senat e and House Armed Services Committees, tha t military compensation adjustments made unde r this law, and other related legislation, have no t achieved the intended objectives but have, in- stead, caused certain inequities . We recommended that the Congress charg e the method of determining military pay in- creases . We noted that the Department o f Defense had proposed one alternative metho d and another had been suggested by the Brook- ings Institution . We stated that, although eithe r method would correct the most significant pay adjustment problems, we preferred the latte r method, called the equal percentage method , because of its simplicity and ease of adminis- tration .

We testified before the House Governmen t Operations Subcommittee on Legislation and Military Operations on House bill 14494, a bil l to raise the ceiling on small purchases t o $10,000 . Senate bill 3311 was passed by th e Congress in lieu of House bill 14494 and onJuly 25, 1974, this provision was signed by th e President, Public Law 93-3356 .

We identifie d $18 million in expenses connected with th e ships transferred under this authority for whic h we believe the Navy should have been at leas t partially reimbursed . Defense Department presentation document s to the Con gressshow little or no information o n ship transfers ; therefore, these costs are no t apparent to interested' congressional committees . We suggested that the Congress require th e Defense Department's annual presentation docu- ments to show all costs associated with transfer s of Naval vessels to foreign countries . (How Shi p Transfers to Other Countries Are Financed , B-163472, June 25, 1974 .) This recommendation isfor consideratio n by the following committees : Senate : Foreign Relation s House : Foreign :affair s U.S..Military assistance toKorea\u2014Based o n ourreview of fthe effectiveness of U .S. securit y assistance activities inKorea, we made certai n suggestions to the Congress for improving th e ecornorny and effectiveness of the program . The specific suggestions carry a security classifi- cation . (U .-S. Security Assistance to Korea : Ac- complishments and Constraints, B-164264, Jul y 1, 1974 .) - The recommendations are for consideratio n by the following committees : Senate :Foreign Relation s Appropriation s House :Foreign Affair s Appropriation s Changes inProcurement Instructions are Needed-The Department of Defense negotiate s contracts worth billions ofdollars annually . Because its buying `system istied to legislation , certain administrative costs associated with pro- curement cannot be reduced without con- gr_-ssional action . The Commission on Govern- rncnt Procurement recognized that changes wer e 193 water quality sufficient forprotecting aquati clife and for recreation by 1983 will require, an ;Ulibitio zs research and demonstration progra m within arelatively short period of time . At, th e current funding levels for water pollution re - search, it is 'doubtful that these goals will b e achieved within the time period established . We therefore recommended that the Congress con- sider the current and planned funding levels fo r water pollution R&D in relation to the researc h needed to determine if increased funding i s warranted . The 1972 amendments established a co m mission` (the National Commission on Wate rQuality) to study the technological aspects o f achieving the effluent limitations and goals se t forth for 1983, as well as all aspects of the economic, social, and environmental effects o f ;achieving or not achieving these limitations an d goals . The Commission isrequired to report t o the Congress by October 1975 We recom- mended_ that, if the Congress `finds it necessar y asa result of the Commission's study to reasses s andrevise legislative goals, the Congress deter - mine the direction ofFederal research pro- grams \u2014interms of priorities and fundin g levels\u2014to meet the revised goals . The Environmental Protection Agency relie s onindustry's ;voluntary release of informatio n can its research efforts` and results in decidin g which 'research water pollution projects to pur- sue. We became aware of some reluctance b y industry to provide such information . Because a free and full' exchange of such in- formation\u2014under proper safeguards to avoi d public disclosu re of proprietary information an d under assurances that such disclosure will no t adversely affect the industry's pollution contro l program\u2014should be of mutual benefit an d should help avoid unnecessary duplication, w e suggested that the Congress may wish to explor e with EPA and industry whether current pro- cedures for exchange of such information can b e strengthened . (Research andDemonstration Pro - grams to Achieve Water Quality Goals: Wha t the Federal Government Needs to Do , B-166506, Jan . 16, 1974 .) These recommendations are for consideratio n by the following committees : Senate : Public Work s House : Public WorksAPPENDIX 1 Need to Amend Law to Give the Atomi c Energy Commission the .:. fhority to Predeter - mine the Trustworthiness ofDrivers and Guard s Transporting Special Nuclear Aaterial-In the absence of a Government-operated orGovern- ment-controlled system for transporting specia l nuclear material, AEC's lack of specific authori- ty to predetermine the trustworthiness of trans - port drivers and escorting guards is a weakness in the system for protecting such materials fro m loss or diversion . We recommended that th e joint Committee on Atomic Energy conside r amending the Atomic Energy Act to give AE C the authority to predetermine the trustwor - thiness of vehicle drivers and escorting guards . This authority would provide AEC with what i t considers a principal element for safeguardin g special nuclear material in-transit . (Protectin g Special Nuclear Material In-Transit : Improve- ments Made and Existing Problems, B-164105 , Apr. 12, 1974 .) This recommendation is for consideration by : Joint Committee on Atomi_ :nerg y Actions Taken by Congres s on Legislative Recommendation s General Governmen t Recovery From Disability Retirements\u2014Th e District of Columbia Police and Firemen's Re- tirement and Relief System provides that i f disabled retirees under 50 years of age recove r from their disabilities, annuities will cease 1 yea r from the dates of the medical examinations . Although medical examinations are also require d for retirees over 50years of age who ar e employed, the law is silent concerning wha t action is to be taken if th-be retirees ar e determined to be no longer disabled . In a report to Congressman Thomas M . Rees , we suggested that, if it is desired that employe d retirees age 50 or older who are medically fit b e removed from the retirement rolls, the law b e changed to specifically provide the District wit h such authority .

We recommended tothe Committee that the projec t grants would have to be extended beyond th e June 30, 1972, date to achieve an orderl y transition toward' the termination of thes e Q7ants . Public Law 92-345, approved July 10, 1972 , extended the termination date to June 30, 1973 . Subsequently, the Congress enacted Public La w 93-53, approved July 1, 1973 , ,extending thetermination date forspecial project grants t o .June 30, 1974, and providing financial relief fo r those States which would have experience d adverse effects under the ori gin.d terminatio n provisions of title V .

On October 30, 1973, Public Law 93-143 wa s signed by President Nixon . This law, providins ; fiscal year 1974 appropriations to independen t agencies authorized the Civil Service Com- mission to spend $641,000 oil itprogram t o locate former employees with balances in th e Fund and to settle their claims .

International Affairs and Financ e Establish Independent Review and Evaluatio n Systems in the International Developmen t Organizations\u2014During the past several years w e have made recommendations in several of our ` reports and testimony before various con- gressional committees to obtain legislatio n which would assist' in establishing independen t review and evaluation systems in these organi- zations . 200 IntheForeign Assistance Act of 1973 (Publi c Law 93-189)dated December 17, 1973) Con- gress , enacted legislation which required th e President, acting through the U .S. representa- tives to the World' Bank Group, the Asia n Development Bank, and the United Nation s System, to propose the establishment of a n independent . review program in each of th e organizations . The lawalso required that state- ments of auditing and reporting standards b e prepared by the Comptroller General of th e United States and presented for the consider- ation of the organizations' governing bodies t o assist in formulating terms of reference for th e independent review system . (See Nondollar Ac- complishments Attributable to the Work o f GAO, app.3.) Legislation to Require Annual Reporting b y the Secretary ofState tothe Congress\u2014In our report tothe Congress ondeveloping countries ' external debt and U.S. foreign assistance , (f3-177988, May 11, 1973) we stated the Con- gress may wish as aprerequisite in order to hav e essential information, consider , legislation t o require comprehensive imnual reporting by th e SccretarY of State, to be submitted in Januar y of cacti year and be available to the committee s ofthe Congress intheir considerations of au- thorization and appropriation proposals .

Restatement o f Prior Fears Recommendation s Conimwce andTransportatio n Transfer tothe Department of Transportatio n Responsibility or 'Inspecting Radios on Com -APPENDIX 1 pulsorily Equipped Ships\u2014To provide for safet y of life at sea, the Communications Act of 1934, > as amended, and international agreements re- quire that a radio be installed oncertain classe s of 'ships and that the radios beinspecte d annually . Responsibility for inspecting the radios was vested in the Federal Communi- cations Commission by a 1937 amendment to the Communications Act . Inspections of ship radios, regardless of ho w important they may be from a safety stand - point, simply have no relationship to FCC 's primary responsibility for maximizing the use o f the radio spectrum . The Department of Transportation is re- sponsible for developing national transportatio n policies and programs, including safety program s for all modes of transportation . We believe tha t the transfer of responsibility for ship radi o inspections to the Department of Transportatio n would be consistent with its safety responsi- bilities . We therefore recommended that th e Congress amend the Communications Act o f 1934 to transfer to the Department responsi- bility for inspecting radios on ships . (Funda- mental Changes Needed to Achieve Effectiv e Enforcement of Radio Communication Regula- tions, B-159895, Nov . 3, 1972 .) This recommendation is for consideratio n by the following committees : Senate : Commerc e House : Interstate and Foreign Commerc e Community Development and Housin g Establishment of an Appropriate :Minimu m Rental Rate for Occupancy of Federally Sub- sidized Housing\u2014The Department of Housin g and Urban Development had not established a minimum rental rate for occupancy of th e federally subsidized housing projects provide d under section 221 of the National Housing Act , although other housing programs more recentl y enacted by the Congress required a minimu m contribution of 25 percent of family income . t>'e stated that it was inequitable for IIUl) t o provide section 221 housing assistance withou t requiring a minimum percentage-of-incr,mc con- tribution because the Congress had deemed a . minimum contribution appropriate for as- sistance under programs for generally lowc- r income families . 201 APPENDIX 1 The Secretary of HUD expressed the vie w that, although there had been ample oppor- tunities since the enactment of the section 22 1 below-market-interest-rate program in1961, th e Congress had chosen not to amend the legis- lation to include such a requirement . In view o f the large percentage of families that were contri- bating less than 25 percent of their income fo r section 221 housing, we suggested that th e Congress consider whether HUD should establis h an appropriate percentage-of-income contri- bution as the minimum rent to be required . (Tighter Control Needed on Occupancy o f Federally Subsidized Housing, B-114860, Jan . 20, 1971 ) This recommendation is for consideratio n by the following committees : Senate : Banking, Housing and Urban Affair s House : Banking and Currenc y Admission toLow-Rent Public Housing\u2014Th e Department of Housing and Urban Developmen t assists local housing authorities in purchasin g privately owned `dwellings for rental to low - income families . As of June 30, 1971, HUD ha d assisted in the purchase of standard housin g units requiring little or no rehabilitation to b e used as low-rent housing at an estimated cost o f about $235 million . Many of the occupants of the acquire d housing units had ` previously lived in standar d housing, and many had incomes exceeding thos e set for public housing eligibility .Wesuggeste d that the Congress consider requiring loca l housing 'authorities to give preference for ad - mission to public housing to occupants o f private substandard housing .

This recommendation is for consideratio n by the following committees : Senate : Banking, ; Housing and Urban Affair s House : Banking and Currenc y Benefits from Federal Outdoor Recreatio n Grants\u2014Among the reasons why recreation pro- ject grant programs of the Departments of th e Interior and Housing and Urban Developmen t programs had not been more successful i n meeting urban recreation needs was that th e Langand Water Conservation Fund Act (1 ) required that 40 percent of Federal grant fund s 202 'be apportioned equally to all States and (2)limited the apportionment to anyState to 7 percent of the funds available to all States . Also , low-income, densely populated communitie swhich need additional recreation facilities ha dnot applied for grants in many cases becaus e they lacked the required 50-percent local match- ing funds . Interior had proposed legislation which woul d revise the allocation formula by increasing ap- portionments to the more populous States . Because we believed that the proposed legis- lation had merit, we recommended that th e Congress amend the Land and Water Conser- vation Fund Act to revise the allocation formu- la. We recommended also that the Congres s consider amending the applicable laws to pro - vide for a flexible matching formula to allow th e Bureau of Outdoor Recreation and HUD to tak e grants of more or less than 50 percent on th e basis of financial needs . (Greater Benefits t o More People Possible by Better Uses of Federa l Outdoor Recreation Grants, B-176823, Oct . 5, 1972 .)

When a borrower de - faults on a HUD-insured or VA-guaranteed loan , the loan is terminated and the property i s generally conveyed by the lender to HUD or t o VA in exchange for insurance or guarant y payments . The power-of-sale method of foreclosure au- thorized by statutes in 26 States and the Distric t of Columbia is generaliy less costly and less tim e consuming than the judicial and other method s of foreclosure authorized in the other 24 States ' statutes . We recommended that the Congres s enact legislation which would establish a Federa l power-of-sale foreclosure law for all federall y financed, insured, or guaranteed home mort- gages .

HUD' s monthly payments include premium charges fo r mortgage insurance provided under the pro - grams . The mortgagees repay the accumulate d premiums to HUD annually . We proposed that HUD deduct the mortgag e insurance premiums from the monthly assistanc e payments `sothat the Government would sav e interest costs on the monthly assistance pay- ments `. HUD disagreed, stating that any saving s which would result would be offset by the cos t of the additional work necessary to implemen t the proposal . As an alternative method, whic h would eliminate any additional administrativ e costs, we recommended that the Congress au- therize HUD towaive the mortgage insuranc e premiums forthe sections 235 and 236 pro - grams .

Contractors who fail to submit filings, submit inadequate filings, orsub- mit there late are not penalized, and the act pro- vides no penalty for late filings . 203 APPENDIX t Because of the large number of delina3ren t filings, we recommended that the Congres s amend the act to provide penalties for failure to file as required by the act . The Board' has experienced problems in ob- taining accurate and complete information fro m contractors .

Of the several sales exemptions inthe act, ou r review -indicated that substantial sales wer e escaping renegotiation under the exemptions fo r (I ) standard commercial articles and services an d (2) new, durable productive equipment .

This recommendation is for consideration b y the following committees : Senate : Foreign Relation s House : Foreign Affair s National Resources and Environmen t Leasing of Federal Lands for Development o f Oiland GasResources\u2014The Department of th e Interior had granted most of the leases for devel- oping oil and gas resources on Federal lands non - competitively and, in many cases, at prices les s than their indicated fair market value becaus e the law required that lands outside the bound- aries of aknown geological structure of aAPPENDIX t of 1930 to prohibit drawback payments fo r products exported under AID programs .

This recommendation is for consideration b y thefollowing committees : Senate : Financ e House : Ways and Mean s U.S.Agreements with Free World Forces i n Southeast Asia\u2014In this review we found no evi- dcnce that the Congress, which is responsible fo r establishing levels of Federal spending, wa s notified or advised before the executive branc h entered into specific agreements with foreig n governments obligating the United States t o incur substantial expenditures . During our review, legislation was enacte d which should help in correcting this situation . Public Law 92-403, dated August 22, 1972, re - quires the Secretary of State to transmit to th e Congress any international agreement no late r than 60 da ysafter the agreement has entere d into forcer However, the Secretary may not con- sider most of the subordinate and implementin g agreements referred toin our report to be sub- ject to the requirements of Public Law 92-403 , because reporting of the parent agreemen t would suffice .

Also, the statutory right o f lessees to sublease in units as small as 40 acre s apparently had impeded rather than induced th e development of oil and gas resources .

Thes e restrictions created problems in protecting andAPPENDIX 1 preserving the areas and resulted in additiona l costs . The use of motorized equipment is not com- patible with an ideal wilderness concept, bu t neither is the construction of facilities and th e presence of litter in wilderness areas . In decidin g when to use motorized equipment once deci- sions have been made to construct facilities an d dispose of accumulated litter ; economy and con - venience should be considered along with other - factors . Because the agencies believed that thei r restrictions were consistent with the intent o f the Wilderness Act of 1964, we recommende d that the Congress consider providing furthe r legislative guidance on the use of motorize d equipment in these areas .

Some of the incomplete pro- jects were authorized in 1944 . The major causes of the terminations an d delays were the failures or delays by local spon- sors to acquire land rights needed for the pro- jects . The failures and delays caused expendi- tures of Federal, State, and local funds in projects that may never be completed, signifi- cant increases in project costs, and long delays i n realizing project benefits . We suggested alternative actions, includin g possible legislation, for the Congress to conside r for the delayed projects.

Actions are taken to eliminate unnecessary expenditures or t o otherwise correct deficiencies identified in GAO's audit reports, but the amount of savings directl y attributable to the work ofGAO cannot be fully or readily measured . Army Combat Service Support System/.null trolled equipment . The Department agreed wit h our recommendation that improved plannin g The Army has been trying for several years t o develop anautomated system for personnel , supply, and maintenance functions for comba t units .Our continuing review of this system , called the Combat Service Support System , disclosed it is still not workable . The syste m was unable to handle the required workload, wa s not responsive to user's needs, was not teste d under a reasonable range of expected conditions , and did not meet the prescribed objectives fo r improved' combat support . These problems wer e primarily attributable to the design of th e system software, especially in the supplysubsys- tem, and the configuration of computer equip- ment . We recommended that the Army, in view o f the problems encountered, reevaluate the need s for a combat support system and redefine it s requirements, particularly for the logistics func- tions .The system should then be designed t o meet those requirements and tested to insur e that it does . In response to our recommendation, th e Army formed a logistics evaluation group t o review their needs and revised their plans accord - ingly . The procurement costs included in th e current plan are estimated to be $84 .9 millio n lower than the costs inthe original plan . Numerically Contro4ed Equipmen t Numerically controlled equipment is expen- sive and complex but offers tremendous produc- tivity increases and savings inindustrial opera- tions . In 1973 the Department of Defens e owned $300 million worth of numerically con -and management of this equipment isneeded t o achieve maximum benefits .The Departmen t plans to establish a tri-service coordinating grou p to review existing guidelines, develop neede d improvements in managing its use in defens e production, and devote attention to equipmen t and software standardization . Improved Handtool Procedure s Purchases by the Department of Defense i n calendar year 1972 for handtool requirement s approximated $25 million . Based on our recom- mendations, the military services began a pro - gram to replace individual tool kits with large r centrally located composite tool kits . This wil l eventually reduce the number of tools and too l kits needed bythe services, will decrease too l losses, and will help decrease equipment damage . An Air Force Logistics Command study ha s found that using composite tool kits coul d reduce handtool and toolbox requirements by a s much as 60 and 80 percent, respectively . Military Packagin g In our review of military packaging we con- cluded that significant savings were attainable i f the Department of Defense 's activities discontin- ued blanket assignment of highest protection an d packaging against the most severe conditio n known and anticipated . During fiscal year 1971 , the Department purchased an estimated $13 .4 billion worth of material subject to packaging . Though no overall averages were available, indus - try comments suggested that packaging cost s 214 APPENDIX 2 Disposal of Surplus Clothin g Department of Defense policy required al l distinctive type military uniforms and clothing ' to be mutilated or dyed prior to sale . Thi s resulted in destroying millions of pounds o f valuable clothing . For example, one depot muti- lated clothing valued at mo . than $2 millio n and received less than $50,000 from its sale . The Department agreed with our recommendatio n that these items be sold without mutilation o r dyeing after distinctive insignias, etc ., have bee n removed . Material that was formerly sold a s scrap is now being sold as usable clothing . Redistribution of Excess Production Equipmen tcould average as much .as10 percent o f procurements . We suggested that greater use b e made of commercial packaging when it meet s Government requirements . The Department re- vised its packaging guidelines accordingly, and a recent survey of contractors indicated that mos t Department buyers' were complying . Coffee 'Procuremen t The average coffee consumer is not sensitiv e to adjustments in blends of coffee . Since price s of different types of coffee beans vary, commer- cial coffee roasters found that they coul d modify their blends to take advantage of marke t fluctuations .Wesuggested to the Department o f Defense that it accept this practice and develo p alternative blends for the military services .A single blend hasbeen used since about 1950 . We estimated possible savings of $1 .7 million annu- ally.The Department accepted our proposal . Revision in Navy's Should-Cost Polic y In May 1973 we pointed out that the Nav y had made only limited use of the should-cos t (industrial management review of contractor op- era\"~ons) approach although the Army and Ai r F'~y ce lied made a number of should-cost studie s and claimed substantial benefits in reducing con - tract prices innegotiation and identifying im- provements needed in contractors' operations . As a result, the Chief of `Naval Material issued a procurement policy statement to clarify Nav y policy onuseof should-cost studies in weapo n system acquisition . In our opinion the Navy's policy statemen t indicated a negative attitude should-cost studies , would not encourage greater use by Nav y contracting officials, and was not responsive t o our recommendation .' We then recommende d that the Secretary of Defense issue polic y guidance to insure consistent application of th e should-cost approach by all the military services . In March 1974 the Naval Material Comman d issued an instruction establishing a positiv e program forapplication of the should-cost ap- proach . Implementation of this program shoul d enable the Navy tonegotiate greater contrac t price reductions and result inimprovements i n contractors' operations .During 1972 we made four equipment us e studies at the San Antonio Air Materiel Are a (now the Air Logistics Center), and found tha t the equipment was idle 64 percent of prime shif t time. The low use indicated that Omor e equipment was onhand Lhan needed to mee t progr=amed workloads, and (2) equipment re- ductions were possible, especially involvin g machines capable of performing duplicate func - tions . In response to our recommendations to de- velop a program to accumulate actual equipmen t usage and to examine existing and propose d investments in equipment, by March 1973 th e depot had begun to install time meters to recor d usage and had identified 65 excess machine s valued at about $985,000 . By June 1973, 1 8 machines, valued at $257,000, had been claime d by other users and the other 47, valued a t $728,000, were being reported' and screened fo r possible use elsewhere . Reevaluation of theArmy's SAM-D Progra m In our February 1973 staff study of th e Army 's SAM-D surface-to-air missile program , we reported the postponement of certain signifi- cant tests . In a May 1973 report to the Congress , we suggested that the decision to defer testing o f critical components until a considerable expen- diture of funds had been made may be unju .ti- fied in light of past experience, and that a r ;r-- cost-effectiveness study may be needed due t o changes made to performance chara : ieristics an d quantities . APPENDIX 2 The Senate Appropriations Committee ; di- rected the Secretary ofDefense to conduct a cost-effectiveness study of the SA~iI-D program . In January 1974 the Deputy Secretary of Defense ordered a'reorientation of the SAM- D level-ipment effort continuation of only an aus - tore dcveiopment program, andademonstratio n of proof of the guidance concept by June 1975 . Reduction in Risk Associated with Navy' s Surface Effect Ship Progra m The Natty requested bids from their surfac e effect ship contractors for detailed design an d long-lead procurement of subsystems for a 2,200-ton ship even though test data from th e smaller surface effect ship (100 ton) was inade- quate in four major areas crucial to the desig n and construction of a larger ship . We recommended to the Secretary of Defens e that the Navy not be allowed to proceed int o detailed design of the 2,200-ton surface effec t ship until he reviewed the adequacy ofsolution s to problems disclosed by testing of the 100-to n ship . The -Deputy Secretary of Defense subse- q entiy directed the Navy to undertake a\"risk reduction\" program prior toproceeding into th e detailed design and long-lead procurement phas e of the program . The Navy issued new request s for proposal for this revised `statement of work . This action should reduce the risk ofsubstantia l cost overruns being incurred onthe 2,200-to n surface effect ship . Civil Service Commission to Administe r Radio Operator Examination for Federal Communications Commissio n The Federal Communications Commissio n spends aconsiderable amount of time in admin- istering examinations to applicants for radi o operator licenses . In cities where FCC does no t have a field office, the examinations are adminis- tered by its enforcement personnel . This is no t only time consuming but, because oflimite d travel funds, results in thetiming and location o f enforcemc ,it actions to coincide with the exam- ination schedule . Consequently, much of FCC' s enforcement manpower isineffectively used . 216In our November 3, 1972, report to th e Congress, we recommended that FCC arrange t o have the Civil Service Commission assume re- sponsibility for administering these examina- tions . In May 1974, we were informed that CSC would begin a6-month test program in99 examining centers which, if successful, would b e retained on a permanent basis .This would no t only improve the use of FCC's manpower bu t would benefit the public aswell because th e CSC has examination facilities inmore tha n 1,000 locations while the FCC has only 9 0 locations . Recovery of Assets for Whic h Accountability Had Bean Los t In May 1973, we observed that the America n Embassy, Vientiane, Laos had lost accounta- bility for items it had acquired from propert y disposal activities in Thailand quid Vietnam . Property accounting records had never bee n established for these items and the Embass y could not identify the value and amount o f properties received, on hand, those disposed of, or used . We recommended that a complete inventor y be conducted, accountability be established , new procedures for acquisition of excess prop- erty be issued and unneeded excess property b e returned to the property disposal yard . Air Force supply specialists conducted a complete inventory and reconstructed the rec- ords. Unneeded items were sent to thepropert y disposal unit for sale . As stocks were reduced t o a manageable level, inventory records and suppl y management procedures were established .New procedures Nvere used for the acquisition of ex- cess property . Property valued at about $200,00 0 was picked up onthe accountable records an d excess property with an acquisition cost of abou t $471,400 was sent to the property disposal unit for sale . These actions were completed b y 107 Q Funds inExcess ofNeeds Wer e Deobligated or Deauthorize d As of March 31, 1973, GAO identified 13 7 loans valued at $422 million which offere d potential for deobligation or deauthorization . These included loans (1)authorized but un- signed for .6months or more, (2) with no disbursements for 6 months or more after borrower met initial conditions, (3) -partiall y disbursed but with nodisbursements for 6 months or more, (4) with expired termina l disbursing authorization dates, and (5) wit h expired terminal disbursement dates . Our review indicated that opportunities ex- isted for the Agency for International Develop- ment- to release funds inthe pipeline and mak e these funds available for priority uses . Fund s made available for a particular purpose had bee n used and only residual amounts remained or th e purposes and priorities for which the funds wer e initially obligated no longer existed . AID has taken action todeobligate or deau- thorize funds amounting to at least $65 . 7 million .The release of these funds will ulti- mately provide fora better application of fund s even `though actual, dollar savings are not re - turned to the U . S. Treasury . Delayed Purchase of Foreign Currencie s In most countries the United States does no t own excess currencies and has to spend dollar s topurchase foreign currencies to meet require d needs .Our audit revealed that substantia l amounts of foreign currencies were purchased i n advance of operating need, and often held fo r years. Significant savings could have bee n realized by using currencies not needed fo r current operations . In our report tothe Congress (B-146749, Oct . 24, 1962), we recommended- that measures :be instituted to permit use of nonexcess foreig n currencies reserved for specific purposes and a dollar equivalent established for replacement o f these foreign currencies when needed . The Congress enacted Public Law 89-677 , dated October 15, 1966, authorizing the Treas- urytoestablish a_system similar to ourpropose d recommendation . From the inception of thi s system through June 1973, the Treasury ha s realized a net gain of about $22 .7million asa result of currency devaluations between th e borrowing date and the date the funds wer e replaced . In addition, significant interest saving s hav\u00b0 resulted and %rill continue toberealize d from the delay =edpurchase of these currencies .APPENDIX 2 Change in Method o f Computing Procurement Requiremen t In 1973 as a part of our examination of -the financial statements of Federal Prison Industries , Inc.,wenoted that the Federal Reformatory fo r Women at Alderson, West Virginia, had onorde r 193,000 yards of aspecial purpose fabric used in making garments . This represented aninvest- ment of $374,000 for material not usuall y stocked which also was excess to current need s when considering accumulated stock on hand o r on order under previous transactions involvin g the same fabric . There existed a possibility tha t the excess material might become obsolet e because the only customer was considerin g garments made from different fabrics . In line with our suggestions, reformator y officials agreed to strengthen procurement pro- cedures to consider on-hand or on-order quanti- ties in future requirement ordering . Althoug h the reformatory was unable to obtain a volun- tary cancellation of the excess material order, i t was able to generate new garment orders to us e the special purpose fabric . Increased Availability of Navy Manpowe r Since at least 1893, the Navy has grante d officers and certain enlisted personnel 4 days of ` proceed time in addition to authorized leave and travel time to arrange their personal affairs whil e enroute to a new duty station . About 40,00 0 Navy personnel, however, are transferred eac h year between ships or duty stations in the sam e locality . Many of these individuals have been routinely granted the 4days of' proceed tim e and in some cases an additional day of trave l time . Our tests at several ships and shore station s showed personnel offices were misinterpretin g Navy instructions or using different criteria t o establish proceed and travel time entitlement . Also, conflicting instructions had been issue d and different entitlements were being extende d to officers and enlisted personnel transferrin g under the same conditions . We recommended to the Navy in March 197 6 that local proceed and travel time policies b e reevaluated and clarified . The Bureau of Nava l Personnel issued revised instructions in May I97 4 to eliminate inequities between officer an d 217 APPENDIX 2 enlisted personnel andto. prohibit proceed an d travel time on , local transfers in the sam e metropolitan area unless the distance betwee n stations exceeded 25 miles . Proper implementa- tion of the revised instructions should result i n annual savings of upto 400 man-years . Reduction in Propose d \u00b0 Staffing Requirement s AtDistrict Correctional Facilitie s In response to a request from the Chairman , Senate Subcommittee on Appropriations for th e District of Columbia, we evaluated the personne l needs- for the District's correctional facilities . In its fiscal year 1974 budget submission tc th e Congress, the District requested 470 additiona l positions for its correctional system . We informally advised the Chairman tha t many of the positions requested by the Depart- ment of Corrections appeared to be in excess o f their needs . As ii result of the Senate Commit - tee's action onthe data weprovided, Congres s appropriated funds for 234 of the requested 47 0 positions . Improved Management o f Acquired Residential Propertie s By using open-end, bulk-bid contracts (whic h provide repairs and services on an as-neede d basis during specific periods at specific prices) , the Department of Housing and Urban Develop- ment and the Veterans Administration reduce d annual repair and service costs for propertie s acquired through defaults on insured mortgage s inJacksonville, Florida, by about $156,000 . However, this form of contracting had not bee n widely used inother areas of the country . In determining whether acquired properties shoul d be repaired forsale, the HUD Detroit office an d the VA Philadelphia office had used data tha t was either incomplete ornotbased on recen t experience and could not insure that their decisions would minimize losses or maximiz e gains indisposing of acquired properties . As we recommended, HUD issued revise d regulations to (1) require the use of bulk purchases of large quantities of supplies an d services procured under one contract from on e source, and (2) emphasize the need for curren t valid data on repair- costs, demolition costs , repaired sales prices, andvacant lotsales prices .Improved System o f Cost and Schedule- Contro l The Board of Directors ofthe Washingto n Metropolitan Area Transit Authority adopte d our recommendations concerning its system o f cost and schedule control .Asa result, futur e quarterly status reports willcontain comparison s between the original and complete current esti- mates of the cost of constructing the Washing - ton Regional Rapid Transit System--(METRO)-- - and the estimated completion date . The inclu- sion of these estimates in the reports will aler t the Board, the Federal Government, and partici- pating local governments of the need for provi d. ing additional funds or for considering whethe r alternatives were available . Continuation of Corps of Engineer s In Postal Construction Progra m In January 1973, the Office of Managemen t and Budget directed the Postal Service t o terminate all Corps of Engineers constructio n support including that given the bulk mai l facility construction program . The Service has projected that a fully imple . mented bulk mail program would result in $30 0 million in annual operational savings . Under th e Corps' construction schedule, 19 of the 2 1 planned bulk mail facilities would be 60- t o 95-percent complete as of June 30, 1974 . In a May 30, 1973, letter to the Postmaster General , we stated that removal of the Corps of Engineer s from the program woul d \u2014delay completion by 3 to 6 months , \u2014incur added costs resulting from a join t Corps/Postal Service management effort , \u2014result indisruption to numerous equipmen t deliveries to the bulk mail facilities, an d \u2014necessitate a reduction in force for abou t 350 Corps personnel . After in-house investigations, the Service con - cluded that removal of the Corps would dela y completion of the program at least 4-1/ 2 months--resulting in about $100 million in los t operational savings--and increase constructio n costs by about $20 million . Citing our letter and the in-house investi- gations the Postmaster General on June 20, 1973 , requested OMB to allow the Corps to complet e 218 construction of the bulk mail faci .iities .: Shortl y afterwards, OMB authorized extension of th e Corps' participation in the bulk mail progra m until its completion . \"Consolidation o f Certain Reserve Fleet Activitie s -In our report to the Congress on saving s available by consolidating certain reserve flee t - activities (B-168700 issued Nov . 18, 1971), w e recommended that the Secretary of Defense an d theSecretary of Commerce make arrangement s to have the Maritime Commission assume th e maintenance and preservation and relate d administrative functions for Navy's inactive ves- sels at Orange, Texas . By letter dated October 15, 1973, the Assis- tant Secretary of Defense, Ibistallations an d - Logistics, subsequently advised usthat the de- cision was made to change designation an d inission of the facility at Orange to the Inactiv e Ship Storage Facility . ANavy examination o f the facility showed that potential savings o f about $1 .2 million annually could be realized b y consolidating operations and streamlining th e organization . Navy officials told us further tha t reductions inpersonnel requirements and over - head costs resulted in reduced costs of $741,00 0 in fiscal year 19 74 . The estimated savings of $741,000 in fisca l year 1974 and $1 .2 million annually thereafte r are based on Navy' Department computations bu t the amounts` attributable to ourefforts are no t readil ymeasurable . Change inNational Science Foundation' s Travel Policy to Conform to Federa l Travel Regulation s In determining travel costs for certain Federa l emplo,,-ees from the Washington, D .C. area wh o attended the Oceans and National Economi c liecelopment Conference in Seattle, Washington , Nve noted that anofficial was permitted, i n accordance %Nithpolicy, totravel first modations . This policy did notconform to th e Federal travel regulations . We found that th e practice be, ,aninJuly 1970, when a forme r director had authorized the agency's directorateAPPENDIX 2 level personnel to travel first class asa matter o f routine . We brought this matter to the attention of th e agency and subsequently the practice was dis- continued . Procedures Corrected to Insur e Issuance of Rills for Medical Service s Rendered at . District of Columbia Hospital s We identified charges inexcess of $5 .9 millio n for medical services rendered at D . C. Genera l and Glenn Dale Hospitals because the compute r was programed not to print bills (1) withou t zip codes ($1 .3 million) or (2) where there was n o address in the payor block (persons responsibl e for patients bills) of the admittance form ($4 .6 million) . These charges covered the period fro m July 1966 through August 1973 and involve d about 8,000 patients' accounts . Part of thes e charges may eventually be paid through th e Medicaid Program . The Medical Collections Branch is responsibl e for billing patients for services rendered a t District health facilities . We suggested that i t mail the bills for services rendered at D .C. General and Glenn Dale Hospitals which had no t been mailed because of computer misprogram- ings . We were advised that all of the bills wer e mailed by May 1974 . A Task Force was also established to maximize reimbursement an d develop a comprehensive system of control an d accountability over patient accounts . The Tas k Force in a report dated April 1, 1974, ha d recommended a vast reorganization of billin g and collections activities to effect more efficien t and complete billing and collection of account s receivable . AMTRAK to Rase Compensation fo r Passenger Train Operations o n Quality of Service Provide d In a report to the Subcommittee on Transpor- tation and Aeronautics, House Committee o n Interstate and Foreign Commerce issued Decem- ber 28, 1973, we said that contracts wit h railroads for passenger train operations neede d to be amended to include reasonable, definitive , and enforceable on-time performance standard s 219 APPENDIX Z and to clearly fix the responsibilities ofcontract- ing parties .Inline with our findings, AMTRA K negotiated a new arrangement with the larges t operating railroad (Perm Central) which include d provisions for incenti-es and penalties in deter - mining the amount of compensation payable . Al`ITRAK said that our report reinforced it s position and gave added impetus to its negotia- tions with therailroads . Policy to avoid Payment of Severance Allowances t o Employees Eligible fo r Immediate Retirement Annuitie s In August 1973 we reported to the Secretar y of Defense that U .S. bases in the Philippines wer e inviting Filipino employees who were eligible t o receive immediate` civil service retirement annui - ties to volunteer to be involuntarily separated . Under the terms of the labor agreement betwee n the Governments of the United States and th e Philippine Islands, all employees who wer e imroluntarily separated (except for cause) re- ceived a severance allowance . Accordingly, thos e who were also eligible to receive an immediat e civil service annuity received both . In 1971 ,-317 employees who were eligible fo r immediate annuities were separated . Of these , 312 (98 percent) were paid severance allowance s totaling $386,000 . Ifthispractice continued, we estimated, DOD would eventually be required t o pay an additional $1` million inseverance allow- ances to employees who would also receiv e immediate annuities . We recommended that action be taken t o discontinue thepayment of severance allow- ances to employees entitled to immediate annui- ties because, in our opinion, the purpose of th e allowances is to sustain employees while the y seek other employment . The military commander in the Philippine s instructed U .S. bases,, whenever possible, not t o let` employees who are eligible for immediat e annuities to become involuntarily separated .This action should reduce the number an damount' of severance payments made toemploy - ees who are eligible for annuities at the time ofseparation . Funds Allocated toSpewrell Bluff Dam Transferred to Other _Project s The Corps of Engineers, Department of th e Army, did not have sufficient supporting data t o show that the environmental impact from th e planned construction of the Spewrell Bluff Da m in Georgia would or could be minimized o r mitigated . Further, project benefits were no t adequately supported to show that the claimed economic benefits could be realized . Environmental losses which could result fro m the project included (1) a unique river fishery , (2) bottom land hardwood supporting valuabl e wildlife habitat, (3) one of the few remainin g free-flowing rivers inGeorgia, and (4) severa l fish and wildlife species . Plans to mitigate thes e losses had not been made . A complete evaluation ofeconomic issue s could not be made because the Corps was revis- ing its estimates . The need forreservoir recrea- tion, one of the largest claimed project benefits , was questioned by State and Federal agencies . On October 1, 1973, acting primarily on ou r findings set forth in adraft report, submitted fo r comments, the Governor of Georgia expresse d opposition to the project . Because of the Gov- ernor's opposition, the Corps transferre d $2,140,000 to other Corps projects .Inthe even t the project is abandoned, the total -cost avoid- ance would be about $178 million . After ac- countin ; for reimbursable power costs of $6 9 million, the net savings to Federal and Stat e agencies would be about $109 million . Our review and action in disclosing objection - able features of the project substantially con- tributed to the Corps' action . However, the exac t amount of savings to Federal and State agencie s which might beattributable to our repor t cannot readily be determined . O/.null LL/.null ACCOMPLISHMENT S Some actions taken in response to GAO's recommendations result in benefits other than dolla r savings . The enactment of recommended legislation by the Congress, or the adoption of new agenc y regulations or procedures,' often results in improved day-to-day operations at Federal, State, and loca l levels . Sometimes the actions have adirect favorable affect on the well-being of individual citizens .

Improved Fund Allocation Syste m In response to recommendations in our repor t to the Congress, the Soil Conservation Service , Department of Agriculture, improved its syste m for allocating funds to the States under th e Great Plains Conservation Program and discon- tinued developing contracts for low-priorit y conservation work . This action should_ help assure that hig h priority isgiven to assisting landowners an d operators who apply for assistance ` in solvin g major soil erosion problems . Ways to Improve `Effectivenes s Of Rural Business Loan Program s In line our recommendations the Farmer s Home Administration, Department of Agricul- turc, incorporated in its regulations, whic h implement the business and industrial assistanc e programs authorized by the Rural Developmen t Pict of 1972, requirements for feasibility an d market studies, and credit analyses of loa n applicants . The regulations also permit th e Administration to evaluate a project's feasibilit y and loan `applicant's credit and to determin e whether the loan, together with other availabl e resources, appears adequate for the project . 'Plus action will help Farmers Home Adminis- tration to identify load applicants with suc h problems as weak management, inadequat e operating capital, or economically infeasibl e operations . 222Guidelines Issued to Improve Managemen t Of Health Research Equipmen t At National Institutes of Health grantee insti- tutions visited during our audit, we noted man y cases where health research equipment wa s unnecessarily purchased and other cases wher e equipment was significantly underused . In response to our recommendations, th e agency issued guidelines instructing grante e officials to make adjustments in procedures t o insure that research equipment requirements ar e carefully evaluated, and that equipment onc e acquired, be maximally used . Strengthened Securit y At Postal Data Cente r Our survey at the St . Louis Postal Data Cente r identified weaknesses in the security at th e Center, including the need to (1) strengthe n controls to prevent unauthorized entry and (2 ) insure continuity of computer operations b y providing for off-site storage of duplicate files . The Assistant Postmaster General, Manage- ment Information Systems, advised usthat th e St. Louis Center, in response to our observa- tions, had taken several actions toimprov e security, including implementing a security plan , storing back-up files offsite, and initiating a review of the entire data security area . Better Internal Auditin g The internal auditors of the National Capita l Housing Authority, Washington, D .C., were pri- marily engaged inthe audit of cash . In view o f the varied activities of the Authority, we recom - mended that the internal audit staff be increase d and its coverage be expanded . By letter o f October 31, 1973, the Executive Director of th e Authority informed us that the staff had bee n increased and that avigorous internal auditin g plan wasunder way . Improved Medicare Subcontracting Practice s As a result of our recommendations, Socia l Security Administration initiated revisions to its instructions for carriers (organizations autho- rized by contract to make Medicare payment s for;,physicians 'services) and intermediarie s (organizations authorized to make payments t o hospitals) . The revised' instructions willprovid e that;potential offerors under proposed subcon- tracts of the carriers andintermediaries are to b e advised in writing of the criteria which willbe used to evaluate their proposals, including th e relative importance that will be given to eac h factor, particularly price orcost. This woul d allow the offerors to be more responsive to th e requirements of the Government and its contrac- tors. Highway Safet y As a result of GAO's recommendation to th e Congress, a law was passed setting aside fund s for highway safety improvement projects, result- ingina potential for reducing highway death s by 1,450 and injuries by 22,000 annually . Policy onReligious ; Teaching in School s Some schools under contract with the Over - seas Dependents Schools System of the Depart- ment of Defense include religious instruction a s a part of the education program . There is a possibility this compulsory religious training o f U.S. nationals may be in violation of the firs t amendment to the ;Constitution and raises a question 'concerning the validity of the use of appropriated funds as tuition ; payments to thes e religious affiliated schools . Werecommended to the Secretary of Defens e that an opinion- of the Attorney General b e secured as to the appropriateness of the con - tracts with such schools . On May 17, 1974, th e Department advised usthat asurvey of school s under contract disclosed alarger incidence o f optional and mandatory religious education tha n had been anticipated .' Consequently, the Offic e of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Man - power and Reserve Affairs) was directed t o develop a departmental policy regarding th e matter for dissemination to contracting officer s and incorporation indepartmental directives .APPENDIX 3 Improvements inNeighborhoo d Youth Corps Progra m On the basis of GAO's recommendations, th e Department of Labor adopted regulations an d guidelines aimed at improving the program . These included establishing goals formeasurin g project success ; reemphasizing the importance o f education, skill training, and work experience ; reemphasizing the need for employability plan s and assessment of enrollee needs being alert t o ineligible enrollees ; and reemphasizing the importance of adequate monitoring . Improved Homeownershi p Opportunities Progra m We reported on weaknesses in the Departmen t of Housing and Urban Development's Turnke y III program\u2014a program to enable low-incom e families to acquire homes under lease-purchas e agreements . The weaknesses included insuffi- cient demand, failure of many families to accep t homeownership responsibility, and inadequat e homeownership training . We recommended tha t the Department consider (1) discontinuing th e program or (2) strengthening the program t o insure that its objectives are achieved . Th e Secretary of HUD said that the Department; (1) has adopted regulations to overcome the prob- lems noted in our report and (2) will discontinu e funding additional Turnkey III projects, excep t on Indian Reservations . Improved Administrative Procedure s For Repair of House s HUD's District of Columbia area office, i n accordance with our suggestion, improved it s administrative procedures for the repair of exist- ing houses insured under the interest subsid y program . The area office established procedure s requiring the inspection of authorized repai r work, review of contract files by appropriat e officials before authorizing payment for repai rcontracts, and the documentation of procur e ment files to show the number of firms solicite d for repair contracts, 223 UENM X Greater Insurance Protection to Flood Prone Confnluni-tie s HUD's itilplementation ofour reconlnlenda - ti;. e National .loc>_d Illsilt :;nce Prdg~rain resulted i n insurance protection to flood pron e communities, In `accordance Nvith our recom - niendations .theDepartment notified most o f the coninnunities not participating in the pro - aran of file availability of flood insurance , contracted with private engineering firms t- o in<ke detailed flood plaid studies so participat - ing conitniunities could obtain insurance . bene - .its; notified com in in ,. i ties with deficient lan d use and control -measures of what they' roust d o to l i11un cttgible for the prograin and bega .

Regulation of Outer Continental Shel f Oil Production Operation s the Department of the Interior's Geologica l Survey is resporisible for inspecting and regulat- ing oil and gas operations on the Outer Contiu- ental Shelf . To enforce its regulations, th e Surve -leas relied principally on written waviiing s and, in theGulf Coast rcgicn, also on stoppin g operations .

Extensive use of our information durin g hearings was made to emphasize the need fo r changes invarious program areas evaluating th e Federal strategy to combat drug abuse, such a s (1) reductions in long-term training of profes- sionals and amount ofstipends paid, (2) chang e inthe direction ofresearch efforts to place les s emphasis onmarijuana and more emphasis o n narcotics, and (3) modification of the educatio n and training programs . Protection of Consumer s From Defective Pesticide s Inlinewith our recommendations for protect- ingconsumers from defective pesticides, th e Environmental Protection Agency started can- celling `registrations for pesticide found to b e ineffective . The agency also issued guideline s providing for the prompt public release o f information concerning its enforcement activi- ties. Improved Procedures for Controlling Grant s To Air Pollution Control Agencie s In line with our recommendations, the Ein-i- rotime nt al Protection Agency issued, i n February 1974, improved rules and regulation s for controlling program `grant assistance to ai r pollution control agencies . These regulation s require EPA regional administrators to annuall y evaluate each agencies' effectiveness inmeetin g objectives . Grant amounts may be reduced if th e evaluation shows that the grantee agencies hav e failed, or will fail, to achieve the objective s described in their approved programs . To th e extent' that grant amounts are reduced, addi- tional amounts %will be available for reallotmen t to other air pollution eontrol'agencies within th e region . .: Improved Adverse Drug Reactio n Reporting Wsteer i GAO's recommendation that the Food an d Drug Administration improve' its adverse dru g reaction reporting system resulted in more effec -APPENDIX 3 tive use of information to regulate drugs' . 'Th e agency has provided for additional adverse reac- tion reporting by Federal and private hospital s and is increasing its efforts to more 'effectivel y administer its controls in obtaining advers e reaction information . Greater Protection for Human s Participating in Testing of New Drug s As a result of GAO's recommendation, th e Food and Drug Administration has (1) provide d for increased efforts on the part of its medica l officers and (2) plans to make extensive change s toward more stringent regulations for protectio n of humans participating in the testing of investi- gational new drugs . Eliminating the Reuse o f Disposable Catheters and Guidewire s As a result of GAO's recommendations to th e Secretary of Defense and the Administrator o f Veterans Administration, both agencies hav e taken actions to assure that disposable catheter s and guidewires used in vascular studies woul d not be reused . There is evidence to indicate tha t the reuse of these devices could result i n increased potzntial for infections and ethe r health problems . Reduced Waiting Tim e For Clinical Appointment s At our suggestion, the y'A del eloped, tested ' and evaluated a pilot study for red .ucink th e length of time a veteran had to v,~ait to s~ :ea physician at an outpatient clinic . The stud , deemed successful and VA deve1r)ped th methodology- to implement a ccntr `iycd s ( duling system for veterans reel ing care at th e outpatient clinics for all VA hospitals . O Lun t 3, 1974, VA Central Offic eissued a d,r,ct v( -,t<J all toirnplf ;rnen t the system . Elimination of Transplant Uni t \\Ye 3 and locations of transplant centers needed an d discontinue existing services which cannot b e expected to meet VA workload criteria, partic- ularly at the Manhattan VA Hospital where only two transplants were performed over a 3-yea r period . As a result, VA withdrew funds for it s transplant program atthe Manhattan VA Hos- pital and advised usthat the hospital isno longe r considered a .part of the kidney transplan t program . Closing Supervoltage'Therapy Unit s We recommended that VA evaluate existin g supervoltage therapy units and decommissio n duplicative or underused facilities by (1) consoli- dating services at VA hospitals within metropol- itan areas and (2) closing underused service s when theservices are available atother Federa l or community hospitals in the area . Thi s resulted in VA taking action to close some o f these supervoltage therapy units and consolidat- ing others . Educational Benefit s Asaresultof our recommendations, VA ha s beguntopublish and distribute correspondenc e course cost and completion rate informatio n which should aid veterans in their decision s about home study training . VA Contract Settlement s As itresult ofour examination into irregular- ities involving ;aproposed multi-million dolla r claims settlement on aVA hospital constructio n contract, the Congress enacted legislation requir- ing an independent audit and approval` throug h the appropriations process of all VA contrac t settlements in excess of $1 million . 226Establishing Independent Revie w systems in International Organizations , During the past several years wehave mad e recommendations inreports and testimon y before congressional committees for legislatio n which would assist inestablishing independen t review and evaluation systems inthe interna- tional development organizations . In the Foreign' Assistance Act of 1973, th e Congress enacted `legislation which required th e President, acting thrc ugh the U .S. representa- tives to the World Bank Group, the Asia n Development Bank, and the United Nation s System, to propose the establishment of a n independent review program in each of th e organizations . The law also required that state- ments of auditing and reporting standards b e prepared by the Comptroller General of th e United States and presented for the considera- tion of the organizations 'governing bodies to assist in formulating terms ofreference forthe independent review system . (See Legislativ e Recommendations, Appendix l .) Developing Countries` External Deb t And U .S. Foreign Assistanc e Wereported that the Congress may wish to consider legislation requiring comprehensiv e reporting on developing countries' debts by th e Secretary of State inJanuary of each year fo r the committees of theCongress in their consid- erations of authorization and appropriation pro- posals . Such reporting will make availabl e current summary perspectives of theworldwid e dimensions of the debt burden problem, as wel l as the specifics of debt relief granted or pro - posed . Inthe Foreign Assistance Actof1973, the Congress enacted legislation which requires th e President to transmit to the Speaker of th e House of Representatives and to the Committe e on Foreign Relations of the Senate, not late r than January 31 of each year, a comprehensiv e report, based upon the latest data available, t o meet this need .
