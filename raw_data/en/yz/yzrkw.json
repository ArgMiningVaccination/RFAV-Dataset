The replay is yours, free with the purchase of Hormone Intelligence thru June! The Hormone Intelligence Chats Virtual Weekend Event Hormone shifts are natural. Suffering is not. In this book you'll learn to: Eat for Hormone Health Heal the Stress-Hormone Connection Reset Your Body Clock & Hormones Support the Gut-Hormone Connection Calm Inflammation, Improve Detoxification Nourish Your Ovaries Adrenals & Thyroid Implement Advanced Protocols that Target Your Symptoms Period pain. Endometriosis. PCOS. Fertility problems. Miserable menopause symptoms and more. None of these are just par for the course of being a woman and we shouldn't accept that they are as too often we're told to do. Nor should we accept over-medicalization in place of gentler, natural approaches to our hormonal health throughout our lives. We need a healthy \"new normal.\" Your cycles, hormones, and gynecologic health are your body's 6th Vital Sign-an innate set of signals that tell us much more about our health than we've ever been taught. You deserve more. You deserve better. You deserve to be heard, believed, and respected. To feel your best. And to believe in your phenomenal body again. Hormone Intelligence is the plan I've developed over thirty-five years of helping women to reclaim their hormones and feel like themselves again. It does this by providing you with the specific elements you need for hormone health, while removing the obstacles that get in the way: the chronic inflammation, toxins, stress, poor foods, and more that are the fires setting off your hormone alarm system. And it brings you the solutions you need to feel like the force of nature you really are. 3 Easy Steps to Get Your Book and Your Gifts Step 1 Order your copy of Hormone Intelligence Step 2 Use the button just below to upload a screenshot of proof of book purchase and to enter your details.

A personal note from Dr. Aviva Being a woman is not a diagnosis. Many women know the feeling - you enter your doctor's office with period problems, pain, or another hormonal or gynecologic concern and you're told it's 'just normal' for women to fee that way, to try some ibuprofen, take the Pill, or it's insinuated in some way that all in your head. I'm here to tell you that you should never have to 'just deal with it' and that while medication or surgery may sometimes be the right choice for you they are rarely the only answer for the most common problems women face. You can't make the best choices if you don't know all the options. Further, living at a fraction of your best because you're hijacked by your symptoms should not be your new normal, and what you're experiencing is not in your head. It is my joy to share the program I use in my practice, and to support you on your journey to getting curious about your body, your hormones, and the many ways you can feel more empowered. Don't walk away without the answers you deserve. Join the bestselling author who has already helped thousands of women reclaim their hormone health. More Praise for Dr. Aviva's Books "}
