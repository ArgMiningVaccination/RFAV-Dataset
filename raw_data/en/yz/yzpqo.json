Do not intentionally feed herbs to your pets without the advice/permission of a Veterinarian. 1) Basil is safe for cats. It is a bright and fragrant herb, and it's safe to keep if you have cats around, so if your sneaky cat pinches a piece, you won't need to panic. 2) Coriander is also safe for cats in addition to being super tasty. You can have it in the house without worrying about your feline friend. 3) Can cats eat rosemary? Yes they can, if they want to! Rosemary is a wonderful herb to have in the garden, especially when it's in bloom.

Herbs toxic to cats: *Be aware that this is typically in large amounts and mostly only causes an upset stomach. It's unlikely for your cat to willingly eat enough to get sick, so don't panic unless you notice that something is wrong or a lot has been eaten. 1) We get asked all the time, \"Is Oregano safe for cats?\". Oregano isn't something you want your cat to eat, but Rosemary, which is safe for cats, actually has a smell that repels them. Try putting your unsafe herbs next to some Rosemary to keep them from eating something they shouldn't. 2) Cats shouldn't eat chives so avoid putting chives and garlic chives within their reach. Since they are also a favourite herb, you could try putting them in a room with a lockable door or a place your cat isn't allowed to go. 3) Tarragon is not good for cats and isn't something they should eat. Since cats are great climbers and jumpers, it can be tricky to just keep these plants out of reach, but hanging baskets out in the garden might do the trick. 4) Can cats eat mint? No, mint isn't good for cats, so try to keep a close eye on your cat to make sure they aren't being sneaky, and to be extra safe, make sure you know the signs of [Mint poisoning](https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/toxic-and-non-toxic-plants/mint).
