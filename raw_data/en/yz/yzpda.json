Located in Boston's historic South End, BMC is the primary teaching hospital of the Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) and was created by the 1996 merger of Boston City Hospital (founded in 1855) and Boston University Medical Center Hospital (founded in 1864). BMC is the largest and busiest provider of trauma and emergency services, and the largest safety-net hospital, in New England. BMC provides a full spectrum of pediatric and adult care services, from primary care and family medicine to advanced surgical and medical specialty care. he Department of Surgery has a long, proud history with roots that extend back more than 150 years. In 1873, Boston University School of Medicine opened its doors, combining the New England Female Medical College with the medical staff of the Massachusetts Homeopathic Hospital. Dr. Israel T. Talbot was the first chairman of the Department of Surgery while also serving as the first dean of Boston University School of Medicine. The modern history of the Department of Surgery at Boston University dates to 1946, when Dr. Reginald H. Smithwick was recruited from Massachusetts General Hospital to serve as Surgeon-in-Chief and Chairman of Surgery at Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM). Dr. Smithwick served in those positions for nearly 20 years. Among the surgeons who have led and contributed to the international stature of the Department of Surgery throughout the ensuing decades are Drs. Richard Egdahl, John Mannick, Lester Williams,Peter Mozden, Robert Hobson, Edward Spatz, James Becker, and Gerard Doherty. In July 2017, Jennifer F. Tseng, MD, MPH, was recruited as Chair and Utley Professor of Surgery at Boston University School of Medicine and Surgeon-in-Chief at Boston Medical Center. The Department of Surgery comprises 14 divisions or sections and includes 44 full-time clinical faculty members at Boston Medical Center. A well-established relationship with Boston Children's Hospital provides shared faculty in pediatric critical care and pediatric general surgery, as well as pediatric training for residents. The department also has 19 affiliated Boston University School of Medicine faculty members from Roger Williams Medical Center, the Veterans Administration (VA) Boston Healthcare System, and Cape Cod Hospital (Cape Cod Healthcare). The Department of Surgery has had a unique partnership with the Department of Surgery at the VA Boston Healthcare System, a relationship that extends back to the 1950s. The departments of Surgery at both hospitals are well-integrated, collaborating not only on the training of medical students, residents, and fellows, but also on many research and clinical programs. Under the leadership of Kamal Itani, MD, Chief of Surgery, the VA Boston Healthcare System Department of Surgery is a valued partner of the Boston University School of Medicine/Boston Medical Center Department of Surgery. The department also has close ties to the Department of Surgery at Roger Williams Medical Center, led by Chairman N. Joseph Espat, MD, MS. Roger Williams Medical Center has a proud history of more than a century, and is the largest academic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Rhode Island. Offering a full range of specialty and subspecialty services, Roger Williams Medical Center performs approximately 7,300 inpatient and outpatient surgical procedures annually, and is a major source of teaching and training for Boston University School of Medicine/Boston Medical Center. This annual report provides an overview of some of the clinical programs, research, and educational initiatives of the previous year (July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018), and highlights some of the many accomplishments and activities of our faculty, trainees, and alumni. We invite you to visit our website and follow us on social media to keep abreast of our activities throughout the year. Message from the Chair has been a little over a year since I had the honor of becoming Chair of the Department of Surgery. When my appointment became public, some of my fellow new chairs around the nation privately confided to me that my first year would be difficult, but advised me to persevere and persist and I would \"get through it.\" To some eyes, the fact that I happen to be female and nonwhite would make it even more challenging to lead an important Department of Surgery at a historically significant hospital located in a tradition-rich city and region. Prepared as I was to meet the challenge, I was in for a very pleasant surprise. Since day one, colleagues throughout BUSM and BMC, especially my fellow surgeons, have been incredibly welcoming and supportive. This has enabled me \u2014 joined by a remarkably talented, dedicated, and hardworking team of faculty, trainees, and staff \u2014 to focus our collective efforts on what matters most: building a healthier future for all, which is the theme of this year's annual report. As you will discover on the following pages, we are making considerable progress toward that goal. I understand better now why I did not face the hurdles my well- meaning colleagues suggested I might. This is a very special place that, since its founding in 1873, has been defined by diversity. In fact, we were born this way: One of BUSM's founding institutions, New England Female Medical College, was the first medical school in the country to train women as physicians, including, in 1864, Rebecca Lee Crumpler, the first black female physician. This is also where, in 1890, Charles Eastman became the first Native American physician. Today, that legacy of diversity and inclusion lives on at BUSM/BMC and the Department of Surgery. Indeed, our department is widely considered a model of diversity \u2014 to quote Massachusetts Bay Colony governor John Winthrop, we are a \"city on a hill,\" to be emulated. Our faculty, trainees, and staff hail from all regions of the nation and the globe, and from all walks of life, reflecting the wonderful diversity of the world in which we live and the patients we care for. I am very proud to be among them. I hope you will enjoy reading our annual report, and encourage you to keep abreast of our activities throughout the year on Twitter (@BMCSurgery).

His inspiration was his father, Saul, a veterinarian and cattle rancher who sometimes let his eager and curious son help out under his watchful eye: once letting him set a dog's leg and another time assist in an operation on a cat. When his father told him, \"You've got good hands,\" Richard, whose great uncle was also a doctor, knew he had found his calling in life. Indeed, decades later, Dr. Shemin, one of the nation's top academic cardiac surgeons, Robert and Kelly Day Professor and Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at UCLA Medical Center, Executive Vice Chairman of the Department of Surgery, and Co-Director of the Cardiac Vascular Center, says, \"I still wake up every day excited to go to work.\" Highly selective program After graduating from high school, Dr. Shemin was thrilled to be accepted to Boston University's six-year BA/MD program, from which he graduated, cum laude, in 1974. \"This highly selective program enabled me to earn a liberal arts degree [he majored in philosophy and religion, graduating magna cum laude] and be with classmates who were also academically strong and focused on a career in medicine,\" says Dr. Shemin. He was elected into the Phi Beta Kapa Society and, as a junior medical student, elected to Alpha Omega Alpha. Dr. Shemin matched with his first choice of surgical residencies: the Harvard-affiliated Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. (In 1980, Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, Robert Breck Brigham Hospital, and Boston Hospital for Women merged to form Brigham and Women's Hospital.) He was the first BU School of Medicine graduate to be accepted into the elite surgical training program. Prepared for success \"The education that BU School of Medicine provided \u2014 and still provides \u2014 was as good as or better than any other medical school in the country,\" says Dr. Shemin, who is also Program Director of the UCLA Cardiothoracic Surgery Residency Program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. \"BU School of Medicine's core values of humanism, compassion, and professionalism, as well as its emphasis on teamwork and communication skills, prepared its graduates then, as now, for success in today's complex healthcare environment.\"During his residency, Dr. Shemin decided to specialize in cardiac surgery, which at the time was undergoing many exciting advances. He spent two years during his residency as a clinical associate in cardiac surgery at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and following his graduation in 1980 from the Brigham, completed a fellowship in cardiothoracic surgery at New York University Medical Center. Acceptance into both programs was highly competitive. Bringing heart transplantation to New England In 1982, Dr. Shemin joined the faculty at Brigham and Women's Hospital, taking a year in 1983 to complete a heart transplantation fellowship at Stanford University. Dr. Shemin, who was Medical Director of the Cardiac Surgical ICU, convinced the leadership that Brigham and Women's should develop a program in heart transplantation. At the time, heart transplants were being done at only three hospitals nationwide, none of which was in New England. Dr. Shemin succeeded and, in 1984, he was part of the team that performed the first successful heart transplant in New England. Another highlight of Dr. Shemin's career was a case in 1983, which at the time received national media attention, involving a woman who was 30 weeks pregnant with a ruptured aorta who went into cardiac arrest. Neither she nor the baby were expected to survive. Dr. Shemin, who fortunately had chosen to assist with a number of cesarean sections during his surgical training, delivered the infant safely and then saved the mother. \"This was a situation where one patient near death went into the OR and two people came out alive,\" says Dr. Shemin, noting that he advises surgical trainees to learn as much as possible about all specialties during their training. \"I tell them it will make them better doctors. You never know when the knowledge or surgical skills learned years before may make a difference in the life of a patient.\" World-class cardiothoracic surgery service In 1987, Dr. Shemin, then only 36, was recruited to BU School of Medicine as Professor and Chair of Cardiothoracic Surgery. During his 20-year career at BU, Dr. Shemin served in many senior leadership roles, including Vice Chair of Surgery and Co-Director of the Cardiovascular Center at Boston Medical Center, a center he was instrumental in creating. During his tenure, he built a world-class cardiothoracic surgery service that performed more than 1,000 operations a year with outcomes as good as or better than other top academic hospitals in the region. \"We were a coveted training program internationally and a highly productive basic science and clinical research center,\" he says. Although Dr. Shemin enjoyed his position at BU School of Medicine and considered Boston home, when he was recruited to lead the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at UCLA Medical Center, one of the top academic hospitals in the nation, he could not resist. In 2007, Dr. Shemin and his wife, Susan \u2014 their three children now grown \u2014 moved to California to start a new chapter. Among many other accomplishments, Dr. Shemin brought minimally invasive and robotic cardiac surgery to UCLA and grew its heart transplantation program, now one of the busiest and most respected in the nation. In addition to his busy schedule at UCLA, which includes patient care, research, teaching, and administrative responsibilities, Dr. Shemin holds leadership positions in many professional societies. He served as former Chair of the American Board of Thoracic Surgery and is currently a governor of the American College of Surgeons, representing cardiothoracic surgery. Alumni awards among many honors Dr. Shemin also serves on numerous editorial boards, including the prestigious Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery and Circulation. He has authored more than 370 articles and abstracts as well as 28 book chapters, and is frequently invited to lecture worldwide. Among his many honors, Dr. Shemin has received the BU School of Medicine and the BU College of Liberal Arts Alumni Achievement Award. A longtime generous supporter of the BU School of Medicine, he is a lifetime member of the Chester S. Keefer, MD Society. Dr. Shemin considers BU School of Medicine the foundation upon which he built his illustrious career, which is why he recently established the Richard J.

Shemin, MD, Class of 1974 EAlumni BUSM/BMC Department of Surgery Annual Report 2018 15 14 bumc.bu.edu/surgery Thoracic surgeon Kei Suzuki, MD ung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both women and men in the United States, responsible for killing nearly 156,000 Americans in 2017 alone. The vast majority of lung cancers are caused by cigarette smoking, and the more and longer one smokes the greater the odds of developing the disease. Unfortunately, at the time of diagnosis, almost seven in 10 patients have locally advanced or metastatic disease, when treatment is far less likely to be effective and the outlook is often bleak. Early diagnosis and treatment is therefore essential for improving patients' odds of beating lung cancer. In 2011, the National Lung Screening Trial recommended that heavy smokers (30-plus pack years*) between the ages of 55 and 74 (later expanded to 80) undergo screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (CT). This recommendation was based on evidence that CT screening in this population reduced lung cancer deaths. In 2013, the United States Preventive Services Task Force also recommended these screening guidelines. Arbitrary screening criteria But CT screening is imperfect and not without risks. The lung cancer detection rate (yield) is very low \u2014 in the range of 0.6 to 3.7 percent \u2014 largely because the screening criteria are somewhat arbitrary. Moreover, it is estimated that approximately one cancer death is caused by radiation from imaging for every 2,500 patients screened. Thoracic surgeon Kei Suzuki, MD, has long focused his research on lung cancer, first as a resident and later during his fellowship at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. When he joined the BUSM/BMC Surgery faculty in 2016, he was eager to continue his research in this domain. Dr. Suzuki is especially grateful to Thoracic Surgery Chief Virginia Litle, MD, and Associate Chair of Research Tony Godfrey, PhD, for their support and mentorship of his research. Sparing lower-risk patients \"We need a way to biologically identify individuals at high risk of developing lung cancer so that we screen them with CT while sparing people at lower risk from unnecessary and potentially harmful scans,\" says Dr. Suzuki, who treats many patients with lung cancer. Such a biomarker would also be able to identify people who do not fit the current criteria, but nonetheless have a high risk of lung cancer and should also undergo screening. As it turns out, BUSM/BMC is the ideal place for Dr. Suzuki to pursue this goal. Shortly after he arrived, he connected with pulmonologist and BUSM-BMC Cancer Center Director Avrum Spira, MD, chief of Computational Medicine in the Department of Medicine. Dr. Spira's research focuses on genomic changes associated with smoking-related lung disease, and is based on the paradigm that smoking creates a \"field of molecular injury\" in epithelial cells that line the airway. These changes, Dr. Spira established, are also seen in the nasal lining. Dr. Spira's work has led to a biomarker, now in clinical use, that distinguishes which patients who have had a suspicious lung nodule detected by CT are at high risk of lung cancer and should undergo further intervention, such as a biopsy. The biomarker cells are acquired via a bronchoscope from the patient's airway. Research takes a new direction With recent funding from the Thoracic Surgery Foundation, Dr. Suzuki is taking this research in a new direction. He is investigating whether genetic changes in the cells of the nasal lining, which could be easily acquired with a swab in a primary care office setting, could be developed into a biomarker that will provide a simple way to determine which patients should undergo CT screening for lung cancer. Initially Dr. Suzuki will evaluate the nasal genetic changes in patients who fit the current age and smoking history criteria. If this approach proves successful, it would later be evaluated in other individuals, including those who are younger and/or have a smoking history of fewer pack years, and developed into a biomarker. \"In the ongoing battle against lung cancer we need a simple, non-radiation tool to help us identify patients at high risk so we are screening those most likely to benefit,\" says Dr. Suzuki. \"We are hopeful that this research will bring us closer toward that goal.\" * Pack years are the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by the number of years the person has smoked.Nasal Biomarkers: A Potential New Tool for Lung Cancer ScreeningHighlight: Research L \" In the ongoing battle against lung cancer w e need a simple, non-radiation tool to help us identify patients at high risk so we are screening those most likely to benefit.

There is nothing we find more rewarding than having a positive impact on our patients' lives.\" \u2014 Jason Hall, MD, MPH Jason Hall, MD, MPH, Chief of Colon and Rectal SurgeryColon and Rectal Surgery Provides Leading-Edge Treatmentsvery second and fourth Monday of the month, a multidisciplinary team of clinicians at Boston Medical Center gathers together to discuss the case of every patient who will undergo surgery for colorectal cancer, both before and after the patient's operation. Regularly participating in this conference are, of course, BMC's three colorectal surgeons: Chief Jason Hall, MD, MPH, Angela Kuhnen, MD, and Uma Phatak, MD. They are joined by others involved in colorectal cancer patients' care, including specialists from medical oncology, radiation oncology, radiology, and pathology, as well as physician assistants. Established last year by Dr. Hall, who joined the Department of Surgery in 2016, this conference \"ensures that each of our patients with cancer receives the best, most appropriate treatment in a well-coordinated manner,\" says Dr. Hall. This commitment to providing the best possible treatment extends to all patients who receive care from the Colon and Rectal Surgery team (see sidebar). Patients include people from nearby communities, many of whom who rely on BMC as their safety-net hospital. Others travel long distances for access to the excellent medical and surgical care for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) offered at BMC's Dempsey Center for Digestive Disorders, which is co-led by Dr. Hall and BMC gastroenterologist Francis Farraye, MD. Cutting-edge treatments Colon and Rectal Surgery provides the entire breadth of the most effective, cutting-edge surgical treatments, including minimally invasive and robotic surgery, for common and complex disorders of the colon and rectum. The types of conditions treated include colon and rectal hemorrhoids, fissures and fistulas. The division also excels at complex re-operations and offers screening colonoscopies. BMC is one of only a few hospitals in the region to offer transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEMS) for selected patients with early-stage rectal cancer (with or without chemotherapy or radiation), and certain rectal polyps. This minimally invasive technique, which enables surgeons to visualize and remove tumors using a proctoscope inserted through the anus, avoids the need for an incision and its potential complications. Importantly, it also preserves the function of the rectum, thus avoiding the need for a permanent colostomy. Dr. Hall notes that in complex cases, at Boston Medical Center it is common for two attending colorectal surgeons to participate in an operation to ensure the best possible outcome. Indeed, outcomes achieved by the section reflect a consistently high quality of care. The latest quarterly data (as of press time) from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), a voluntary program of the American College of Surgeons that provides data on a range of post-operative outcomes, indicates that the section's outcomes were outstanding. Research on enhanced recovery Faculty in the section are also engaged in research, with a particular focus on enhanced recovery following colorectal surgery. One project is looking at the role of certain adjuvant medications to encourage return to bowel function after surgery. Another is evaluating the use of transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks to improve pain control following surgery, based on the knowledge that better pain control on the first post-operative day results in faster recovery and shorter length of stay. Several other projects are investigating some of the social determinants of outcomes, including the effect of patients' primary languages on readmissions. The section is also the first to participate in a department-wide project to create standardized discharge instructions in several languages (Spanish, Portuguese, and Haitian Creole) for non-English-speaking surgical patients, with the goal of reducing preventable readmissions or Emergency Department visits and improving patient satisfaction (see article, page 20). \"Our team is deeply committed to providing each and every patient with excellent care,\" says Dr. Hall. \"There is nothing we find more rewarding than having a positive impact on our patients' lives.\" FOR APPOINTMENTS OR REFERRALS, CALL: 617-414-8054 Highlight: Patient Care E The Colon and Rectal Surgery Team Jason Hall, MD, MPH Chief Angela Kuhnen, Surgery Annual Report 2018 19 18 bumc.bu.edu/surgery \" The goal of our r esearch is to identify where we can make improvements to ensure that all patients, regardless of their race or ethnicity, birthplace, or circumstances, have equal access to the best surgical care resulting in the best possible outcomes.\" \u2014 Teviah Sachs, MD, MPHResearch collaborators (from left) Teviah Sachs, MD, MPH, Susanna de Geus, MD, PhD, Jennifer Tseng, MD, MPH, Rodney Bruno, BS, and Sing Chau Ng, MS. Other collaborators (not pictured) are Ryan Morgan, BS, Michael Cassidy, MD, and David McAneny, MD.urgical skill obviously plays an important role in the outcomes of patients being treated for a serious disease like cancer. But long before many patients are on the operating table, the cards may already be stacked against them by virtue of their race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, insurance coverage, country of origin, primary language, and the distance they must travel for tertiary-level treatment. Understanding the root causes of inequities in surgical care with the goal of reducing or eliminating them has long been a major priority of the Department of Surgery. As part of an urban safety-net hospital serving a racially/ethnically diverse and largely economically disadvantaged patient population, the Department of Surgery is especially well-positioned to conduct research aimed at understanding disparities in surgical care and implementing and evaluating measures to address them. This important work is enhanced by the existence of SOAR (Surgical Outcomes Analysis & Research), a research initiative founded years ago by Surgery Chair Jennifer Tseng, MD, MPH, with a mandate to investigate and promulgate best practices and eradicate disparities in all aspects of surgery. In collaboration with Dr. Tseng and other faculty at Boston Medical Center and Johns Hopkins Medical Center, surgical oncologist Teviah Sachs, MD, MPH, is engaged in numerous research projects looking at disparities in the surgical care of patients with gastric (stomach) cancer and cancers of the pancreas and liver. Need for early diagnosis of gastric cancer While the incidence of and mortality from gastric cancer has decreased in the U.S. and other developed nations during the past century, the disease remains a major cause of death around with world. For U.S. hospitals that treat large immigrant populations, it is imperative to know how to identify and manage patients at risk of gastric cancer to ensure that they receive the best possible care. With this goal in mind, Dr. Sachs conducted a retrospective study aimed at identifying the presentation and survival of gastric cancer patients treated between 2004 and 2017 at Boston Medical Center. Of the 249 patients, 40 percent were African-American, most were born outside the U.S. or Canada (predominantly the Caribbean, Africa, and Central America/Mexico), lived in poorer neighborhoods, and were insured through federal programs. Among the many other findings of this research, which will be published in the Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery, was that the patient's stage of cancer at presentation was the strongest predictor of survival. Unfortunately, the research found that patients of Hispanic ethnicity, individuals born in regions such as Central America, and those living in the most impoverished communities frequently present with later stage disease \u2014 often too late for surgical intervention or a chance at cure. Other authors of the paper were Dr. Tseng, Ryan Morgan, BS, Michael Cassidy, MD, Susanna de Geus, MD, PhD, and David McAneny, MD. \"These findings focus attention on the importance of early diagnosis, as patients with early-stage gastric cancer can benefit from surgical intervention,\" says Dr. Sachs, adding that prevention programs aimed at reducing risk factors, as well as targeted screening of high-risk populations in the U.S., would help improve survival. Dr. Sachs has submitted proposals for grants to continue work in this area. Collaboration with Johns Hopkins Another area of investigation Dr. Sachs is pursuing involves disparities in hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) cancer surgery. He recently teamed up with faculty of the Department of Surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital, where he did his fellowship, to conduct a study on disparities in HPB surgery. This retrospective observational study, which is currently under IRB review, will investigate how racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and insurance status impact the treatment and outcomes of patients with benign or malignant tumors originating from the pancreas or liver. The co-principal investigator is Christopher Wolfgang, MD, PhD, Director of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery at Johns Hopkins; other members of the research team are research fellows Heidi Overton, MD, at Johns Hopkins, and Dr. de Geus at BUSM/BMC, along with Dr. Tseng and biostatician and SOAR Administrative Director Sing Chau Ng, MS. \"The goal of this and other research we are engaged in is to identify where we can make improvements to ensure that all patients, regardless of their race or ethnicity, birthplace, or economic circumstances, have equal access to the best surgical care resulting in the best possible outcomes,\" says Dr. Sachs.Investigations Seek to Understand and Reduce Inequities in Surgical CareHighlight: Equity SBUSM/BMC Department of Surgery Annual Report 2018 21 20 bumc.bu.edu/surgery is always a special day when a patient goes home from the hospital following surgery. But recovering from an operation safely at home requires strict adherence to written post-operative discharge instructions on everything from wound care and medications to when to seek medical attention. Not following these instructions can lead to readmissions and potentially serious harm to the patient. But what if the patient does not understand the discharge instructions because he is not proficient in English? This is an important question at Boston Medical Center, where nearly one-third of patients speak a primary language other than English. Stephanie Talutis, MD, MPH, is a resident who recently completed her second year of dedicated research time under the mentorship of David McAneny, MD, Vice Chair of Surgery and Chief Surgical Officer. Dr. Talutis has focused much of her research on projects aimed at improving quality and patient safety, with a particular focus on the issues affecting non-English-speaking patients at BMC. \"The Department of Surgery alone treats about 1,300 non-English-speaking patients a year, so it is important that we evaluate whether we are addressing their needs to ensure the best possible outcomes,\" says Dr. Talutis. Effect of primary language One research project instigated by Dr. Talutis evaluated the effect of primary language on readmission after colorectal surgery at BMC. \"We hypothesized that patients whose primary language was not English were readmitted more frequently,\" says Dr. Talutis. In fact, her research, a retrospective review that compared the outcomes of nearly 600 patients, 25 percent of whom were non-English speakers, found that this was not the case. However, among patients who were readmitted to the hospital, non-English speakers were readmitted sooner than their English-speaking counterparts. This work led to a poster presentation at the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons national scientific meeting in May, and a podium presentation at the New England Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons in June. Standardized multilingual instructions Another of Dr. Talutis's projects, which is still ongoing, aims to improve quality and safety through the creation of standardized multilingual discharge instructions for surgical patients. Supported by a two-year BMC Patient Safety grant, this work is being conducted in collaboration with co-principal investigators Pamela Rosenkranz, RN, BSN, MEd, and Dr. McAneny. This project was borne out of a recognition that written discharge instructions in the Department of Surgery were not standardized \u2014 even within a division \u2014 and were also not available in the languages most commonly spoken by BMC's non-English speaking \" The Department of Sur gery treats about 1,300 non- English-speaking patients a year, so it is important that we evaluate whether we are addressing their needs to ensure the best possible outcomes.\" \u2014 Stephanie Talutis, MD, MPHResident's Research Focuses on Quality and Safety Surgery resident Stephanie Talutis, MD, MPH patient populations. Dr. Talutis notes that not having standardized instructions leads to confusion among care providers, and the lack of multilingual discharge instructions can potentially harm patients. In 2014, for example, a Spanish-speaking BMC surgical patient delayed contacting his doctor about symptoms he was experiencing after leaving the hospital because he did not understand his discharge instructions, and suffered complications as a result. \"Fortunately, he was not permanently harmed, but this was entirely preventable,\" says Dr. Talutis, noting that this is likely just one of many incidents in which patients whose primary language is not English may have been put at risk. Spanish, Portuguese, and Haitian Creole This multi-faceted project involves developing standardized discharge instructions for the most commonly performed operations for seven surgical divisions, starting with Colon and Rectal Surgery. A multidisciplinary team was formed to provide input. Once approved by the division chief, the discharge instructions, which will be written at a fifth-grade reading level and accompanied by images, will be translated into Spanish, Portuguese, and Haitian Creole, the languages most commonly spoken by BMC's non-English speaking patient population. A plan is in place for educating faculty, residents, and other providers about the new instructions and the materials will be put in the electronic medical record and shared drive for easy access. Dr. Talutis says the anticipated outcomes of this initiative are to reduce preventable Emergency Department visits and hospital readmissions and improve patients' experiences, all of which will be evaluated over time. \"Everyone in the department appreciates the need for these steps to improve patient safety and quality, and is very excited to see them coming to fruition,\" says Dr. Talutis, who will continue her involvement in the project during her clinical training. Dr. Talutis hopes that in the future additional funding will become available to translate the discharge instructions into additional languages, and that this initiative will be adopted by other BMC departments and perhaps other medical centers nationwide.Highlight: Quality and Safety It Stephanie Talutis, MD, MPH, with faculty members David McAneny, MD (left), and Thurston Drake, MD, MPH, at the 2018 American Association of Endocrine Surgeons annual meeting, where she gave a poster presentation.BUSM/BMC Department of Surgery Annual Report 2018 23 22 bumc.bu.edu/surgery SURGERY RESIDENCY PROGRAM Donald Hess, MD, Associate Chair for Education, Program Director Tracey Dechert, MD, Associate Program DirectorTeviah Sachs, MD, MPH, Associate Program DirectorLana Ketlere, Residency Program Coordinator SURGERY FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMS Surgical Critical Care FellowshipRobert Schulze, MD, MBA, Program Director Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Fellowship Alik Farber, MD, Program Director SURGICAL EDUCATION Luise I.

Led by Donald Hess, MD, the program provides residents with the range and depth of experience and academic exposure to develop superior surgical skills and to make mature, informed, independent judgments. Graduates of the program are well-prepared to become outstanding general surgeons or surgical specialists. The majority of residents pursue additional fellowship training after graduation, and many have gone on to assume leadership positions in academic surgery. The Surgery Residency Program is based at Boston University Medical Center, a modern, vibrant medical complex located in the heart of Boston's South End. The medical center includes Boston University School of Medicine, the Boston University School of Public Health, and the Boston University Goldman School of Dental Medicine, as well as Boston Medical Center. Our program leads to American Board of Surgery Certification within an environment designed to encourage clinical and basic scientific research experience. Residents interested in careers in academic surgery are encouraged to develop the necessary skills in research, education, and/or administration through a broad range of research fellowship opportunities. Clinical research is also encouraged among residents during their clinical years of training. In fact, most residents have contributed to at least one paper being published in a peer-reviewed journal by graduation, and many have given award-winning presentations (see Resident News, page 26). The principal goal of our program is clinical excellence. We believe that exposure to a large, diverse patient population and broad experience in complex open and minimally invasive surgery are essential elements in the training of outstanding surgeons. The department also has a unique program that links Boston University School of Medicine students who are interested in surgical research with resident mentors, who connect the students with faculty members conducting research in the students' areas of interest. This program provides residents with mentoring experience and has led to numerous award-winning presentations by medical students.Current Residents PGY1CategoricalNicole Cimbak, MDSidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University Loreski Collado, MDCooper Medical School of Rowan University Allan Stolarksi, MDAlbany Medical College Spencer Wilson, MDUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine Mark Zapata, MDMedical College of Georgia at Augusta University Preliminary William Biche, MDYale School of Medicine Kenneth Briley, MDTulane University School of Medicine Curtis Hon, MDBoston University School of Medicine Patrick Mota, MDSt. George's University School of Medicine PGY 2CategoricalSherif Aly, MD Boston University School of MedicineRebecca Hasley, MD Drexel University College of MedicineOlivia Humbarger, MD Boston University School of MedicineLenee Plauche, MD Boston University School of MedicineMichael Poulson, MD Georgetown University School of Medicine University of Miami Leonard M.

During the previous year, six SRS members attended the national meeting of the Association for Surgical Education in Austin, Texas, giving five presentations that sparked a great deal of interest. The presenters were residents Ryan Macht, MD, MS (\"Improving Nutrition in Perioperative Patients\"), Michael Poulson, MD (\"Advocacy and Policy Training Program for Residents and Medical Students\"), Megan Janeway, MD (\"Socially Responsible Surgery: A Model Organization for Implementing Socially Responsible Practice in Training Programs\" and \"The Service Learning Project: A Unique Model for Patient Education and Advocacy Training in Early Medical Education\") and Praveen Sridhar, MD (\"Holidays are for Patients, Too: Using a Pulpectomy to Serve Patients and Engage Medical Students\"). Advocacy Program Last year also marked the development of the SRS Advocacy Program, led by Dr. Poulson, which hosts monthly advocacy roundtables to educate residents and medical students about advocacy and political policy work. Advocacy activities organized by SRS included participation in events such as the anti-gun violence \"March for Our Lives\" in 2018 and the annual Mother's Day Walk for Peace, and co-organizing the first annual Health Equity Symposium at Boston Medical Center. As members of the Advocacy Program, Drs. Janeway and Poulson both received grants to attend the American College of Surgeons Leadership and Advocacy Summit in Washington, DC in May. There, they met with Senators Edward Markey and Elizabeth Warren and Representatives William Keating, Catherine Clark, Seth Moulton, and Mike Capuano to discuss issues of importance such as gun violence research, the opioid crisis, and trauma system preparedness. Service projects and research Two of SRS's service projects also made significant headway in the previous year. Now in its third year, the SRS Service Learning Project provides first-year medical students on the Acute Care/Trauma Surgery service with the opportunity to address inpatients' unmet needs by helping them understand their procedures and screening them for social determinants of health. Another project integrates food insecurity screening on surgical services, leading to improved patient access to nutrition resources during the perioperative period. In the previous year, SRS also expanded it research program, which now includes five residents and 20 medical students working on more than 15 unique projects. One, for example, is focused on assessing whether there are disparities in post-hospitalization care placement based on injury type and social determinants of health. Others are evaluating patients' experiences within the referral system for elective surgery and how to improve access to early surgical intervention for gallbladder disease. SRS also secured several grants from multiple sources for pilot projects and the development of existing projects. In addition, members of SRS gave 14 regional and national podium and poster presentations at meetings throughout the nation. \"Socially responsible surgery is becoming an increasingly important part of the national conversation about reducing disparities in care, and we are proud to be at the forefront of this movement,\" says Dr. Janeway.
