The objective was to explore this previously unstudied form of meditation. The current sample (N = 30) consists of long-term practitioners of Anthroposophic meditation. Semi-structured interviews, focusing on demographics, background, and phenomenology and interpretation, were conducted with these practitioners. The material gathered was investigated using thematic analysis. Seven main themes were found: Self, cognition, perception, affect, sleep, embodiment, and environment, and, among these, 32 subthemes. Potential avenues for further research are outlined. Some of these overlap with current approaches to meditation while others represent new areas of inquiry: Personal development with a focus on strengthening the self, introspection or contemplative inquiry, sensed presences, the experience of phenomenological atmospheres, consciousness in the sleep state, embodied aspects of meditation experience, the relationship between practice and daily life, and meditation challenges.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-06-26", "cleaned_text": "Body, Soul, and Spirit: An Explorative Qualitative Study of Anthroposophic Meditation and Spiritual [anthroposophy](/search?q=anthroposophy); [meditation](/search?q=meditation); [Rudolf have been a number of publications appearing in philosophy and psychology over the last couple of decades et [Kienle et which grew out of and are still part of the Anthroposophic movement, the field of Anthroposophic research is indeed relatively large. Anthroposophic meditation, however, has hardly received any attention. This led to the conception of the research project that this article is based on, which aimed to be an initial exploration of Anthroposophic meditation experience in general and among contemporary practitioners. [Sparby 2016a](#B44-religions-11-00314)). Structurally, Anthroposophic meditation can be seen to have the notion of human freedom, including, for example, intellectualism or a spirit of inquiry, anti-authoritarianism, and a scientific outlook, as a foundation. However, it also involves, perhaps paradoxically, an element of religious devotion and surrender as a way of deepening the connection of the human being to its environment. Finally, Anthroposophic meditation aims at a union with the spiritual world that involves a strong emphasis on nature and culture; specifically, it aims at providing inspiration that can transform human society based on spiritual insight. Hence, transcendence and immanence are strongly connected. Ultimately, nature, human life, and the whole of reality are seen as inherently spiritual. In short, Anthroposophic meditation represents a kind of spiritual empiricism aiming at social reformation. To what extent the realization of this has been influenced by the spiritual practice of Anthroposophists during the last hundred years is hard to assess but, if we use socio-cultural influence as a measure, Anthroposophy must be considered to be one of the more successful subcultural spiritual movements of the 20th century. Not only has Anthroposophy had a strong impact on pedagogy, but also on medicine, art, literature, social banking, and politics. Main works by Steiner include The secondary literature on Anthroposophic meditation is, however, somewhat scarce. Some authors have provided sourcebooks ( [Wehr 1983](#B67-religions-11-00314); [Romero 2014](#B34-religions-11-00314); [Zimmermann and Schmidt meditation ( [Zajonc 2009](#B69-religions-11-00314); [Schmidt 2010](#B38-religions-11-00314); [Ben-Aharon 2016](#B3-religions-11-00314)). In recent years, annual meetings by a network referred to as the Goethanum Meditation Initiative Worldwide has taken place, a network that seeks to connect Anthroposophic practitioners and develop this approach further. [Sparby 2017b](#B47-religions-11-00314)). Anthroposophy contains claims that overlap, go beyond, and sometimes contradict typical contemporary views found in psychology, such as that consciousness is a exclusively a product of human physiology ( [Weger and Edelh\u00e4user 2014](#B65-religions-11-00314)). Hence, when a psychological researcher investigates Anthroposophic practitioners, both may be challenged. Indeed, as noted below, one participant of the current study did not want to participate because of doubts regarding whether contemporary psychological methods could adequately represent Anthroposophic meditation experiences. However, the spiritual or the Anthroposophic and the psychological perspective can be viewed as complementary. The contemporary psychological approach of developing theories based in data rather than philosophical ideas is very much in accordance with the spiritual empiricist attitude of Anthroposophy. In other words, Anthroposophy can potentially include the results of psychological studies and is not necessarily challenged by them. Only to the extent that psychology becomes reductionist, i.e., insofar as it denies the existence of the mind and spirit or sees them as epiphenomena, it can present a challenge to Anthroposophic practitioners. However, psychological research is not necessarily reductive. In this way, Anthroposophic and psychological methods and perspectives may be viewed as complementary. [Sparby 2017b](#B47-religions-11-00314)), discussing methodological issues ( [Sparby 2016b](#B45-religions-11-00314)), reporting for Anthroposophic meditation ( [Sparby and Ott 2018](#B50-religions-11-00314)), and describing the effects of the Anthroposophic mantra practice and the so-called subsidiary exercises ( [Sparby 2018](#B48-religions-11-00314)). These studies will be summarized in the following, providing an introduction to Anthroposophic meditation. The present article presents the main results of the qualitative analysis of interviews with Anthroposophic practitioners, consisting of seven main themes and 32 subthemes. [Sparby and Ott 2018](#B50-religions-11-00314)). The most common motivation among the current sample (11 participants or 37%) was developing higher capacities of knowledge. A general developmental trajectory in relation to motivations may be one starting with external motivations, going through a phase of internal motivations, and ending with service motivations. [Sparby 2018](#B48-religions-11-00314)). The subsidiary exercises\u2014a set of practices aiming at developing the capacity of thinking, willing and emotion in a virtuous manner\u2014may also result in a host of different perceived effects. One overall perceived effect that is noteworthy is the stabilization of the practitioners. The subsidiary exercises, therefore, may represent a way of reducing the prevalence of the destabilizing or challenging effects of meditation. [Steiner 1995](#B54-religions-11-00314)). This conception of the human being will be picked up again in the discussion and the relationship between the Anthroposophic categories and the categories presented in this study will be indicated. 2. Method [Section 2.1](#sec2dot1-religions-11-00314)), researcher characteristics and reflexivity strategy ( [Section to human subjects ( [Section 2.5](#sec2dot5-religions-11-00314)), data collection methods and data collection instruments and technologies ( [Section 2.6](#sec2dot6-religions-11-00314)), units [Section 2.9](#sec2dot9-religions-11-00314)). 2.1. Qualitative Approach and Research Paradigm [Velmans 2000, p. 181](#B64-religions-11-00314)). In general, qualitative methods are typical of exploratory studies ( [Given 2008, p. 327](#B16-religions-11-00314)) and \"are used to investigate new areas of inquiry or previously unknown types of behaviors, groups, or contexts\" ( [Tewksbury 2015, p. 210](#B61-religions-11-00314)). Furthermore, qualitative methods are employed \"to explore the human elements of a given topic, where specific methods are used to examine how individuals see and experience the world\" and \"to explore new phenomena and to capture individuals' thoughts, feelings, or interpretations of meaning and process.\" ( [Given 2008](#B16-religions-11-00314)). [Lindahl et al. 2017](#B29-religions-11-00314)) and some initial training was acquired from members of the VCE research team of Brown University. While the VCE project focuses specifically on challenging meditation experiences, an area hardly investigated, this project seeks to uncover the entire range of Anthroposophic meditation experiences, regardless of whether they are positive or negative. There are presently no descriptions of Anthroposophic meditation experiences that can be found in the literature. The interviews and analyses were conducted by the Principal investigator while receiving feedback from the research group at the University of Giessen, whose other team members are working on a replication of the VCE study. 2.2. Researcher Characteristics and Reflexivity [Giorgi 2009](#B14-religions-11-00314)). In other words, positivist and post-positivist stances are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Reflecting on one's own presuppositions, subjective interests and perspectives can be a means of becoming aware of and sensitive to other points of view, potentially giving rise to new views that are more comprehensive. The approach taken here is to strive towards objectivity and wholeness by both continually reflecting on contextual factors and potential sources of prejudice while making these explicit when deemed relevant (such as when the researcher's background may influence an interpretation). 2.3. Context of the Study [Sparby 2018](#B48-religions-11-00314)). The interviews that this study is based on have revealed many examples of how this process has unfolded. This study can itself been seen as part of the process towards openness, although the fact that the anonymity of the participants is retained and contextualized within a Non-Anthroposophic framework makes participation less of a potential social risk. 2.4. Sampling Strategy [Tashakkori and Teddlie 2003](#B59-religions-11-00314)), snowball sampling sampling ( [Teddlie and Yu 2007](#B60-religions-11-00314)). Since this was going to be the first qualitative study of the range of experiences relating to Anthroposophic meditation, the general aim was to recruit experienced long-time practitioners who can potentially report on a wider range of topics and phenomena than inexperienced ones. The P.I. was already acquainted with some experienced practitioners. Further participants were requited based on the recommendation of those who had already participated (snowball sampling). Since difficult meditation experiences may be underreported, cases representing prominent difficult experiences were specifically sought after when asking the participants whether they knew of any. Certain basic inclusion criteria were also adhered to: The participants had to be at least 18 years old, Anthroposophic meditation should be a main element of their meditation practice, and they should have experienced at least one significant or unexpected effect, whether positive or negative, as a result of their practice. 2.5. Ethical Issues Pertaining to Human Subjects 2.6. Data Collection Methods and Data Collection Instruments and Technologies [Supplementary Materials S1](#app1-religions-11-00314). 2.7. Units of Study [Table 1](#religions-11-00314-t001)for demographic characteristics). Five potential candidates declined to participate, three did not respond to the invitation, and three were, for various reasons, hesitant about taking part in the study and were, in the end, not interviewed. Hence, 11 potential candidates either declined to participate, did not respond, or did not participate due to hesitancy. Of the candidates that declined, one did not have enough time available, one had doubts about the validity of academic research on meditation experiences, and one declined because obtaining consent was perceived as being too bureaucratic. Two declined for unspecified reasons. One potential participant that could possibly have represented a case of strong difficulties connected to her meditation practice did not respond. One of the hesitant candidates expressed doubts about describing her meditation experiences because, as it was stated, it could make those experiences disappear, and another doubted that her experience could be counted as significant enough to be included in the study. 2.8. Data Processing 2.9. Data Analysis [Strauss and Corbin 1998](#B56-religions-11-00314)) as part of an overarching thematic analysis approach ( [Guest et al. 2012](#B17-religions-11-00314)). The aim was to let themes emerge from the text (inductive or data-driven coding). In the further analysis, some theoretical constructs have been used, such as when analyzing the motivations for Anthroposophic practice, resulting in a combination of inductive and deductive strategies, which can both be part of thematic analysis. The first draft of the codebook was created by the P.I. alone and the results were presented to the research group at the University of Giessen. Then, after the initial feedback, rough definitions of themes were refined with clear inclusion and exclusion criteria for each theme. The codebook was then validated by an external researcher. This process consisted of six interviews being coded using the existing codebook. The identified themes were then compared to each other. In particular, themes that could have been missed were looked for. However, this resulted in only one additional code (the affective category of \"sadness\"). After this, each interview was re-read and the identification of the themes re-checked. This resulted in very few revisions and the codebook was finalized. The codebook is contained in [Supplementary Materials 2](#app1-religions-11-00314). 3. Results [Section 3.1](#sec3dot1-religions-11-00314)) as well as the themes that were discovered by the qualitative analysis ( [Section 3.2](#sec3dot2-religions-11-00314)). 3.1. Overview of Practices [Table 2](#religions-11-00314-t002). Anthroposophic practices are considered to practices that have been suggested originally by Steiner or common practices within the Anthroposophic community growing out of Steiner's work (for example biographical work), while practices that come from other traditions, such as Christianity or Buddhism, are considered to be non-Anthroposophic practices. The practice and effects of the most common practices, mantras and the subsidiary exercised (\"Neben\u00fcbungen\") have been described elsewhere ( [Sparby 2018](#B48-religions-11-00314)). 3.2. Themes [Table 3](#religions-11-00314-t003). Note that \"experience\" is a quite broad category and includes in principle anything the participants report on having gone through as a result of their Anthroposophic meditation practice; some of these experiences may last only a few seconds or even less, while others are transformative experiences taking place over years. 3.2.1. Self [Sparby and Ott 2018](#B50-religions-11-00314)); what has been shown is that there are three main forms of motivations\u2014external, internal and service\u2014and that the interviews tend to show a development from the former to the latter. [Steiner 1993](#B53-religions-11-00314)). The terms are quite complex and can be used in a variety of different senses. For example, although \"imagination\" mostly refers to visual experiences in altered states of consciousness, they can also refer to seeing figures within everyday consciousness ( [Sparby 2017a](#B46-religions-11-00314)). Furthermore, imagination as an altered state of consciousness contain many different aspects, such as light, colors, radiance, inherent intelligence, etc. ( [Sparby 2020](#B49-religions-11-00314)). It is not always clear which aspects the reports concern, and in the following the emphasis is on the experience itself rather than the Anthroposophic interpretation of the term. Character Self-Encounter, Self-Strengthening, and Self-Dissolution [Sparby 2018](#B48-religions-11-00314)). It is also possible that the self dissolves as part of the meditative practice. As one participant described it, \"it is a kind of death, a death experience. Nothing is left of the [name of participant] that I knew [...]. The self that I had known in that way so far, I cannot take with me\". Note that the idea of the higher self in Anthroposophy distinguishes itself from other traditions such as Buddhism, where the existence of the self is mostly denied. Although there are examples of true self doctrines for example in Mahayana Buddhism and in other Indian traditions, these doctrines present the true/higher self as a universal self. In Anthroposophy, the higher or true self is understood as having an individual aspect, so that someone who experiences an ego dissolution can still find a true identity, a true home, that is also personal. \"I was meditating a lot, and reading a lot, and I overdid it basically. And I had an experience where I sort of suddenly lost a sense of self. Which was very scary actually. And I really couldn't get a grasp, suddenly, of who or where I was. And it was literally like, you know, the self just kind of disappeared for a while, and I had to ... I just had to ... I just ... luckily, I was at home. I just did the most familiar thing that I could think of doing, kind of, and I just had to keep active doing something very simple, and familiar. And gradually, kind of normalized, and I was ok again, but it was very, very uncomfortable.\" Capacities [Sparby 2018](#B48-religions-11-00314))). Other participants described other capacities, such as new perceptual abilities, becoming more able to sense certain fine/subtle sensations or atmospheres and even presences (see [Section 3.2.3](#sec3dot2dot3-religions-11-00314)). Specific practices, such as the subsidiary exercises, were connected to the development of specific capacities as well, for instance the ability to maintain a series of thoughts on the same subject (see list in ( [Sparby 2018](#B48-religions-11-00314))). Finally, though descriptions relating to the feeling of love were rare, one significant experience in relation to a sensed evil presence (a more in-depth description is presented below) led to an understanding that, through being able to embrace and transform the evil presence, a greater capacity for love and a tolerance for the evil actions of others would develop. Furthermore, another participant noted that the capacity for love deepened through meditation practice. Crisis Oneness \"It is not something I strive to attain, but still it can be delightful, although it is rare. [...] [I] enter a state, I don't want to say out of body, but I am ... I could meditate for hours. It is as if I am inside a glass, in a world that is living, I can perceive everything [...] I don't have to move an eyelash or anything else, it's an experience of oneness with everything, an enlightenment experience.\" 3.2.2. Cognition Knowledge Thinking [Sparby 2018](#B48-religions-11-00314))). One participant stated that it becomes easier to think through such practices, that the trust in thinking grows, and that he had insights into the nature of thoughts (for example, that their pure conceptual content is independent of material processes). Another participant described how the fact that thinking can often be difficult (some notions and thought processes are \"chewy\" or tough) may lead to an increased sense of oneself, although this does not preclude the possibility of giving other people or phenomena room in one's thinking. Memory \"I start to cry, and then a whole lot of memories come up, a whole lot of things that I remember from growing up when I hurt someone. I laid there and struggled terribly with pangs of conscience really. All the times I have hurt someone came up. From when I was quite small. Things I've ... if I had bullied a teacher at school, or bullied some boy at school, or a girl I had broken up with because I was in love with someone else. All of these experiences where I had hurt another human being. They came up.\" Conviction [Sparby and Ott 2018](#B50-religions-11-00314)). Attention and Meta-Cognition \"And that is what I mean, that meditation ... there are different directions. One is to become more grounded and so on. And meditation also helps to bring up things purposefully that lie just below consciousness by listening for it. I found that very helpful, that has helped me a lot, and also helps me in different situations. For instance when I am agitated or something. Then I notice that if I practice meditation, then that helps me notice more clearly where things are bubbling up, and also to see the relationships more clearly.\" 3.2.3. Perception Sensed Presences Visual Sensations Auditory Taste and Smell Touch Time Perception 3.2.4. Affect Joy Fear [Steiner 1992](#B52-religions-11-00314)). In order to proceed, a kind of death experience occurs at some point, where there is nothing left of the person. The participant's reaction to this was \"really great fear\", but also wonder and joy. The fear was described further as a \"great existential fear, but in the way that ... that one can say, yes, this is good.\" There were many similar experiences of fear appearing in conjunction with a sensed presence. For one participant, such a meeting resulted in a phobia of seeing himself in a mirror (as this gave rise to the same experience of fear as when the sensed presence was there), while another participant described developing agoraphobia after experiencing a threatening sensed presence in the middle of the night, while sleeping. Finally, one participant experienced strong fear connected to an out-of-body experience occurring during mantra meditation, which led to avoiding meditation for years afterwards. Peace and Calmness \"[...] a deep peace, to the point of [...] wanting nothing. Nothing anymore [...] not to be attached to anything in the future. Which doesn't mean that I won't re-enter, have to re-enter, and that I can want that again, but I'm not so attached to things so crazily anymore, like before, that something [...] absolutely has to happen. I am, I believe, paradoxically, more calm, on the one hand, and, on the other, much more ready to put things on the line, including confrontations with people.\" Sadness and Depression 3.2.5. Sleep Dreams and Lucid Dreams Sleep Paralysis Lucid Dreamless Sleep 3.2.6. Embodiment Vitality and Health Energies/Forces Grounding Energetic Centers Out of Body Experiences 3.2.7. Environment Relationships Life Competency Integration Meaningful Connections 4. Discussion [Steiner 1995](#B54-religions-11-00314)). The soul corresponds to the mind or consciousness, and spirit to the fundamental nature of the human being, expressing itself for instance in principled thinking and ethical action. Spirit is also that which connects the human being to the external world and the cosmos at large, which is, in Anthroposophy, inherently of a spiritual nature. Anthroposophic meditation is conceived within this framework. For example, meditation is thought to disentangle the soul and spirit from the body, so that an underlying reality can appear, which can then later lead to a spiritualization of material reality. The way inwards to a spiritual core in meditation is hence seen as part of a process that ultimately goes outwards into mundane reality, based on an experience of the dissolution of the distinction inside and outside in meditative experience. [Merton 2003](#B30-religions-11-00314)) and Kabbalah ( [Fishbane 2009](#B12-religions-11-00314)) have a more integrative view of the relation between the self and spiritual development. However, if the true self is treated as universal rather than individual, one may see Christian and Mayahana doctrines and compatible ( [Kennedy n.d., pp. 35-36](#B23-religions-11-00314)), though this view contradicts the Anthroposophic view that the true self has an individual aspect. In a way, Anthroposophic practice may also be seen as opposing mindfulness practice. Developing one's character or ability of decisive ethical action requires not accepting things as they are and exerting force to realize something that lies in the future, while mindfulness is typically thought of as \"moment-to-moment, non-judgmental awareness, cultivated by paying attention in a specific way, that is, in the present moment, and as non-reactively, as non-judgmentally, and openheartedly as possible\" ( [Kabat-Zinn 2005, p. 108](#B22-religions-11-00314)). Note, however, that there is a discussion surrounding how to conceive of mindfulness, particularly in relation to the connection between awareness, emotional reactions and action ( [Dorjee 2016](#B9-religions-11-00314); [Dreyfus 2011](#B10-religions-11-00314)). Specific to the Anthroposophic conception of practice is also that development happens in a way that involves de-repression, crises, and a meeting with or realization of a true or higher self. Studies have indeed shown that people tend to believe in the existence of a true self, although this construct is indeed controversial in the field of psychology ( [Strohminger et al. 2017](#B57-religions-11-00314)). Investigating Anthroposophic meditation further can, however, potentially give us insight into what claiming an experience of a true self actually involves. [Weger and Wagemann 2015](#B66-religions-11-00314); [Bitbol and practitioners make use of introspection in a setting of contemplative inquiry and, in particular, the way they combine focused attention and open presence to explore topics may represent an effective method of inquiry ( [Zajonc 2009](#B69-religions-11-00314)). Indeed, the insight aspect of meditation, which is traditionally connected to meditation both in the East and West, has up until now hardly been investigated. A central question is whether standard measurements can be used for such research or whether the method of contemplative inquiry is restricted to the contemplative domain. [Braithwaite 2010](#B6-religions-11-00314)) and are prevalent in the context of sleep paralysis ( [Adler 2011](#B1-religions-11-00314)). Recently, a sensed presences scale was developed ( [Barnby and Bell 2017](#B2-religions-11-00314)) Anthroposophic practitioners claim to be able to increase their sensitivity to sensed presences and are able to interact with them. This naturally raises many ontological questions, which can also be bracketed. There are indications that human biology supports the perceptions of presences as a kind of unified field of subjectivity, with which one can interact or sometimes represent ( [Suedfeld and Mocellin 1987](#B58-religions-11-00314); [Cheyne 2001](#B8-religions-11-00314)). Whether sensed presences actually exist is, to a certain degree, secondary. The human being may on a fundamental level rely on sensing presences when engaging with the world, whether the sensed presences are human beings, animals, spirits, a book, nature, etc., and how this happens can potentially reveal new aspects of how the human psyche functions. Investigating how Anthroposophic practitioners perceive and interact with sensed presences may provide insight into such functions. [B\u00f6hme 2013](#B5-religions-11-00314); [Schmitz 2014](#B39-religions-11-00314))\u2014may provide us with insight into how subliminal processes influence our perceptions and how they can be accessed through meditation practice. Again, no specific ontological presuppositions are required for this kind of investigation. Studies have already shown that meditators are able to increase access to cognitive and volitional processes ( [Jo et al. 2015](#B20-religions-11-00314); [Fox et al. 2012](#B13-religions-11-00314)), and this may be true also for the experience of deeper esthetic qualities such as atmospheres. [Windt et al. 2016](#B68-religions-11-00314); [Thompson 2015](#B62-religions-11-00314); [Britton et al. 2014](#B7-religions-11-00314)). Anthroposophic practitioners understand their practice as accessing the sleep state and can sometimes report on experiences in such states. Their inherent cognitive value could be explored in addition to, for example, how predictive processes are altered during the sleep state. [Kerr et al. One avenue of research would be to consider whether Anthroposophic meditation has similar effects, while another would be to consider whether there are any specific effects of Anthroposophic practice in relation to the workplace environment and daily life (in general). [Lindahl et al. 2017](#B29-religions-11-00314)), and there seems to be a connection between the amount of practice and the frequency of challenges ( [Schl\u00f6sser et al. 2019](#B37-religions-11-00314)). More specifically, there is an association between having retreat experience and challenges. In the Anthroposophic community there is no tradition of doing retreats, which rather are often seen as useless and self-centered ( [Sparby 2017b](#B47-religions-11-00314)). Further studies are needed to establish whether or not Anthroposophic practitioners actually experience fewer challenges. If it turns out that the prevalence of challenges is statistically low in comparison to other groups, the reasons for this may be explored, and it could be investigated, for example, whether certain practices such as the subsidiary exercises supports dealing with challenges ( [Sparby 2018](#B48-religions-11-00314)). A further hypothesis that can be tested is whether the reason for lower prevalence is caution on the side of practitioners due to for example knowledge of potential negative effects that are described in Anthroposophic meditation manuals ( [Steiner 1992](#B52-religions-11-00314)). 5.
