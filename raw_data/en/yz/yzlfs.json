What is the harm in e-cigarettes? The long-term health effects of using e-cigarettes for more than 24 months are not yet known. Whether you choose to smoke tobacco or vape, you are still inhaling nicotine. The younger a person tries nicotine, the greater the risk of addiction. As a young person, your brain is more vulnerable to the effects of the addictive substances than that of a fully developed adult brain. Nicotine can: disrupt brain development interfere with long-term cognitive functioning increase the risk of various mental and physical health problems later in lifeE-cigarettes are linked to: poisonings burns blast injuries an increased risk of lung infection and asthmatic attacksResearch has shown that young people who use e-cigarettes are 3 to 5 times more likely to start smoking tobacco cigarettes compared to those who never used e-cigarettes.Most e-cigarettes have higher levels of nicotine than regular cigarettes/tobacco. Activity: Do you know how much nicotine is in your e-cigarette? Does it come in lower strength levels?

Within this age group, men are signicantly more likely to smoke than women: 19% for men, and 11% for women. Men in this age group are also more likely to be daily smokers: 15% for men and 6% for women. In the general population, smokers report lower levels of mental health. The numbers of smokers identifying with a 'probable mental health problem' is higher than for non-smokers: more than 22% (about 1 in 5) of smokers 14% of non-smokers E-cigarette use: 4% of the population use e-cigarettes. 4% of young people aged between 15 and 24 use e-cigarettes. 6% of current smokers use e-cigarettes. 3% of non-smokers use e-cigarettes. Those aged under 25 are most likely to have used e-cigarettes; 14% have tried them at some point. 3 Healthy Ireland 2021Week 1: 1H TFI/PUB-8 Revision 12A: Questionnaires for nicotine dependence There are two tests to help you measure your nicotine dependence.

When you feel stressed, where on your body do you feel it?Week 4: Coping with stressWeek 4: 4A TFI/PUB-8 Revision 14B: Relaxation exercises Breathe deeply - This technique is excellent for emotional calming. Practise this every day to get the best effect. Sit in a comfortable position, with both feet firmly on the ground. Close your eyes. Place your left hand on your abdomen (stomach) and your right hand on your chest. Breathing normally, notice which hand moves as you breathe. Slowly count from 1 to 4 as you breathe in through your nose. Pause for 2 counts. Mentally count from 1 to 6 as you breathe out through your mouth. As you continue to breathe like this, try to shift most of the movement towards the hand on your abdomen. Allow your abdomen to push your hand out as you breathe in and pull your abdomen in, letting your hand fall as you breathe out. After several minutes of slow, rhythmic breathing, allow your hands to move freely in and out during each breath. Slowly open your eyes and sit quietly. This technique is excellent for emotional calming. Practise this every day to get the best effect. Escape f or a while - Lose yourself in a book, film or a game. Work o your anger - Physical activity helps to produce the body's own 'happy hormones' called endorphins. These give us that feel-good factor experienced after exercise. Prioritise - Make three lists: List 1: What I need to do today List 2: What I can put off till tomorrow List 3: What I do not need to do at all Talk it over - Do not bottle it up. Talk to someone you can trust.Do something for someone else - Instead of worrying about you all the time, try doing something for someone else. This can help you forget your own worries and give you a warm, comfortable feeling. Worry box - We wast e so much valuable time worrying about things. An effective way to stop this needless fretting is to make a worry box. Write down your worries as they occur and put them into the box. Set aside some time to go through the box every day. Week 4: 4B 1 of 2 TFI/PUB-8 Revision 14B: Relaxation exercises Create a stress survival kit - Make a bag into a personal survival kit. Put in sugar-free gum, low calorie snacks, a stress ball, a deck of cards, a book or anything to keep your hands busy. Carry a card with all the reasons you want to quit smoking/vaping and read it when you feel tempted. Carry a picture of someone who will be proud of you when you quit smoking/vaping. Choose new ways to deal with stress, for example: accept what you cannot change take one thing or a day at a time go for a walk or run listen to music scream or shout (warn people first!) practise saying 'no' buy a treat with the money you have saved Prepare for stressful events in the future If you smoked or vaped to deal with stress in the past, you may want to smoke or vape when you feel stress in the future. However, stress will be there whether you smoke/vape or not, so don't use it as an excuse to smoke/vape. It will only add to the stress. Plan ahead and think about what you can do instead. Congratulate yourself for surviving stressful times without smoking or vaping. Week 4: 4B 2 of 2 TFI/PUB-8 Revision 1 4C: Role-play: Learning to say 'no' Role A You have recently quit smoking A friend you have not seen for a while meets you and offers you a cigarette They insist on you taking one You have to say 'No' This may include being pleasant and polite, giving reasons for saying no, perhaps getting firmer with your friend, stating your bottom line Remember you are refusing a request, not rejecting a person. Role B You are a smoker You meet your friend you haven't seen for a while You offer them a cigarette They refuse. Be persistent Try and convince them to take one Use various reasons for taking one. Learn to say 'no'! Week 4: 4C TFI/PUB-8 Revision 14D: Understanding stress and nicotine What happens to your body when it needs nicotine and you cannot have it? When I am on the bus: When I am at the cinema:I just had a cigarette before getting on the bus. My nicotine levels are high and my stress levels are low.15 minutes later, my nicotine levels are dropping and my stress levels are increasing. 30 minutes later, my nicotine levels are low and now I am very stressed. I vaped before the film started. My nicotine levels are high and my stress levels are low.15 minutes later, my nicotine levels are dropping and my stress levels are increasing. 30 minutes later, my nicotine levels are very low and now I am very stressed. Week 4: 4D TFI/PUB-8 Revision 14E: Stress and nicotine - the truth Stress is part of life. It is the body's natural response to demanding situations If, like many smokers and e-cigarette users, you used cigarettes or e-cigarettes to get through stressful times, then you need to learn new ways of coping with stress without nicotine. Smoking or vaping as a stress reliever is an illusion You may feel calmer and less stressed when you smoke or vape, but your body is having the opposite reaction. Blood pressure rises, heart rate increases, muscles tense, blood vessels constrict and less oxygen is available to the brain and body to help you to cope. Smoking or vaping actually makes you more stressed When you smoke or vape, your body becomes addicted to nicotine. Therefore, when you quit your body still craves nicotine for a while. You might have been in the habit of lighting up at stressful times, such as when it is exam time, or when things have gone wrong or when you are bored, or to take a break between tasks. But it is the break and deep breaths you take when you smoke/vape that reduces that stress, not the cigarette or e-cigaretteWhen you quit, you need to choose other ways of dealing with stress. The first step is to recognise stress and realise that you can manage it, and that a cigarette or e-cigarette will not change it! Believe in yourself! Week 4: 4E TFI/PUB-8 Revision 1Positive vibes!4F: Coping with stress 1. Know yourself You have many roles and challenges every day. 2. Know your warning signs Stress is different for each of us.Knowing what makes you stressed is the first step to coping. 3. Know how to cope Pick a few ways that work for you. Remember to: Manage time Exercise Have a healthy diet Be positive Week 4: 4F TFI/PUB-8 Revision 15A: Smoking, vaping and healthy eating Smoking and vaping can cause serious health problems, yet many people are afraid they will gain weight if they quit. It is possible to quit AND maintain your weight. The facts Some people gain weight when they stop smoking and some people do not. There is some evidence to suggest that this is similar for those who vape. However, some people lose weight after quitting. Most of the weight gained after stopping smoking is due to eating more food. If you do gain a few pounds, do not pick up a cigarette! Remember the hazards of smoking: lung disease, heart disease and cancer will affect your health a lot more than temporary weight gain. Watch what you eat Go easy on coffee and other beverages that you associate with smoking or vaping because these drinks make nicotine cravings stronger. Choose decaffeinated coffee, herbal tea and water to quench your thirst. After you quit, food will smell and taste better, so enjoy your food but be careful not to overeat foods high in fat - check out the food pyramid in handout 5C. Start a healthy eating and exercise plan before you quit so that you are only changing one habit at a time. Keep some sugar-fr ee chewing gum, raw vegetables and fruit near at hand if you feel like nibbling. Have regular meals. All meals should include high-fibre, low-fat, starchy foods such as bread, potatoes, pasta or rice. Drink plenty of wat er. Aim for two litres per day. Increase your activityStay fit while you quit! Being more active will help keep your weight steady. Exercise reduces stress and tension and helps control weight. You can try: Walking more Using the stairs Playing a sport you enjoy.Week 5: Continuing support and healthy eatingWeek 5: 5A rashers Fruit bowl One biscuitBananaWrap with cheddar cheese, boiled egg, lettuce and tomato Bottle of water (500ml)Treat size chocolate bar Half of a medium Margherita pizza with side salad Chicken stir fry with boiled rice (homemade)5B: Healthy Snacks Many people eat as a substitute for smoking. Sensible snacking can actually help you control your weight while you are giving up smoking. To balance your nutrient intake, eat more snacks such as starchy foods, fruits and vegetables and go easy on foods like cakes and biscuits. Healthy snack ideas include: apples, oranges, kiwis, grapes, bananas or dried fruits such as raisins popcorn (unbuttered), wholegrain crackers a bowl of high-fibre cereal a wholemeal scone chopped carrots, celery and peppers a bowl of homemade vegetable soup fruit juices (unsweetened or pure) or yoghurt drinks relishes, chutneys, pickles and mustard on sandwiches instead of butter and mayonnaiseVary the snacks you choose and enjoy them!

Question: Who needs exercise? Answer: We all do! Exercise is vital for good health, but research shows that most of us do not get enough. Regular activity, which gets the heart pumping a little harder, can make us look and feel better. It does this by helping to reduce stress, control weight gain and lower blood pressure.Then why do we sometimes make excuses not to exercise No time, I am far too busy - Just a total of total of 30 minutes most days of the week could make a real difference to your health. You do not have to do it all at once. Begin by putting a little extra energy into things you do already to help you build up to this total. Use the stairs instead of lifts and walk or cycle short distances. Too tired, I need to relax - Exercise can actually help you relax by relieving stress and this, in turn, makes you feel good. It can also boost your energy and make you feel less tired, yet you will probably find you will sleep better too. Not the sporty type - You do not have to be sporty! Activities such as walking, gardening, housework or dancing can be just as good for you as jogging, football or working out in the gym. It all depends on the effort you put in! Exercise is boring - Try a variety of activities and choose ones that are good fun and sociable. Options like dancing, walking clubs or five-a-side football are great ways to meet people, be active and have fun. Link your exercise to something you enjoy. No one to do it with - Try asking a friend (maybe this is their excuse too) or find out about local clubs or classes where you will meet people just like you. Do you ever use any of the excuses above not to exercise? What could you do to change this and make exercise part of your life? You can do it!Week 6: 6A TFI/PUB-8 Revision 16B: What exercise is best? Exercise does not have to involve an intensive work out. You can try new activities or go back to something you have not done for a while, for example: dancing exercise at home. Use the internet to nd some work-out you might enjoy! cycling swimming or aqua aerobics jogging or brisk walking tennis, badminton or squash What do you like to do? OrWhat would you like to try? Tips on exercise Try a number of activities before choosing those you like best. It can be fun to exercise with a partner or friend. Check on your progress. Regular activities should begin to take less time or take less out of you. Always be aware of how your body feels and do not push it too far. Gradually build up your activity to a total of 30 minutes a day. You don't have to do it all in one go to get the benefits - Two sessions of 15 minutes are just as good! Do not feel you have lost all the benefits if you miss a day. It is important to stretch your muscles before and after any strenuous exercise. The secret of success is doing something you really enjoy, that you can fit into your life and you can keep doing regularly.Try something new!

Remove cigarettes, e-cigarettes, lighters, matches and ashtrays. If you smoke or vape in a particular area, try to avoid going there if possible. If other people where you live smoke or vape, then ask them to hide their cigarettes and not offer you any or not to vape in front of you. Plan ahead! If you know that there are unavoidable situations or events where you may be tempted to smoke or vape, then you need to prepare for them. If, for example, you cannot avoid going to a party, then you need to practise various ways of saying 'no' when someone offers you a cigarette. For example, you could say, 'No thanks, I have just quit', or you could take a friend with you for support. The key is to recognise situations in advance that may be tempting and then prepare three or more strategies that you can use in these situations. Cravings and breaking old habits! When a craving starts, try to distract yourself by doing something that requires concentration or makes it harder to smoke. Try simply removing yourself from the situation you are in and doing something different to distract yourself from the craving. For example, you could go for a walk or do some exercise; you could ring or text a friend; you could listen to music or read a book. Fortunately, most cravings will pass in a few minutes. The idea is to break the connection you have made between smoking or vaping and certain situations by replacing them with other healthy habits. What to do if you slip A slip is not failure. Remember that not all of your hard work is wasted. The important thing is to get back on track as quickly as possible and to learn from the slip. Think about what led you to smoke or vape and figure out how you will handle the situation differently if it happens again. Be kind to yourself and think positively. Plan aheadWeek 6: 6D TFI/PUB-8 Revision 16E: Talking positively to yourself Most of us talk to ourselves. Often it is in a very negative way such as, 'I feel miserable,' or 'I do not think I can do this'. It is negative because it does not change our situation; it only makes us feel worse. On the other hand, saying positive things to ourselves can motivate us. To increase your chances of quitting smoking or vaping for good, pay attention to yourself-talk. If it is negative, silently say 'stop', and then replace it with positive self-talk. Some examples include: I have gotten through tougher problems than this beforeI am well preparedand can handle anything that comes my way Thisfeelingwill passin a few minutes Dream, believe, achieve!Week 6: 6E This withdrawal feeling is a reminder that my body is healing itself TFI/PUB-8 Revision 17A: I have come a long way Week 7: Celebrate!Week 7: 7A Know where you can get help when you need it.Think positivelyTalk to friendsThink of your quitting plan TFI/PUB-8 Revision 1 End-of-course feedback Today's date: _____/_____/_____ 1.

Find strategies that work for you Quitting smoking or vaping may not be easy and life can get in the way. Find strategies that work for you to help you in your quit journey. Try to imagine how you will feel when you achieve your goal of one day, one week, one month without smoking or vaping. For example, 'At one month quit, I want to feel strong, condent and proud of myself.' Maybe write this down and post it on a wall to remind yourself of your goal. 2. Try writing a journal Why not try writing a journal or recording your quit journey? It can be helpful to record things as though you are talking to a friend and you can read back your entries when you need some extra motivation. For example, 'I was at a family gathering - there were some people smoking, and others were vaping. I found some people who did not smoke or vape and I chatted with them. I talked about how well I was getting on and they were very supportive and encouraging.'3. Think of your pocket! Think about the money that you will have when you have quit for one week, one month, six months or one year. Think of something you said you would like or like to do, if you only had the money. It might be buying a treat, getting driving lessons or heading off on a holiday. Focus your attention on this and maybe put a picture up on a wall near a moneybox where you keep the money you save from not smoking or vaping.4. Think of all you will gain Think about how quitting is an investment in you - your health, your wellbeing, your money. Think of the opportunities that will come your way as you quit smoking or vaping. For instance, you might start a new sport or activity; you will have more energy to do the things you love; you will have money to treat yourself. You can do it! Activities TFI/PUB-8 Revision 1 "}
