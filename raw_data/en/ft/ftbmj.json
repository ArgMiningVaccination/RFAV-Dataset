Acid reflux is an irritating condition where stomach acid flows back into your esophagus, leaving a painful feeling in your chest. You may get acid reflux from smoking, overeating, getting stressed, or eating certain foods. While acid reflux can make you feel uncomfortable, drinking aloe juice can help soothe your pain due to its anti-inflammatory and healing properties. As long as you incorporate aloe juice into your daily diet, you should start feeling relief within a few days. Just be sure to talk to your doctor before taking aloe and if you feel any severe symptoms or side effects. Steps Taking Aloe Orally - 1Choose aloe vera juice that doesn't contain aloin or aloe latex. Check online, at pharmacies, or at health-food stores for an organic aloe juice so it's the best quality. Look on the label to ensure that the juice says it's for oral use rather than applied topically. Read the ingredients to make sure the juice doesn't contain any aloin, aloe latex, or artificial preservatives. Search for phrases like \"latex-free\" or \"aloin-free\" on the packaging to ensure the juice is safe to consume. [[1]](#_note-1)X Research source - You can buy aloe juice online or from your local drugstore. - Avoid packages that say \"whole leaf\" since they may also contain aloe latex or aloin. Warning: Aloe latex and aloin may lead to kidney damage or cancer. Even if you take 1 gram (0.035 oz) of aloe latex each day, it could be fatal.

You'll want to drink about 2 fluid ounces of aloe vera gel or juice 20 minutes before you eat. Aloe vera can be quite strong on its own, so if you don't like the flavor, dilute it with water or herbal tea. Alternatively, you can take 1 or 2 aloe vera gel capsules before meals, although these haven't been studied specifically for acid reflux treatment. Keep in mind that taking aloe vera can give you side effects like diarrhea, stomach cramps, and skin rashes. If your symptoms don't improve after 2 weeks of taking aloe vera, visit your doctor so they can work out if something else is causing your acid reflux.
