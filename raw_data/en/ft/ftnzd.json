In an increasingly toxic world, our bodies need all the help they can get. And herbs are an effective way to help support and boost our body's natural systems of detoxification. Here's how our natural systems of detox work and 23 of the best herbs to support your body's everyday detox.

You can read the full disclaimer [here](https://www.botanyculture.com/privacy-policy/). Cleanse vs Detox: What's The Difference? Believe it or not, the practice of detoxing and cleansing can be [traced back to ancient times](https://naturalmeddoc.com/blog/history-of-detoxification/). But let's be real, times are very different. We currently have over [80,000 chemicals](https://www.nrdc.org/issues/toxic-chemicals) approved for use in the United States, none of which were around for our ancestors and many of which haven't been adequately tested for human health safety. Because we're exposed to so many toxins every day, these practices to help rid our bodies of these toxins remain incredibly beneficial in supporting whole-body health, and perhaps even more so! Today, the words \"cleanse\" and \"detox\" are used interchangeably. However, much of the modern wellness community has drawn a subtle line between the two. Both typically focus on eating a healthy diet rich in minimally processed, nutrient-dense whole foods. However, cleansing and detoxing may take on slightly different responsibilities. Cleansing for Better Digestive Health \"Cleansing\" is often used in reference to the digestive system and gut health. If you experience digestive problems such as gas and bloating, indigestion, or constipation, cleansing may be used as a way to help promote better digestive health. This usually involves eliminating certain foods that can be hard on your digestive system. And while these foods may be different for everyone (because our bodies are unique), they typically include foods like dairy, eggs, gluten, grains, soy, refined sugars, and alcohol. After your body has had time to heal and get back to functioning properly, sometimes some of these foods may be slowly reintroduced. In other cases, it may be best to replace these foods with healthier alternatives that are easier on your digestive system. Detoxing for Deep, Cellular-Level Restoration On the other hand, \"detoxing\" refers more to a systematic approach of removing toxins from the body. It essentially takes cleansing to the next level. This approach often shines a spotlight on liver and kidney health, two of the main organs responsible for getting rid of toxins in your body. These toxins can come from our outside environments (eg. air pollution), homes (eg. wall paint, furniture off-gassing, chemical cleaners), beauty products, stress and anxiety, prescription medications, processed foods, and so many other places. In fact, our bodies naturally make their own toxins, referred to as metabolic waste, during routine body functions. As opposed to specifically targeting digestive issues, detoxing is a way to offer yourself deep cellular-level restoration by focusing on nourishing and supporting your body's natural detoxification systems. Sneak-Peak Into How Your Body Naturally Detoxes Our body's natural detoxification abilities are incredibly complex! It's a lot of complex physiology and chemistry heavily influenced by many external factors such as nutrition, lifestyle choices, exposure to environmental toxins, and more. When it comes to natural detoxification, the liver steals the show. However, there are many supporting organs and systems. Meet Your Built-In Detox Team When you really dive deep into the science, you'll quickly realize that your whole entire body is involved in your natural, everyday, behind-the-scenes detoxification. Meet your built-in detox team: - Skin - Your largest detoxification organ, the skin, helps to rid the body of toxins through sweat. Exercise is a way to promote self-cleansing. - Lungs - The lungs help to rid the body of toxins through breathing. - Liver - The liver helps to transform toxins into compounds that we can excrete through your kidneys (via urine) and digestive tract (via stool). The liver is often considered our main detox organ. - Kidneys - The kidneys excrete toxins through urine. - Digestive Tract - Having regular, healthy bowel movements is an important part of eliminating toxins. - Lymphatic System - Your lymphatic system, which is technically part of your immune system, is a circulatory network that helps to cleanse nearly every cell in your body by helping to carry away toxins, metabolic waste (from normal body functions), and more. The Phases of Detoxification, Simplified With all those organs and biological system involved, there's a lot happening to detox our bodies. However, to significantly simplify the incredibly complex miracle of natural detoxification, let's look at how our main detox organ, the liver, works its magic. There are 3 primary phases. - Activation - Phase 1: Enzymes (primarily cytochrome P450) in your liver chemically \"activate\" toxins so that Phase 2 enzymes can then neutralize them. - Conjugation - Phase 2: Phase 2 liver enzymes then neutralize the activated toxins by making them water-soluble. In this form, they're easily be excreted. - Elimination - Phase 3: Proteins are then attached to help transport them out of the cell. Once outside of the cell, they're excreted through urine, stool, or bile. The Ultimate Lifestyle Detox So what's the best way to detox our bodies? The answer is both simple and complex: The ultimate detox is a lifestyle commitment to changing unhealthy habits, eliminating exposures where we can, taking more time for relaxation and self-care, getting more and better sleep, and so much more. And then there's the herbs. Once we've maximized as many of our natural detoxification processes as best we can, we always have the support of the plants. Detoxing is a Long Game & It's All About Self-Care Detoxing is an everyday sort of thing, a whole-body kind of effort. While there are nutritive herbs that we can use to help support our body's natural ability to detox on its own, I have some news that may be disappointing: there's no magic pill. And because we live on a planet that's increasingly becoming more toxic, we have to work for it. But, big bummer aside, the work can be incredibly easy! All we have to do is take care of ourselves and let the herbs help. The Easiest Way to Detox Everyday Before we get to the herbs, here's a noninclusive list of simple things you can do every single day that will help support your body's natural processes of detoxification. - Drink Lots of Water: Without adequate hydration, many of your bodily functions, including those of our organs directly involved in detox will struggle to function. With adequate hydration, the kidneys are self-cleansing. - Eat Lots of Cruciferous Veggies: Cruciferous veggies like broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, kale, and cabbage contain sulfur-rich compounds called glucosinolates that promote natural detoxification. They're also known to help prevent cancer. - Eat More Fiber-Rich Foods: Foods rich in fiber encourage healthy and regular bowel movements and the elimination of toxins through your feces. Otherwise, toxins can be reabsorbed into your bloodstream and sent right back to your liver, making it work harder! - Add More Fresh Herbs & Spices to Your Meals: Fresh herbs and spices, like parsley, cilantro, and ginger, are high in antioxidants that help offset the damaging effects of toxins and support healthy digestion. - Breathe Deeply: Healthy lungs are also self-cleansing. Deep, purposeful breathing can greatly enhance their ability to expel toxins through breath. - Choose Organic When Possible: The chemicals that much of our food is exposed to through conventional growing practices only increase our toxic burden, putting a bigger strain on our detox organs. - Drink More Herbal Teas: Drinking herbal teas is one of the easiest ways to gently help support your body's natural detoxification abilities. You can purchase many pre-mixed teas for detox and cleansing or have some fun and make your own! Check out: [How to Make Your Own Functional Herbal Tea Blends - A Step-By-Step Guide](https://www.botanyculture.com/make-your-own-herbal-tea-blends/) - Enlist Other Herbal Support: And after that, enlist the support of the herbs that have scientifically proven to help support natural detox. >> A Note on Cleansing, Detoxing, & Diet Culture We absolutely cannot talk about cleansing and detoxing without acknowledging the role these often play in diet culture. These words have, in many ways, become brand representatives of an incredibly toxic diet culture that fuels unhealthy relationships with our bodies. They've become trendy marketing expressions tangled deep in a multi-billion dollar diet industry that has proven itself over and over again to be incredibly harmful to us as individuals and as a culture. And while these practices are often used irresponsibly and sometimes dangerously to disguise weight-loss diets, that's not what they were originally intended for. Cleanse and detox should not be used as code words for crash diet. [Diets don't work](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=pX-SBQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=diets+don%27t+work&ots=TW1wUBeocy&sig=4X1ZgQubHsJG2Vjrw_rHLwTNa0g#v=onepage&q=diets%20don't%20work&f=false); they've never worked. But supporting your body's ability to self-cleanse with healthy lifestyle habits and detox-savvy herbs is a safe way to support long-term, whole-body health. Plus, it may even result in healthy and sustainable weight loss. For When You Need Extra Support: 23 of the Best Herbs for Natural Detoxing [Psyllium](#psyllium) | [Turmeric](#turmeric) And yet, while we have incredibly sophisticated natural detoxification processes, sometimes our bodies need a little help. When the toxic burden becomes too great to bear, the herbs are there to help support our organs and systems of natural detoxification. Here are 23 of the best herbs to help support your body's ability to self-cleanse or detox on its own. These herbs work by directly and indirectly supporting our organs and systems of detoxification. Some may be potent anti-inflammatory antioxidants. Others may have a direct action on the liver. And still, others may work by stimulating the digestive process. While many of these are considered to be fairly gentle herbs, always be sure to consult with a licensed health practitioner or practicing clinical herbalist before introducing new herbs into your life. Be especially careful if you're pregnant, nursing, or taking prescription medications. Another thing to note is that this list focuses on the medicinal properties specific to our organs and systems of detoxification. Many of these herbs act on more than one of these organs and systems, and also have other medicinal uses not directly related to detoxification as well. 1. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) Alfalfa is an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant diuretic that can help flush toxins out through urine. - HOW TO USE ALFALFA: A common way to consume alfalfa is to eat alfalfa sprouts!

Gentian (Gentiana lutea) A bitter-tasting root that is anti-inflammatory, helps to stimulate digestion, and increases the flow of bile (important for the breakdown of fats). Gentian is considered to be a very potent herbal bitter and may not be appropriate for long term use or for those that have acute gastric inflammation or irritation. - HOW TO USE GENTIAN: Gentian is easy to take as an [extract](http://aspireiq.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=24&aff_id=3350&url=https://mountainroseherbs.com/gentian-extract)or as part of a classic [herbal bitters blend](http://aspireiq.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=24&aff_id=3350&url=https://mountainroseherbs.com/classic-herbal-bitters).

I really enjoy making overnight cold infusions of nettle leaf, red clover, and oatstraw. These mineral-rich herbs make a nice daily tonic. 19. Rosehips (Rosa spp.) These fruits of the rose plant are incredibly high in vitamin C and powerful antioxidants! Rosehips are particularly nourishing to the digestive system and can help protect against inflammation that may be caused by eating chemical-laden, highly processed foods.

JOHNS WORT: To support detoxification, St. John's wort is most often taken in capsules or as an extract. 22.

It's useful in helping to prevent and alleviate both constipation and diarrhea. And its mucilaginous properties also make it very soothing to the entire digestive tract. - HOW TO USE PSYLLIUM: You'll see both psyllium seeds and husks on the market. Both the whole seed and the husk contain the mucilage beneficial to gut health, however the husks are a little easier to find. Many people will mix powdered psyllium with a little water or add it to juice or a smoothie and consume the fiber this way. The mucilage also acts a fantastic binder and can be used as a replacement for eggs in many baked good. You can also sprinkle psyllium over oatmeal, toast, cereal. 23.
