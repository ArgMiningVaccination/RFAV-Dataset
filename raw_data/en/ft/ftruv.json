Rush employees also commit themselves to executing these values with compassion . This translates into a dedication \u2014 shared by all members of the Rush community \u2014 to providing the highest quality patient care . History of Rush University Medical Center Rush University Medical Center is one of Chicago's oldest health care organizations . Its heritage extends back to 1837, when Rush Medical College was established . St . Luk e's Hospital, founded in 1864, and Presbyterian Hospital, founded in 1883, merged in 1956 to form Presbyterian-St . Luk e's Hospital . The subsequent incorporation of these pioneer institutions in 1969 created Rush-Presbyterian-St . Luk e's Medical Center, which was renamed Rush University Medical Center in October 2003 . Rush is a not-for-profit academic medical center comprising Rush University Medical Center, Rush University, Rush Oak Park Hospital and Rush Health . Renowned Patient Care Rush University Medical Center encompasses a 664-bed hospital serving adults and children, including the Johnston R .

Rush's commitment to sustainability innovation earned the Tower LEED Gold certification . It is the largest new construction health care project in the world to be LEED Gold certified . Rush' s renova - tion also includes Rush's Orthopedic Building, which opened in 2010, and the ongoing campus-wide implementation of an elec- tronic medical record system, enhancing patient care and safety . A unique combination of research and patient care has earned Rush national rankings in seven of 16 specialty areas in U . S . News & World Report's 2015-16 America's Best Hospitals issue, among other recognitions of our quality of care and accreditations . Our nurses are at the forefront of our efforts to provide quality care, receiving Magnet status four times for making outstand- ing nursing care the standard at the Medical Center . Rush w as the first hospital in Illinois serving adults and children to receive Magnet status \u2014 the highest honor in nursing . And some of the world's best athletes trust themselves to the hands of our physicians . Rush is proud to be the preferred hospi - tal for the Chicago Bulls .

Core Values As the academic component of Rush University Medical Center, the University shares the Medical Center's core values: innova- tion, collaboration, accountability, respect and excellence . The I CARE values guide the efforts of Rush University students, faculty and researchers . History of Rush University Rush University is the academic component of Rush University Medical Center . F ounded in 1972, the University has expanded from one college and fewer than 100 students to four colleges and more than 2,500 students . It includes Rush Medical College , Rush University College of Nursing, the College of Health Sciences and the Graduate College . Rush Medical College is named for Benjamin Rush, a physi-cian from Pennsylvania who also signed the Declaration of Independence . Rush Medical College w as chartered in 1837 and opened officially on Dec . 4, 1843, with 22 students enrolled in a 16-week course . During the first century of oper ation, more than 10,000 physicians received their training at Rush Medical College .Rush Medical College was affiliated with the University of Chicago from 1898 until 1942, when the medical college tem- porarily suspended its educational program, though it continued its corporate existence . Its faculty continued undergr aduate and graduate teaching of medicine and the biological sciences as members of the faculty of the University of Illinois . The charter of the medical college was reactivated in 1969, when it became part of the Medical Center . Rush Medical College reopened in 1971 with a class of 66 first-year students and 33 third-year students . First-year class size reached its projected maximum of 120 in 1976 . Rush University College of Nursing represents a com- bined heritage dating back to the late 19th century when its first antecedent, the St . Luk e's Hospital School of Nursing, opened in 1885 to offer diploma education to nurses . In 1903, the Presbyterian Hospital School of Nursing accepted its first students . F rom 1956 to 1968, nurses were taught at the merged Presbyterian-St . Luk e's Hospital School of Nursing . Before the establishment of the College of Nursing in 1972, more than 7,000 nurses had graduated from these three schools . The College of Health Sciences, established in 1975, traces its origins to the School of Medical Technology sponsored by Presbyterian-St . Luk e's Hospital from 1959 to 1972 . This school was the second largest of its kind in the city of Chicago . During its operation, it provided a one-year professional internship program to more than 200 baccalaureate students in medical technology . Today, the College of Health Sciences offers doctoral programs in audiology and health sciences, 10 programs at the master's level, and bachelor's programs in health sciences, imag - ing sciences and vascular ultrasound technology . The Graduate College was established as a separate aca-demic unit in January 1981, having previously been organized as the Graduate School within the College of Health Sciences . The Graduate College is responsible for educational programs in the basic sciences and offers master's and doctoral degrees in 12 disciplines . The Seal of Rush University The seal of Rush University is a shield, a classic Greek symbol of preservation and protection and also a medieval British emblem used for identification . As such, it recognizes the University's over - arching commitment to educating 10 11 practice is based in knowledge . The shadow in the background is the anchor cross, a symbol of hope and steadfastness, which became the emblem of the merged Presbyterian and St . Luk e's hospitals in 1957, and the foundation that created the vision for Rush University . Superimposed on top is the stylized version of the anchor cross that was adopted in 1971 upon the merger of Rush Medical College and Presbyterian-St . Luk e's Hospital . The final elements are Chicago, the city that is home to the University, and the date of the University's founding, 1972 . The Rush University Board of Overseers adopted the seal in 1999 .

At Rush, these initiatives are focused on strong recruitment, development and retention efforts, not on quotas \u2014 and these recruitment and programming efforts will be continued, consis - tent with federal, state and municipal guidelines . Rush University is committed to attracting students who will enable the student body to achieve the educational benefits of diversity and to providing services to all students, faculty and other employees on a nondiscriminatory, equitable basis .

As essential as academic honesty is to the relationship of trust fundamental to the educational process, academic dishonesty violates one of the most basic ethical principles of an academic community, and will result in sanctions imposed under the University's disciplinary system .Examples of conduct that would subject a student to disciplinary action include but are not limited to: All forms of academic dishonesty , including but not lim - ited to cheating; plagiarism; collusion; gaining or seeking unfair advantage in relation to any work submitted; helping others to gain an unfair advantage; removing examination materials from a secure examination area; the unauthor - ized downloading or copying of examinations that are given online; fabricating assigned academic work, including clinical assessments, and presenting them as authentic; facilitating academic dishonesty; unauthorized examination behavior Obstruction or disruption of teaching, research, adminis - tration, clinical practice and community outreach or other University/Medical Center activities F alsification of student records, transcripts or financial aid forms or applications T heft of or damage to University/Medical Center property or the property of a member of the University/Medical Center community T hreatened or physical abuse of any person, or action that threatens or endangers the safety of others Misrepresentation, falsification, alteration or misuse of University/Medical Center documents, records or identifica-tion, or research data Unauthorized use of or entry into University/Medical Center facilities Conviction of a crime deemed serious enough to render the student unfit to pursue the profession the student is prepar - ing to enter Conduct that is inconsistent with the ethical code of the profession the student is preparing to enter Unlawful use or possession of controlled substances on the Medical Center campus Unauthorized possession or concealment of firearms or other weapons on Medical Center premises at any time Attempting to gain access to another' s email or computer account, username or password Knowingly setting off false fire , safety or security alarms An accusation of student and/or faculty academic dishonesty or misconduct made in bad faith Rush University Honor Code The Rush University Honor Code is as follows: I pledge that my academic, research and/or clinical work will be of the highest integrity . I shall neither give nor receive unauthorized aid; I shall not represent the work of others as my own; I shall not engage in scientific misconduct, and I shall treat all persons with the great- est respect and dignity, just as the ethical codes of Rush University Medical Center and my future profession demand . I recognize that behaviors that impede learning or undermine aca- demic, research and clinical evaluation, including but not limited to falsification, fabrication and plagiarism, are inconsistent with Rush University values and must be reported . Implementation of the Honor Code This Honor Code (from now on referred to as the Code) sets the standards for expected professional behavior within the University and the Medical Center . Commitment to this Code is a shared responsibility of all faculty, staff and students within the Rush University community to ensure the highest standards of behavior, whether in the classroom, the laboratory or the clinical setting, and to ensure that education obtained at Rush provides a sound foun-dation for each student's future success as an academic, scientific or healthcare professional . Code Enforcement Any violations of this Code or suspicion of student or academic misconduct should be reported to the student's college for further review in accordance with the procedures specified by that college . Each college will be expected to set standards for addressing Honor Code violations and cases of misconduct in a fair and consistent manner that best fits its respective student population . Students refusing to sign must submit a letter to their dean's office explain-ing why, and adherence to the Code is required for matriculation, whether or not the document has been signed . The Code may also be enforced for off-campus actions when the student is represent- ing himself or herself as a member of the University . Commitment By signing below, I affirm my commitment to this Code and pledge to act with integrity and adhere to the Rush University values of Innovation, Collaboration, Accountability, Respect and Excellence . I understand that this signed document becomes part of my perma-nent record, and I must uphold the letter and spirit of this Code throughout my Rush education . Inappropriate Degree Usage A student may not refer to himself or herself as having earned a specific degree until all of the following are accomplished: All degree requirements have been successfully completed . A completed Degree Approval Form has been submitted to the Office of the Registrar . T he official date of graduation for a particular term has been reached . A student who disregards this policy will be referred to the commit- tee that addresses professional ethics violations for that student's program or college .28 29 Continuous Enrollment Rush University requires continuous enrollment in the majority of its academic programs from the time a student matriculates through a student's graduation . Exemptions for the summer term only include both first-year medical students and Health Systems Management majors . Students who are not officially enrolled or have not submitted a Petition for Leave of Absence or a Voluntary Withdrawal form risk being administratively with - drawn from the University . A student enrolled in a noncredit residency or academic enrich-ment program prior to receipt of his or her degree must be registered for the Continuous Enrollment course to retain his or her student status . Any degree or certificate student not enrolling in a new course but needing to replace an outstanding incomplete grade must register for the Continuous Enrollment course until the grade is satisfied . A student who is auditing a course and not allowed in other courses during the same term must register for the Continuous Enrollment course to be charged appropriately . Credit by Proficiency A student who passes a proficiency examination at Rush University will earn academic credit toward the degree . Programs have the discretion to offer credit by proficiency (e .g ., standardized examinations such as ACT-PEP Challenge or Advanced Placement exams) and/or achieved prior learning (such as Continuing Education Units) . Rush Medical College does not offer credit by proficiency . Credit by proficiency and/or achieved prior learning is based upon documented equivalence with courses offered by the program . The minimum standards and format for demonstrat - ing proficiency are determined by program faculty . F ormats for demonstrating proficiency may include departmentally devel-oped examinations, licensure/certification exams, portfolios and competency demonstrations . Credit awarded by proficiency will equal the credit value of the course(s) as listed in the Rush University Catalog under which the student matriculated . Information that is posted on the transcript for approved credit is the prefix, number, and title of the course section, the credits awarded, and the grade of \"K\" . Credit for the course will appear in the appropriate term as credit earned . Credit earned by this mechanism will not be used in calculating the student's grade point average (GPA) . A fee or partial tuition related to what the student would have been charged may be assessed .Academic Credit Academic credit is awarded to a student upon the success-ful completion of an approved instructional course or by the demonstration of competencies, proficiencies, or fulfillment of learning outcomes equivalent to that provided by an approved instructional course . One unit of academic credit is the measure of the total time commitment a typical student is expected to devote to learning per week of study . Total time devoted to learning includes but is not limited to classroom or faculty instruction in either a synchronous or asyn- chronous mode; time devoted to individual conferences with instructors; reading and completion of learning activities and assignments; posting in online discussion forums; performance demonstrations; examinations; work associated with comple- tion or dissertations; labora - tory work; clinical practica; or any other activity required of the student . One hour of credit is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that reasonably approximates not less than one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approxi- mately 15 weeks for one semester or one trimester hour of credit or 10 to 12 weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent of at least 37 .5 hours of work for one semester or one trimester hour of credit or 25 hours of work for one quarter hour of credit . In this context, an hour of work is defined as 50 minutes . Course credits are not calculated for Rush Medical College and second- or third-year Physician Assistant Studies courses; how- ever, the number of weeks of clinical experiences appears on the student's transcript . Credit hour assignment for time spent in clinical practica, internships, seminars and laboratory work vary according to college or program requirements . Grade Point Average A grade point average (GPA) is not reported for Rush Medical College students . Transfer credits from institutions outside of Rush University are not included in the GPA calculation . Transfer credits internal to Rush University are included in the GPA calculation . Separ ate GPAs are calculated for a student's under - graduate and graduate records . The GPA is calculated using all grades in courses that could count toward the program . The GPA is recalculated from zero when a student successfully completes a program and matriculates into a new program at the graduate or professional level . Transcripts show the GPA for each term in Grading and Numbering System Gr ade P oints Description A 4 . 0 Excellent B 3 . 0 Good C 2 . 0 Satisfactory for undergr aduates but may not be acceptable at the graduate level D 1 . 0 Minimal pass for some undergr aduate programs . May not be acceptable at gr aduate level . Not used at the gr aduate level by the College of Nursing, the Graduate College, or the Department of Health Systems Management . F 0 F ailure P 0 P assing HP 0 High P ass (only used by Rush Medical College for third- and fourth-year clinical courses) N 0 No P ass H 0 Honors (only used by Rush Medical College) W 0 Withdrew between weeks 2 through 5; also used by Rush Medical College when a circumstance beyond the student' s control prevents completion of course requirements regardless of withdrawal date during the quarter K 0 Credit earned through proficiency examination T 0 Credit accepted in tr ansfer from another college/university CIP/IP 0 Course in progress and gr ade not reported I 0 Incomplete NR 0 No Record (not used after summer 2009) CC 0 Course continues into the next term . Gr ade received at end of series is grade for entire course . AU 0 Audit XX 0 P articipation in an ungraded course or residency XIP 0 Mandatory tr aining course completion is in progress . XC 0 Satisfactory completion of mandatory tr aining coursewhich grade points are earned and show a cumulative GPA for all work taken at Rush University for each program degree level . When a course is repeated, only the most recent attempt is computed in the GPA, although all grades will display on the transcript . No grade points are assigned for work taken on a pass/no pass basis, and therefore such work is not computed in the GPA . Undergraduate students who are required to enroll in courses that typically are taught at the graduate level will have these courses count toward their undergraduate programs of study; thus the credits and grade points will be calculated as part of the undergraduate transcript . Grade Report Students can access RUConnected for their grade report . Gr ade reports are not mailed to students . Printed copies of a student' s grade report are unofficial and intended for the student's personal use and should not be accepted by another college/ university in lieu of an official transcript .30 31 Graduation and Commencement Registration Students must be registered for the term in which they graduate . Application for Graduation Only Rush University students who are candidates for a degree may participate in the commencement ceremony . Certificate candidates are ineligible to participate . Although Rush University has multiple graduation dates during which degrees are conferred, the University has only one com - mencement ceremony . Students are invited to participate in the commencement cer - emony if either of the following is true: T hey graduated in the fall, winter or spring term immediately preceding the current academic year's ceremony . T hey are anticipated to graduate at the end of the spring or summer terms that immediately follow the current academic year's ceremony . Doctoral students writing a dissertation must provide the title of their dissertation by the date indicated on the Degree Approval Form in order to have that title included in the commencement program . Publication of a student's name, academic credentials and/or dissertation title in the commencement program does not indicate that a degree has been officially conferred by Rush University . Students must be registered for the term in which they graduate . All degree-seeking students must submit both Intent to Graduate and Degree Approval forms to the Office of the Registrar by the published deadlines . Students who do not submit either the Intent to Graduate form or the Degree Approval form by the published deadline risk a delayed graduation and may be charged a processing fee . The student's signature on the Intent to Graduate form signals that the student is ready to graduate; allows, only for purposes of the ceremony, the release of directory information restric-tions enacted by the student through his or her signature on the Directory Information Restriction form; permits Rush University to release the student's name and address to the external photography vendor with whom Rush contracts and to have the vendor place photographs of the student on its website; permits the University to publish the student's picture in a picture com-posite; for medical students, permits publication of the student's name, photograph, prior degrees and universities/colleges attended in the Rush Medical College yearbook; and permits Rush University to print and/or announce the following: Student' s name as indicated on the Intent to Graduate form Honors or aw ards received Previous colleges/universities attended Prior degrees earned The Degree Approval form must be submitted after all academic degree requirements are completed . These include the following: All progr am prerequisites, including general education requirements All courses required in the major progr am of study and completion of required cumulative credit hours Residency requirements Dissertation/thesis defense (if required by college) Submission of the dissertation/thesis to the libr ary (if applicable) Achievement of the minimum cumulative GP A of 2 . 0 for undergraduate and 3 .0 for graduate students (not applicable to Rush Medical College) The student's transcript, diploma and other notification of degree conferrals will be held until a student's financial obligation has been met . Outstanding financial obligations have no effect on the awarding of degrees . Rush University degrees are dated the day following the last day of the term in which the degree requirements are com- pleted . Degree requirements must be fully met before the next term officially begins; otherwise, the student will be required to register for the subsequent term and will graduate at the end of that term . Candidates for the Bachelor of Science degree who have demon-strated academic excellence are honored at commencement by the Rush University faculty . Those earning a 3 . 40 to 3 . 59 cumula - tive grade point average at Rush are awarded the Bachelor of Science degree cum laude; 3 .60 to 3 .79, magna cum laude; 3 .80 to 4 .00, summa cum laude . Only Rush University courses are calculated into the GPA . Latin honors appear on the student' s transcript and diploma and are typically announced during the graduation exercises including the commencement ceremony and at college/departmental convocation/awards ceremonies . Awarding of Degrees Rush University degrees are dated the day following the last day of the term in which the degree requirements are completed . Degree requirements must be fully met before the next term offi-cially begins; otherwise, the student will be required to register for the subsequent term and will graduate at the end of that term . The student's transcript, diploma and other notification of degree conferrals will be held until a student's financial obligation has been met . Outstanding financial obligations have no effect on the awarding of degrees .

Only Rush University courses are calculated into the GPA . Latin honors appear on the student' s transcript and diploma and are typically announced during the graduation exercises, including the commencement ceremony and at college/ departmental convocation/awards ceremonies . Graduation Prizes and Awards Many prizes and awards are given at the time of graduation . Award winners are identified in the commencement ceremony pro-gram and in college/departmental convocation/awards ceremony programs . Thesis/Dissertation/Scholarly Project Requirements for Graduation Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) candidates must complete a disser - tation . The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program requires completion of a scholarly project . Some master' s programs require a thesis to meet degree requirements . Each thesis/dissertation/scholarly project must be original and can - not have been used to meet the requirement of any other degree, either at Rush University or at any other university . Each student will have a committee whose role is to assure that the student's thesis/dissertation/scholarly project is of high quality and meets the standards of the program and the University for originality, contribution to the field, and scholarly presentation . Review of a thesis/dissertation/scholarly project will follow the sequence of steps as described by each college, including the prescribed preparation manual for each degree . Students must give a public presentation of the knowledge devel-oped through the thesis/dissertation/scholarly project process to the academic community . Public presentation of the thesis/dissertation/scholarly project must precede the final approval by the thesis or dissertation committee . A copy of the thesis/dissertation must be approved by the director of the Library of Rush University Medical Center for conformance to publishing requirements and copyright compliance . Scholarly projects are not reviewed by the library .Hazardous Exposure Procedures A hazardous exposure incident is defined as follows: eye, mouth, mucous membrane, non-intact skin contact or parenteral expo-sure to blood or potentially infectious or hazardous materials that result from the performance of a duty related to a student's educational program .

Students must comply with annual health and immunization requirements . Students who do not submit the proper proof of fulfilled health and immunization requirements by the designated deadline will be prohibited from registering for the next term and may be disengaged from the program until these requirements are met . Late registr ation fees will apply . Students should be aw are that clinical sites outside of Rush may have additional requirements . Students with a medical or religious exemption will be required to adhere to state and hospital policies concerning infection control . Incomplete Grades The grade of incomplete (\"I\") is given only when circumstances beyond the student's control prevent completion of course requirements and the student has received permission to defer completion of these unmet course requirements . Students must be enrolled during the term in which course requirements are completed . Students enrolling only to complete requirements for a course in which a grade of incomplete was given must register for the Continuous Enrollment course (XXX 999) for zero credit hours . Upon completion of the course require - ments, the \"I\" grade will be replaced by the new grade earned in the course . A student receiving a grade of \"I\" in a course may not begin another course for which the incomplete course is a prerequisite . A student who fails to remove the incomplete grade within the specified time period will receive a final grade of \"F\" or \"N\" in the course . It is the student' s responsibility to pursue the comple - tion of an incomplete grade Students in the College of Nursing, the College of Health Sciences, and the Graduate College and students-at-large must complete the unmet course requirements, typically within one term after the term in which the incomplete grade was assigned and not to exceed one calendar year, unless an extension is approved . Students in the College of Nursing may not register for new courses if they have two or more incomplete grades . Rush Medical College students will be informed by the course instructor and the Office of Medical Student Programs regarding the specific time frame in which an incomplete grade must be resolved . Additional college-specific policies may apply . Pass/No Pass Grading Option Designated letter-grade courses may be taken as pass/no pass based on approval by the course/program director . The pass/no pass option is college and course specific, as is the proportion of courses that can be taken pass/no pass . The decision to take a course for a pass/no pass grade cannot be changed after the first Friday of the term .Repeated Courses Some courses, such as research and clinical courses, may be repeated . These are usually indicated in the course description . All grades and grade points are counted in the GPA for these courses . F or all other courses that are repeated, only the most recent grade is counted in the GPA . Both the original course and the repeated course appear on the student's transcript . Repeated Courses: Rush Medical College All instances of a course are represented on the student's official transcript . Course and exam remediations are also represented . Room Reservations To schedule the use of classrooms, lecture halls and auditoriums in the Armour Academic Center, individuals should request a room from the Office of the Registrar . The Office of the Registrar will assist in making room reservations for classes, meetings and campus events based on room availability . Priority for rooms is given to instructional/class meetings, followed by standing meet-ings, ad hoc meetings, student organizations and other requests on a first-come, first-served basis . Student events must have the approval of the Office of Student Life regarding the date and time of the event and either the orga-nization faculty sponsor's or the Office of Student Life's verifica- tion regarding the sponsorship of the event . RULearning (Blackboard) RULearning (Blackboard) is a web-based learning system for course management and delivery . Instructors may use Blackboard to provide students with course materials, discussion boards, online exams, virtual chats and more . The degree to which Blackboard is used in a course varies . Some courses may be conducted entirely online through Blackboard, without any on-campus sessions, while others may use Blackboard as a supple- ment to face-to-face sessions . Account Creation Students will have RULearning accounts created for them auto- matically . Students will gain access to their R ULearning account approximately a month prior to their first term at Rush, but typically will not be able to review course content until the term begins . Account Deactivation RULearning accounts for students will remain active for the dura- tion of their affiliation with the University . Students' accounts will be deactivated 14 days after their graduation or their affiliation with the University ends .Course Availability and Retention Courses in RULearning are available to students on the start date of the term . Courses will be retained in RULearning for one year past their expected end date . At the end of this period of time, courses will be archived and removed from RULearning . Students will be informed how to download relevant information from their courses that they might need after leaving Rush . System Availability The Blackboard system is available on campus via the Rush net- work and off campus via public Internet . System maintenance is performed every Sunday between 2 a .m . and 6 a . m . Centr al time . The system may be unavailable during this time .

Students are not allowed to take Rush Medical College courses as a student-at-large . Students are not allowed to take clinical courses as a student-at-large . An instructor is not obligated to accept a student-at-large in his or her class . A final grade will be assigned to any course taken as a student-at-large . Individuals should be sure they have the appropriate preparation to take any courses they register for as students-at-large . Students in degree or certificate programs have enrollment prior - ity over students-at-large . Students-at-large may be removed from a course if degree- or certificate-seeking students need to enroll in that class . If a student-at-large is removed from a class that he or she has already paid for, a full refund will be issued . A student may accumulate no more than 12 credit hours of academic credit as a student-at-large . These hours may be taken within one term or over a period of time . Registr ation as a student-at-large that results in more than the allowable number of hours in the student-at-large status can only be authorized by the dean or associate dean of the college offering the course(s) . Credit earned as a student-at-large will not necessarily apply toward a Rush degree, if the individual is subsequently admitted to a degree program .34 35 Any incomplete (\"I\") grade earned as a student-at-large will revert to a permanent failing grade (\"F\") unless completed by the end of the next academic term . It is the student' s responsi - bility to pursue the completion of an incomplete grade . Student-at-Large applications are only accepted during the designated priority registration period for continuing students for the term in question . Late forms will only be accepted if authorized by the dean or associate dean of the college offering the course(s) . Student-at-Large applications will only be processed with full tuition payment and all appropriate approvals . Students-at-large who qualify for Rush University Medical Center employee LEAP tuition assistance must have applied for LEAP tuition assistance by the end of the designated prior - ity registration period for continuing students for the term in question . Please note that the designated priority registr ation period may end earlier than the normal LEAP tuition assistance deadline for degree- or certificate-seeking students . Students cannot be admitted to a Rush University degree or certificate program if they have had a probationary event as a student-at-large . Students who have already been admitted when a probationary event occurs will have their admission rescinded or be dismissed from the program . In order to be considered for admission, an applicant must be considered in good academic standing . Student Email Accounts Rush University creates an email account for each student prior to the student's first term . Students are expected to check their email account with regular frequency because Rush University considers email an official means of communication . Often, students are notified of important news and deadlines via the campus email system . Students should also use their Rush email account to communicate with faculty and staff instead of send - ing an email using a personal email account . Should problems arise with a student's email account, the student should contact the Help Desk at (312) 942-4357 or via email at help@rush .edu . Graduates of Rush University and students who end their affili-ation with Rush prior to graduation should have access to their Rush email account for 14 days after graduation .

The Armour Academic Center building opens at 5:30 a .m . and is locked at 7:00 p . m . , Monday through Friday . On Saturday , the building opens at 8:00 a .m . and is lock ed at 1:30 p . m . The building is closed on Sundays and holidays . If a special event is going on in the building or a special request is made, the opening and closing times may change . As always, any visitor may enter Rush through the main visitor entrance in the Atrium building and request a visitor pass . In order to make it easier for students to enter the Armour Academic Center after the building has been locked at night and to utilize new and extended-hour study spaces, an ID card reader has been installed on the ground floor of the Armour Academic Center near the Rush University Bookstore . Rush students, faculty and employees may utilize this card reader . Temporary ID badges are available in the event that authorized personnel have forgotten their original ID . Students may obtain a temporary ID 8 a .m . to 4 p . m . Monday through F riday at the Rush Security Office . The temporary ID will allow access for a 24-hour period .

P aulina St . , Suite 440, Chicago, IL 60612 . F ax requests are honored at (312) 942- 2310 . The letter or fax must include the handwritten signature of the student . Five to six business days should typically be allowed for processing .36 37 Transcript requests by Rush Medical College students to be used in support of residency applications should be made to the Office of Medical Student Programs rather than to the Office of the Registrar . A Medical Student Performance Evaluation letter is included with these requests . Copies issued to students will be stamped in red ink as \"Issued to Student .\" All transcripts bear the signature of the University registrar . Transfer Credit Rush University may accept up to 90 quarter hours or 60 semes-ter hours of credit toward General Education and other lower- level course requirements . Graduate-level transfer credit is subject to the approval of the major advisor, program or division director, or designated college administrator based on an evaluation of quality and equivalence . For graduate-level programs, no more than one-third of the total number of required credits may be granted to a student as trans - fer credit for work done at another graduate institution . Rush University will not refuse to consider transfer credit based on the accreditation of the sending institution . Continuing Education Units cannot be transferred in for credit . Undergraduate courses must be completed with a \"C\" or better to be awarded transfer credit . Graduate courses must be completed with a \"B\" or better to be awarded transfer credit . Only letter-graded courses are eligible for evaluation as transfer credit; pass/no pass courses will not be considered . Undergraduate-level courses cannot be transferred to meet the requirements of a course taught at the graduate level at Rush . Transfer credits can only be applied to satisfy the degree require- ments of one program . Once applied, they cannot be used a second time for a new degree program . Previously earned program credits at Rush University may only be used to satisfy the requirements of another program if they are at the same level (e . g . , master's or PhD) and if they meet the current curricular standards . The number of credits granted for a given course cannot exceed the number awarded for the course on the transcript of the school where the course was taken or the number earned for the corresponding course at Rush University . Credits earned on the quarter system will be converted into semester credits where applicable . A quarter credit is equal to two-thirds of a semester credit (e . g . , three quarter-system credits equal two semester credits) . Course information (including grades) from transferred courses is not recorded on the student's transcript; only the number of cred- its is recorded and added to the cumulative number of credits .Enrollment Enrollment Status Definitions Students who are working toward a degree or certificate and who are enrolled at least half-time may be eligible for student financial assistance . These students may also be eligible to have their federal educational loans deferred . Students are considered full-time or half-time based on the criteria below . Full-Time Registration for PhD Students A full-time PhD student is one who is matriculated and meets the conditions for each term noted below: Registers for nine or more gr aduate credit hours in an academic term; or Registers for a minimum of two hours of dissertation course work in a fall, spring, or summer term . Note: A student may register for additional courses as needed or required, but if the student registers for less than nine hours, this must include a minimum of two hours in dissertation hours to be considered full-time . A student must be registered for one of the above-defined statuses during the fall, winter, spring or summer term sessions to maintain status as a full-time matriculated student . Individual gr aduate programs may set guidelines on research enrollments, including which academic milestones should be passed before a student is permitted to enroll in dissertation hours . Once students successfully defend their dissertation, no further research enrollments are necessary or allowable, and graduation should not be deferred . Each student will be allowed one term of enrollment to finalize all work related to the defense of the dissertation . During this term, the student should apply for graduation, and graduation should not be deferred beyond this point . Effective fall 2015, all dissertation courses will be corrected to be similarly named following university guidelines and hold fixed credit hours starting at a minimum of 2 .0, thereby always confer - ring full-time status . Students should contact the Office of Financial Aid about full-time status for financial aid purposes .Registration Adding/Dropping Courses The first Friday of the term is the last day a course can be added through RUConnected without instructor approval . A course dropped during the first week of the term will not appear on the student's transcript . After that date, one of the following applies: Course(s) dropped beginning in week 2 (the fourth week prior to the end of the term) will be issued a grade of \"W\" for the course . F or course(s) dropped during the three weeks prior to the end of the term, the student will receive the grade earned for the course work . No course may be dropped after the last day of classes or after a final evaluation of the student has been delivered . No with - drawals are allowed during the final examination period . Rush Medical College students wishing to change their clinical schedules must contact the Office of Medical Student Programs at least four weeks before the start of the scheduled rotation . For additional information concerning tuition refunds, please refer to Financial Affairs: Tuition Refund Policy . Auditing a Course A student wishing to attend a course without completing all the requirements for credit must register to audit the course with permission of the program director . If space in a class is limited, continuing and new students have priority . Registration in a course cannot be changed from audit to credit or from credit to audit after the first week of the term . Fees associated with auditing a course are listed in the Tuition and Fee Schedule . Auditing of laboratory or clinical courses is prohibited . An auditing student must be aware of the following: An auditing student may participate in class discussion only at the invitation of the course director . An auditing student is prohibited from taking examinations . An auditing student is expected to attend class . An audited course will appear on the student's transcript with the designation of \"AU\" . If the student does not attend the class , a grade of \"W\" will be assigned . A student who has audited a course may not apply for credit for that course at a later time . Earning a gr ade and receiving credit for the course can only occur by enrolling in and paying for the course during the term it is offered . Rush Medical College does not allow students to audit Rush Medical College courses except with the permission of Committee on Student Evaluation and Promotion .Course Schedule The course schedule is available through the RUConnected stu- dent portal . Typically, the course schedule will be available one week before the priority registration period begins . The Office of the Registrar will generally send an email announcement to students' Rush University email accounts regarding availability of the course schedule . Registr ation dates and deadlines are also published in the academic calendar . Changes to the course schedule, including updates to meet-ing times, instructors, classrooms and added/closed/canceled courses, will be updated in RUConnected . Independent Study If a student wants to register for independent study, the educa-tion coordinator or course instructor offering the course must approve the course and its objectives . Then the student forwards the independent study course request form, including the instructor, course title, course description, number of credit hours and grading system, to the Office of the Registrar . The Office of the Registrar will create the course in the student information system . Once the course has been created, the Office of the Registrar will inform the education coordinator or course instructor of the status of the course . The education coor - dinator or course instructor will inform the student when the course is available, and the student will register for the course using RUConnected . Nursing students complete an Independent Study Contract form, which is available in the Office of the Registrar or online . On this form the objectives of the study are defined, and a plan to meet those objectives is described . This form should be completed and approved by the preceptor, the department chair and the program director no later than the first day of the term in which the independent study is to be taken . The student's preceptor keeps the contract . Health Systems Management students also complete a separate independent study form, which is available in the Department of Health Systems Management . Registration Process The course schedule for each term is available on the RUConnected student portal . Classes are filled on a first-come, first-served basis according to the following order of priority: 1 . Continuing students 2 . New students 3 . Students-at-large It is the responsibility of continuing students to register using RUConnected each term during the priority registration period Full-time Half-time Medical Students All enrolled medical students are considered full-time . Graduate Students 9 credit hours 4 . 5 credit hours Undergraduate Students 12 credit hours 6 credit hours38 39 for continuing students . Late fees will be applied to students who register during the late registration period . To register for any given term, students cannot have a registra- tion hold (i .e . , missing transcripts, missing/out-of-date - nizations, insurance waivers, financial holds, etc .) . If the hold is removed before the end of the registration period, the student can register without penalty . If the hold is not removed by the end of the registration period, the student will need to register with the Office of the Registrar as soon as the hold is resolved and will be assigned a late registration fee . Registration is complete only when tuition and other charges for the term are paid or satisfactory arrangements for payment are made . Tuition is always due on the first day of the term . Students who register for a class and subsequently decide to withdraw without completing an Add/Drop, Leave of Absence or Voluntary Withdrawal form will receive a failing grade (\"F\" or \"N\") for that course . Withdrawal/Leave of Absence Administrative Withdrawal Administrative withdrawal refers to a permanent departure from the University that is University-initiated and without expecta- tion of the student's return . Rush University requires continuous enrollment in most of its programs from the time a student matriculates through a stu- dent's graduation . Students are required to be registered each term or on an approved leave of absence . If the student has decided to withdraw from Rush, voluntary withdrawal paper - work must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar before the voluntary withdrawal will become official . A student who is not registered or on an approved leave of absence or who has not submitted paperwork to voluntarily withdraw will be adminis-tratively withdrawn from the University at the end of the term in which the student stopped attending . The administrative with - drawal is posted to the student's transcript . Should the student wish to return to Rush in the future, the student will need to apply for readmission . Voluntary Withdrawal Voluntary withdrawal refers to a permanent departure from the University that is student-initiated and without expectation of the student's return . After matriculation to Rush University, a student may not arbi- trarily cease registration . All students are required to maintain continuous enrollment or risk administrative withdrawal due to unexplained nonregistration .Any student withdrawing from the University must give formal notification by completing a Petition for Withdrawal or Leave of Absence form, which requires the student to obtain specific signatures . The Office of the Registrar is the designated office that a student must notify if he or she wishes to withdraw from the University . The Petition for Withdrawal or Leave of Absence form may be obtained from the Office of the Registrar or online . The official date used in processing the form is the date that the student begins the withdrawal process . Withdrawal forms submitted during the current term for the next term or during a break period will use the day after the end of the current term as the official withdrawal date that will be used for processing the form . A student may not withdraw from classes during the last three weeks of any term . A student who submits a voluntary withdrawal form during the last three weeks of the term will receive grades in the courses for which he or she is registered . Official withdrawal from the University entitles a student to a tuition refund from the first through the fifth weeks of the term (see the Tuition Refund Policy in the Financial Affairs section of this catalog) . No other fees are refundable . The lower refund per - centage is valid beginning the next Monday morning at midnight . Leave of Absence After matriculation to Rush University, a student may not arbi- trarily cease registration without notice . All students are required to maintain continuous enrollment or risk administrative with- drawal after one term due to unexplained nonregistration . A leave of absence (LOA) is approved and granted for the term for which the LOA is requested or as otherwise approved by the college . It is the student's responsibility to communicate directly with his or her college regarding the disposition of the request for the LOA . Students who request a LOA may be displaced into a subsequent cohort, required to take a revised program of study upon return to the University or be delayed in their progression through the program based on availability of courses and/or clini - cal placements . Students may be eligible for a LOA only after they have completed and submitted the Petition for Leave of Absence required by each college or program to the Office of the Registrar . F ailure to com - plete and submit the Petition for Leave of Absence form will make the student ineligible for any refunds and obligate him or her for the full term's insurance charges . The date that the student begins the process of applying for a LOA is the official date that will be used in processing the form . The day after the end of the current term will be the official date used in processing a Petition for Leave of Absence form submitted during the current term for the next term or during a break period .For all approved LOAs, the last date of actual class attendance will be the date of record for calculating financial aid disburse- ments and returns . A student who initiates a Petition for Leave of Absence form after the first week of the term will receive a withdrawal grade on the transcript for any course work . No classes may be withdrawn during the last three weeks of any term . A student who initiates a Petition for Leave of Absence form on or after the Monday beginning the last three weeks of the term will receive grades in the courses for which he or she is registered and will be subject to an academic progression review based upon the assigned grades . Each degree has a time limit for completion that includes time away on a LOA . The decision to include the LOA in calculating the time limits for completion of the degree is within the discretion of each college . The maximum length of time that will be approved for a single LOA is 12 consecutive months . Each college may have a maximum length of accumulated LOA . Returning From a Leave of Absence Students are responsible for registering themselves for the term in which they are returning from an approved LOA . This registra - tion must occur during the designated priority registration period . Registration outside of this period will result in a late registration fee . It is the student' s responsibility to consult with his or her advisor/program director regarding required courses for the term of re-entry . Rush Medical College students should consult with the appropriate assistant dean to determine required courses . Students must satisfy the conditions of the LOA before re-enter - ing and must comply with all policies, requirements and course sequences in effect at the time of re-entry . A request to extend a LOA requires that a new clearance form be submitted . A request to extend a LOA requires only the signatures of the student's program director/advisor or a designated admin - istrator of the college . The completed form must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar no later than the first Friday of the term for which the extension is being requested . Students who cannot return and who do not have an extension of a LOA approved must withdraw from the institution . Students who fail to return from their LOA on the date that was originally approved risk administrative withdrawal . Student Records Name, Address and Phone Number Changes Rush University requires that student academic records exist under the student's legal name .The Office of the Registrar maintains the current official listing of student names and addresses for Rush University . It is each student's responsibility to keep the Office of the Registrar informed of changes to this information . Name changes require official documentation verifying the new name at the time of the request . Examples of official docu - mentation verifying a new name include valid driver's license, marriage license (the official government document), passport, Social Security card, court order or dissolution decree . Privacy and Confidentiality of Student Records and FERPA Rush University takes seriously its commitment to protect the privacy of its students and their education records . In addition to upholding the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), Rush University has taken further steps to protect a person's privacy by extending benefits similar to those afforded to enrolled students under FERPA to individuals who are applying for admission . If a specific priv acy/confidentiality question is not answered in this text, please contact the Office of the Registrar . Nothing in this policy may be construed to prohibit the University from disclosing information provided to the institu-tion under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act concerning sex offenders who are required to register . Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) FERPA is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of students' educational records . Educational records are those that contain information or documentation directly related to a student that is recorded in any way, including records produced by handwriting, computer, email, audio, video, etc . Educational records contain information directly related to a student, and are maintained by Rush University or any party acting on its behalf . FERPA protects the privacy of students' educational records by setting forth strict instructions and limitations governing the release of information about students . Although FERPA contains exceptions for the release of \"directory information\" without a student's prior written consent, students have the right to request that even such directory information be withheld from disclosure to third parties . Given the restrictions of FERPA, faculty and staff should assume that all students must provide written consent that follows the format specified in FERPA before any educational records may be released to anyone other than the student . Information cannot be released to any third party, including the student's parents, relatives and friends . P articularly sensitive information includes students' Social Security numbers, race or ethnicity, 40 41 gender, nationality, academic performance, disciplinary records, financial aid information and grades . Privacy During the Admissions Process Rush University has chosen to take additional steps to pro- tect a person's privacy by extending benefits similar to those afforded to enrolled students to individuals who are applying for admission . This privacy protection covers all applicants and their application materials throughout the admissions process . The application process exists between the applicant and a Rush University admissions office; therefore, any communica-tion about candidates and their application status to parties beyond these entities is not acceptable unless a school official has a legitimate educational interest to know this information in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities . All those involved in the admissions process (e . g . , admissions committee members, interviewers, admissions staff, etc .) must adhere to these guidelines . Directory Information Rush University may establish categories of information known as directory information and release this information without student consent, upon request . Rush University designates the following personally identifiable information contained in a student's educational record as directory information: Student' s full name Address (local and permanent) T elephone number (local and permanent) Rush pager number (relev ant to third- and fourth-year Rush Medical College students only) Rush email address Major and minor field(s) of study , including the college, division, department and/or program in which the student is enrolled Student' s classification (e . g . , junior, senior, etc . ) or a number referring to such Dates of attendance and gr aduation, and degrees received Date and place of birth Photogr aphs or other electronic images* Honors and aw ards received Previous colleges/universities attended Degrees earned at previous colleges/universities Rush Medical College postgr aduate appointment (program/ institution/state) * Rush University records both visually and audibly many campus events and daily activities, such as classes, commencement, convocations, student events and other public occasions. These images, as well as other information about students, are published (e.g., print media, Rush website) regularly as part of the University's coverage of campus life and portrayal of the University to a variety of audiences. The University's policy is to restrict the use of any photograph/electronic image to the representation, marketing or promotion of Rush activities only. Students may restrict the release of their directory information by completing and submitting the Directory Information Restrictions form available in the Office of the Registrar or online . The decision to restrict directory information will apply to all requests from third parties (other than those who already have legal access to these data elements), including prospec- tive employers . A student must formally rescind a restriction of directory information by submitting a subsequent Directory Information Restrictions form . Annual Notification of Student Rights Under FERPA Rush University notifies students annually of their rights under FERPA with respect to their educational records . These rights include the following: 1. T he right to inspect and review the student's educational records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access. If an educational record contains information about other students as well, the requesting student may inspect and review only the specific informa - tion that pertains to him or her. Students should submit, to the University registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect . The University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected . If the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed . T he University may deny a request for copies of educational records when the requestor refuses to furnish proper identifi- cation and/or information required by the University . 2. T he right to request amendment of an educational record the student believes is inaccurate. Students may ask the University to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate . They should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, specify why it is inaccurate, and provide the accurate information . If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment . Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when the student is notified of the right to a hearing . 3. T he right to consent to disclosure of personally identifi - able information contained in the education record, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception, which permits disclosure without consent, is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educa- tional interests . A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the University has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee (such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks) . A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her profes-sional responsibility 4. T he right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Rush University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is as follows:Family Policy Compliance Office U .S . Department of Education 400 Maryland Ave . , SW Washington, DC 20202-5920 Commencement/Graduation Activities The Intent to Graduate form signals that a student is ready to graduate . By signing the Intent to Gr aduate form, the student is giving permission to the University to print the following information in any Rush graduation program and/or announce this information at any Rush graduation ceremony: the student's name as indicated on the Intent to Graduate form, any honors or awards received, the Rush degree and major the student is earning, previous colleges/universities attended, and degrees earned at those previous colleges/universities . If a Directory Information Restrictions form was previously submitted, the student's signature on the Intent to Graduate form temporarily releases (for graduation ceremony/program purposes only) the directory information restrictions enacted by the student so that the information can be published in any Rush graduation program and/or announced at any Rush gradu- ation ceremony . In addition, the student's signature permits Rush University to release the student's name and address to the external photography vendor with whom Rush contracts, and to have the vendor place graduation photographs of the student on its website . The student's signature also allows the University to publish the student's picture in a picture composite and the student's image in a DVD that is created and distributed of the commencement ceremony . The recording of the gradua - tion ceremony could also appear on the Rush University website and/or social media sites including but not limited to YouTube and Facebook . Finally , if the student is a medical student, the student's signature permits publication of the student's name, photograph, previous degrees earned and other information in the Rush Medical College yearbook . If a student has questions about how the information will used for graduation or commencement purposes, the student should speak with the Office of the Registrar before signing and sub- mitting the Intent to Graduate form . Educational Records Rush University does not maintain educational records in one central office . Educational records are maintained in the Office of the Registrar and in the respective college and department offices . Other educational records are maintained in the Office of Student Financial Aid (financial aid information, student employ - ment), the Office of Student Financial Affairs (financial account payment information), the Office of International Services and other offices . Questions regarding individual student records should be directed to the appropriate location . Rush University will not issue copies of transcripts received from other institutions to anyone, including the student . Deceased Student Records Rush University may, upon the death of a student, release a student's educational records to a third party . This is done at the sole discretion of Rush University . Mailing Lists Rush University does not release student directory informa-tion in mailing lists, except to comply with the federal Solomon Amendment .

The Office of Financial Affairs will investigate the situation and will consult with other offices including the Office of the Registrar, the Office of Student Financial Aid and the student's program, as needed . A decision will be rendered within one month from the time the appeal was received, and the student will be notified in writing . If the decision is not in the favor of the student, the student may file a written appeal with the office of the senior associate provost for educational affairs . The decision of the senior associate provost for educa - tional affairs is final . Payment of Tuition and Fees The following statement represents the payment policy for all Rush University students: Charges can be viewed and payment for tuition, fees and on-campus housing can be completed through RUConnected, the University's online system . P ayment can be made by credit card or e-check . If full payment of tuition cannot be made by the first week of class, as listed in the Academic Calendar located in the Rush University catalog, satisfactory arrangements for payment must be made with the Office of Financial Affairs . Students may not attend classes until after registration is complete . Any exception to this policy must be approved in writing by the senior associate provost for educational affairs . Students have the responsibility to complete one or a combina- tion of the following courses of action on or before the first Friday of classes each term: 1 . P ay total tuition, fees and on-campus housing charges for the term . 2 . Complete a Deferred P ayment Plan Contract . This plan requires that the first payment and a $15 service charge be paid on or before the first Friday of the term . Additional pay - ments are due every four weeks . The length of the contract is dependent on the length of the term . Contact the Office of Financial Affairs to set up a payment plan . 3 . Use the pending financial aid payment option . All students who have financial aid pending will be allowed to defer payment of that portion of tuition and fees that is covered by the anticipated aid . In order to use this option, students must have taken all steps required of them to apply for the aid (e .g ., the application for a guaranteed student loan program must have been completed and submitted to the Office of Student Financial Aid) . In order to avoid a late fee charge , stu- dents must make arrangements for payments of that portion of tuition and fees not covered with pending aid by complet- ing step 1 or 2 above . Failure to follow one of the steps above will result in a $100 late fee . Students who choose the Deferred P ayment Plan Contract option and who fail to make a payment of the specified due dates will be charged a $50 late payment fee for each payment date missed . At the end of the academic term, students who still have out-standing balances with Rush University that are not covered by pending financial aid will face these consequences: Not receive tr anscripts/diplomas May be dismissed from on-campus housing Lose all university privileges Not be allowed to register for the following term Student Health Insurance Rush University requires students to be covered by a health plan in order to promote health and well-being while protecting the individual from undue financial hardship that a medical emer - gency could cause . Non-Rush Medical College students must provide proof of existing coverage before registering for the fall term each year . Students who do not submit proof and receive confirmation of verification of their coverage will be enrolled in the student health insurance plan and charged for the premiums for the term . To that end, students enrolled in degree programs are eligible for the Student Health Insurance Plan offered by Academic HealthPlans Inc . and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois . For the 2017-2018 school year, the cost of the plan is approxi- mately $3,459 per academic year for single coverage . Cover age is also available for dependents at the rate of $3,459 annually per dependent . This plan allows students to choose a primary care physician from a large list of members of the Preferred Provider Plan (PPO) in the greater Chicago area . When using a network provider, there is an annual deductible of $250 and coverage of 80 percent for most patient services including hospitalization and surgery, as well as outpatient services such as office visits, laboratory and X-ray . Preventative care services are covered at 100 percent . When using a pharmacy in the Prime Therapeutics Network, there is a $20 co-payment for generic prescriptions, a $50 co-payment for brand-name prescriptions and an $80 co- payment for brand-name prescriptions when generic is available .44 45 A optional dental insurance plan is also available to all Rush University students . Details of the plan are av ailable in the Office of Financial Affairs . Enrollment for the dental plan is av ailable at the beginning of the fall term only . Applications will not be accepted after the start of the fall term .

Tuition Waivers Rush Medical College Students Enrolling in Graduate College Courses Rush Medical College students who take a leave of absence from their MD program may enroll in Graduate College classes Details of the plans are available in the Office of Financial Affairs or online at the Rush University Financial Affairs Web page . A small portion of fees for Rush Medical College students has been allocated to the Medical Student Health Service Program, supported by Lifetime Medical Associates (1645 W . J ackson Blvd ., Suite 215) . The Medical Student Health Service Program is designed to work seamlessly with Rush University health insur - ance to provide medical students with acute care . By using Rush University health insurance, medical students should experience an enhanced level of service and minimal billing problems, with a $20 fee per office visit . This will provide the type of student health service with which most students are familiar . Additionally, all Rush Medical College students are covered under a blood and bodily fluids exposure rider . This works as a supplemental policy to any health insurance to cover treatment or medications necessary as the result of a needle stick, splash or potentially contagious diseases exposure . Together with the basic Rush University health insurance policy, the rider will com- pletely cover prophylactic medications or injections . Rush Medical College students will be assessed a fee for vac - cinations/immunizations and documentation . This fee covers any necessary blood tests, vaccinations or updates as well as costs associated with maintaining the documentation of their compli- ance and communicating that information to the Rush system hospitals and any away elective locations that may request certification of immunization and vaccination status .as part of a formal MS or PhD program, or simply for additional knowledge . Medical students are exempt (tuition w aiver) from the additional tuition costs associated with enrollment in these classes . Doctoral Students in the Graduate College The Graduate College offers a full-tuition scholarship for students enrolled in doctoral programs in the basic sciences (Anatomy and Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Biomechanics, Immunology/Microbiology, Medical Physics, Molecular Biophysics and Physiology, Neuroscience and Pharmacology) . The scholar - ship is only for tuition . Health insur ance and other fees are the student's responsibility . To receive this scholarship, students must maintain full-time status . A requirement of at least 12 hours per semester is needed to be a full-time student . If a student fails to register for 12 hours each semester, the scholarship is rescinded and the student is billed tuition . In addition, most students accepted by the Graduate College receive a stipend . The stipend awarded to a graduate student is a privilege and is contingent upon policies established by individual divisions . Master of Science Students in the Graduate College Students enrolled in master's programs in the basic sciences (Anatomy and Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Biomechanics, Biotechnology, Immunology/Microbiology, Medical Physics, Molecular Biophysics and Physiology, Neuroscience and Pharmacology) pay tuition and fees . Master' s students are gener - ally not eligible for tuition scholarships and are expected to be enrolled full time (12 hours per semester) unless special arrange - ments have been made . Third-Party Billing If the student will not be personally paying the account, it is the student's responsibility to forward any bills to the appropriate party as soon as possible . Office of Student Financial Aid Financial Aid Process Instructions for accessing financial aid information on the Rush University website are emailed to all newly accepted students prior to enrollment . The Student Financial Aid website con - tains in-depth information on policies and procedures and the financial aid awarding methodology . Students starting in a term other than fall should submit financial aid application materials at least two months prior to their start date . Students must be enrolled at least half time and must be in a degree or approved certificate program to receive financial aid . To receive assistance, all appropriate forms and materials must be on file . Students should expect to receive the majority of assistance in the form of loans . Because of limited institutional funding, financial aid awards will likely contain loans that accrue interest while the student is in school . F or students in the Medical College and nursing students in the Generalist Entry Master's (GEM) program, need-based grant assistance is available through the Office of Student Financial Aid . However , the funds are limited, and all applicants (with few exceptions) must provide parental data and meet the institutional criteria for eligibility . Refer to the Office of Student Financial Aid website (www . rushu . rush . edu/finaid) for details . Undergraduate students who have not received a prior bach-elor's degree are more likely to receive grant assistance through federal and state need-based programs . Employment through the Federal Work-Study Program may be possible throughout Rush University Medical Center . Depending on a student' s academic program, Federal Work-Study funding may be awarded as part of the financial aid package . It is the student' s responsibility to secure employment . The Office of Student Financial Aid assists students in locating jobs within the Medical Center . Financial Aid Determination Financial assistance programs at Rush University are provided to assist students who cannot otherwise afford to pay the full cost of education on their own . In gener al, financial need is the basic criterion for the awarding of funds . Accordingly, students and their families will be expected to contribute toward educational expenses to the fullest extent possible . The level of the expected contribution is determined by using a standard set of criteria to analyze financial information provided by students and their families . Submission of parental data for institutional gr ants and loans is required for students in the Medical College and nursing students in the Generalist Entry Master's (GEM) program . Complete information about this policy is found on the Office of Student Financial Aid website . Financial aid counselors are av ail- able to consult with students and parents (with the student's authorization) on all matters regarding the financing of a Rush University education . Students and authorized parents are wel - comed and encouraged to make use of these services . Financial Aid Awards After evaluating student and family resources and assistance from outside the University, the Office of Student Financial Aid will award federal, state and institutional funds (as appropriate) to students with demonstrated financial need . In v arying quanti - ties, a financial aid award may include grants, loans and student employment . In order to distribute the av ailable funds in the Medical Appr oximate Yearly Rate Student $3,459 .00 Each Dependent $3,459 . 00 Dental Approximate Monthly Rate (2017-2018 r ates) Student Plan $19 . 93 Student + Plan $39 . 06 Family Plan $74 . 5046 47 most equitable manner, the Office of Student Financial Aid estab- lishes a formula that designates the sequence in which funds are awarded to students and the maximum amount awarded under each program . The formula provides for a specific amount of loans and employment before students are considered for grants . These formulas are applied consistently during any given year among all students at a given class level and in a given college (pending availability of funds) . Due to differences in the av ailabil - ity of funds from year to year and changes in eligibility require- ments, the formulas are adjusted annually . Veterans Benefits Rush University participates in federal veterans' education ben- efits through the U . S . Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) . If a student qualifies for participation in more than one veterans' education benefit program, the VA website provides a compari - son tool to help determine which benefits might be appropriate . Post-9/11 GI Bill The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides tuition, fees, books/supplies and housing assistance to eligible veterans . Tuition and fees are paid directly to Rush by the VA . Tuition and fees assistance is capped at the national maximum of $22,805 .34 per academic year . Benefit rates vary based on the veteran's circumstances . Some veterans may be able to transfer their benefits to a dependent . Yellow Ribbon Program Effective with the 2012-2013 academic year, certain colleges within Rush University participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program . Veterans entitled to the maximum benefit rate are eligible to apply for additional tuition and fees amounts if their costs exceed the $21,940 .46 cap . The amount of additional assistance available and the number of students able to be supported are limited and vary by college . Funds will be aw arded on a first- come, first-served basis . Students who have received Yellow Ribbon assistance will have preference for these funds in future academic years . Details are av ailable on the VA's Yellow Ribbon Program information website . Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty (MGIB-AD Chapter 30) This monthly benefit is paid directly to the veteran . Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR Chapter 1606) This monthly benefit is paid directly to the veteran . Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP Chapter 1607) This monthly benefit is paid directly to the veteran .Veterans Educational Assistance Program (VEAP Chapter 32) This monthly benefit is paid directly to the veteran . Survivors' and Dependents' Assistance (DEA Chapter 35) This monthly benefit is paid directly to the survivor or dependent of the veteran . Using Veterans' Benefits at Rush Veterans interested in using their benefits at Rush for the first time should do the following: 1 . Apply for benefits through the VA: If the veteran has never used veterans' benefits at an institution before, this step must be completed . 2 . Submit form 22-1995 or form 22-5495 (as appropriate) online . If the veter an has used veterans' education benefits before but is a first-time benefits user at Rush University, the appropriate form must be submitted . 3 . Provide a copy of the eligibility letter from the VA (as well as any change-of-program forms from step 2, above) to the Office of Student Financial Aid before benefits can be certified with the VA . All documents can be mailed, faxed or scanned and emailed to the Office of Student Financial Aid . Please be sure to indicate name and student ID number (or Social Security number) on all documents . Satisfactory Academic Progress The Higher Education Act of 1965 as amended by Congress mandates institutions of higher education to establish minimum standards of satisfactory progress for students receiving federal financial aid . These standards apply to all federal Title IV aid programs, including the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS Loan and Federal Work-Study programs . Accordingly, the Department of Education regulations require that Rush University's Office of Student Financial Aid monitor the academic progress of all financial aid recipients toward the completion of their degree . This process is called Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) . This SAP policy is enforced in conjunction with all other institu- tional policies and procedures, including the academic pro- gression policies of Rush University's colleges and academic programs . F or undergraduate and graduate students, the criteria below are checked at the end of each term . F or medical students, the criteria below are checked annually at the end of the spring term .Enforcement The Office of Student Financial Aid shall have primary responsi- bility in enforcing the SAP policy . The Office of the Registrar and other Rush University offices that maintain student information relevant to the SAP policy shall provide such information, as requested by the Office of Student Financial Aid . SAP Requirements The SAP requirements vary by academic level (undergraduate, graduate and medical students) . Please refer to the appropriate section to find the requirements that fit each academic program . UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS SAP for undergraduate students is monitored using three fac-tors: maximum time frame measurement, pace of completion and cumulative grade point average (GPA) . SAP is measured at the end of each academic term once final grades are submitted . Maximum Time Frame Measurement Students may attempt up to 150 percent of the credits it normally takes to complete the program . The total allow - able attempted hours are calculated by multiplying the hours required to complete the degree at Rush (excluding the general education courses required prior to entry in the program) by 1 .5 and rounding down to the nearest whole number . F or example, for a program that requires 107 credit hours to receive a degree at Rush (not including the general education courses required prior to entry in the program), a student may attempt up to 160 hours . Pace of Completion Students must successfully complete at least 67 percent of the courses they attempt . This measure will be measured cumula - tively over the course of the student's program . F or the purpose of this measurement, all of the following are applicable: Successful completion is defined as a gr ade of A, B or C for a letter-grade course, or a grade of P for a course that is pass/ fail or pass/no pass . These courses are counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals . Proficiency credit (\"K\" grades) is counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals . All other gr ades (including incomplete grades) are counted in the attempted hours total, but not in the completed hours total . If an incomplete gr ade is later converted to a grade that is considered to be a successfully completed grade, the pace of completion percentage can be recalculated . It is the student's responsibility to notify the Office of Student Financial Aid when an incomplete grade has been converted . Students who drop courses but who remain enrolled at the University will not have those dropped courses counted in the attempted hours total if the courses are dropped prior to the census date . Courses dropped after the census date will be counted in the attempted hours total . Repeated courses are counted as attempted hours during all attempts . T ransfer credits that count toward the student's current academic program count as both attempted and completed hours . Students who change majors will only have hours that were previously attempted counted in their cumulative totals if the hours are applicable to the new academic program . Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) Undergraduate students must maintain a minimum cumula- tive GPA of 2 .0 . Students who have a term GP A of less than 1 .0 after their first term at Rush will be immediately placed on financial aid suspension . GRADUATE STUDENTS SAP for graduate students is monitored using three factors: maximum time frame measurement, pace of completion and cumulative grade point average (GPA) . SAP is measured at the end of each academic term once final grades are submitted . Maximum Time Frame Measurement Students may attempt up to 150 percent of the credits it normally takes to complete the program . The total allow - able attempted hours are calculated by multiplying the hours required to complete the degree at Rush by 1 .5 and rounding down to the nearest whole number . F or example, for a program that requires 113 credit hours to receive a degree at Rush, a student may attempt up to 169 hours . Please note: Nondegree certificate programs are approved by the U . S . Department of Education for financial assistance at a specific number of credit hours . Regardless of a student' s actual plan of study, the maximum time frame is calculated using the number of hours for which the program was approved by the U .S . Department of Education . Pace of Completion Students must successfully complete at least 67 percent of the courses they attempt . This measure will be measured cumula - tively over the course of the student's program . F or the purpose of this measurement, all of the following are applicable: Successful completion is defined as a gr ade of A or B for a letter-grade course, or a grade of P for a course that is pass/48 49 fail or pass/no pass . These courses are counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals . Proficiency credit (\"K\" grades) is counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals . All other gr ades (including incomplete grades) are counted in the attempted hours total, but not in the completed hours total . If an incomplete gr ade is later converted to a grade that is considered to be a successfully completed grade, the pace of completion percentage can be recalculated . It is the student's responsibility to notify the Office of Student Financial Aid when an incomplete grade has been converted . Students who drop courses but who remain enrolled at the University will not have those dropped courses counted in the attempted hours total if the courses are dropped prior to the census date . Courses dropped after the census date will be counted in the attempted hours total . Repeated courses are counted as attempted hours during all attempts . T ransfer credits that count toward the student's current academic program count as both attempted and completed hours . Students who change majors will only have hours that were previously attempted counted in their cumulative totals if the hours are applicable to the new academic program . Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) Graduate students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3 .0 . Students who have a term GP A of less than 2 . 0 after their first term at Rush will be immediately placed on financial aid suspension . RUSH MEDICAL COLLEGE STUDENTS SAP for Rush Medical College students is monitored using three factors: maximum time frame measurement, pace of comple- tion and grade requirements . SAP is measured at the end of each academic year once final grades are in and at the time of awarding . Time Limits on Financial Aid Eligibility The normal time frame for completion of required course work for the MD degree is four academic years . Due to academic or personal difficulties, a student may require additional time . In such situations, the Rush Medical College Committee on Student Evaluation and Promotion (COSEP) may establish a schedule for the student that departs from the norm and that may require repeating a year of study . F or the purposes of this financial aid policy, no more than three years may be devoted to the first- and second-year curriculum and no more than three years may be devoted to the third- and fourth-year curriculum, for a maximum time frame of six years . Summer enrollment, if required, is considered part of the academic year for the purposes of this measure . Approved leaves of absence do not count in this measure . Completion of Requirements/Pace of Completion 1 . First-year students must complete at least 66 percent of their first-year curriculum with a grade of \"Pass\" or better between the start of the year and the last day of spring quarter exams . This includes repeated courses . 2 . T o advance to the second year, students must complete all first-year courses with a grade of \"Pass\" or better by the start of the second year . 3 .

Student Progression in the College of Nursing Student progress in the College of Nursing is reviewed and evaluated in several ways . The progression policies established by the faculty are interpreted and applied by the student's academic advisor, the Office of the Dean, and the College of Nursing Admissions and Progressions Committee . The College of Nursing reserves the right to request a leave of absence or the withdrawal of any student whose conduct, physical or mental health, or performance demonstrates lack of fitness for continuance in a health profession . Should a student' s behavior come into question, policies and procedures to determine the student's continuing status in the college are delineated in the College of Nursing Student Handbook . Since much of the work in nursing requires students to achieve a progressively higher level of understanding and skill, high academic performance is expected . The individual student is responsible for acquiring knowledge inside and outside of formal classroom and clinical settings . Academic Progression Policy A student must achieve an \"A\" or \"B\" grade in all required clini- cal nursing courses . If a \"C\" grade is achieved in a single clinical seminar course or a single clinical practicum, the student must repeat the course prior to graduation . A student may repeat only one clinical seminar or clinical practicum in a program of study . A grade of \"F\" or \"N\" or a second \"C\" in a required clinical seminar or clinical practicum may result in dismissal from the program . An \"F\" or \"N\" grade in any required course places the student on academic probation and may result in dismissal from the program . P ermission may be given to retake a course at the discretion of the Admissions and Progressions Committee . If permitted, a student has only one opportunity to achieve a passing grade . An \"F\" or \"N\" grade in the repeated courses may result in dismissal . Students in all graduate programs must maintain a cumulative 3 .0 average in graduate course work to remain in good aca - demic standing . If a student' s cumulative GPA drops below 3 . 0, he or she will be placed on academic probation . A student may enroll for no more than two consecutive terms as a probation- ary student . Students may be dismissed from the College of Nursing upon failing to achieve satisfactory academic standing in the required period of time or if the student incurs a second probationary event . To be awarded a degree or certificate, a student must be in good academic standing at the completion of her or his program . Please refer to the College of Nursing Student Handbook for a complete review of the college academic progression policy .

Rush University Academic Policies The Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains additional Rush University academic policies . Student Professional and Community Service Requirement Participation in service activities is an important attribute of the health science professional . A hallmark of outstand - ing Rush students and alumni is the desire and ability to make meaningful service contributions . Community service activities may include volunteer activities (health fairs and clinics, health education, provision of health services to at risk or disadvantaged populations and other outreach educa- tion or clinical activities) and service on community boards, committees, work groups and other service activities that promote the health and well-being of the community and its members . Professional service may include participation in the provision of state, national or international activities to advance the quality, access and effectiveness of health care services provided by allied health professionals . Achievement of the College of Health Sciences Excellence in Service Goal is demonstrated in part through the following:1 . Student and faculty participation in community service activities 2 . Student satisfaction with and appreciation for community service 3 . Students and faculty who provide leadership and support to professional associations, boards and committees 4 . Provision of community and professional continuing education to local, national and international audiences In order to support achievement of the college's service excellence goals and objectives, the college has developed a professional and community service requirement for all CHS students as a part of their academic programs . As a requirement for program completion, each academic degree-granting program will establish a minimum service requirement for each student enrolled in the program of at least 16 contact hours of approved professional or community service . Examples of activities that may be used to meet this requirement include participation in community health fairs; community health screening and/or health services; provision of community health education; participation in approved professional service and/or continuing education activities; and assistance with the delivery of seminars, lectures, workshops and related community or profes- sional continuing education activities . Conduct and Ethics Each student is expected to conduct himself or herself in a profes - sional manner at all times \u2014 in a manner that conforms to the ethics of the health professions and instills confidence in the student's abilities as a health care professional . Each student is expected to conform to the professional code of ethics as outlined in his or her departmental student handbook . Irresponsible, unprofessional or unethical behavior may result in disciplinary action, which may include suspension or dismissal from the college . All clinical agency or hospital regulations are to be followed by students when undergoing clinical or other training in a facility . F or additional information, students should refer to the Rush University Policy on Academic Honesty and Student Conduct and the Rush University Medical Center Code of Conduct . Scholastic Dishonesty and Cheating The College of Health Sciences will not condone cheating in any form . Allegations of cheating will be reviewed by the departmental Committee on Progress and Promotions . Any student found to be cheating on an examination may receive a \"0\" for the examination and will be subject to formal disciplin- ary action, which may include suspension or dismissal from the program . F ailure to report incidents involving scholastic dishon - esty on the part of another student will be considered unpro- fessional conduct and may also result in disciplinary action . Students should refer to the Rush University Policy on Academic Honesty and Student Conduct for further information . HIPAA and Patient Privacy Rush University students have a legal and ethical responsibility to safeguard the privacy of all patients and protect confiden- tiality and security of all health information . Protecting the confidentiality of patient information means protecting it from unauthorized use or disclosure in any format \u2014 verbal, fax, written or electronic/computer . P atient confidentiality is a central obligation of patient care . Any breaches in patient confidentiality or privacy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the college . The laboratory component of some courses may use students as simulated patients . This is particularly true for the patient evalu - ation, medicine and patient education components . Additionally, the sharing of personal experiences can be a rich resource in the development of students' understanding, knowledge and appre- ciation of disease, health care and impact on peoples' lives . Practicing the medical history and physical examination of patients places students in close contact and leads to the sharing of personal information and physical findings . Similarly students may use personal experiences in patient role-playing exercises . All shared and personal medical information and physical examination findings are to be treated with utmost confiden- tiality, the same as for any patient contact . F ailure to protect the confidentiality of any information related to the activities in a course or clinical rotation may result in disciplinary action, up to and including suspension or dismissal from the college . For additional information, students should refer to the Rush University HIPAA policy and the Rush University Policy on Privacy and Confidentiality of Student Records and FERPA .

Incidents involving gross errors in judgment or practice on the part of the student will constitute grounds for dismissal from the program . Criminal Background Checks and Drug Testing Programs offered in the College of Health Sciences often require that clinical rotations, practica, internships or other learning expe - riences be successfully completed in hospitals and other health care facilities in order to meet program requirements . Because use of these facilities is required, students must be able to suc-cessfully complete their assigned rotations in order to fulfill the academic requirements of their program . Hospitals and other health care facilities often have policies requiring criminal background checks for employees, students and volunteers . These facilities may refuse to accept individuals for clinical, practicum or other experiential rotations based on past criminal convictions . Students should be prepared to comply with the policies and procedures at any facility where they are assigned as part of their educational program and may not request facility assignments in an effort to avoid specific requirements . Students who have certain types of information in their criminal background checks may be ineligible to complete rotations in specific facilities .

Toward that goal, we teach the highest levels of competence and integrity in educa-tion, leadership and research and provide professional develop-ment and research mentoring by established scholars across the continuum of health sciences . The underlying educational philosophy of the program is grounded in a triad of learner-centered thought including progressivism, in which the learners' experiences, needs and interests are explored and fostered; reconstructionism, in which the learners see their growth applied to real-world problems; and existentialism, by which learners are challenged to \"own\" their future and become lead- ers in the evolution of health care . PhD in Health Sciences: Mission & Vision Mission Our mission is to produce experienced health science profes- sionals with a broad-based, interdisciplinary education who are prepared to lead, teach, practice clinically and perform research at the highest levels of competency and integrity . Vision To become the highest quality PhD in Health Sciences program in the United States . PhD in Health Sciences: Curricular Design We offer a rigorous curriculum that emphasizes fundamentals and advanced concepts in leadership, education, research and professional development . We provide high-quality, asynchro - nous online courses in leadership, education and research . The role of the curricular design is to provide a logical progression to learner growth . The guiding principle of the curricular design is threefold and presented in a continuum of foundations (theory), application (real-world problem resolution), and vision (synthe- sis and creative/critical forward thinking regarding the future trajectory of health care) . The curricular design first establishes a foundation of past and current thinking (epistemological framework) and theory associated with leadership, education and research . Scaffolding on these foundations , the curriculum challenges the learners to address real-world applications through focused seminar courses and learner-centered projects . The curriculum progresses and challenges the learner's axiologi-cal considerations encouraging the value of moving health care forward through research, demonstration projects, dissertation focus, ownership of learning, and philosophical challenges to the status quo . To assure learner progress through the curricular constructs, we assign each student an academic advisor who is an estab- lished scholar in a health sciences field matching the student's background and professional interest . The academic advisor provides general support and leads the student's professional development . The transition to doctoral candidacy occurs upon successfully completing all core courses, passing a compre - hensive qualifying exam, and passing a dissertation proposal presented to the dissertation committee . Doctor al candidates conduct research and publish under the guidance and supervi- sion of a research mentor . The dissertation committee consists of the academic advisor, the research mentor, the program director and at least two additional qualified members . The dissertation committee ensures that students are well prepared to identify and fill important gaps in knowledge through the generation and dissemination of new knowledge and endorses the award- ing of the PhD in Health Sciences degree . PhD in Health Sciences: Program Overview The Doctor of Philosophy in Health Sciences degree program was launched by the College of Health Sciences in the fall of 2011 . The program is designed to prepare health science profes - sionals to assume major leadership, research and educational positions within their professions, as well as to provide career advancement opportunities . The program will provide a broad-based, interdisciplinary educa - tion that will prepare graduates to teach, practice and perform research across the continuum of health care . The program at Rush will prepare individuals for careers in research, education and leadership within allied health and, more broadly, within health care and higher education . The program of study for the Doctor of Philosophy degree involves formal courses in leadership, education and research . It also involves mentored professional development within a health science specialty field . The publication of scholarly work in a peer-reviewed journal and the passing of a comprehensive oral examination upon completion of all course work are also 164 165 required . In addition, the student must complete and present a dissertation proposal that meets the approval of his or her advisory committee prior to beginning a dissertation research project that culminates in the writing and oral public defense of a dissertation . The PhD degree demonstrates the capability for independent research and recognizes a unique contribution to scientific knowledge . The program may be taken on a part-time basis; however, in all cases it must be completed in seven years or less . The PhD program in Health Sciences consists of five major core areas: Leadership (12 semester hours [SH]), Education (9 SH), Research (18 SH), Professional Development (3 SH) and Dissertation Research (12 SH minimum) . The professional devel - opment courses are based on learning contracts that provide opportunities for advanced mentored learning and skill devel- opment in the allied health profession matching the student's interests . Student learning objectives for the PhD in Health Sciences have been developed for each major core area and are mapped to individual courses . Students entering the progr am must have a master's degree in an area related to health sci- ences or health care administration . PhD in Health Sciences: Program Objectives 1 . T o produce scholars who will generate new knowledge and innovative applications through research . 2 . T o produce scholars who will disseminate knowledge through education and publications . 3 .

The thesis project is optional in the speech-language pathology curriculum, and students are encouraged to consider choosing this option . Audiology students have the opportunity to complete a thesis in lieu of the Investigative Project . The complete thesis policy is found in the Student Manual for the Department of Communication Disorders and Sciences . Investigative Project Students enrolled in the Doctor of Audiology program complete the Investigative Project during the third year of the curriculum . The objectives of the Investigative Project are to synthesize a body of literature related to a specific topic in audiology, to cultivate professional writing skills, to acquire didactic skills for dissemination of professional information and to develop orga - nizational and verbal tools needed for professional presenta- tions . Ordinarily , the Investigative Project includes three options: 1) Evidence-based Practice Systematic Review; 2) Experimental Project; or 3) Professional/Clinical Project . A complete descrip - tion of the Investigative Project is found in the Student Manual for the Department of Communication Disorders and Sciences . Students are expected to submit the completed project for presentation at a state or national professional meeting or for publication .Service Activities The faculty provides a full range of diagnostic and therapeu- tic services to a large clinical population, both inpatients and outpatients .

Goals The primary goal of the program is to prepare competent entry-level vascular technologists in the cognitive (knowledge), psychomotor (skills) and affective (behavior) competencies nec- essary to perform vascular ultrasound examinations . A secondary goal is to offer a broader understanding of the profession to the students through basic education in professional practices . Vascular Ultrasound and Technology: Overview Description of the Profession The vascular sonographer plays a vital role in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with disorders of arteries and veins . These include atherosclerosis that may result in strokes or gangrene of the extremities, blood clots in veins that may break off and travel to the lungs and possibly cause death, aneurysms that may burst, and many other pathologies of the circulatory system . A vascular sonographer is responsible for taking the patient's history; performing the appropriate test using high-tech, noninvasive equipment such as ultrasound; documenting and analyzing the data and images; and preparing a preliminary report for the physician to interpret . The sonographer has exten - sive direct interaction with patients, physicians, coworkers and other hospital personnel . The work requires physical, intellectual and communication skills . Program Description Students in the Vascular Ultrasound and Technology Program are taught by vascular sonographers and physicians who are experi- enced practitioner-teachers in the field . The basic program is full time and consists of 20 months (5 semesters) of study . The first two semesters consist of classroom instruction, student labora-tory practice with models, and observation of patient examina- tions . The second-year students primarily perform the vascular examinations learned during the first year on patients under the direction of credentialed and experienced vascular sonographers at two or more vascular laboratories during the year . The clinical sites include university hospitals in Chicago, as well as some community hospitals and out-of-state sites . During the second year, students also participate in senior lectures, patient case presentations and vascular lab conference . Students earn a Bachelor of Science degree and are eligible to take the certifica-tion examination to become a registered vascular technologist (RVT) before graduation due to the program's status as an accredited ultrasound program through CAAHEP (Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Educational Programs) . Program Accreditation The program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Educational Programs (CAAHEP) at 25400 US Highway 19 North, Suite 158, Clearwater, Florida 33763, or www . caahep . org, (727) 210-2350, through the Joint Review Committee on Education in Diagnostic Medical Sonography (JRC-DMS) .

By basing the program on adult learning theories, it is possible to build on the students' past, connect it to their activities of the present and predict a future of competent, capable responses to the needs of the profession . The program is designed to enable the student to learn not only the content and theories of occu- pational therapy, but also the process of utilizing the multiple resources of the learning environment, including teachers and peers . A series of carefully designed learning experiences, occur - ring within and outside the classroom, promote independence in conjunction with collegial interaction, problem solving and clinical reasoning, and analysis and synthesis of information . The graduate emerges as a competent therapist who has main- tained initial curiosity and added to it through increased ability for creative thinking . Because of experiences in self-directed learning and self-identification of needs, the graduate is able to be responsible and responsive to the needs of the profession . The graduate is expected to be a lifelong learner capable of maintaining professional integrity when faced with challenges and complexities of contemporary health care . Professional Orientation Since the Rush graduates will be prepared to work in a variety of traditional and nontraditional settings, their practice base is the result of broad experiences within the many arenas of occupational therapy . The graduates have the ability to add increasing amounts of depth and validation to their treatment programs as a result of their involvement and experiences with problem-solving approaches to therapy . Given the combination of breadth and depth of knowledge and experience related to occupational therapy treatment, the primary strength of Rush University graduates will be their ability to function as highly resourceful practitioners . As in the past, and for the foreseeable future, the role of the practitioner is the core of all occupa- tional therapy . The practitioner who is able to base treatment on established fact, use internal and external resources, and engage in clinical reasoning and problem solving is the practi- tioner who will contribute to the credibility and viability of the profession . It is this type of pr actitioner who is expected to be the product of the Rush program . The graduates of the program are able to enter the clinical arena competently and confidently, applying their clinical skills and expanding upon those skills as individual situations require . This continuous process of assessment and expansion contrib-utes to the personal and professional growth vital to occupa- tional therapists . The role of the clinician, as it is understood in this context, incorporates other major roles of the therapist . As the Rush program is designed, the students have the oppor - tunity to explore the functions of the therapist as an educator, researcher and manager from the practitioner's perspective . The involvement of the student in these other roles is another major strength of the program . The additional roles of educator, manager and researcher cannot be separated from the practitio - ner's role . Accreditation and Certification The Occupational Therapy program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education 246 247 (ACOTE) of the American Occupational Therapy Association . Additional information can be obtained by contacting: Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) c/o Accreditation Department American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA)4720 Montgomery Lane, Suite 200 Bethesda, MD 20814-3449 (301) 652-6611 ext . 2042 www . acoteonline . org Graduates will be eligible to sit for the national certification examination for the occupational therapist administered by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy, Inc . (NBCOT) . Additional information can be obtained by contacting: NBCOT, Inc . One Bank Street, Suite 300Gaithersburg, MD 20878 (301) 990-7979 After successful completion of this exam, the individual will be an Occupational Therapist, Registered (OTR) . In Illinois , occu - pational therapists must be licensed in order to practice, and state licensure is based on the results of the NBCOT certifica- tion examination . This is true in many other states, but specific requirements for licensure may be determined by contacting individual state licensing boards . Program Philosophy Occupational therapists recognize humans as persons engaged in and organized around occupations . When dysfunction pre - vents doing, occupational therapists enable doing in a variety of ways . The practice of occupational therapy involves individuals, their attributes, and the multiple environmental components that comprise the performance of occupations . Occupational therapy interventions are directed at these variables to amelio- rate and enable occupational performance . The faculty members are practitioners-teachers and researchers, a combination that infuses the curriculum with a contemporary and scholarly perspective . Gr aduate courses are designed to build on past knowledge and experience as well as encourage transformative learning . The critical self-reflection of the trans - formative learning process encourages the examining, question - ing, validating and possible revision of prior knowledge so that new perceptions and meanings may be constructed . It results in the learner being able to wholly and freely participate in critical dialogue and the resulting action, thus empowering the learner (Cranston, 1994) . By basing the progr am on transformative learning, it is possible to build on the student's past, connect it to their activities of the present, and predict a future in which they are competent and capable to respond to the needs of the profession . These learning experiences, occurring within and outside the classroom, promote independence in conjunction with faculty mentorship, problem solving, and critical thinking . Because of the graduate's experience in self-directed learning, he or she is able to be responsible and responsive to the needs of the increasingly dynamic profession . The graduate is a potential learner in the field who is able to work in the traditional and diverse occupational therapy settings, but more importantly, the graduate is flexible, autonomous, and informed so as to adapt to the changing demands of practice .

Areas of respiratory care include basic care (oxygen, aerosol and chest physiotherapy), critical care (ventilator management and physiologic monitoring), perinatal and pediatric respira\u00actory care, cardiopulmonary diagnostics, pulmonary laboratory, skilled nursing, restorative, subacute, home care, and pulmonary rehabilitation . The respiratory therapist may often see a diverse group of patients ranging from the newborn and pediatric patients to adults and the elderly . Disease states or conditions often requiring respiratory care include asthma, emphysema, chronic obstructive lung disease, pneumonia, cystic fibrosis, infant respiratory distress, and conditions brought on by shock, trauma or postoperative surgical complications . Respiratory therapists are also involved in many specialty areas in the hospital such as newborn labor and delivery, neonatal and pediatric intensive care units, pulmonary function labora - tory, sleep laboratory, adult intensive care units, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and EKG testing . Therapists may also be employed in physicians' offices, clinics, extended care facilities, or home care .Master of Science Program The Master of Science in Respiratory Care requires a mini- mum of 92 semester hours of credit for graduation . This is an integrated program, requiring 29 semester hours of program preprofessional prerequisite requirements prior to admission to Rush University for the professional phase (24 months) . The preprofessional phase requirements may be completed at any accredited college or university and include the successful completion of a baccalaureate degree . Dedicated to clinical and academic excellence, the professional phase includes more than 1,000 hours of in-hospital clinical practice . As a leadership program in respiratory care, this course of study aspires to provide graduates with the foundation needed to assume professional leadership roles in clinical practice, clinical specialty areas, research, education and management . Upon completion of the program, graduates are eligible for the national board examinations in respiratory care as well as state licensure . Respiratory Care: Admission Requirements - Master's Program Admission to the program is on a competitive basis . Student selection is based on a number of factors including overall grade point average, prerequisite grade point average, consis- tency of academic performance, course work completed prior to application, Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores and interpersonal abilities . The program is rigorous, and applicants are required to arrange an orientation visit to a respiratory care department at a hospital prior to acceptance to the program if the applicant has no previous experience in the field of respira- tory care . Requirements for admission to the professional phase of the program in respiratory care include: A minimum over all GPA of 2 . 5 in undergraduate course work Completion of all professional prerequisite required courses with a grade of \"C\" or better Completion of a bachelor' s degree Senior standing at the time of application and the ability to complete all preprofessional course work by the beginning of the fall quarter of the first year .

Each professional course in the program serves as the prerequisite for the subsequent course . Consequently, professional courses must be taken in sequence . Withdrawing or failure to successfully complete a professional course with a letter grade of \"C\" or better may result in the student being placed on a three-year track, given a leave of absence (LOA) and academic probation, or dismissed from the program after review by the Committee on Progress and Promotions. Students readmitted to the program at times other than the fall quarter of the second year will pick up the course sequence as prescribed by the chair/program director or Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care . Standards of Performance for Respiratory Care and Major Field-Related Courses 90 - 100 = A 80 - 89 = B75 - 79 = C70 - 74 = DBelow 70 = FUnless otherwise described in a given course syllabus, the mini- mum satisfactory grade for course credit is a letter grade of \"C\" and all stipulated segments of a course must be passed by this standard . Students must demonstr ate proficiency in all clinical skills presented in order to pass clinical courses . F or all clinical courses, the final exam must be passed at the designated cut score AND a grade of \"C\" or better must be maintained in order to successfully complete each clinical course to continue in the program . Students are expected to maintain an overall GPA in the program of at least 3.0. Failure of the student to maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 3 .0 will subject the student to a review and may result in the student being placed on probation, given a LOA, or dismissed from the program after review by the Committee on Progress and Promotions . If a student is dismissed and the student wishes to reenter the program, he or she must reapply and will be considered on the same basis as any new applicant . Students who voluntarily withdraw from the program, either passing or failing, have no guarantee of reinstatement to the program . Students requesting readmission to the program should submit a letter to that effect to the Committee on Progress and Promotion for Respiratory Care . Students readmitted to the progr am will pick up the course sequence as prescribed by the chair/program director or Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care . The three-year track option may be used to remediate students that fail to earn at least a grade of \"C\" in each respiratory care course or maintain an overall GPA of at least 3 .0 . While on this three-year track, withdrawing or failure to complete a respira - tory care professional course with a letter grade of \"C\" or better may result in the student being placed on academic probation, given a LOA, or dismissed from the program after review by the Committee on Progress and Promotions . Clinical Final Examinations All students are required to pass the clinical final examination after completing the clinical course to continue in the program . In the event a student fails the clinical final examination, the student is allowed to make ONE more attempt to pass . In the event the student passes the clinical final exam on the second attempt, the student will continue in the program . The grade earned on the first attempt will be used to calculate the final clinical grade . In the event the student does NO T pass the clini - cal final exam on the second attempt, the student will be placed in remediation . The student will be given a third attempt to pass the final by the end of the next quarter . In the event the student does not pass on the third attempt, the student will earn an \"F\" in the clinical course and may be suspended or released from the program . Comprehensive End-of-Program Competency Assessment Examination Before graduating, the student will complete comprehensive end-of-program examination assessments [NBRC secure Therapist Multiple Choice (TMC) and clinical simulation exami- nations (CSE)] . The TMC examination will be taken at the end of the Spring semester of the second year as a part of RCP-581, Clinical Practice 2 . The CSE will be given at the beginning of the Summer semester of the second year as part of RCP-591, Clinical Practice 3 . A passing score is required to successfully complete RCP-581 and RCP-591, as well as meet graduation and program course completion requirements . Students who do not successfully complete the comprehensive self-assessment examinations will receive an Incomplete (\"I\") for RCP-581 and/or RCP-591 . Those students failing receiving and \"I\" will be required to attend remediation over the following quarter . Those failing the examination after multiple attempts or fail-ing to attend remediation may be subject to dismissal from the program . Those students may reapply to the program (see Procedures for Readmission) . Conduct and Ethics Each student is expected to conduct oneself at all times in a dignified manner . This manner conforms to the ethics of the profession and instills patient confidence in one's abilities as a health care practitioner . Each student is expected to conform to the professional code of ethics as outlined in this handbook and policies outlined in the university catalog . Irresponsible, unprofessional or unethical behavior as deter - mined by the instructor or failure to follow the instructions of a clinical instructor during clinical practice may result in dismissal from the program . F alsification on any clinical documents will be treated as scholastic dishonesty . All hospital regulations are to be followed by students when undergoing clinical training in a facility . If employed by a clinical site in which the student is assigned a clinical rotation, the student must not complete clinical course work while in an employee status . Scholastic Dishonesty and Cheating The department will not condone cheating in any form . Plagiarizing or copying others' writing or work is considered cheating . Any allegations of cheating will be reviewed by the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care and, if merited, dealt with in a strict manner, including immedi- ate dismissal from the program . Any student found to be cheating on an examination, test, quiz or assignment will automatically receive a \"0\" for the grade and will be subject to dismissal from the program at the discretion of the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care . F ailure to report incidents involving scholastic dishonesty on the part of another student will be considered unprofessional conduct on the part of the student and may result in disciplinary action . Examination Review At the discretion of the course instructor, during review of any examination given within the curriculum, no other papers or books will be allowed on the student's desk . No writing imple - ments of any kind will be allowed . NO note-taking or recording of any kind will be permitted . This includes written note-taking and/or recording with audiotape, videotape or any other form of electronic or mechanical recording . Violation of this policy will constitute academic dishonesty and will be referred to the Committee on Progress and Promotions for review and possible disciplinary action . Examination Administration All examinations given by the department will be monitored by faculty or staff at all times . Students will be seated in such a manner as to minimize the opportunity for observation of other students' examination papers . No breaks will be allowed once an examination period has begun, and students may not leave the room during an exam until they are finished taking the examination, except in the event of an emergency, which will be judged by the faculty or staff monitoring the exam on a case-by-case basis . If a student turns in an examination without answering all ques-tions, he or she will NOT be given an opportunity to finish the examination after leaving the room . Only marks made on the Scantron sheet will be used to compute a grade on all Scantron-graded examinations . Even if a student marks the answer correctly on his or her examination, but does not mark it correctly on the Scantron, only the Scantron answer will be used to compute the grade, not the answer marked on the examination . Calculators will be provided to students for examinations; thus personal calculators will not be allowed during examinations .260 261 Policy for Transfer Students Students who have completed course work at other approved respiratory care programs may petition to have these courses transfer in lieu of specific course work in the Rush University program . Students must submit a tr anscript of their courses from the program and a copy of the course syllabus for each course in which they desire transfer credit . The syllabus must contain the following: course objectives, lecture outlines, course content, evaluation procedures and related information . These courses will be evaluated on an individual basis for content and total contact hours and credit hours . The department reserves the right to test the proficiency of any student in course work transferred from other respiratory care programs and the right to disallow such transfer credit in such course work in cases which the student cannot dem- onstrate acceptable proficiency . All transfer credit is subject to the approval of the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care . The student must also have a minimum grade of \"C\" (2 .0) for each course being transferred . A student cannot receive transfer credit for any respiratory care course work if he or she left the previous program due to academic probation, suspension or exclusion . All University policies regarding transfer credit must be satisfied .Respiratory Care: Graduation Requirements - Master of Science Completion of all required course work with a gr ade point average of 3 .0 or better Completion of each required respir atory care professional course with a grade of \"C\" or better Basic Life Support (BLS), Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS), Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS), and Neonatal Resuscitation Provider (NRP) course completion Successful completion of a departmental research project Completion of all University requirements for gr aduation Respiratory Care: Master of Science Curriculum Preprofessional Phase - Program Prerequisites The preprofessional phase (lower-division college-level course work) requires a minimum of 29 quarter hours of prescribed study as outlined below .

Submission of an application for admission should be made to the Office of College Admission Services with all official transcripts, NBRC RRT certificate, and a personal interview at least 30 days prior to the first day of the semester which the individual desires to begin classes . Professional prerequisites must be completed prior to gradua- tion . All other program policies and procedures apply . Introduction Individuals may have acquired academic credit in respiratory care courses from other schools and universities . Some individu - als may acquire knowledge through experience and on the job training . When such persons apply for admission into the pro - gram, an attempt is made to grant academic credit for equiva - lent educational courses, equivalent knowledge acquired from experience and/or successful completion of the National Board for Respiratory Care's certification and registry examinations . All students graduating from the Respiratory Care Program must meet the same standards for graduation; the awarding of advanced standing does not signify a lesser quality educa- tion than that offered through regular course work . What it does, however, is attempt to exempt the student from those areas of the formal program where the student already has the knowledge and expertise in those skills that would be offered . The program has identified the minimum competencies that a respiratory therapist must have in order to provide safe, high- quality patient care . The identification of these competencies is a complex task, and a great deal of care must be taken to ensure a standard of excellence . The following policies and procedures are designed to ensure that those individuals who receive advanced standing are qualified to do so, and that the screening process adheres to University as well as departmental policies at all times . To allow individuals who are not qualified, to receive advanced standing, is not in the student's or the program's best interest . Definition Advanced standing is defined as a special and individually determined status granted to a student in a formal educational setting, who has already gained professional experience through other sources or through nonacademic experiences, knowledge, skills and professionalism taught in the program courses . Purpose of Advanced Standing Procedures The purpose of the advanced standing procedures is to recog-nize and give formal educational credit for knowledge and/or ability gained through previous training or experience . Methods of Granting Advanced Standing Adv anced standing can be awarded through transfer credit . Adv anced standing can be awarded through the passing of an equivalency examination covering a certain area of knowledge . (An \"equivalency\" examination is an instrument or means by which a student accepted into the Respiratory Care Program can demonstrate mastery of a knowledge area, content area or skill and thus be exempted from a course in the program that teaches that area or skill .) Adv anced standing can be awarded as credit for successful completion of national registry examinations (RRT/RPFT) . Eligibility for Advanced Standing T ransfer students (who have been accepted into the Rush University Respiratory Care Program) may receive a transfer credit for equivalent courses within the Respiratory Care Program curriculum . Credentialed students (RR T, RPFT) who have been accepted into the Rush University Respiratory Care Program may receive transfer credit and will also be eligible to take equiva- lency examinations in certain courses . Policy for Transfer Students Students who have completed course work at other approved respiratory care programs may petition to have these courses transfer in lieu of specific course work in the Rush University program . Students must submit a tr anscript of their courses from the program and a copy of the course syllabus for each course in which they desire transfer credit . The syllabus must contain the following: course objectives, lecture outlines, course content, evaluation procedures and related information . These courses will be evaluated on an individual basis for content and total contact hours and credit hours . The department reserves the right to test the proficiency of any student in course work transferred from other respiratory care programs and the right to disallow such transfer credit in such course work in cases which the student cannot dem- onstrate acceptable proficiency . All transfer credit is subject to the approval of the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care . The student must also have a minimum grade of \"C\" (2 .0) for each course being transferred . A student cannot receive transfer credit for any respiratory care course work if he or she left the previous program due to academic probation, suspension or exclusion . All University policies regarding transfer credit must be satisfied . Policy for Individuals Who Hold the RRT Credential Advanced standing is available to individuals who have suc- cessfully completed the National Board for Respiratory Care's Respiratory Therapy Registry (RRT) who hold a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited college or university . Those eligible for advanced standing must submit the following documentation: A notarized copy of the RR T certificate indicating that it is a true and accurate copy . Official tr anscripts of all previous respiratory care and general education course work attempted and/or completed indi-cating award of the bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university . A notarized copy of the Certificate of Completion from an approved respiratory care training program as applicable . A completed application for admission to the Advanced Standing program . These are available in the Admissions Office . A letter directed to the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care requesting advanced standing .

This is a time of explosive growth in biomedical knowledge occurring simulta - neously with rapidly expanding health care needs . We have an unprecedented challenge in optimally preparing graduate professionals to contribute to progress in health outcomes for this dynamic world . In the Gr aduate College, we have six educational programs that include a range of biomedical doctoral and master's degrees to help prepare the next generation of biomedical research and educa - tion leaders . F or example, we have recently re-engineered our laboratory-based doctoral program, as well as our laboratory-based two-year master's program, so that the research students in those programs will be better prepared to address emerging biomedical challenges . The redesign of our graduate curricula is the collaborative work of the faculty working with students to synthesize many disciplinary perspectives to better understand the shared mechanistic basis of human health as well potential perturbations contributing to the development of human diseases . Our faculty includes a wide range of highly accomplished and nationally impactful researchers and educators who are deeply committed to biomedical professional development . Over the last decade , Rush research faculty have been consistently successful in competing for new federal research awards . As a result, despite tight national biomedical research funding, last year our faculty received over $100 million dollars of total federal awards . This great success has many positive dimensions . F rom our students' perspective, this provides a vibrant array of research environments with a number of productive research teams to choose from when considering where to conduct their dissertation or thesis research work . This biomedical research environment is further strengthened by several major, federally funded collaborative relationships across the academic medical centers of Chicago in the areas of translational research, precision medicine research and medical bioinformatics research . The Graduate College is an institution that is invested in the success of each and every student that walks through our doors . Our goal is to sharpen analytical skills , hone problem-solving approaches and educate our graduate students so that they are well prepared to bring value in creatively address - ing complex biomedical problems . We live and work in a vibrant urban center that enjoys a produc - tive and collaborative biomedical community . This environment, coupled with Rush's strong research and clinical legacy, provides many opportunities for ongoing career evolution both in this region and nationally . Rush' s Graduate College is a superb environment for biomedical training, and we look forward to working together in advancing your professional career goals while we make real progress in improving health . James L . Mulshine , MD Professor Dean of The Graduate College (Acting) 274 275 The Graduate College: Mission, Vision and Philosophy Mission The mission of the Graduate College of Rush University is to promote and assure excellence in research education and mentoring programs responsible for training outstanding and diverse candidates in the basic and clinical sciences . At Rush, the translation of bench research to the clinic and the develop- ment of evidence-based medical practice through clinical trials are critical goals of the institution . The faculty works side by side with the students to devise better detection approaches or to develop more effective interventions that improve patient outcomes and the health of all citizens of greater Chicago . The Graduate College promotes respectful, collaborative efforts and provides a rich educational and research environment for students to prepare for challenging careers in the fast-moving world of biomedical research . Vision Basic and clinical scientist graduates of the Graduate College will become leaders in their respective research fields, secure leadership positions in academia or industry, compete success- fully for extramural grants, and train the next generation of research scientists . Success in this regard relates to embr acing the culture of team science, understanding how your efforts can ensure sustained productivity in addressing strategic biomedi- cal problems, and leading in the advancement of the medical sciences and the promotion of health . Philosophy Rush University provides outstanding health sciences education and conducts impactful research in a culture of inclusion, focused on the promotion and preservation of the health and well-being of our diverse communities. This statement outlines a vibrant role for the Graduate College in preparing leaders to help Rush, and other institutions that share similar aspirations, to achieve success in transforming our health care system . The Graduate College was originally established in 1981, to provide opportunities for students to work with nationally recognized faculty to earn doctoral degrees in the sciences basic to health care . Students are engaged in highly individualized training to maximize opportunities for self-realization . F aculty members share their scholarly expertise and hands-on labora- tory and clinical research experiences with students in a variety of settings . The Graduate College is also addressing emerging training concerns as communicated by the National Institutes of Health in regard to optimal biomedical workforce preparation . To address issues with the torrential pace of research innovation as well as the realities of the rapidly evolving workplace, we have recently completed a comprehensive re-engineering of our laboratory-based doctoral and master's curriculum . In this pro - cess, we have placed a deeper emphasis on presenting course material from an integrated conceptual framework so that students are better prepared to manage the rapidly expanding body of complex biomedical information . Our curriculum moves from a disciplinary perspective to a more systematic, interdisci - plinary orientation that is intensely collaborative in nature . Thus, all laboratory-based graduate students will now jointly partici - pate in a common, integrated first-year curriculum exploring the shared foundations of biomedical sciences . This approach lever - ages the significant interaction of students with interests across the spectrum of biomedical sciences and provides a common knowledge base to allow students to move more fluidly into the team-based research phase of their specific programs . This integrated biomedical sciences curriculum also creates a more inclusive and welcoming feeling among students to encourage group learning and problem solving . The new integrated biomedical sciences master's program starts with a shared first-year course plan, but in the second year, students can personalize their research activities in any of five areas of translational research excellence at Rush . The Graduate College also includes a specialized master's program for laboratory-based biotechnology research and another program in clinical science research . We continue to evolve these course offerings to address the expanding need for clinical scientists and highly trained technical staff, respectively, to advance sci - ence in the 21st century . These programs also share the Rush unifying features including a high degree of individualized fac-ulty and student interaction through the educational processes of the college grounded in a productive, high-quality transla- tional research/clinical environment . Students find the open collaborative environment across the college with a shared focus on translational research through team-based research and care to constitute a highly favorable educational environment . The Graduate College: Organization The Graduate College Council The Graduate College Council is the senior representative body of the college . Its membership includes all progr am directors, including the directors of the PhD in nursing science and PhD in health sciences programs (that are run jointly with the College of Nursing and College of Health Sciences, respectively), as well as an elected faculty member from each of the programs serving for a term of two years, and three students from these programs (elected by the students annually) . Only the elected members and students are allowed to vote . An elected member of the Graduate College Council serves as the chair of the council . The council is the senior representative body of the faculty and is constituted to represent the college faculty and advise the dean regarding (i) the organization, function and coordination of edu- cational and research resources, services and activities among the various units of the college; (ii) adequacy of college facilities and infrastructure, (iii) effectiveness of the college's support services (e . g . , student services, technology, information systems, etc .); (iv) faculty grievance process; and (v) amendments to the policies and procedures . Under the Rush University governance , the Graduate College Council has a number of defined respon- sibilities in governing the college, such as conducting periodic reviews of all Graduate College program policies and procedures . The faculty of the Graduate College is drawn from the faculty of the other colleges of Rush University, who hold the same rank in the Graduate College as in their primary colleges . All of our programs are administered out of the dean's office and are overseen by the Graduate College Council . F aculty members from several programs participate in the education of students in each program . Program-Specific Education Committees The integrated biomedical sciences, biotechnology and clinical research programs all have education committees that monitor the process of student acceptance and progression and deal with curricular issues . Respective progr am directors chair these committees . Changes in curriculum must be approved by the Graduate College Council . Graduate College Student Council (GCSC) The Graduate College Student Council (GCSC) is an open forum, whereby any student member of the Graduate College (MS or PhD) can attend meetings held by the elected graduate student representatives . These meetings are for the students to discuss concerns related to the Graduate College, including the curricu- lum, insurance, academic matters, fund-raising, degree require- ments, professional development opportunities, and community engagement . All issues raised at these meetings will be brought to the attention of the Graduate College Council . Also, the GCSC coordinates awards given to the faculty by the graduate students (Mentor of the Year and Excellence in Teaching Award) . All stu - dents are encouraged to participate to ensure that their input is communicated . Students serving on the council are provided the opportunity to take an active role in college governance, serving as liaisons between the student body, the Graduate College, and the University . Also, as part of a community of science professionals, the GCSC partakes in university or community outreach programs such as fund-raisers, elementary school science demonstrations, and philanthropic work deemed appropriate by the members of the council that year . In recent years , the GCSC has instituted the Emerald Event, a large fund-raiser to enable the students of the Graduate College to attend scientific conferences and present their research . Since its beginning, the GCSC has raised money to pay for well over 50 travel awards . The GCSC has also helped in various charitable endeavors that raise money for research, as well as university-sponsored fund-raisers including golf outings, wine and cheese tastings, art auctions, and smaller projects throughout the year . The GCSC also organizes several social outings from BBQs to WhirlyBall competitions and intradepart- mental sporting competitions . Programs Doctor of Philosophy in Integrated Biomedical Sciences Program To facilitate their educational mission, the laboratory-based research PhD and MS programs, called the integrated biomedi - cal research programs, are organized into five tracks correspond - ing to interdisciplinary areas of research excellence at Rush that are also highly aligned with areas of clinical strength . This align - ment forms a fertile nexus for sustained, innovative translational collaboration . The tracks typically involve fluid interactions of relevant scientists, clinicians and other professionals working in flexible team structures . This new organizational approach builds on the strong legacy of the Graduate College but is designed to create a more stimulating learning environment for the students . This entails moving from the traditional discipline-focused curriculum to a more integrated, systems biology approach embracing multidisciplinary team-based science that is required for greater success in addressing existing complex biomedi- cal challenges . The learning environment in the new program format will enhance student-to-student interaction as students are immersed into the Rush research environment . All students participate in a shared integrated curriculum and then choose to conduct their doctoral or thesis research in one of five inter - disciplinary tracks that related to areas of excellence in clinical care as well as funded research at Rush . At the same time, we have broadened the array of faculty, representing a wider range of disciplines from basic science to clinical care and community health, working together to address critical biomedical problems in the five track areas .276 277 The five educational/ research tracks of the College are as follows: Cardiov ascular and respiratory biology Function and disorders of the musculosk eletal system Function and disorders of the nervous system Infection, immunity and inflammation research T ranslational cancer research The primary goal of each track is to provide excellent gradu- ate education in the sciences basic to medicine .

All competitive PhD applicants will be asked to interview over the phone, in person or via Skype . Acceptance of transfer credit: Petition for transfer of gradu- ate credit is consistent with University policy . Gr aduate-level transfer credit is subject to the approval of the faculty advisor, program director or designated college administrator based on an evaluation of quality and equivalence . F or graduate-level pro - grams, no more than one-third of the total number of required credits that contributed to the student's GPA may be granted to a student as transfer credit for work done at another graduate institution .The Graduate College: Shared Curriculum The Graduate College shared curriculum is designed to enhance interaction among students from all the programs while at the same time provide the basic knowledge base that the faculty have deemed necessary to become successful in science . The Graduate College curriculum runs for two consecutive semesters (fall and spring) and provides introductory training in molecular genetics, genomics cellular biochemistry, cell biology, tissue biol- ogy and cell signaling, as well as a comprehensive and system- atic overview of physiology and pharmacology . Students will also learn basic theories underlying modern scientific technique . In addition, the student will take courses in ethics, scientific writing and basic statistics . These courses will be supplemented by specialized, advanced courses offered by the individual programs . The following courses constitute the shared curriculum of the Graduate College (GCC): GCC-501 Molecular Biology: Genome to Proteome GCC-502 Cellular Transport and Signaling GCC-503 Functional Cell Biology GCC-504 Functional Tissue Biology GCC-505 Techniques in Biomedical Sciences GCC-506 Research Ethics GCC-507 Biomedical Statistics GCC-508 Scientific Writing GCC-510 Introduction to Pharmacology GCC-511 Readings in Molecular Biology GCC-512/513 Readings in Cellular Biochemistry and Functional Cell Biology GCC-514 Readings in Functional Tissue Biology GCC-544 Adv anced Statistics GCC-546 Principles of Biostatistics I GCC-547 Principles of Biostatistics II GCC-551 Ethics in Biomedical Research and the IRB GCC-593 Introduction to Gr antsmanship GCC-711 Advanced Readings in Molecular Biology GCC-712/713 Advanced Readings in Cellular Biochemistry and Functional Cell Biology GCC-714 Advanced Readings in Functional Tissue BiologyIn addition to these requirements, full-time PhD candidates in the Graduate College must attend a minimum of four ethics seminars per year following their first year of classes . F ailure to attend the required number of lectures or equivalent will delay graduation . The Graduate College: MS and PhD Degrees The Graduate College prepares students for the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees . The Doctor of Philosophy is awarded in recognition of high achievement in a particular field of scientific research as evidenced by submission of a dissertation that demonstrates the power of independent investigation and contributes to the body of existing knowl- edge . An undergraduate record of scholastic excellence is an important background for the Graduate College experience . The Graduate College also provides excellent research and training opportunities for advanced medical students who want to take time out of their medical school studies to enroll in the Graduate College in an MS or PhD program . The process of application review includes a search for evidence of creativity and scholarly potential in the applicant . Non-degree students are not admitted with advanced degree objectives and are ineligible to become candidates for advanced degrees . Upon approv al by a course director and appropriate registration, any individual may audit a course . In all cases , a student considering application for admission should first establish contact with the director of his or her choice of program to determine program requirements . The student must meet all of the requirements for progress and graduation in the graduate studies program . In this regard, individualized studies will be programmed to meet the student's need in achieving essential knowledge in preparation for these requirements . Doctor of Philosophy The degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) is the highest degree conferred by Rush University . The PhD is restricted to those scholars who have demonstrated superior ability in a recog- nized academic discipline . While each program has identified requirements, the PhD degree is not awarded following the completion of any specific number of formal courses nor on the basis of miscellaneous course studies and research . The entire PhD program must be integrated and highly research oriented . It should culminate in a work of literary and scholarly merit, which is indicative of the candidate's ability to conduct original research in a recognized specialty (generally in the form of a first-author manuscript) . PhD progr ams are directed by selected 280 281 faculty members who work closely with graduate students . In practice, each program is composed of formal courses, guided individual study in a chosen field or discipline, study in such cognate subjects as may be required by the candidate's advisory committee, and original research that serves as the basis of a required scholarly dissertation . Admission to Candidacy Admission to candidacy is evidence that the doctoral student has successfully completed all preliminary coursework and is prepared to move into an intensive research experience . Depending upon the program's requirements, these exams will test accumulated knowledge, scientific reasoning, and the ability to develop hypotheses and test them with appropriate designs . Admission to candidacy is a demonstration of confidence that the student will successfully accomplish the remaining require- ments of the program . Students who fail to achieve admission to candidacy, but have otherwise completed all other prerequisites, will be granted a terminal master's degree . Dissertation A doctoral student must complete a dissertation . This document is developed through faculty-guided independent research proj- ects . Review of the dissertation will follow the sequence of steps described in the manual \"Preparation of Theses and Doctoral Dissertations .\" Copies of this manual are available in each graduate program and in the Library of Rush University Medical Center . The dissertation must be original and cannot have been used to meet the requirement of any other degree, either at Rush University or at any other university . Each student will have a dissertation committee whose role it is to assure that the student's dissertation is of high quality and meets the standards of the program and the college for originality, contribution to the field and scholarly presentation . The role of the committee is also to assure that the student is making satisfactory progress toward completion of the degree . The dissertation committee is chosen by the student in conjunc- tion with the student's primary advisor and should consist of at least five total members . The primary advisor must be a member of the Graduate College . At least one member of the committee should be from outside of the program or track, and preferably from outside of the institution . Once the committee convenes , it will choose a chairperson, who cannot be the student's primary advisor . The chairperson will oversee the scheduling and activi - ties of the committee .At or near the completion of the dissertation, each student will share, by means of a public presentation with the academic community at large, the knowledge that the student has devel- oped . Students are responsible for posting announcements (at least two weeks prior to the presentation) on institutional bulle- tin boards and emailing all faculty and students of the Graduate College the title of the dissertation, the student's name, and the location, date and time of the public presentation . This public presentation must precede the final approval of the dissertation by the dissertation committee . Upon completion of the public presentation, the student will meet with the dissertation committee to review the presenta- tion, the dissertation document and the student's preparedness to enter the scientific community . A majority of members of the committee must sign the dissertation certifying the completion of all requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy degree . Master of Science The Master of Science degree is offered in many programs . This degree is designed to offer students an intermediate step in a career path, provide research experience to supplement their primary professional path or provide supplementary training for other reasons . The college offers two types of MS degrees: (1) the research MS in basic sciences or clinical research, which requires a thesis and traditionally takes two years to complete; and (2) a non-thesis MS that is a consequence of the successful completion of a series of classes and laboratory skills (i .e . , the MS in biotechnology) . Thesis The research MS degree requires the successful completion of course work and publication of a scientific thesis that reflects the research experience of the student . This thesis should reflect original work, which can be published in a peer-reviewed journal . The student, together with the advisor, will form a thesis committee consisting of three members: the advisor (who must be a member of the Graduate College) and two additional members . The advisor will work with the student to develop a research project that can be completed within the framework of the program . The committee members will assure the quality of the work and of the thesis document . Upon completion of the thesis, the student will present the findings in a public forum open to the University . The members of the committee, including the student's advisor, must sign off on the thesis, certifying the completion of all requirements for the MS degree .The Graduate College: Academic Policies The Graduate College adopts college-wide policies and pro- cedures and reviews program-specific regulations . Students follow the college and program-specific policies in effect at the time of initial matriculation in the Graduate College . However , the Graduate College reserves the right to make substan- tive changes in its programs after the student's matriculation . Students will be informed in writing by the program director of any changes made during their tenure in the program . Students re-entering the college after an absence will be guided by poli- cies and procedures in effect at the time of re-entry . Examination Policy Enforcing the examination policy of the college is the responsi- bility of the individual course director, who will inform students and the proctors about the examination requirements for that particular course . A period at the end of the semester is pro - vided for examinations; however, any form of assessment can be conducted at any week of the semester . This information will be included in the course schedule and syllabus . Pass/No Pass Grades Each program identifies all courses required of its students . Required courses are usually taken for letter grade and not under the pass/no pass (P/N) option . Research hours are gener - ally graded using the P/N option . However , a program may opt to provide a letter grade for research classes . P ostcandidacy research hours (over 600) for doctoral students are graded as P/N . Good Academic Standing To remain in good academic standing, students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3 .0 and meet the require - ments of their program . A student must be in good academic standing to be admitted to candidacy and to graduate . Students failing to maintain a GPA of 3 .0 will be notified by the dean in writing that their student status has been changed to \"on pro- bation .\" Students who fail to remediate their deficiencies within one academic year or are placed on probationary status a third time are subject to dismissal by the Graduate College . Academic Difficulty Each program has policies and procedures regarding students who fail to maintain good academic standing . While the respon - sibilities of informing students of their academic problems and of establishing conditions for regaining good academic stand- ing reside within the program, the Graduate College Council monitors the progress and promotion of all students and gives final approval to award students' degrees . Dismissal Each program establishes grounds for dismissal beyond the minimal criteria established by the Graduate College . Should a program recommend the dismissal of a student, the director will forward such recommendation to the Graduate College Council for final action . Letters of dismissal come from the dean . Appeal of a dismissal action begins within the appropriate program . Full-time Enrollment Full-time enrollment is required of all Graduate College students with the exception of the clinical research students and students within the PhD programs in nursing science and health sciences . Full-time students must register for at least nine semester hours for each term, except when advised differently . Students must obtain written permission from the program director for excep- tions to this policy . Students receiving a thesis-requiring master' s degree from the Graduate College as a full-time student must be enrolled for all terms between their matriculation and gradu- ation . The average length of this program is five semesters . Part-time students earning a master's degree must be enrolled a minimum of two semesters per academic year . The accelerated, non-thesis master's program's length is two semesters . The mini - mum requirement for graduation from the college is program specific . At the time of graduation, the student must be enrolled in the college . The maximum time allowed to graduate from a full-time thesis-requiring master's degree program is four years starting with the first semester of official enrollment; for the PhD degree, the maximum time is five years . Residency Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) candidates are expected to meet all requirements for graduation within five enrolled academic years in the Graduate College (excluding leaves of absence [see below]) . This period begins with the semester in which the stu - dent formally matriculates . A student exceeding that time limita - tion must submit to the Graduate College Council, in writing, a request to extend their candidacy beyond that time period . This request must identify the reasons for the extension and provide a written plan with reasonable deadlines for completion . This document will be co-signed by the student's advisor and pro- gram director . The council will then vote whether to accept the extension or not (passed by simple majority) . The student's advi - sor will then provide an update on the student's progress after six months . One year after the extension is gr anted, the student is expected to complete all requirements . A second request may 282 283 be made by the student's advisor and program director, but will be accepted only through a two-thirds majority of the voting members present at a formal hearing of the Graduate College Council . Within one year of that second request, the student must complete all requirements for the PhD degree or face dis- missal . Alternatively, the student may be awarded a MS degree upon the recommendation of the student's graduate program . Readmission Any student who has withdrawn from the University or any dismissed student may apply for readmission by submitting an application for this purpose to the Graduate College admis- sion office . An interview may be required . A re-entering student must meet the conditions for re-enrollment stated in his or her dismissal or re-entry acceptance letter and all policies, require - ments and course sequence in effect at the time of re-entry . The student will pay tuition and fees at the rates in effect at the time of re-enrollment . Application deadlines may vary by program . Academic Progression The graduate program, in concert with the rules of the college and Rush University, develops specific regulations governing the process that results in final awarding of the degree . While such regulations differ slightly from one program to another, the Graduate College Council reviews each program's regulations for approval . In all cases , graduate programs are required to be explicit and clear about regulations that will affect the candi- date . This must be stringently observed in program regulations concerning selection of principal advisors, advisory committees and a plan of study . Similarly , programs will be explicit and clear concerning academic policies and procedures surrounding qualifying, preliminary and final examinations when they are required . The programs are also responsible for providing the candidate with the support needed to plan and conduct the dissertation research . At the same time, a major responsibility of the student is to become familiar with the regulations and expectations of his or her chosen program . These regulations and expectations are included in this catalog within the sections devoted to each program and are also included within program publications . The student is responsible for understanding the regulations and monitoring changes that may occur during his or her tenure in the program . Student Academic Appeals Policy Any student of the Graduate College may appeal a final course grade, failure on a preliminary or comprehensive examination, or failure of the thesis or dissertation that results in his or her academic probation or dismissal from the University . A student may also appeal an unreasonable delay in his or her graduation from the University . No other issues may be appealed through this process . The process for filing an appeal is maintained by each program . The student may request a copy of the program appeal process from the program director . This process will be completed within one semester . If a resolution cannot be achieved at the division level, the following procedure must be followed . At any step in the process, the student may withdraw the appeal by written notification to the program director with a copy to the dean . In the event of a dismissal decision, a student may continue to enroll until the appeal process is completed or the student withdraws the appeal . Step 1: If the student wishes to appeal the decision beyond the program, within two weeks of receiving a decision from the pro - gram, the student will submit a written statement to the dean requesting consideration of his or her case by an advisory panel . The student must provide the following in the written statement: Course number and gr ade being appealed or other cause for probation or dismissal (i .e . , failure on a preliminary or comprehensive examination, or of the thesis or dissertation) Action being requested Justification for the request An outline of the efforts and actions already tak en to obtain consideration of the request The student will send copies of this communication to the program director and the dean's office . In addition, if a course grade is being appealed, the student will send a copy to the course director . If the ev aluation of a thesis or dissertation is being appealed, the student will send a copy to the chairper - son of the thesis or dissertation committee . The advisory panel will be the Graduate College Council . Its chairperson will be appointed by the dean from among the members . The program director of the student's program and any other member who is evaluating the student's academic status will not vote . Step 2: Within two weeks after notification to the dean, the chairperson of the advisory panel will arrange a meeting of the advisory panel . It will submit a written recommendation to the dean . Step 3: Within two weeks following receipt of the advisory panel's recommendation and upon discussion with the student and with others as appropriate, the dean shall reach a final deci - sion and notify each party of the decision . The decision reached by the dean is final .The issues discussed and the outcomes of all meetings in this appeal process are documented . This record-keeping is the responsibility of a faculty member who is to be designated at each meeting . Copies of the documentation should be distrib - uted to the individuals present at a meeting, to the program director and to the dean and should be placed in the student's academic file . Academic Honesty and Student Conduct The Graduate College and its programs follow the University policies on academic honesty and the University statement on student conduct . Each student is expected to conduct himself or herself at all times in a professional manner \u2014 a manner that conforms to the ethics of the profession and that instills confidence in one's abilities as a working scientist . Irresponsible or unethical behavior, as determined by the Graduate College honor code committee, may result in dismissal from the program . The college and its programs will not condone cheating in any form . Allegations of cheating will be reviewed by the program director with the help of an ad hoc committee . If merited, the report will be forwarded to the Graduate College honor code committee . Rush University Academic Policies The Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains additional Rush University academic policies . This Rush University catalog also details the policies regarding inclusion of minorities and those with disabilities, as well as the policies and procedures for reporting harassment . Students who may need special accommodations can access this information at www . rushu . rush . edu/students-disabilities . The Graduate College: Committees The Graduate College Council The Graduate College Council is the senior representative body of the college . Its membership includes all progr am directors, the directors of the integrated biomedical sciences, biotechnology and clinical research programs, the directors of the PhD in nurs- ing science and PhD in health sciences programs (that run jointly with the College of Nursing and College of Health Sciences, respectively), as well as an elected faculty member from each of the programs serving for a term of two years, and three students from these programs (elected by the students annually) . Only the elected members and students are allowed to vote . The dean or his or her designee serves as the chair of the council . The council is responsible for setting policies for the admission of students; the formulation and adoption of general operating policies, standards and procedures of the college; the appoint- ment of the Graduate College faculty; and the approval of those recommended for degrees . Although the dean and the council maintain significant oversight of programs in the Graduate College, the programs also establish policies and procedures consistent with the policies and procedures of the college and the University . The Graduate College Council periodically reviews all program policies and procedures .284 285 The Graduate College: Academic Programs Biotechnology (MS) Clinical research (MS) Integrated biomedical sciences (MS and PhD) Master of Science Biotechnology , MS Biotechnology: Program Overview The Graduate College offers a nine-month, non-thesis academic, research and laboratory master's-level training program designed to prepare the student for a research career in the pharmaceuti- cal and biotechnology industries or the university laboratory . This program is also an excellent preparation for further training in graduate school or professional doctoral programs . The student will take the Graduate College's core curriculum series of didactic courses covering principles of molecular biology and genetics, cellular biochemistry, cell biology, tissue biol- ogy, system physiology and pharmacology . Additional courses designed specifically to prepare students for a career in the laboratory and research, including Experimental Design and Models in Disease, Tools for Research, Biostatistics, Research Ethics, Scientific Writing, and Communication and Management, are also required . Finally , students will participate in hands-on laboratory courses designed to cover the common and most important techniques and methods employed in research today . The student will also participate in the IPE 502 university course, which will expose students to interprofessional teamwork in health care settings . The course will appear on the student's transcript . The laboratory and research experiences will ensure proficiency in a wide variety of techniques, making the student highly competitive for employment in this ever-expanding and understaffed job market . This program also gives an excellent exposure to basic science and its applications in translational research, thus serving those students who wish to further their studies in professional schools (medical, dental, pharmacy and other health sciences) or join a PhD program . Biotechnology: Admission Requirements Admissions to the biotechnology program are offered for the fall semester only . The Graduate College feels that a qualified and dedicated student can complete the requirements of the full-time curriculum within the two-semester academic plan . It must be emphasized that this is a rigorous program that will require full attention and commitment by the student . The faculty of the Graduate College encourages diversity among the student population and therefore seeks to admit persons from various backgrounds . The Graduate College uses the follow - ing guidelines to evaluate candidates for admission: 1. Deadline for applications: All F-1 visa holders are encour - aged to apply by March 15 . F or U . S . students , applications are received until the class is filled; however, applications must be completed with all supporting documents received by June 30 .2. Application r equirements: All students must complete an application to the Gr aduate College online . A minimum of three letters of recommendation are required, and a minimum of two should come from academic sources . An interview may be required . Students must have scores submitted for the GRE or an equivalent test (e . g . , MCAT, DAT, PCAT or other equivalent exam in the sciences) . Although no specific score on these exams is required, students scoring above the 50th per - centile are strongly encouraged to apply . GRE is w aived for applicants with a PhD degree in basic science or a professional degree in health sciences (e . g . , MD, DO, DDS, PharmD) . Students with a GP A of 3 . 0 or better on a 4 . 0-point scale are strongly encouraged to apply . Please submit an official tr anscript from each college or university attended . All transcripts must be received in an original sealed envelope or through secured email from the institution . Scanned items can be used for review and preliminary admission decisions; however, official documents will be required for final admission decision . F ormal course by course grade/diploma certification by ECE is required of all students who have completed their last degree outside of the U . S . Applicants whose native language is other than English and who do not hold an equivalent of a U . S . bachelor' s degree from an institution in a country where English is the official language must submit TOEFL scores . 3. Acceptance letter s: Official acceptances for students will come only from the dean's office . No students will be accepted after August 1 unless they had been officially placed on a wait list . Specific admission requirements may be waived by the Graduate College Council . These will be addressed on a case-by-case basis . Applicants who may have special or unique qualities that make them strong candidates for graduate education are also encour - aged to apply . Research and related job experience are v alued highly in the admissions process and will be taken into account . Interviews with applicants are extremely helpful and can play a significant part in the admission decision . Beyond these measures , the faculty attempts to determine the applicant's motivation and potential for advanced study and a research career in the sciences . Once the Office of College Admissions Services has received all required documents, including the application fee, the applicant's 286 287 admission materials are reviewed by the program director and approved by the dean . In special circumstances , the application file is sent to the Graduate College Council, where a review of the application takes place . The Office of College Admissions Services then notifies the applicant of the decision . Additional information and the admission application are available at www . rushu . rush . edu/gradcol . Biotechnology: Academic Policies Academic Standing All students who maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3 .0 while completing the required course sequence with full-time enrollment will be considered to be in good academic standing within the Graduate College and are eligible for gradu - ation with the MS degree . Any student who fails to maintain a 3 .0 grade point average will be considered to be in academic difficulty until the deficiency is corrected . Those requirements will be determined by the Biotechnology program director with the advice of the dean and the Graduate College Council . A student in academic difficulty is not eligible for graduation . Graduate College/Rush University Academic Policies Academic policies specific to the Graduate College are located earlier in this catalog . In addition, the Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies . Biotechnology: Graduation Requirements The successful completion of the biotechnology curriculum with a minimum 3 .0 (4 .0 scale) cumulative GPA will qualify the stu - dent for graduation .

Students with other advanced degrees including nursing and pharmacy degrees and experience in clinical trials may also apply; however, an advanced degree is not required . Many stu - dents in the program are physicians in fellowship programs at Rush and Stroger Hospitals . Students seeking admission to the Master of Science in Clinical Research program must complete an application and provide formal transcripts from all institu - tions of higher education that were previously attended . The deadline for application is generally July 30, although exceptions can be made . Applicants must enter the program in the fall semester, which starts in early September . The majority of stu - dents applying to this program are current health professionals, and if an advanced health professional degree is documented, no entrance examination is required . If the applicant does not hold a professional degree, the GRE must be taken, except in instances where professional experience would demonstrate performance in the field . If evidence of performance is in the 50th percentile in national examinations (e . g . , MCAT or USMLE Step 1, or an equivalent test score or DAT) is provided, the GRE requirements can be waived . Applications will be reviewed by the program director . and students will be notified when they are accepted . Clinical Research: Thesis Process After identifying a mentor, the student and mentor will begin to outline the research project during the spring and summer of the first year . This project can be of the student's own design or, alternatively, a student may participate in a large multicenter trial, provided permission is received in advance for publication of the subset of that data collected by the student as a thesis . Any project that involves patient-oriented research (requires IRB approval, or involves a systematic review of patient data) can be submitted . By midterm of the spring semester , the student will present the project in the form of a scientific abstract with anticipated methods, statistical analyses, power analysis and possible outcomes . The program director must approve the abstract . Once approved, an IRB application can be submitted . The student is required to complete the research and write up the findings as a research thesis . The student is then encouraged to formulate the thesis into a scientific journal article and submit the manuscript for publication in a peer-reviewed journal . If a manuscript is not written and submitted, the student must still present a written thesis for consideration for degree completion . All students will present their work publicly prior to graduation . The mentor and program director sign the completed thesis document indicating acceptance of the thesis for completion of the degree . There are no written or oral qualifying exams for the program . Clinical Research: Academic Policies For a student to remain in good standing, the Graduate College requires that the student have a passing (B or higher) cumula- tive average for all required coursework . F or this purpose a P will count as a B for grade averaging . Students are expected to attend all classes and participate in discussion . Students are also expected to participate in the various computer laboratories that are routinely held in the McCormick Educational Technology Center (METC) throughout the first year of the program, where biostatistics courses are taught . Students are expected to conduct themselves in a profes- sional manner . This includes respecting the rights of others and being kind and courteous to students, faculty/staff and patients . Intimidation of other students and faculty/staff will not be tolerated and is grounds for dismissal . Sexual har assment as well as harassment related to race, color, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, age, marital or parental status, or disability is prohibited . The University Bulletin details the policies regarding inclusion of minorities and those with disabilities as well as the policies and procedures for reporting harassment . The Graduate College understands that many of the students are clinicians, but it does expect for them to be on call during class time (generally 3:30 to 7:00 p . m . on Tuesdays and Thursdays) . The Master of Science in Clinical Research program follows the University policies on academic honesty and student conduct . Student Grievance Procedure Numerous checks are in place to assure the fair treatment of students . However , if a grievance does evolve, the student should speak with the program director first in an attempt to resolve the problem . If this is unsuccessful or the griev ance involves the program director, the student's grievance can be appealed to the dean of the college .

All students in the program are required to maintain a cumulative average of \"B\" or greater (or pass) . Courses offered are gr aded in year one either as pass/ no pass or with a letter grade . With the exception of the IRB modules, all classes in the first year are scheduled on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:30 to 7:00 p . m . Students are recommended to take the readings courses along with Introduction to Grantsmanship . The students will also meet periodically with the program director during the second year to monitor progress on their master's thesis research project . A trainee who fails a class or receives a no-pass grade in a course will have an opportunity to retake the exam or rewrite the paper to reverse the no-pass grade . A cumulative aver - age of \"B\" or greater (pass) in required courses is needed to continue in the program . F ailure to remediate the no-pass grade will automatically require the program director to review the trainee's status and officially place the trainee on academic probation for a period of one semester . The course director will develop a remediation plan to ensure the trainee has mastery of the subject area covered . second year is designed to provide an intense clinical research project under a mentor's guidance and the preparation of a master's thesis . Students usually enroll in at least six credit hours per semester . These are typically research hours (CRE- 597) or elective readings classes . The student and mentor will identify a clinical research project and will submit that project in the form of an abstract by the end of the spring semester of year 1 . The student and mentor will further refine the proposal in the summer between the first and second years . Only projects relating to clinical research questions will be considered for this program . The student is expected to complete all of the data col - lection by the beginning of the spring semester for submission of the thesis by the end of the spring semester of the second year . Minimum Credit Hours Required Successful completion of the clinical research program requires 32 semester hours as a minimum for graduation along with preparation and public defense of a written thesis . Integrated Biomedical Sciences Integrated Biomedical Sciences: Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Integrated Biomedical Sciences: Philosophy The PhD in integrated biomedical sciences is designed to educate science professionals for leadership in research and academic positions, as well as provide career path education relevant to their specialized field . In the past, Rush offered doc - toral degrees in anatomy, biochemistry, immunology, neurologi- pharmacology . Since collabor ative interdisciplinary teams of scientists perform current and future biomedical research, we no longer offer, individual basic science degrees . Instead our new doctor al program emphasizes an integrated interdisciplinary approach to biomedical research . Graduates of this program will perform high-quality, impactful biomedical research at colleges and universities, government agencies, hospitals and nonprofit agencies and in industry . Students in the program will work with faculty and scientists to generate new knowledge in the biomedical fields using sophisticated research methods and statistics . As a part of the program, students are required to pass a comprehensive pre - liminary examination and demonstrate their knowledge of core and concentration specific course work . They will design and conduct research that culminates in a dissertation, and they will disseminate their scientific findings through scholarly publica- tions and presentations . Integrated Biomedical Sciences: PhD Admission Requirements Applicants must enter the program in the fall semester in order to begin the required course work in the core curriculum . The deadline for submission of applications is generally March 1 . International applications can be accepted after March 1 but must take into consideration the delays associated with the necessary visa arrangements . The Integrated Biomedical Sciences Program has the following requirements for admission to the program: A baccalaureate degree from an accredited college is required . Course work in biology , cellular biology, molecular biology, physics, chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry and mathematics, including calculus, is highly recommended . Upper-level biochemistry or physiology courses are also highly recommended . Official academic tr anscripts from all baccalaureate and post - baccalaureate educational experiences are required . These should provide a minimal grade point average of 3 .0 overall (A = 4 .0) . Higher gr ades are expected in science courses, and evidence of research experience is preferred . GRE or MCA T scores are required . All applicants whose native language is not English are required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) . Applicants from foreign countries must have their transcripts evaluated by ECE, an independent agency . A statement of the applicant' s interests, previous research experience, and goals needs to be included as an essay in the application . The personal statement must include a ranking of the student's interest in the five rese arch tracks . If the 290 291 student's research track interest is not clear, then the student should list \"undecided .\" T hree letters of recommendation, two from academic resources, are required . We prefer these to be from science faculty who can evaluate the character of the applicant, the applicant's academic and research performance, and the applicant's ability to think and work independently . The admissions committee will evaluate applications . All prior academic experience and the letters of recommendation will be evaluated for an indication of the applicant's potential for suc- cess as a graduate student and future independent investigator . With rare exceptions, PhD applicants will be required to inter - view with faculty members before admission to the program . Acceptance into the doctoral program is limited by the availabil-ity of stipends and by the availability of faculty to act as men - tors . All accepted doctoral students receive a competitive stipend and tuition scholarship . The stipend and tuition scholarship is renewed each year providing the student is making satisfactory progress toward the degree . Integrated Biomedical Sciences: Curriculum Cognates and Electives For graduation, students will need 16 credits of cognate hours and 9 credits of elective hours in courses that they select . They can take these at any time throughout their tenure as a PhD student .

Two credit hours of GCC 598 is defined as full-time . GCC-694 - 698 Advanced Topic Seminar courses count as cognates and are taken for one semester hour of credit each fall and spring term starting in the second year for a maximum of eight credits . The Advanced Topic Seminar course should align with the student's research track . GCC-699 Dissertation Research: Students are expected to register for a low number of research credits each semester since only 18 credits of dissertation research are required for graduation . Two credit hours are considered to be a full-time commitment to research . Years 3 to 5 In years 3 through 5, the emphasis is on research . A student works with their dissertation advisor, research advisory commit- tee and track director, to determine the most appropriate mix of cognates, electives and research hours each semester . While registrations appear similar in years 3 through 5, the nature and character of the research changes, and the student passes through a number of steps toward completion of the PhD .292 293 Integrated Biomedical Sciences: PhD Dissertation Program Progression Year 1 Classes and Comprehensive Exam The goal of the course work in the first year is to expose stu- dents to the biomedical sciences to enable them to design and approach a research problem from molecular, biochemical, cel- lular and organ system perspectives . The reading courses provide a critical understanding of the literature and existing base of knowledge . They will also show the students how new knowl - edge in these areas can help us understand diseases and use this information to identify new therapeutics . This broad-based approach to disease is the core of the Integrated Biomedical Sciences Program . The Topics in Biomedical Integration I course (GCC-531) is offered in the spring semester of the first year . In this course, a specific disease will be studied from the molecular perspective to organ system failure under faculty direction . The students will then be assigned a group project in which they use the approaches they have learned to study another disease . This project will strengthen students' skills in preparation for the comprehensive exam . In the summer , GCC-532 Topics in Biomedical Integration II is the comprehensive exam in which students will be given an individualized disease topic related to their planned research . They will be required to write a literature review approaching the topic from each biomedical prospective . Year 1 Research Experience During the first year, every student will have three laboratory rotations: GCC-530 Laboratory Rotations I (variable), GCC-533 Laboratory Rotations II (variable) and GCC-534 Laboratory Rotations III (variable) . Each rotation must be in a different labo - ratory . A student registering for the three required Laboratory Rotations courses should consecutively use GCC 530, 533 or 534 . These laboratory rotations will expose the students to a range of research environments . Students are expected have a small project with a hypothesis and aims, to learn techniques and to attend all lab meetings . Based on these rotations and other discussions with potential advisors, the student will submit the names of three potential research advisors with a prior - ity ranking to the IBS education committee . The IBS education committee in consultation with the potential advisors will decide which student will be matched with which advisor . Students committed to a particular laboratory (funded by the research advisor's grants) are also required to do three laboratory rota - tions . Exposure to other labor atories and research will give the student a greater breadth of knowledge . Students are expected to select a research advisor and a research track by the end of their first summer term . All advisors must meet the criteria established by the program . Year 2 Track Selection, Research Experience, Qualifying Exam The selection of a research advisor will significantly influence the student's selection of a research track . Subsequent classes will be dictated by the track cognates and electives and by relevant electives offered in other tracks . The selection of electives should complement research activity and the interests of the student and should help prepare the student for the career path identified through the use of the Individual Development Plan (IDP) website (http://myidp . sciencecareers . org) and additional resources provided by the Graduate College . The goals of the student in the second year are to learn the relevant laboratory techniques and to develop a research proposal in conjunction with the research advisor . The research project will advance knowledge in a specific discipline and yield first-author scientific publications for the student . The student's research proposal should include specific aims and be written up as an F31 grant (see the \"Dissertation Proposal and Presentation\" section below) . The student must select a dissertation committee and present the proposal to the committee by the end of the second year . The proposal presentation to the committee is considered the qualifying exam . Acceptance of the proposal by the disserta - tion committee means the student is a candidate for the PhD . The student's assessment at this time relates to the following student learning outcomes: T he graduate will be able to acquire research skills, collect and analyze data, and interpret results in order to address an original research question . In addition, this step begins the continuing assessment of the following outcomes: A gr aduating student will be capable of independent critical thinking and writing as well as proposing, performing and effectively presenting his or her research . T he graduate will be able to work collaboratively with other scientists, physicians and health care professionals to give and obtain feedback concerning the approach to research problems, data analysis and implications of research . The work environment in basic and clinical science is evolv- ing . Students need to be aw are of the many different types of opportunities available in the workplace and need to prepare themselves for the opportunities and challenges that they will encounter when they graduate . In addition to the research and the course work that the students will be involved in, the students will create an individual development plan (IDP) to define their areas of interest, including teaching, administration, research in industry or academic research . At the end of the first year, the program and track directors will review each student's IDP and progress in the program . Upon gr aduation, the gradu - ates will have used the IDP , mentorship and training opportuni- ties to refine their career path . Student progress is assessed at the end of years 2 to 5 . F or year 2, the assessment of student progress to meet expected out- comes will be evaluated by the student's research advisor and track director . See the \"Dissertation Proposal and Presentation\" section below . Years 3 to 5 Research Progress/Publications/ Dissertation For evaluations in years 3 to 5, students will submit a writ- ten report documenting their progress . The research advisor and track director will also submit their assessment of student progress for each year . A meeting with the student, research advisor and track director will take place at the end of each year to discuss the student's progress . The research advisor monitors the day-to-day progress of the student . The dissertation committee will meet at least once per year to monitor progress and to approve any changes to the proposed research project . They may meet more frequently, especially after the approval of the student's research proposal . The student is expected to attend national meetings, make pre - sentations and posters, etc ., and become a part of the scientific community . Lik ewise, the student should be submitting research articles . The Integrated Biomedical Science PhD program requires that the research project yield at least one first-author research article accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal . The publication requirement is necessary for graduation but not sufficient . The dissertation committee will continue to assess student progress on the aims and determines when the student has completed his or her dissertation . (See \"Dissertation Proposal and Presentation\" below . ) The student's assessment continues on the outcomes listed above with emphasis on the growth of research and commu- nication skills . Lik ewise, it is expected that the communication outcomes will also become more centered on written commu-nication in the form of abstracts, peer-reviewed journal articles and the dissertation as the student begins to complete the following outcome: T he graduate is able to contribute to the scientific literature in an area of expertise via published abstracts, a disserta - tion and the publication of a first-author research article in a refereed journal .Thesis Document, Presentation and Approval The student is expected to write a thesis document (approved by the director of the Library of Rush University Medical Center) and present the work in a public lecture attended by the thesis committee and University faculty and students . The thesis com - mittee will then meet with the student in a closed session to address any additional questions and to deliberate on approval of the thesis . Typically the meeting immediately follows the pub - lic lecture . The student may be asked to make revisions before final thesis approval by the committee . The registrar's office must be notified of impending completion of the degree by submis- sion of an Intent to Graduate form at the beginning of the final semester . As the thesis is reaching final form, the student should consult with the University librarian to assure that the document is formatted correctly . Once the thesis is approved, the student will complete the final checklist to assure that all necessary approvals have been obtained . Each student will be required to have an exit interview and provide feedback concerning his or her experience at Rush University . Minimum Credit Hours Required for the Integrated Biomedical Sciences PhD Degree The PhD in integrated biomedical sciences should be completed in five years and requires completion of 80 semester hours of credit distributed as follows: core courses (37), concentration specific cognates (16), electives (9) and dissertation research (18) . The core curriculum, which is common to all students, builds knowledge and skills in research theories and methodol-ogy, data analysis and statistics, laboratory applications and skills, and the molecular and cellular sciences basic to health and disease . These courses provide systematic exposure to the contemporary process of scientific discovery and will serve as the basis for the remainder of the curriculum . Advanced students entering with a Master of Science (MS) degree in a biomedical science or a Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree may have satisfied the requirement for some of the core classes based on their prior records . Therefore, some core course requirements may be waived, and then the requirement of core course hours can be compensated by taking extra hours of laboratory rotations or pre-dissertation research . These students may be able to complete the degree in a shorter time period providing that they progress through the other program requirements . Students will be required, in conjunction with their advisors, to select from concentration-focused cognates in one of five tracks: translational cancer research; cardiovascular and respiratory biology; immunity, inflammation and infection; disorders of the musculoskeletal system; and disorders of the nervous system . All students will be required to participate in track-specific 294 295 advanced topic seminars and to complete a minimum of 18 semester hours of dissertation research following admission into candidacy for the PhD . Dissertation hours in the Gr aduate College encompass laboratory research required for comple-tion of the dissertation, including analyzing published data; developing a research proposal; learning and applying advanced methodologies and statistical data analyses; developing skills to write and submit a pre-doctoral training grant application; practicing presentation skills to disseminate one's own research findings in national conferences; writing a research publication; and developing and defending a dissertation project . Integrated Biomedical Sciences: Academic Policies Academic Advisor/Principal Advisor The program director functions as the academic advisor to the student during the first year . During this time , the program director determines the course schedule with the student and monitors the student's progress . In the second year , the track director works with the research advisor and assists the student in selecting the proper cognates and electives . Research Advisor Selection During the first year, the student, in consultation with the program director and track directors in areas related to the student's interests, will select three laboratories for research rotations . Based on these rotations , the student will identify the track he or she is interested in and submit the names of three potential advisors with a priority ranking to the IBS educa- tion committee . The IBS education committee, in consultation with the potential advisors, will match students with advisors . Students who are already committed to a particular laboratory (funded by the research advisor's grants) are still required to take three laboratory rotations . The student's research project should advance knowledge in a specific discipline and yield first- author scientific publications for the student . Integrated Biomedical Sciences: Track/Research Opportunities The research tracks for the Integrated Biomedical Sciences PhD Program are translational cancer research; cardiovascular and respiratory biology; immunity, inflammation and infection; func - tions and disorders of the musculoskeletal system; and func- tions and disorders of the nervous system . The tracks include qualified faculty from Rush University Medical Center who have an interest in research in these tracks . They come from academic departments as well as clinical departments, which enables students to select a variety of individuals with basic and clinical expertise to serve on their advisory committees and guide them through their projects . Qualifying Exams Comprehensive exam \u2014 In the summer quarter following the first year of classes, all students will take GCC-532 Topics in Biomedical Integration II . This course is their comprehensive exam where each student will be given an individualized disease topic related to their planned research . They will be required to write a literature review approaching the topic . This comprehensive exam assures that the student can approach a research or clinical problem from a variety of perspectives, accounting for the published literature that illu- minates the molecular, cellular and organ systems manifesta- tions of the disease process . Qualifying exam (dissertation proposal and presentation) \u2014 The student must select a dissertation committee and present the proposal to the committee by the end of the second year . The student's research proposal should include at least three specific aims and be written up as a National Institutes of Health F31 grant . Acceptance of the proposal by the disserta - tion committee means the student is a candidate for the PhD . Dissertation Research Committee After passing comprehensive exams, the student selects a research advisor and begins to collect preliminary data . By the end of spring of the second year, the student and advisor will select a research committee in consultation with the track director . This committee will advise the student and evaluate his or her dissertation . The Graduate College requires that the committee include five members and that one member be the student's mentor or advisor . A majority of the committee (at least three members) must be faculty at Rush who are mem- bers of the Graduate College . The chair of this committee, who cannot be the student's mentor or advisor, will be chosen at the first committee meeting and will preside at all subsequent meetings and arrange for timely completion of the dissertation work . The dissertation committee will strive for consensus in all its actions; however, a majority vote of the committee's member - ship is sufficient for all activities except the final approval of the dissertation, in which case only one member may disagree with the final decision . In addition to the five committee members , either the director of the graduate program, the associate direc- tor or a track director will serve as an ex officio member of the committee .Dissertation Proposal and Presentation Before the end of the spring semester of the second year, each student will present a thesis proposal that the student has developed with a thesis advisor and graduate committee . The format for the written portion of this requirement is the stan-dard Individual National Research Service Award (F31) mecha- nism . In addition, a comprehensive review of the literature relevant to the proposed studies is highly recommended as an adjunct document for this requirement . All students are highly encouraged to submit these proposals to the National Institutes of Health for consideration of funding . The schedule for submis - sion deadlines is April 8, Aug . 8 and Dec . 8 of every year . Once the written document is completed, the thesis pro-posal will be presented, in seminar format, to the Integrated Biomedical Sciences Program, with the written portion provided to the student's committee at least one week prior to the presentation date . A formal committee meeting with disserta - tion proposal defense will follow this presentation . During this meeting, the quality and merit of the project will be assessed, and a determination as to whether the work satisfies the degree requirements or what measures for remediation are required to satisfy this requirement will be made at this time . Upon suc - cessful completion of this requirement, the status of doctoral candidate is conferred on the student . It is recommended that this requirement be satisfied as early in the second year as is reasonably attainable . In the event that a student does not satisfy this requirement before the end of the summer of the second year, the student and advisor will need to present to the IBS education committee a reason as to why this requirement has not been satisfied and provide a plan for remediation . Once the dissertation proposal requirement has been satisfied, each student will present an oral and written annual update to his or her committee, detailing progress made in the previ- ous year . The committee will review progress of the project and the candidate's career development . In addition, the Individual Development Plan (IDP) website, which helps students identify career goals (http://myidp . sciencecareers . org), should be used whenever possible to track and report all professional develop- ment activities . Completion of the Degree In the candidate's final year, a dissertation data defense will be presented to the candidate's committee demonstrating that satisfactory progress has been made on the project to justify development of a plan to complete all experiments and to initi- ate dissertation preparation . Upon completion of this phase , the student will present the dissertation to the University in written form (approved by the director of the Library of Rush University Medical Center) and present the work in a public one-hour lecture attended by the dissertation committee and faculty and students of the University . The dissertation committee will then meet in closed session with additional questions and will approve the dissertation . Typically the meeting immediately follows the public lecture . In line with the rules and procedures of the Graduate College, the committee strives for a consensus, but the dissertation can be approved over the objections of a single committee member . However , if two committee members disapprove the dissertation, then it is not approved . The award - ing of the PhD degree requires the demonstration of a capabil- ity for independent research and a contribution to scientific knowledge . It is assumed that one or more research articles will be included in the dissertation . Since a peer -reviewed, first-author research article is required for the degree, the dissertation is not consid- ered complete until this article has been published . If publica - tion is pending, the committee may sign off on the dissertation, but the program director will not sign off until the paper is published . The registrar's office must be notified of impending completion of the degree by submission of an Intent-to-Graduate Form at the beginning of the final semester . As the dissertation is reach - ing final form, the student should consult with the University librarian to assure that the dissertation is formatted correctly . Once the dissertation is approved, the student will complete the final checklist to assure that all necessary approvals have been obtained . Students will be required to have an exit interview and provide feedback concerning their experience at Rush University . Student Grievance Procedure A student who is having difficulty with a course, anticipates being absent from class, or faces an emergency that will impact his or her attendance or performance should contact his or her course director . A student with a problem in laboratory rota - tions or research should attempt to resolve the issue through direct communication with the laboratory advisor or mentor . A good-faith attempt to plan or resolve any issues directly with the course director, laboratory advisor or mentor should always be the first course of action . If this fails , the student should bring the concern to the program director if the student is a first-year student or to the track director if the student has already identi- fied a track . The program director or track director will work with the student and faculty member(s) to resolve the issue . If it is a serious issue, the program director, track director or faculty member may involve the education committee . The student may 296 297 also appeal directly to the education committee by requesting in writing that it meet to discuss the issue . The education com - mittee will meet within 10 days to render a judgment to best address the interests of the student within the guidelines of the Integrated Biomedical Sciences PhD Program . Students must maintain a B average in the first year . If they drop below a B average, they should discuss the possibility of remediation with the director of the course they had difficulty with . The course director may issue an incomplete grade for a limited time in accordance with University policy while agreed- upon remediation takes place . However , once a failing grade (a no-pass grade or a letter grade less than B) has been given, the education committee must approve a remediation plan . Until the grade is remedied or the average is improved in some other way, the student is on probation . A student who remains on pro - bation for two semesters will be dismissed . Students who have entered a track must receive at least a B grade in any courses deemed required by their track director . Failure to remediate a grade of less than B in a required course, a no-pass grade in a pass/no-pass course, or the receipt of another such grade while on probation will result in dismissal . The education committee will also hear complaints concerning academic dishonesty, nonprofessional behavior and student misconduct . The council may become involved through a direct request from a student or faculty member or by a referral from the honor code committee . If the committee has not been involved, the council may refer the initial request to the honor code committee . They will hear testimony from any involved faculty and students and may recommend remediation or disciplinary measures . Recommendations for expulsion or suspension are made to the Office of the Dean of the Graduate College . Appeals will be heard by the Graduate College Council or a subcommittee of the Graduate College Council that will be organized solely for the purpose of hearing the appeal and making a recommendation to the dean . The ultimate decision regarding student expulsion or suspension rests in the Office of the Dean of the Graduate College . Graduate College/Rush University Academic Policies Academic policies specific to the Graduate College are located earlier in this catalog . In addition, the Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies . Integrated Biomedical Sciences: PhD Tuition Scholarship and Stipend All students who are admitted to the IBS PhD program at Rush University Medical Center will receive a tuition waver and stipend . The stipend is awarded annually and renewed if the student remains in good standing . To remain in good standing, the Graduate College requires that students maintain at least a B average . F ailure to do so will result in the student being on probation . If the student does not have a B aver age following one semester of probation, the student may lose the stipend . Students are expected to attend all classes and spend appropri- ate time in the lab . All outside employment is forbidden without prior Graduate College approval as it interferes with the time and effort necessary to complete the program . This excludes activities that would be in line with individual development plan goals, such as tutoring, teaching and proctoring . Integrated Biomedical Sciences: Master of Science (MS) Integrated Biomedical Sciences: MS Philosophy The MS in Integrated Biomedical Sciences (IBS) is a research master's degree that will introduce students to the scientific approach . Students who do well in the IBS MS progr am are encouraged to apply for the IBS PhD program . Gr aduates will be prepared to perform advanced biomedical research at colleges and universities, government agencies, hospitals and nonprofit agencies and in industry . In the past, Rush offered master's degrees in anatomy, biochemistry, immunology/microbiology and pharmacology; however, the IBS master's program includes additional basic science disciplines, such as neurological science and physiology, as well as the original four areas . Since col - laborative interdisciplinary teams of scientists perform trans-formative biomedical research, single-discipline-based science degrees will no longer be offered . Instead, our new integrated program emphasizes an interdisciplinary approach to biomedi- cal education and research . Students in the progr am will work with faculty to generate new knowledge in biomedicine using sophisticated research methods and statistics . Integrated Biomedical Sciences: Track/Research Opportunities The research tracks for the program are translational cancer research; cardiovascular and respiratory biology; immunity, inflammation and infection; functions and disorders of the musculoskeletal system; and functions and disorders of the nervous system . The tracks include qualified faculty from Rush University Medical Center who have an interest in research in these tracks . They come from academic departments as well as clinical departments, which enables students to select a variety of individuals with basic and clinical expertise to serve on their advisory committees and guide them through their projects .Integrated Biomedical Sciences: MS Admission Requirements Applicants must enter the program in the fall semester to begin the required course work in the core curriculum . The priority deadline for admission consideration is March 30, and the final date that applications will be accepted is May 1 . The program has the following requirements for admission: A baccalaureate degree from an accredited college . Course work in biology , cellular biology, molecular biology, physics, chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry and mathematics, including calculus, is highly recommended . Upper-level biochemistry or physiology courses are also highly recommended . Official academic tr anscripts from all baccalaureate and post- baccalaureate educational experiences are required . These should provide a minimal grade point average of 3 .0 overall (out of 4 .0) . Higher gr ades are expected in science courses . Applicants from foreign countries must have their transcripts evaluated by ECE, an independent agency . GRE or MCA T scores are required . All applicants whose native language is not English are required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) . A statement of the applicant' s interests, previous research experience, and goals needs to be included as an essay in the application . The personal statement must include a ranking of a student's interest in the five different research tracks . If the student's research track interest is not clear, then he or she should list \"undecided .\" T hree letters of recommendation, two of which must come from academic resources, are required . Letters will prefer - ably be from science faculty who can evaluate the character of the applicant, the applicant's academic and research performance, and the applicant's ability to think and work independently . The admissions committee will evaluate applications . All prior academic experience and the letters of recommendation will be evaluated for an indication of the applicant's potential for success in the program . With rare exceptions, MS applicants will interview online or by phone with faculty members before admission to the program . Acceptance is on a rolling basis and will be limited by the availability of faculty to act as mentors . We will begin accepting qualified applicants after the priority deadline until the cohort is complete .

The specific courses or hours of cognates and electives will vary each semester depending upon the student's choice of track and specific course selections . A low number of credit hours are considered to be a full-time commitment to research . Integrated Biomedical Sciences: MS Program Progression Year 1 Classes The goal of course work in the first year is to expose students to the biomedical sciences in a logical progression and to provide the students with tools for approaching their future research experience . The reading courses provide a critical understanding of the literature and existing base of knowledge . They will also show students how new knowledge in these areas can help us understand diseases and use this information to identify new therapeutics . This broad-based approach to disease is the core of the Integrated Biomedical Sciences Program . Year 1: Research Experience, Advisor and Research Track Selection During the first year, students will typically have two lab rota- tions in different laboratories . Labor atory rotations will expose students to diverse research environments and allow them to assess how they fit into a particular laboratory or mentor situation . Students are expected to learn techniques and attend all scheduled experiments, lab meetings, mentor/student discussions, etc . Based on these rotations , students will submit the name of a potential advisor and their track choice to the Integrated Biomedical Sciences education committee . The com - mittee, in consultation with the potential advisor, will approve advisor-student matches . Specific research projects will be deter - mined by the thesis advisor after advisor-student discussions . If a student cannot choose a thesis advisor based on the first two laboratory rotations, a third rotation may be taken in the spring or summer . The selection of a research advisor and project will determine the student's selection of a research track . Year 2: Classes, Research Experience, Thesis Committee, Thesis Proposal and Thesis Presentation Any classes will be dictated by the track cognates and elec- tives available that academic year . Course selection should complement research activity and the student's interests and should help prepare him or her for the career choice identified through the use of the Individual Development Plan website and additional resources provided by the Graduate College . When the student is not in class or studying, the student should be working on his or her research project . The student's assessment at this time relates to the following student outcomes: T he student is able to acquire research skills, collect and ana - lyze data, and interpret results to address an original research question . In addition, this step begins the continuing assessment of the following outcomes: A gr aduating student is capable of independent critical thinking and writing, as well as proposing, performing and effectively presenting his or her research . T he graduate is able to work collaboratively with other scientists, physicians and health care professionals to give and obtain feedback concerning the approach to research problems, data analysis and implications of research .The student creates an individual development plan (IDP) to bet-ter define his or her areas of interest, including teaching, admin- istration, and research in industrial or academic environments or further professional education . Upon gr aduation, the graduate will have used the IDP , mentorship and training opportunities to refine his or her career path . In consultation with an advisor, the student chooses a the- sis committee consisting of the advisor and two additional Graduate College faculty members . Committee members should be familiar with either the research area or crucial technical aspects of the student's project . Each student will write a suc - cinct research project proposal, which will be presented to the committee for approval . The proposal serves to keep the student focused on achieving project aims and allows the committee to track student progress based on the stated aims . Students should view the committee members as a resource for didactic and technical assistance . The student is expected to write a thesis and present his or her research to the Rush research community (thesis presentation) . The thesis committee will then meet with the student to address any questions or issues related to the data or format of the thesis document . The student may be asked to make revisions before final committee approval . Minimum Credit Hours Required for the Integrated Biomedical Sciences MS Degree The program is designed to be completed in five consecutive semesters and requires completion of at least 37 semester hours . These hours include 20 credit hours of core courses, seven credit hours of track-specific cognates, four credit hours of elec - tive courses, and six hours of thesis research credit . The core curriculum focuses on developing knowledge and skills in research theories and methodology, data analysis and statistics, laboratory applications and skills, and the molecular and cellular sciences basic to health and disease . In addition, students will work with faculty advisors to select one area from five available tracks: translational cancer research; cardiovas- cular and respiratory biology; immunity, inflam- mation; function and disorders of the musculoskeletal system; and function and disorders of the nervous system . Students will each have a research project, write a thesis and give a thesis presentation at project completion . The core curriculum, which is common to all students, builds knowledge and skills in research theories and methodology, data analysis and statistics, laboratory applications and skills, and the molecular and cellular sciences basic to health and disease . These courses will provide systematic exposure to the contemporary process of scientific discovery and will serve as the basis for the remainder of the curriculum . Students will be required, in conjunction with their advisors, to select seven credit hours of courses from concentration-focused cognates in their chosen tracks and a minimum of four elec- tive credits from the Graduate College courses offered . Finally , students will be required to accrue a minimum of six credit hours of thesis research . Master' s students will be encouraged to participate in track-specific advanced topic seminars in the second year . Integrated Biomedical Sciences: Academic Policies Academic Advisor/Principal Advisor The program's assistant director functions as the academic advisor to the students during the first year of matriculation in the program . After two rotations, the student will identify the track that he or she wishes to enter and will begin working in the laboratory of his or her research advisor . At this time, both the track director and research advisor will serve as mentors for the student . Research Advisor Selection During the first year, the student, in consultation with the assistant program director and track directors in areas related to the student's interests, will select two laboratories for research rotations . Based on these rotations , the student will identify the track that he or she is interested in and submit the name of a potential advisor to the IBS education committee . The committee will match students with advisors . Master's Thesis Research Committee After the student selects a research advisor and begins to collect preliminary data, the student and advisor will select a research committee in consultation with the track director . This commit - tee will advise the student and evaluate his or her proposal and thesis documents . The thesis committee will consist of the advisor and two additional Graduate College faculty members . Committee members should be familiar with either the research area or crucial technical aspects of the student's project . Committee members are intended to be a resource for the student and their advisor to enhance didactic and technical knowledge toward the completion of the student's project . The track director (or designated representative) will serve as an ex officio non-signing member of the thesis committee to oversee the procedural aspects of the committee meetings and student 300 301 progression through the program . The thesis committee will strive for consensus in all its actions; however, a majority vote of the committee's membership is sufficient for all activities except the final approval of the thesis, in which case only one member may disagree with the final decision . Research Proposal Each student will write a succinct research project proposal to be presented to the committee for approval . The proposal serves to keep the student focused on achieving project aims and allows the committee to track student progress based on the stated aims . Proposals should contain the following elements: A background section with relev ant literature citations in the specific research area T he specific aim or aims (appropriately limited in scope) T he experimental design and methods to be utilized Any preliminary data collected The target date for proposal presentations is within the first 45 days of the fall semester of year 2; it is also acceptable for the proposal presentation to be held in the summer term between years 1 and 2 . The thesis committee evaluates the feasibility and scope of the project and recommends alterations as needed to ensure adequate student progress through the program in a timely fashion . Student Grievance Procedure A student who is having difficulty with a course, anticipates being absent from class, or faces an emergency that will impact his or her attendance or performance should contact the course director . A student with a problem in laboratory rotations or research should attempt to resolve the issue through direct communication with the laboratory advisor or mentor . A good- faith attempt to plan or resolve any issues directly with the course director, laboratory advisor or mentor should always be the first course of action . If this fails , the student should bring the concern to the program director if the student is a first-year student or to the track director if the student has already identi- fied a track . The program director or track director will work with the student and faculty member(s) to resolve the issue . If it is a serious issue, the program director, track director or faculty member may involve the education committee . The student may also appeal directly to the education committee by requesting in writing that it meet to discuss the issue . The committee will meet within 10 days to render a judgment to best address the interests of the student within the guidelines of the Integrated Biomedical Sciences Program .The education committee will also hear complaints concerning academic dishonesty, nonprofessional behavior and student misconduct . The council may become involved through a direct request from a student or faculty member or by a referral from the honor code committee . If the honor code committee has not been involved, the council may refer the initial request to the committee . The council will hear testimony from any involved faculty and students . The council may recommend remediation or disciplinary measures . Recommendations for expulsion or suspension are made to the Office of the Dean of the Graduate College . Appeals will be heard by the Graduate College Council or a subcommittee of the Graduate College Council that will be organized solely for the purpose of hearing the appeal and making a recommendation to the dean . The ultimate decision regarding student expulsion or suspension rests in the Office of the Dean of the Graduate College . Graduate College/Rush University Academic Policies Students must maintain a B average in the first year . If they drop below a B average, they should discuss the possibility of remediation with the director of the course causing difficulty . The course director may issue an incomplete grade for a limited time in accordance with University policy while agreed-upon remediation takes place . However , once a failing grade (a no- pass grade or a letter grade less than B) has been given, the education committee must approve a remediation plan . Until a grade is remedied or the average is improved in some other way, the student is on probation . A student who remains on proba - tion for two semesters will be dismissed . Students who have entered a track must receive at least a B grade in any courses deemed required by their track director . Failure to remediate a grade of less than B in a required course or a no-pass grade in a pass/no-pass course or the receipt of another such grade while on probation will result in dismissal .Rush University Course Descriptions 302 303 Rush University Course Descriptions Anatomy and Cell Biology ANA-7EI Basic Sciences Individualized Elective Students may receive credit for an individually arranged elective with a Rush faculty member .
