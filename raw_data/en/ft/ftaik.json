He earned his medical degree from Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, completed an internship and residency at Ochsner and went on to perform a fellowship in cardiovascular training at the Mayo Clinic Foundation Graduate School of Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota. Dr. Lavie is a fellow of the American College of Cardiology and has been on staff at Ochsner since 1989. His expertise includes non-invasive imaging, echocardiography, nuclear cardiology, preventive cardiology, cardiac rehabilitation and exercise physiology. Dr. Lavie is an active researcher and has written more than 1,000 medical articles and book chapters for scientific medical publications and cardiology textbooks. He is the author of the book The Obesity Paradox and serves as a scientific reviewer or editorial board member for over 40 prestigious scientific journals. He is the associate editor for The Ochsner Journal's population medicine section and the editor in chief of Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases, as well as associate editor and cardiovascular section editor, for the prestigious Mayo Clinic Proceedings . In his clinical practice, Dr. Lavie creates individualized care plans based on his patients' conditions, and believes that the best treatment involves a coordinated effort between the physician's practice of evidence-based medicine and the patient's active involvement in their own care.
