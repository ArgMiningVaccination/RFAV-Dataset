She is down to earth and well attuned to diagnosing and treating the whole person.

I look forward to continuing with her in the future for any health/well being issues.\" Lisa R. - \"My husband and I began care with Dr. Kapoor a few months ago. We wanted to go with a more naturopathic health care approach. Dr. Kapoor has met that need, and she has exceeded our expectations. She is an incredibly kind, intuitive, educated, well-read doctor. I have never had such in-depth conversation with a doctor, followed by in-depth testing, to give her the most detailed picture of my health. I love her whole-health approach. We plan to have our adult children begin care with her as well. I highly, highly recommend Dr. Kapoor!\" Jamie Anderson - \"It is rare to find a doctor as smart, loving and thorough as Dr.Kapoor. She listened to me carefully, and spent a lot of time with me. Even her office space is welcoming and beautiful. Highly recommend her.\" S.
