The 127-bed facility located in Wheaton, Illinois, provides advanced rehabilitation and care to members of the immediate community, and also serves as a regional destination hospital for individuals in need of state-of-the-art rehabilitative care . MRH has 100 acute inpatient rehabilitation beds and 27 Medicare-licensed, sub-acute beds for adult and pediatric patients recovering from illness or injury who require intensive therapy to regain their function and independence . The main hospital is a 170,000-square-foot facility with a number of unique inpatient and outpatient offerings, including specialty programs focused on the treatment of stroke, spinal cord injury, brain injury and orthopedic/musculoskeletal conditions, as well as conditions affecting pediatric patients . MRH's comprehensive approach to rehabilitation addresses a patient's body, mind and spirit through personalized treatment programs in inpatient, comprehensive outpatient, sub-acute and physician clinics that specialize in rehabilitation medicine . MRH also provides inpatient and outpatient pediatric rehabilitation programs and is the only pain management program in Illinois accredited by CARF . The hospital includes a full-size Chartres labyrinth, therapeutic enabling gardens, a meditation room, a two-story chapel and many other unique features designed to establish it as a healing sanctuary . Additionally, the Marianjoy Assistive Rehabilitation Technology Institute (MARTI) at MRH offers solutions to everyday problems of daily living encountered by individuals with disabilities . MARTI consists of seven distinct centers that apply advancements in technology to benefit individuals with disabilities through maximizing functional independence and expanding educational vocational, recreational and communicative opportunities . MARTI offers a specially designed fitness center and a specialized aquatic therapy center to support the needs of individuals striving to meet their therapy goals . MRH has completed a comprehensive Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) to identify the highest-priority health needs of residents in our community and will use this information to guide new and enhance existing efforts to improve the health of our community . As described in detail in this report, the goal of the CHNA was to implement a structured, data-driven approach to determine the health status, behaviors and needs of all residents in the MRH service area . Through this assessment, we identified health needs that are prevalent among residents across all socioeconomic groups, races and ethnicities, as well as issues that highlight health disparities or disproportionately impact the medically underserved and uninsured . 4 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportAcknowledgments To ensure organizations that impact health in central DuPage County and represent the broad interests of the community were meaningfully engaged in reviewing and interpreting the findings of the CHNA, an External Steering Committee (ESC) was established . The purpose of the ESC was to develop priorities among the identified areas of opportunity and assist in the formation of a collaborative plan to address the top Priority Health Needs . ESC members include representatives from the following organizations: DuPage County Health Department DuPage Federation on Human Services Reform DuPage Health Coalition (Access DuPage) Elmhurst CUSD 205 Illinois Health and Hospital Association Naperville School District 203 People's Resource CenterAbilityLinks SPR Consulting Edward Hines VA Hospital Donka, Inc . DuPage Workforce Board Kensington International5 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportBackground A comprehensive CHNA was commissioned on behalf of Northwestern Medicine by Professional Research Consultants, Inc . (PRC) . PRC is a nationally recognized healthcare consulting firm with extensive experience in conducting CHNAs in hundreds of communities across the United States since 1994 . The CHNA framework consisted of a systematic, data-driven approach to determine the health status, behaviors and needs of residents in the service area of MRH . The CHNA provided information to enable hospital leadership and key community stakeholders to identify health issues of greatest concern among all residents and decide how best to commit the hospital's resources to those areas, thereby achieving the greatest possible impact on the community's health status . Methodology As previously noted, the CHNA incorporates data from both quantitative and qualitative sources . Quantitative data input includes primary research (the PRC Community Health Survey) and secondary research (vital statistics and other existing health-related data) . These quantitative components allow for trending and comparison to benchmark data at the state and national levels . Once the data has been reviewed by MRH community health experts, executive leadership and key community stakeholders identify priority areas of need in which MRH is uniquely positioned to address and respond . The entire CHNA process includes: A comprehensive identification and prioritization of needs The identification of priority needs that MRH is most uniquely suited to address The development of a comprehensive Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) designed to guide MRH in addressing and responding to the identified priority needs via a process-driven methodology including goal development, strategies and measurable outcomes A plan to partner with other key community stakeholders to support the remaining needsThe Community Health Needs Assessment6 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment Report1 2 3CHNA Goals The MRH CHNA will serve as a tool toward reaching three related goals: Improve residents' health status, increase their life spans and elevate their overall quality of life. A healthy community is one where its residents suffer little from physical and mental illness and enjoy a high quality of life . Reduce the health disparities among residents. By gathering demographic information along with health status and behavior data, it will be possible to identify population segments that are most at-risk for various diseases and injuries . Intervention plans aimed at targeting these segments may then be developed to combat some of the socioeconomic factors that have historically had a negative impact on residents' health . Increase accessibility to preventive services for all community residents. More accessible preventive services will prove beneficial in accomplishing the first goal (improving health status, increasing life spans and elevating the quality of life), as well as lowering the costs associated with caring for late-stage diseases resulting from a lack of preventive care . Quantitative data analysis: The community health survey Quantitative data input included primary research (the PRC Community Health Survey) and secondary research (vital statistics and other existing health-related data) . These quantitative components allowed for comparison to benchmark data at the state and national levels . Survey instrument The survey instrument used for the PRC Community Health Survey was based largely on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, as well as various other public health surveys and customized questions addressing gaps in indicator data relative to health promotion and disease prevention objectives, and other recognized health issues . The final survey instrument was developed by Northwestern Medicine and PRC . Community defined for this assessment The study area for the survey effort was defined as the MRH service area and analyzed at the ZIP code level, and included the following ZIP codes: 60190 Winfield Bartlett 60185 West Chicago7 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportSample approach and design To accurately represent the population studied and minimize bias, proven telephone methodology and random-selection techniques were applied . While this random sampling of the population produces a highly representative sample, it is a common and preferred practice to \"weight\" the raw data to further improve the representation . This was accomplished by adjusting the results of a random sample to match the geographic distribution and demographic characteristics of the population surveyed (post-stratification) to eliminate any naturally occurring bias . Specifically, once the raw data were gathered, respondents were examined by key demographic characteristics (namely gender, age, race, ethnicity and poverty status) and a statistical application package applied, weighting variables that produced a sample that more closely matched the population for these characteristics . While the integrity of each individual's responses was maintained, one person's responses may have contributed to the whole the same weight as, for example, 1 . 1 respondents . Another respondent, whose demographic characteristics may have been slightly over- sampled, may have contributed the same weight as 0 .9 respondents . The poverty descriptions used in this report are based on administrative poverty thresholds determined by the U .S . Department of Health and Human Services . These guidelines define poverty status by household income level and number of persons in the household . (For example, the 2017 guidelines place the poverty threshold for a family of four at $24,400 annual household income or lower .) In this report, \"low income\" refers to community members living in a household with defined poverty status or living just above the poverty level and earning up to twice (< 200 percent) of the poverty threshold . \"Mid/high income\" refers to those households living on incomes that are at least twice (> 200 percent) the federal poverty level . The sample design and quality control procedures used in the data collection ensure that the sample is representative . Thus, the findings may be generalized to the total population of community members in the defined area with a high degree of confidence . Quantitative data analysis: Public health, vital statistics and other data A variety of existing (secondary) data sources was consulted to complement the research quality of the CHNA . Data for the MRH service area was obtained from the following sources with specific citations included throughout the PRC report: Cen ter for Applied Research and Environmental Systems (CARES) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Community Commons ESRI ArcGIS Map Gallery Illinois Department of Public Health National Cancer Institute, State Cancer ProfilesOpenStreetMap (OSM) U .S . Census Bureau U .S . Department of Agriculture U .S . Department of Health and Human Services U .S . Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation U .S . Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics It must be noted that secondary data indicators reflect county-level data . 8 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportBenchmark data Trending data was utilized throughout the report when available . State and national risk factor data was utilized as an additional benchmark against which to compare local survey findings . Source data included Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and Trend Data published by the CDC . State and national level vital statistics were also provided for comparison of secondary data indicators . Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) \u2014 a nationally recognized and evidence-based program \u2014 was also utilized as a significant source of benchmark data . Qualitative data analysis: Community stakeholder input Qualitative data input includes primary research gathered through an online key informant survey of various community stakeholders . Online key informant survey To solicit input from key informants \u2014 individuals who have a broad interest in the health of the community \u2014 an online key informant survey was included in the assessment process . A list of recommended participants was provided by MRH, which included names and contact information of physicians, public health representatives, other health professionals, social service providers and a variety of other community leaders . Potential participants were chosen because of their ability to identify primary concerns of the populations with whom they work as well as the overall community . Key informants were contacted by email, introducing the purpose of the survey and providing a link to take the online survey . Reminder emails were sent as needed to increase participation . In all, 41 community stakeholders took part in the online key informant survey, including representatives of the following organizations: DuPage Foundation DuPage Senior Citizens Council DuPage United Educare West DuPage Fox Valley Special Recreation Association NAMI DuPage Northern Illinois Food BankPeople's Resource Center SamaraCare Senior Services Associates, Inc . Warrenville Park District Western DuPage Special Recreation Association West Chicago Public Library District Winfield Park District Through this process, input was gathered from several individuals whose organizations work with low-income, minority populations and other medically underserved populations . Key informants were asked to rate the degree to which various health issues are a problem in their own community . Follow-up questions were asked for a description of how these issues may be better addressed . 9 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportMinority populations represented To Minority/medically underserved populations that were represented within the key informant survey included included: African American Arabic Asian Disabled ElderlyHispanicHomeless Immigrant/refugee Laotian Low income Medicaid/Medicare recipientMentally ill Non-English-speaking Teen parent Undocumented Unemployed Determination of significance Differences noted in this report represent those determined to be significant . Statistical significance is determined based on confidence intervals (at the 95 percent confidence level) using question-specific samples and response rates . For purposes of this assessment, \"significance\" of secondary data indicators is determined by a 5 percent variation from the comparative measure . Information gaps While this MRH CHNA is quite comprehensive, it cannot measure all possible aspects of health in the community, nor can it adequately represent all possible populations of interest . It must be recognized that these information gaps might in some ways limit the ability to assess all of the community's health needs . For example, certain population groups \u2014 such as those who are homeless, institutionalized or only speak a language other than English or Spanish \u2014 may not be fully represented in the survey data . Other population groups \u2014 for example, pregnant women, lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender residents, undocumented residents, and members of certain racial/ ethnic or immigrant groups \u2014 might not be identifiable or might not be fully represented in numbers sufficient for independent analysis . In terms of content, this assessment was designed to provide a comprehensive and broad picture of the health of the overall community . However, it is recognized that there are a number of medical conditions that were not specifically addressed . Supplemental disability surveys To specifically assess the needs of individuals with disabilities in the MRH service area, input was also solicited from the following groups through an online survey form: People who received healthcare services from the MRH network within the past two years and provided a valid e-mail address People who registered with AbilityLinks, a national, web-based community where qualified job seekers with disabilities gain access to valuable networking opportunities Organizations that provide services and resources to people with disabilities who are affiliated with MRH and who seek assistance following return to the community10 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportPublic dissemination This CHNA is available to the public and can be accessed through the following channels: View, download and/or print the document without special computer hardware or software (other than software that is available to members of the public at no cost) without fee at nm .org/about-us/community-initiatives/com - munity-health-needs-assessment View a hard copy of the CHNA at MRH without fee upon request . Key Findings and Opportunities: Quantitative Data Community description DuPage County encompasses 327 .41 square miles and is home to a total population of 930,412 residents, according to latest census estimates . The county's population density is reported at 2,840 .83 per square mile . DuPage County is predominately urban, with nearly all the population living in areas designated as urban . Demographics It is important to understand the age distribution of the population, as different age groups have unique health needs that must be considered in planning to meet the needs of county residents . In DuPage County, 23 .8 percent of the population are infants, children or adolescents age 0 to 17 years (up 0 .4 percent from the 2015 CHNA) . Another 63 .3 percent are age 18 to 64 (up 1 . 1 percent), while only 12 .9 percent are 65 and older (up 0 .6 percent) . Race and ethnicity In looking at race independent of ethnicity, 79 .4 percent of residents in DuPage County are White and 4 .7 percent are Black . When considering ethnicity, 13 .9 percent of DuPage County residents are Hispanic or Latino . The county has a higher proportion of White residents and a lower proportion of Black residents than the state and U .S . The percentage of Hispanic and Latino residents is also lower than found in the state and U .S . Social determinants of health Health starts in our homes, schools, workplaces, neighborhoods and communities . We know that taking care of ourselves (including eating well, staying active, not smoking, and regularly seeing a doctor) influences our health . Our health is also determined in part by access to social and economic opportunities, resources that are available in the community, quality education, workplace safety, environmental factors and our personal relationships . The conditions in which we live explain, in part, why some Americans are healthier than others . Poverty The U .S . Census Bureau American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates (2011 to 2015) show 7 .4 percent of the DuPage County population living below 100 percent of the Federal Poverty Level . This represents an increase of 0 .5 percent over 2009 to 2013 census data . A total estimated 19 .1 percent of residents (175,652 individuals) live below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level . This represents a notable 10 .5 percent increase (6,807 individuals) from our previous assessment .11 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportEducation and employment Among the Kane County population age 25 and older, an estimated 16 .9 percent (56,865 people) do not have a high school education, which was a less favorable number than state (11 . 7 percent) and national (13 .0 percent) findings . According to data derived from the Illinois Department of Employment Security, the unemployment rate in Kane County was 3 .8 percent in April 2018, trending more favorably than both the state and national unemployment rates . . Morbidity and mortality A total of 64 .3 percent of MRH survey respondents rated their overall health as \"excellent\" or \"very good,\" with 9 .5 percent describing their overall health status as \"fair\" or \"poor .\" The remaining 26 .1 percent rated their health as \"good .\" Activity limitations An individual can develop a disabling impairment or chronic condition at any point in life . According to HP2020, people with disabilities are more likely to: Experience difficulties or delays in getting the health care needed Not have had an annual dental exam Not have had a mammogram in the past two years Not have had a Pap test within the past three years Not engage in fitness activities Use tobacco Be overweight or obese Have high blood pressure Experience symptoms of psychological distress Receive less social-emotional support Have lower employment rates Further, there are many social and physical factors that influence the health of people with disabilities . The following three areas for public health action have been identified, using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and the three World Health Organization (WHO) principles of action for addressing health determinants . Improve the conditions of daily life by encouraging communities to be accessible so all can live in, move through, and interact with their environment; encouraging community living; and removing barriers in the environment using both physical universal design concepts and operational policy shifts . Address the inequitable distribution of resources among people with disabilities and those without disabilities by increasing appropriate health care for people with disabilities; education and work opportunities; social participation; and access to needed technologies and assistive supports .12 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment Report Expand the knowledge base and raise awareness about determinants of health for people with disabilities by increasing the inclusion of people with disabilities in public health data collection efforts across the lifespan; the inclusion of people with disabilities in health promotion activities; and the expansion of disability and health training opportunities for public health and healthcare professionals . A total of 12 .0 percent of survey respondents identified a limitation in activities in some way due to a physical, mental or emotional problem . Limitations were higher in women (13 .6 percent) than men (10 .3 percent) and highest among the 65+ year range (14 .7 percent) . Additionally, the prevalence was higher in low-income individuals (27 .6 percent) and Hispanics (21 .5 percent) . Individual activity limitation indicators included: Difficulty walking or climbing stairs Difficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions Difficulty doing errands alone Difficulty dressing or bathing Mental health status A total of 68 .6 percent of respondents reported their mental health as \"excellent\" or \"very good\" with 19 .7 percent reporting \"good\" and 11 . 7 percent reporting \"fair\" or \"poor .\" Those reporting \"fair\" or \"poor\" mental health were most likely to be: Women (16 .5 percent) Individuals ages 19 to 39 years (15 .2 percent) Low-income individuals (31 . 5 percent) African Americans (16 .2 percent) A total of 19 .1 percent of adults self-reported being diagnosed with a depressive disorder . This was higher than state trends, but lower than U .S . rates . This represents an increase from 15 .9 percent in 2015 . Additionally, 22 .8 percent of respondents reported symptoms of chronic depression lasting two or more years . This was lower than U .S . data and trending similar to 2009 to 2015 rates (22 .0 to 25 .2 percent) . The rate was highest in: Women (27 .4 percent) Individuals ages 18 to 39 years (24 percent) Low-income individuals (36 .3 percent) Asians (25 .5 percent)13 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportBetween 2013 and 2015, the annual average age-adjusted suicide mortality rate was 8 .9 deaths per 100,000 population in DuPage County \u2014 higher than trending rates, but lower than state and national rates . A total of 27 .3 percent of survey respondents reported having ever sought treatment from a professional for a mental or emotional problem, compared to 30 .8 percent nationally . Additionally, 11 . 7 percent acknowledged currently taking medication/receiving mental health treatment as compared to 13 .9 percent nationally . A total of 5 .5 percent of survey respondents acknowledged being unable to get mental health services when needed in the past year, compared to the U .S . rate of 6 .8 percent . Rates were highest in: Women (6 .8 percent) Individuals ages 18 to 39 (11 . 4 percent) Low-income individuals (8 .0 percent) Hispanics (21 . 8 percent) Mental health was rated as a major problem by 64 .7 percent of key informants, citing challenges such as: Access to care/services Denial/stigma Affordability Inadequate funding Morbidity and mortality Together, cardiovascular disease (heart disease and stroke) and cancers accounted for more than one-half of all deaths in DuPage County . The top five 2013 to 2015 age-adjusted death rates per 100,000 population for selected causes included: Cancers (143 .0) Diseases of the heart (131 . 8) Stroke (30 .8) Chronic lower respiratory diseases (29 .9) Unintentional injuries (23 .6) All rates were lower than state and national rates .14 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportCardiovascular disease Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U .S ., with stroke following as the third-leading cause . Together, heart disease and stroke are among the most widespread and costly health problems facing our nation today, accounting for more than $500 billion in healthcare expenditures . HP2020 stresses that the risk of Americans developing and dying from cardiovascular disease would be substantially reduced if changes were made in diet, physical activity and management of high blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking . Fortunately, these deaths are mostly preventable, especially if intervention is provided across the lifespan of the disease, from early education, prevention and screening to early diagnosis, prompt treatment and comprehensive aftercare . In planning responses to the priority needs of their communities, hospitals can positively impact the health burdens of all chronic diseases by addressing the disease across the continuum of its lifespan . Together, cardiovascular disease (heart disease and stroke) accounted for 27 .9 percent of all deaths in DuPage County . A total of 6 .2 percent of survey respondents acknowledged having been told by their healthcare A total of 33 .4 percent of adults reported being told at some point that their blood pressure was high, exceeding the HP2020 target of 26 .9 percent or lower . This finding represented an increase from 32 .7 percent in the 2015 MRH CHNA . Among adults with multiple high blood pressure readings, 83 .0 percent reported taking action to control their levels . A total of 36 .5 percent of adults reported a diagnosis of high cholesterol . This represents a notable increase from 34 .3 percent in our 2015 assessment and an HP2020 target of 13 .5 percent or lower . Among adults with self-reported high blood cholesterol readings, 81 .3 percent reported taking action to control their levels . Regarding total risk of cardiovascular disease, 83 .6 percent of respondents reported one or more risk factors, including being overweight, smoking cigarettes, being physically inactive, or having high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels . Risk and/or behaviors were highest in: Men (88 .4 percent) Individuals 65 years and over (90 .9 percent)Low-income individuals (93 .8 percent) Hispanics (98 percent) . Heart disease and stroke were rated as a major (31 .3 percent) and moderate (34 .4 percent) problem by key informants citing concerns such as: Gen eral wellness, physical activity and nutrition being ignored StressFast-paced lives Diet Genetics15 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportCancer Continued advances in cancer research, detection and treatment have resulted in a decline in both incidence and death rates for all cancers . Yet cancer remains a leading cause of death within the MRH service area . Once again, intervention across the lifespan of the disease poses an opportunity for hospitals to focus on prevention through education, and early diagnosis and treatment through access to routine screenings . Between 2011 and 2013, the annual average age-adjusted cancer mortality rate was 149 .3 deaths per 100,000 residents in DuPage County; the rate was notably higher among non-Hispanic Blacks and Whites . The rate decreased slightly in 2015 to 143 .0 per 100,000 residents . Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in DuPage County, followed by female breast cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal cancer . The incidence of female breast cancer ranked higher in DuPage County than in Illinois or in the U .S . When queried regarding screenings: Among women age 50 to 74 years, 76 .7 percent reported having had a mammogram in the past two years . This represented a decrease from 84 .6 percent in 2015 . Among women age 21 to 65 years, 81 . 4 percent reported having had a Pap smear within the past three years . This represented a downward decrease from 87 .3 percent in 2015 and 90 .4 percent in 2012 . Among adults age 50 to 75 years, 774 .8 percent reported having a colorectal cancer screening . This represented an increase from 67 .9 percent in 2015 . A total of 70 .6 percent of key informants rated cancer as either a major or moderate problem in DuPage County, citing concerns such as: Cancer is growing in epidemic proportions The number of women diagnosed with breast cancer exceeding state and national rates Economic impact . Pulmonary disease Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pose significant public health burdens . The age-adjusted mortality rate per 100,000 population is lower in DuPage County than in Illinois and in the U .S . Currently, 5 .6 percent of adult survey respondents suffer from COPD, down from 8 .4 percent in 2015 . Additionally, 6 .9 percent of adults surveyed report a diagnosis of adult asthma, trending slightly lower than the 2015 rate of 7 .1 . Among parents surveyed, 9 .5 percent of children within the MRH service area were reported to have asthma . This represents an increase from 8 .1 percent in 2015 .16 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportA total of 38 .7 percent of key informants rated respiratory disease as either a moderate or major problem in DuPage County, citing concerns such as: Extensive smoking in refugee camps . Overall high rate of tobacco use . Diabetes Diabetes is another disease that continues to increase in both incidence and prevalence in the U .S . Increasing numbers coupled with earlier onset of the disease pose a growing concern about the potential to overwhelm the existing healthcare system . Between 2011 and 2013, the annual average age-adjusted diabetes mortality rate was 11 .3 deaths per 100,000 residents in DuPage County, well below regional, state and national rates; age-adjusted mortality by race was highest among the Hispanic population . In 2015 the rate dropped to 10 .9 . In 22018, 9 .2 percent of survey respondents reported having been diagnosed with diabetes, and an additional 7 .5 percent reported having \"pre-diabetes .\" The prevalence of diabetes has increased modestly from 8 .5 percent in our 2015 survey . The prevalence of diabetes was higher in men, adults 65 years and over, low-income individuals and Asian non-Hispanics . Among individuals not having been diagnosed with diabetes, only 51 . 1 percent reported having had their blood sugar level tested within the past three years . This is a decrease from 55 .4 percent in 2015 . Diabetes was identified as a major problem in DuPage County by 55 .9 percent of key informants, citing concerns such as . Lack of education and poor diet among immigrant population \u2014 unaware of long-term consequences of unmanaged diabetes Insufficient preventive education Insufficient support and education after diagnosis (tertiary intervention) Sugar intake out of control Inability to eat healthy Increase in children diagnosed with diabetes Insufficient nutrition, physical activity and weight management Affordable care17 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportInjury and violence Injuries and violence are widespread in society . HP2020 notes that both unintentional injuries and those caused by acts of violence are among the top 15 killers for Americans of all ages . Poisoning (including accidental drug overdose), falls, motor vehicle accidents and suffocation accounted for the majority of accidental deaths in the hospital's service area in 2015 . While considered \"accidental,\" most events are predictable and preventable . Beyond their immediate health consequences, injuries and violence have a significant impact on the well-being of the community by contributing to: Premature death Disability Poor mental health High medical costs Lost productivity The leading causes of accidental death in DuPage County between 2013 and 2015 were: Poisoning/noxious substances (37 .8 percent) Falls (27 .4 percent) Motor vehicle accidents (16 .6 percent) Suffocation (5 .3 percent) Between 2013 and 2015, the average annual age-adjusted motor vehicle crash mortality rate was 4 .0 per 100,000 residents in DuPage County \u2014 notably below state and national rates and significantly below the HP2020 target of 12 .4 or lower . Additional survey data noted: Among survey respondents, 90 .4 percent reported \"always\" wearing a seat belt when driving or riding in a vehicle, and 92 .5 percent of parents reported their child \"always\" wearing a seat belt . Among MRH service area children, 43 .2 percent were reported to \"always\" wear a helmet when riding a bicycle . This is modestly lower than 2015 reports of 45 .1 percent . The annual average age-adjusted homicide rate was 0 .9 deaths per 100,000 residents in DuPage County, notably below state and national rates . Violent crimes were reported at a rate of 86 .5 crimes per 100,000 residents, well below regional, state and national rates . Among DuPage County residents, 1 . 1 percent of survey respondents acknowledged having been a victim of a violent crime within the past five years . Additionally, 8 .8 percent of survey respondents reported having been hit, slapped or hurt in any way by an intimate partner . While this was lower than the U .S . rate of 14 .2 percent, it was an increase from the 2015 assessment of 7 .4 percent .18 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportInjury and violence were rated as major (6 .3 percent) and moderate (31 .3 percent) problems in the community, with one key informant noting that many of their clients are victims of violence . Infectious disease Acute respiratory infections, including pneumonia and influenza, are the eighth-leading cause of death in the U .S ., accounting for 56,000 deaths annually according to HP2020 . Among survey respondents, 75 percent received a flu shot within the past year \u2014 significantly up from 47 .2 percent in 2015 . However, among high-risk adults, only 47 .3 percent received a flu shot within the past year . Among adults age 65 and older, 80 .8 percent have received a pneumonia vaccination at some point in their lives . This trend is higher than 2015 rates of 75 .5 percent, but lower than the U .S . rate of 82 .7 percent . Additionally, only 40 .5 percent of high-risk adults received a pneumonia vaccination . Among key informants, 25 .0 percent perceived immunizations and infectious disease as a moderate problem . Modifiable Health Risks Factors contributing to premature death The most prominent contributing factors to premature mortality in the United States in 2000 were lifestyle and behaviors, including tobacco use (an estimated 435,000 deaths), diet and activity patterns (400,000 deaths), alcohol use (85,000 deaths), infectious disease (75,000 deaths), exposure to toxic agents (55,000 deaths), use of motor vehicle (43,000 deaths), use of firearms (29,000 deaths), and illicit use of drugs (17,000 deaths) . Researchers believe that poor diet and physical inactivity may soon overtake tobacco as the leading cause of death . These findings, coupled with escalating healthcare costs and an aging population, argue persuasively that there exists an urgent need to establish a more preventive orientation in today's U .S . healthcare model . At MRH, we believe that this is a shared responsibility among public health systems and the hospitals and medical centers that provide care to populations within their respective service areas . Utilizing a collaborative, evidence-based approach to prevention, screening and chronic disease management will allow for an optimum impact on the reduction/elimination of many of the prominent contributors to mortality in U .S . healthcare systems . Diet and nutrition Strong science exists supporting the benefits of consuming a healthy diet and maintaining a healthy body weight . The goal of promoting healthy diets and healthy weight encompasses increasing household food security and eliminating hunger . The demonstration of a healthy diet includes: Consuming a variety of nutrient-dense foods across the food groups Limiting the intake of saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, added sugars, sodium and alcohol Limiting caloric intake to meet caloric need .19 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportSocial and physical factors thought to influence diet include: Knowledge and attitudes Skills Social support Societal and cultural norms Food and agricultural policiesFood assistance programs Economic price systems Retail venues, local restaurants Marketing Access to healthy, nutrition-dense foods A total of 29 .2 percent of survey respondents reported eating five or more servings of fruits and/or vegetables per day; however, only 20 .3 percent of low-income respondents were likely to consume the recommended servings . While 14 .8 percent of respondents reported little or no difficulty accessing fresh produce, 31 . 7 percent of low-income respondents and 25 .6 percent of Hispanic respondents reported that it was \"somewhat\" or \"very\" difficult to access affordable fresh fruits and vegetables . U .S . Department of Agriculture data reported that 22 .6 percent of DuPage County residents have low food access or live in a \"food desert,\" meaning that they do not live near a supermarket or large grocery store . These findings were more favorable than state or national findings . Physical activity In another recent study of DuPage residents conducted by PRC, a total of 25 .9 percent of respondents reported no leisure-time physical activity in the past month . Additionally, a total of 24 .1 percent of respondents acknowledged participating in regular, sustained moderate or vigorous physical activity . Access to safe and affordable places for exercise was not a problem for the majority of respondents without physical limitations . Between 2008 and 2012, there were 14 .5 recreation/fitness facilities for every 100,000 population in DuPage County . This is in addition to more than 25,000 acres of open area in the DuPage County Forest Preserve District . Among service area children age 2 to 17 years, 24 .6 percent were reported to have had 60 minutes of physical activity on each of the seven days preceding the interview . These results were lower than national findings (50 .5 percent) . It was interesting to note that girls were less likely to engage in physical activities than boys (18 .6 percent vs . 29 .4 percent respectively), and activity time decreased with age . Overweight/obesity Based on self-reported heights and weights, 65 .9 percent were overweight (BMI of 25 or higher), and 31 . 7 percent were obese (BMI of 30 or higher) . Current reports demonstrate an increase from 63 .9 percent overweight and 25 .9 percent obese in 2015 data . Of the 31 . 7 percent of individuals reporting obesity, 49 .5 percent were low income and 52 .2 percent were Hispanic .20 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportBased on heights and weights reported by surveyed parents, 27 .3 percent of children ages five to 17 years were overweight (BMI > 85th percentile) and 12 .3 percent were obese (BMI > 95th percentile) . Nutrition, physical activity and weight were perceived as major problems by 45 .9 percent of key informants who cited reasons including education, access to affordable healthy foods, school lunch menus and inadequate opportunity for physical activity . Substance abuse Substance abuse has a major negative impact on individuals, families and communities, and its effects directly impact teenage pregnancy rates, domestic violence, child abuse, motor vehicle accidents, fights, crime, homicide and suicide . HP2020 defines substance abuse as a set of related conditions associated with the consumption of alcohol and illicit drugs . Age-adjusted deaths from cirrhosis/liver disease and age-adjusted drug-induced deaths remained lower than regional, state and national rates . A total of 26 .8 percent of service area respondents acknowledged excessive drinking, and 6 .5 percent acknowledged having driven in the past month after having too much to drink . Additionally, 4 .2 percent of adult respondents acknowledged using an illicit drug in the past month . A total of 56 .8 percent of key informants characterized substance abuse as a \"major\" problem in the community, citing barriers to treatment such as self-imposed barriers, cost/insurance, access to care, and lack of funding to support treatment programs . Key informants who rated substance abuse as a \"major\" problem most often identified alcohol, heroin/other opioids and marijuana as the most problematic substances in the community . Tobacco use Tobacco use is the single-most preventable cause of death and disease in the U .S . according to HP2020 . Tobacco use causes cancer, heart disease, lung disease and premature birth . A total of 9 .5 percent of survey respondents currently smoke cigarettes . Among households, 8 .5 percent have someone who smokes cigarettes in the home, and 5 .9 percent of these households have children who are exposed to smoke . Additionally, a total of 2 .4 percent of service area adults use some type of smokeless tobacco . A total of 36 .4 percent of survey respondents identified tobacco use as a moderate problem, while an additional 12 .1 percent identified it as a major problem, citing concerns such as the number of new teen smokers, and proliferation of e-cigarettes and vapor smoking . Access to healthcare services A person's ability to access health services has a profound effect on every aspect of their health, yet, according to HP2020, almost one in four Americans do not have a primary care provider (PCP) or health center where they can receive regular medical services . Approximately one in five Americans (children and adults under age 65) do not have medical insurance . People without medical insurance are more likely to lack a usual source of medical care, such as a PCP, and are 21 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment Reportmore likely to skip routine medical care due to costs, increasing their risk for serious and disabling health conditions . When they do access health services, they are often burdened with large medical bills and out-of-pocket expenses . Increasing access to both routine medical care and medical insurance are vital steps in improving the health of all Americans . Access to health services affects a person's health and well-being . Regular and reliable access to health services can: Prevent disease and disability Det ect and treat illnesses or other health conditions Increase quality of lifeRed uce the likelihood of premature (early) death Increase life expectancy2 A total of 5 .4 percent of survey respondents age 18 to 64 reported having no healthcare coverage as compared to 10 .7 percent statewide and 13 .7 percent nationwide . Major payor sources for MRH patients included Medicare and HMO/PPO . Barriers to healthcare access A total of 35 .6 percent of survey respondents reported some type of difficulty or delay in obtaining services in the past year . Women, individuals ages 40 to 64, low-income, Hispanic and Asian individuals reported the most difficulties accessing healthcare services . Notable barriers to healthcare access included: Inconvenient office hours Difficulty obtaining a provider appointment Cost of a doctor visitCost of prescriptions Difficulty finding a doctor Lack of transportation A total of 18 .4 percent of key informants perceived access to healthcare services as a major problem in the community, citing reasons such as access to care for the undocumented, system issues such as Medicare/ Medicaid managed care plans and high deductibles, social determinants such as housing, education/literacy levels and language/cultural barriers . Key informants also identified mental health care, specialty care and substance abuse treatment as the most difficult to access in the community . Primary care services Individuals with a usual source of care have better outcomes, fewer disparities and lower health-related costs due to routine care, timely intervention and close follow-up . Having a consistent PCP is associated with: Greater patient trust Good patient-provider communication Increased likelihood that patients will receive appropriate care22 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportDue to the collaborative efforts of Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital (NMCDH), MRH, the DuPage County Health Department and multiple health/human service organizations, service area residents have access to significantly more primary care providers than throughout the state or nation . DuPage County provides 145 .6 PCPs per 100,000 population, as compared to between 80 and 95 PCPs at the state and national level . Additionally: A specific source of primary care was acknowledged by 80 .2 percent of survey respondents A doctor's office is used for medical care by 71 . 1 percent A total of 71 . 8 percent have visited their healthcare provider for a checkup in the past year A total of 84 .6 percent said their children have visited a PCP for a routine checkup in the past year A total of 5 .5 percent of survey respondents acknowledged use of the emergency room more than once in the past year due to: Emergency situations (51 . 6 percent) Weekend/after-hours situations (22 .4 percent) Access problems (3 .4 percent) Supplemental disability survey To specifically assess the needs of individuals with disabilities in the MRH service area, input was also solicited from two groups through an online survey . Group 1: People who received health care from the MRH network within the past two years and provided a valid email address (aka Community) Group 2: People who registered with AbilityLinks, a national, web-based community where qualified job seekers with disabilities gain access to valuable networking opportunities (aka AbilityLinks) The goal of the additional survey was to gain input from constituencies who look to MRH for service or partnership, and who better understand overall health concerns and need in the community, especially for persons with disabilities and impairments . The surveys were developed and administered by MRH; results were shared with PRC for inclusion in the CHNA . The surveys included the following eight categories: Disability and impairment Access to healthcare services Transportation EmploymentHousing Technology and assistive devices Students Individual background Surveys were sent to 1,197 Community members and generated a return rate of 23 .6 percent (283 respondents) . Surveys were also sent to 251 AbilityLinks members and generated a response rate of 12 .4 percent (31 respondents) .23 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportDisability prevalence Mobility/physical disability was the most prevalent health condition in both the Community (61 . 6 percent) and AbilityLinks (40 percent) samples . It was also noted that only 15 .7 percent of respondents from the Community were born with their disability, as compared to 33 .3 percent of AbilityLinks respondents . A total of 60 percent of Community respondents rated their disability as moderate to somewhat severe, as compared to 71 . 5 percent of the AbilityLinks respondents . Activity limitations A total of 39 .6 percent of Community respondents required assistance with basic needs as compared to 26 .3 percent of AbilityLinks respondents . Family members or friends provided the greatest level of assistance to both groups \u2014 Community (50 percent) and AbilityLinks (26 .3 percent) . Health insurance coverage A total of 48 .5 percent of Community respondents reported Medicare as their primary source of health insurance, followed by health insurance through work/union (23 .6 percent) . Access to health services A total of 7 .7 percent of Community respondents stated that they were unable to get medical care in the past year, compared to 31 . 6 percent of AbilityLinks respondents . AbilityLinks members, in general, reported a greater level of dissatisfaction overall with access to health services as compared to Community respondents . Affordability of prescriptions was least satisfying to Community respondents . Transportation A majority of Community respondents (72 .5 percent) and AbilityLinks respondents (55 .6 percent) reported that transportation was not a problem . However, 29 .6 percent of Community and 27 .8 percent of AbilityLinks respondents acknowledged difficulty in the use of public transportation . . Employment A total of 42 .3 percent of Community respondents reported being retired or not working . AbilityLinks respondents were split between unemployment (10 .3 percent), looking for work (26 .3 percent) and working part-time (31 . 6 percent) . Additionally, 31 . 6 percent of AbilityLinks respondents reported that lack of jobs that accommodate disabilities was a primary reason for unemployment . A total of 68 .5 percent of AbilityLinks respondents agreed that persons with a disability are able to find out about job training . Additionally, 52 .6 percent of AbilityLinks respondents agreed that persons with a disability are able to find assistance in finding work when needed . Housing A total of 11 . 5 percent of individuals in the Community survey reported currently lacking housing that meets their needs, while almost one-third (31 . 6 percent) of AbilityLinks respondents reported a similar lack of necessary housing . Cost was reported as the main factor in both surveys . When asked about independent living, 88 .2 percent of Community respondents and 84 .2 percent of AbilityLinks respondents reported that their homes allow for independent living .24 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportSupportive/special equipment When questioned regarding the need for special equipment that was not already owned, 18 .4 percent of Community respondents and 21 . 1 percent of AbilityLinks respondents acknowledged the need for additional equipment . Barriers to obtaining equipment included: Affordability Never tried to get it Don't know where to get it Declined by insurance Not comfortable using it . Education A total of 4 .4 percent of community respondents are pursuing an education as compared to 15 .8 percent of AbilityLinks respondents . Additionally, 44 .3 percent of Community respondents and 50 percent of AbilityLinks respondents disagree that there are enough student programs that focus on job placement . Areas of opportunity for community health improvement The following areas of opportunity were identified through this CHNA and represent potential areas to consider for intervention . Topic Identified Needs/Concerns Access to Healthcare Services Difficulty accessing healthcare services: Finding a physician Inconvenient office hours Cost of doctor visit Affordability of prescriptions Supplemental surveys: Cost and \"not covered by insurance\" were main reasons that Community and AbilityLinks members could not get medical care Affordability was a key dissatisfier for Community respondents Access to good insurance Access to rehab services or general medical care . Heart Disease and Stroke Second-leading cause of death in DuPage County High blood pressure prevalence Heart disease and stroke ranked as a top concern in the online key informant survey Disabilities related to heart disease and stroke Injury and Violence Injury and Violence Ongoing bicycle helmet education (children) Ongoing car seat safety education/injury prevention Seat belt usage Disabilities related to injuries and violence25 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportMental Health Suicide deaths Mental health ranked as a top concern in the online key informant survey Substance Abuse Overall alcohol use and binge drinking Seeking help for alcohol/drug issues Illicit drug use Substance abuse ranked as a top concern in the online key informant survey Nutrition, Physical Activity and Weight Physical activity, nutrition and weight ranked as a top concern in the online key informant survey Potentially Disabling Conditions Arthritis prevalence (50+) Supplemental surveys: Mobility/physical disability was the most prevalent health condition in both the Community and AbilityLinks samples More than one-third of individuals taking part in the supplemental surveys characterized their disability as \"severe\" or \"somewhat severe\" A total of 26 percent of AbilityLinks respondents and 40 percent of Community respondents require assistance with basic needs Meeting the Specialty Needs of Disabled Individuals Promoting independence Access to fitness and physical activity Transportation Employment training Specialized housing/equipment Additional sources of input and key partnerships DuPage County Health Department Concurrent with the development of the MRH CHNA, the DuPage County Health Department also conducted a comprehensive needs assessment of residents in DuPage County . The IPLAN (Illinois Project for Local Assessment of Needs) is a community health assessment and planning process that is conducted every five years by local health jurisdictions in Illinois . Utilizing the Assessment Protocol for Excellence in Public Health (APEX-PH) model, IPLAN is grounded in the core functions of public health and addresses public health practice standards . The completion of IPLAN fulfills most of the requirements for Local Health Department certification under Illinois Administrative Code Section 600 .400: Certified Local Health Department Code Public Health Practice Standards . Impact DuPage In August 2013, a group of community leaders formed Impact DuPage, a countywide initiative aimed at creating a common understanding of community needs, gaps and priorities that will advance the well-being of the DuPage County community . Utilizing the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnership (MAPP) process, Impact DuPage 26 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment Reportcompleted four countywide assessments between June 2014 and December 2014 . Partners are currently developing an action plan to address the priorities identified in these assessments . The assessments included: . Landscape review Conducted in fall 2014, the purpose of this assessment was to collect community voices to learn perceptions about quality of life in DuPage County . This was done through a countywide survey, with more than 2,000 responses: Local system assessment This assessment gathered partners in a day-long event that assessed the strength and weaknesses of local systems that support the well-being of DuPage County residents . It provided valuable feedback regarding system performance and opportunities for improvement Forces of Change Assessment During the Forces of Change Assessment, community leaders brainstormed trends, factors and events that affected quality of life, and the associated threats and opportunities . Community Profile The Community Profile provided a snapshot of the well-being of DuPage County residents by displaying quantitative information on health status, quality of life and risk factors . Additional information regarding the Impact DuPage Community Assessment can be found at www .impactdupage .org/index .php?module=htmlpages&func=display&pid=5011 . Impact DuPage priorities Data from the assessments described above formed the basis for the top five priorities identified by DuPage County: Affordable housing Mental health Access to health services Substance abuse Healthy lifestyles Interpreting and prioritizing health needs Prioritization process A planned and structured process was used to facilitate prioritization of the identified health needs . Tools and data utilized in the process included the CHNA data, IPLAN data, key informant feedback, an organizational asset inventory, and alignment with guiding principles for response to community need . Organizational guiding principles include: Importance of the problem to the community Is there a demonstrated community need? Will action impact vulnerable populations? Does the identified health need impact other community issues? 27 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportAvailability of tested approaches or existing resources to address the issues Can actionable goals be defined to address the health need? Does the defined solution have specific and measurable goals that are achievable in a reasonable timeframe? Opportunity for collective impact Can the need be addressed in collaboration with community or campus partners to achieve significant, long-term outcomes? Are other organizations already addressing the health issue? Applicability of MRH as a change agent (as a partner, researcher, educator, in a role to share knowledge or provide direct funding, etc .) Does MRH have the research or education expertise/resources that address the identified health need? Does MRH have clinical services or other expertise/resources that address the identified health need? Estimated resources, timeframe and size of impacted population MRH developed a survey tool to formally solicit input from leaders and identify their organizations' Priority Health Needs (defined as health needs that could be impacted the most by the work of MRH and partner organizations participating on the ESC) . MRH leaders were asked to identify top priorities from among the areas of opportunity identified by PRC using the following prioritization criteria: Magnitude: How many people in the community are/will be impacted? Seriousness and impact: How does the identified need impact health and quality of life? Feasibility: What capacity/assets currently exist to address the need? Consequences of inaction: What impact would inaction have on the population health of the community? Trend: How has the need been changing over time? The survey results were compiled, and the highest Priority Health Needs were determined, taking into account the findings of the CHNA, the survey findings, and discussion around the guiding principles and prioritization criteria . Attention was also focused on assessment of internal and external capabilities . An asset analysis was conducted, which included a review of current initiatives and exploration of ways to better coordinate efforts . The potential for duplicative efforts was identified in addition to existing gaps . Identified needs are not addressed if MRH is not best positioned to address them because: MRH has limited expertise, services or resources to address the needs The needs are typically addressed by a public health or other organization28 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment Report Other organizations have infrastructure and plans already in place to better meet the needs The needs will be addressed or significantly impacted through broader initiatives in the Organizational Implementation Plan Upon review and discussion of the CHNA, it was the consensus of leadership that MRH's primary focus should emphasize a response to the need of disabled individuals . Priority Health Needs Americans are living longer, but they are sicker . While we are experiencing consistent increases in life expectancy, our longer lives are burdened with increasing chronic illnesses and resulting disabilities . Sedentary behavior and preventable chronic disease are compromising our community's health . More than one-quarter of the population is obese, and diabetes is at epidemic levels . Hand-in-hand with a decreasing quality of life is an astounding increase in the economic impact of managing these diseases . The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimates that by the year 2030, medical costs associated with treating preventable obesity-related diseases are estimated to increase to $66 billion dollars annually, with a resultant loss in economic productivity of between $390 and $580 billion annually . A 2012 CNN documentary entitled Escape Fire drives home the stark reality that we can no longer afford to focus on acute care as the center of health care, but must also focus on prevention, education, chronic disease management, rehabilitation and case coordination to maximize the health of our nation's most valuable asset \u2014 our people . As hospitals, we must continue to challenge ourselves to provide the highest-quality, state-of-the-art health care to our community, but as experts and leaders in the healthcare industry, we must also look outside our doors and reach out to the communities we serve, striving to enhance the quality of life by engaging in evidence-based activities that will promote health across the lifespan . To that end, MRH has identified four priority health needs that will enable us and our community partners to maximize the health benefit generated by our collective resources over the next few years . In selecting these priorities, we considered the significance of the health needs identified in the CHNA, available resources, the capacity of other agencies to meet the need, and the suitability of our own expertise in rehabilitative care and resources to address the need . In particular, we looked for identified health needs that would be addressed through coordinated response from a range of healthcare and community resources . We believe these health needs will be optimally impacted through the integrated efforts of our organization and our community partners . The 2018 MRH Priority Health Needs were identified as follows: 1 . Promoting Independence in Individuals With Disabilities 2 . Chronic Disease Management and Rehabilitation 3 . Access to Care 4 . Injury Prevention 29 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportDevelopment of Implementation Plan MRH will continue to work with leadership and key community agencies to develop a comprehensive Implementation Plan that addresses each Priority Health Need . MRH and its community health partners share the vision of a healthy community and are committed to working together to address significant health needs . Through an affiliation with Northwestern Memorial HealthCare, MRH and the organizations of Northwestern Medicine can support efforts to positively change the health status of our community by taking on any of a number of roles, whether as a direct clinical service provider, through application of our research and education expertise; by sharing our knowledge of health literacy, quality improvement or information technology; by providing indirect support by coalescing organizations that can impact health; or by funding initiatives undertaken by others . The Implementation Plan will specify resources MRH and its community partner organizations will direct toward each Priority Health Need . A general listing of the collective assets that could potentially be directed toward impacting priority health issues includes: Clinical care resources and facilities of MRH and its community partner organizations Established, replicable community-based clinical and health promotion programs addressing both highly prevalent and targeted chronic health conditions Research and education expertise among Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine physician scientists Financial assistance programs at MRH Policies and procedures that broaden and simplify access to health care for the uninsured or underinsured Advocacy resources at MRH and its community partner organizations Planning and oversight resources Management expertise in quality improvement and information technology Existing healthcare facilities and resources MRH recognizes that a large number of healthcare facilities and organizations within DuPage County respond to health needs and support health improvement efforts . A list of those that were found through publicly available information sources as of July 2018 is included in Appendix B in this CHNA report . 30 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportActions taken to address the 2017 CHNA priority health needs Introduction An aging population, coupled with a rise in the incidence of chronic disease, challenges all healthcare providers in the U .S . to think out-of-the-box when it comes to the future of health care . Maintaining awareness of a community's health needs is imperative in an environment as dynamic and diverse as Chicago's western suburbs \u2014 especially when it involves planning and responding to the needs of multiple demographic and economically diverse populations . The successful implementation of any community benefit strategy requires a comprehensive assessment of need coupled with a knowledge of key community stakeholders and existing health collaboratives . No one institution can comprehensively address all the health needs of a community \u2014 nor can it work independently of other key community stakeholders and existing outside initiatives . Therefore a quality CHNA and its ensuing Implementation Plan must consider the strengths and expertise of its organization in addition to its ability to mobilize effective partnerships, which will result in the maximized use of every dollar expended to address unmet community need . Through the prioritization process, MRH identified four priority health needs: 1 . Access to Healthcare Services 2 . Chronic Disease Management and Rehabilitation 3 . Promoting Independence in Individuals With Disabilities 4 . Injury Prevention MRH identified priority health needs that would be best addressed through a coordinated response from a range of healthcare and community resources . Specific ways in which MRH is addressing the significant needs identified in its most recently conducted CHNA are below . Priority Need: Access to Healthcare Services MRH ensures that residents of our community have access to high-quality, medically necessary healthcare services in the most appropriate setting . Dedicated to the delivery of physical medicine and rehabilitation, MRH offers specialty programs for adult and pediatric patients recovering from injury or illness in both the inpatient and outpatient settings . MRH is committed to developing and maintaining programs that address the affordability of and accessibility to healthcare services . Additionally, MRH offers a comprehensive financial assistance program to patients who are unable to afford the cost of necessary medical care . MRH seeks to engage and maintain a multicultural workforce of PCPs, specialists, midlevel practitioners, registered professional nurses and those in other specialties committed to working in an evidence-based practice setting by providing a clinical site for educational experiences .31 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportThe development and implementation of the DuPage County Access to Health Services Action Plan is led by the DuPage Health Coalition . Formerly known as Access DuPage, the Coalition is a collaborative effort by thousands of individuals and hundreds of organizations in DuPage County to provide access to medical services to the county's low-income, medically uninsured residents . The DuPage Health Coalition also operates the Silver Access Program, which provides financial help to lower-income families purchasing health insurance through the Affordable Care Act's Healthcare Marketplace . In early 2017, the DuPage Health Coalition will open the DuPage Dispensary of Hope, a new free pharmacy program in Wheaton, offered in partnership with DuPage County . MRH leadership and staff work collaboratively with the DuPage Coalition to promote affordable access to care for all residents of DuPage County . MRH will continue to support national and local efforts to increase access to care by providing leadership, investing resources and working collaboratively with other community organizations throughout the county . In conjunction with DuPage Health Coalition's Access DuPage program and independent medical providers, MRH will support the maintenance of an efficient and effective continuum of care for individuals with disabilities, offering inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services to those in need . Strategy 1: MRH will offer financial assistance policies that are easily accessible, user-friendly, respectful, and meet all regulatory requirements. In FY17, an audit was completed . The MRH website was updated to enhance end user access . Content was also updated to reflect alignment to NM policies and procedures . Strategy 2: MRH will continue to provide medically necessary inpatient and outpatient hospital services to uninsured and underinsured patients in accordance with the hospital's financial assistance policies. MRH tracked the number of individuals and the amount of rendered financial assistance annually . In FY17, 568 patients were provided services, and a total of $1,200,000 of community care was provided . Strategy 3: MRH will continue to address the needs of individuals identified as potentially eligible for public health insurance by facilitating their application for government-sponsored healthcare coverage via a trained in-person staff who will assist in facilitating enrollment. In FY17, MRH continued coordination of monetary support of Access DuPage services . Strategy 4: MRH leadership will continue representation on various task forces and work groups related to the collaborative work occurring on access to care issues. In FY17, MRH maintained a 99 percent approval rate of applications submitted . . Strategy 5: MRH will provide low-cost transportation to outpatient appointments. In FY17, MRH provided 10,296 rides through MRH transport services . Zero trips were cancelled due to weather or facility-specific issues . Strategy 6: MRH will continue to provide free inpatient and outpatient care to all Access DuPage clients in accordance with presumptive eligibility and existing MRH financial assistance policies. Opportunities to promote coordinated care to needed services for Access DuPage will be evaluated. In FY17, 568 patients/services provided, in the amount of $1,200,000 of community care provided . . 32 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportStrategy 7: MRH will serve as a training center for physicians, nursing and other allied health professions. Quantitative data, such as the number and types of internships and staff time commitment, was tracked throughout FY17 and was summarized in the Northwestern Medicine Community Benefit Report . Strategy 8: MRH will provide trained professional healthcare interpreters and offer language assistance programs. In FY17, MRH provided a total of $372,790 in interpreter services for MRH patients, including $26,728 on phone interpretation and the remainder on in-person interpretation . Priority Need: Chronic Disease Management and Rehabilitation In general, individuals with disabilities tend to experience higher percentages of health disparities than the larger population . These added challenges can result in further impaired mobility, nutritional deficits and an increased susceptibility to chronic medical conditions . Common precursors of chronic diseases, including physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension and high cholesterol, are more prevalent among persons with disabilities than those without . Despite increased health risks, people with disabilities are rarely targeted by specific health-promotion and disease-prevention efforts . Given the increasing prevalence of disability as the population ages, the need for community health services focusing on the rehabilitation needs of those served will likely increase at a proportional rate . A broad range of intervention exists to address the issue of chronic disease, including health education, health screenings, supporting linkages to medical homes, and chronic disease management programs . MRH utilizes a collaborative, evidence-based approach to prevention, screening and chronic disease management aimed at reducing and eliminating many of the prominent contributors to mortality in the United States . Programs such as Access DuPage and Engage DuPage ensure access to routine health care, screening, PCPs, specialists, medications and medical homes . MRH offers a comprehensive financial assistance program to individuals unable to afford the cost of their acute medical care . In addition, the hospital offers a comprehensive array of community education programing and services to support both primary and tertiary interventions . Strategy 1: MRH will offer evidence-based community health and wellness programming in the areas of chronic disease management and rehabilitation, overcoming the limitations of chronic disabilities. In FY17, MRH staff developed curriculum for the five courses listed below . Follow-up based on course content was tracked through the support groups . 1 . Understanding pediatric spasticity 2 . Relaxation and meditation 3 . Overcoming the limitations of spasticity 4 . Posture training to increase flexibility and decrease lower back pain 5 . Post-stroke exercise program33 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment ReportStrategy 2: MRH will provide access to the Emerging Fitness Center, including specialty group classes for individuals with specific exercise needs. In FY17, 1,449 sessions were held in the MRH Fitness Center for individuals with disabilities . Many of the participants were previously MRH patients or family members . . Strategy 3: MRH Medical Library will provide educational and supportive resources for the community. In FY17, MRH experienced 4,291 literature searches, 67 hours of education support and 57 interlibrary load transactions . MRH also conducted 130 hours of website/virtual library site development . Strategy 4: MRH will offer evidence-based support programs in the areas of chronic disease management programmatic venues including, but not limited to, self-help and support groups. In FY17, MRH provided the following support groups: 1 . Amputee (six sessions; 65 participants) 2 . Parkinson's (three sessions; 15 participants) 3 . Caregiver Support (seven sessions; 21 participants) 4 . Stroke (five sessions; 51 participants) 5 . ALS (five sessions; 97 participants) 6 . Aphasia (seven sessions; 152 participants) 7 . Connections - Pediatrics (seven sessions; 122 participants) 8 . High Hopes - Brain Injury (seven sessions; 159 participants) 9 . Lives in Motion - Spinal Cord Injury (seven sessions; 71 participants) 10 . Multiple Sclerosis (five sessions; 81 participants) Priority Need: Promoting Independence in Individuals With Disabilities The physicians and clinicians at MRH are trained in the provision of specialty treatments and rehabilitation for individuals with disabilities resulting from injuries, accidents, illnesses or congenital defects . Fitness and wellness programs tailored to people with disabilities and other health issues help ensure these vulnerable populations are engaged in moderate physical activity designed to improve strength and increase flexibility, to protect against further disability and enhance functional independence . The addition of the Marianjoy Fitness Center has opened new opportunities for individuals who may not have felt physically able or comfortable in other exercise settings . Throughout the year, MRH offers a variety of free and public classes and lectures (focused on health and wellness) to support and promote the independence of individuals with disabilities . Additionally, MRH sponsors a variety of support 34 Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, part of Northwestern Medicine 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment Reportgroups at no cost and open to the public including: amputation, aphasia, brain injury, chronic pain and stroke . MRH works closely with its community partners to promote independence of individuals with disabilities . Partners include, but are not limited to, DuPage County Health Department, DuPage Federation on Human Service Reform, local school districts, Office of the Secretary of State, DuPage Workforce Board and AbilityLinks, a national, web-based community where qualified job seekers with disabilities gain access to valuable networking opportunities . Strategy 1: MRH will provide aquatic programs in a group class setting for adults and children. In FY17, MRH provided 177 patient sessions .
