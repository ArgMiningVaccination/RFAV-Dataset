Or maybe it is not so unbelievable, as that is exactly how it should be. After all, what better to heal us than the derivatives of the earth which we call home. Ayurvedic aromatherapy is the latest in a long line of Ayurvedic treatments that is seeing an explosion of followers and fans due to the incredible results it delivers. And it seems like this is just the beginning. Not sure where to start with aromatherapy? Let us help! The science of life and your wellbeing Ayurveda is considered to be one of, if not the oldest, systems of medicine in the world. Literally meaning the 'science of life', Ayurveda is a cumulation of natural remedies, therapies, and practices that promote health and wellbeing. Not only treating the symptoms of an illness, Ayurveda focuses on attaining and maintaining a healthy balance of mind and body; utilising a combination of preventative and curative therapies that bring about the best version of you. What is Aromatherapy? The sense of smell has an incredible influence on our balance of doshas and holistic wellbeing. Aromatherapy is a form of treatment that uses natural plant extracts and aromatic compounds such as essential oils to promote physical and psychological health. And with an incredible array of materials at its disposal, the list of ailments it treats is, quite simply, astounding. What are the benefits of Ayurvedic Aromatherapy? Though Ayurvedic aromatherapy has long since been associated with decreasing stress and anxiety, this is just one dimension to it. Some of its other incredible benefits include: - Pain management - Improving sleep quality - Boosting immunity - Easing discomfort of labour - Improving digestion - Alleviating side effects of chemotherapy - Improving palliative care - Treating headaches and migraines - Soothing joint pain - Fighting infections - Easing depression while boosting relaxation What is the connection between Aromatherapy and the 3 doshas? Ayurvedic medicine is based on the concept that the world is made of 5 elements; namely space, water, earth, fire, and air. A combination of these elements results in 3 types of doshas, which essentially contribute to specific physiological, mental, and emotional characteristics of an individual. Based on which dosha is predominant in a person, you can identify their strengths and weaknesses, as well as understanding their physical, mental, and emotional states. However, a lack or an excess of any of these elements results in an imbalance within ourselves, and causes disease. Ayurveda and aromatherapy aim to restore the balance in the doshas, thereby restoring health and wellbeing. Utilising the specific essential oils that complement an individual's specific dosha helps to bring about this harmony and perfect equilibrium. What do you need for aromatherapy? Since aromatherapy works through inhalation and topical application, it can be done using any of these: - Diffusers - Spritzers - Inhalers - Facial steamers - Bathing salts - Hot and cold compresses And of course, essential oils, creams, and lotions. What essential oils are used in Ayurvedic aromatherapy? Essentials oils are a concentrated concoction of volatile and aromatic plant compounds. Popular essential oils such as lavender, chamomile, lemon, and cedarwood are widely used to improve the mood and ease anxiety. They may be diffused around the home or even anointed on the person. But with more knowledge and understanding of essential oils, comes more options. Specific oils can help bring specific results. And with over a hundred different essential oils to choose from, you can essentially create a unique blend that is the ideal complement to your individual dosha constitution. For instance, people with Vata dosha tend to feel more anxious and fearful. Therefore, they benefit from using warming and calming oils such as sweet orange, ylang ylang, and frankincense. These oils may even be blended in equal parts for a relaxing full-body massage. People with Pitta dosha on the other hand benefit from woody and floral oils with a cooling effect. These include jasmine, lavender, and sandalwood. These oils help ease headaches, inflammation, heartburn, and fiery emotions. An excess of Kapha dosha tends to result in feelings of heaviness and lethargy. Energising aromas such as eucalyptus, peppermint, basil, and lemongrass are therefore ideal to provide an invigorating and stimulating effect. Conclusion Ayurvedic aromatherapy is an incredible form of treatment that has as many applications as it has advantages. Its adaptivity, specificity, and ease of use, makes it one of the best options for treating a range of ailments, be it physical or psychological. From digestive problems and fatigue, to headaches and heartburn, aromatherapy provides a customised blend that cures, invigorates, soothes and eases all at once. Best of all? Whether you choose to diffuse your favourite essential oils at home, incorporate them in a warm bath, or use them for a rejuvenating massage, the effects of aromatherapy remain as enduring and balancing as you need them to be.
