The present invention also relates to methods of making cell-binding agent-drug (cytotoxic agent) conjugates in a specific manner comprising either modification of drugs with these linkers first, fol\u00ad lowed by reaction with prepared cell-binding agents; or modification of cell-binding agents with these linkers first, followed by reaction with drugs. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Traditional chemotherapy is often accompanied by systemic toxicity to the patient. Monoclonal antibody which can offer an alternative tumor-selective treatment approach via discriminating antigens on cancer cells, is normally not sufficiently potent to be thera \u00ad peutically active by itself. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), which by their name have the exquisite targeting ability of antibodies in combination with the cytotoxic action of anticancer agents, enable to target and deliver drugs to cancer cells leaving normal cells largely unaffected, thus improving the therapeutic index of chemotherapeutic agents, since US FDA approvals of Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin) in 2011 and Kadcyla (ado- trastuzumab emtansine) in 2013, the applications of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) as a promise targeted treatment of cancers have been exploded and almost every major pharma \u00ad ceutical and biotech company has adopted this approach (Chari, R. et al, Angew . Chem., Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 3796-3827; Sievers, E. L. et al. Annu Rev Med. 2013, 64, 15-29; Mehrling, T. Future Oncol, 2015, 11, 549). Antibody-drug conjugates are now a drug class with a robust pipeline and a flurry of deal-making among pharmaceutical companies. With more than 50 ADCs currently in various stages of clinical trials according to www.clinictrails.gov , and even more in preclinical and/or are ready to enter first-in-human trials, the market is rife with eager anticipation of more ADC drugs to be approved by regulators. The first-generation ADCs, including Kadcyla and Adcetris, are interchain an anti\u00ad body respectively to a cytotoxic drug. Since there are over 50 surface-exposed lysines and 8 hinge cysteine residues in IgGl antibodies, this nonselective conjugation results in I 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/151081 PCT/IB2015/055264 randomly cross-linkage of cytotoxic drugs to practically all areas of the antibody molecule, particularly having a diverse population of ADCs with a wide distribution of drugs per antibody (DAR) (Wang, L., et al. 2005 Protein Sci. 14, 2436; Hamblett, K. J., et al. 2004 Clin. Cancer Res. 10, 7063). Thus some of the undesired ADC subpopulation could lead to shorter circulation half-life, lower efficacy, potentially increased off-target toxicity and a wide range of in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) properties (Hamblett, K. J. et al, Clin. Cancer Res. 2004, 10, 7063-7070; Adem, Y. T. et al, Bioconjugate Chem. 2014, 25, 656-664; Boylan, N. J. Bioconjugate Chem., 2013, 24, 1008-1016; Strop, P., et al 2013 Chem. Biol. 20, 161-167). In addition, with this classical conjugation, the batch-to-batch consistency in ADC production can be challenging and may require diligent manufactur\u00ad ing capabilities (Wakankar, A. mAbs, 2011, 3, 161-172). Therefore, biotechnology companies and academic institutions are intensely focusing on establishing novel reliable methods for site-specific ADC conjugation. So far, there are several approaches developed in recent years for site selective ADC preparation (Panowski, S, 2014, mAbs 6, 34). They include incorporation of unpaired cysteines, e.g. engineered reactive cysteine residues, called THIOMAB from Genentech (Junutula, J. R., et al 2010 Clin. Cancer Res. 16, 4769; Junutula, J. R., et al 2008 Nat (Strop, P., Bioconjugate Chem., 2014, 25, 855-862; Strop, P., et al., 2013, Chem. Biol. 20, 161-167; US Patent 8,871,908 for Rinat-Pfizer) or transglutaminase (Dennler, P., Bioconjug. 569-578. US pat appl 20130189287 for Innate Pharma; US for Bio-Ker S.r.l. (IT)), incorporation of thiolfucose (Dennler, P., et al, 2014 Bioconjugate Chemistry 25, 569; Okeley, N. M., et al 2013 Bioconjugate Chem. 24, 1650), incorporation of unnatural amino acids through mutagenesis (Axup, J.Y., et al., 2012, Zimmer \u00ad man, E.S., et al., 2014, Bioconjug. Chem. 25, 351-361; Wu, P., et al, 2009 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 106, 3000-3005; Rabuka, D., Nat. Protoc. 7, Pattent 8,778,631 selenocysteine 2009, Biochemistry 48, 12047- 12057; US Patent 8,916,159 for US National Cancer Institute), Convertion of cysteines located in the CXPXR consensus sequence to formylglycine (FGly) with formylglycine 2 5 15 20 25 30WO 2015/151081 PCT/IB2015/055264 generating enzyme (FGE) (Drake, P.M., et al., 2014, Bioconjug. Chem. 25, 1331-1341. Carrico; Isaac S. et and through glycoengineeringly introduction sialic acid with the use of galactosyl- and sialytransferases (Zhou, Q., et al 2014, Bioconjug. Chem., 25, 510-520, US Pat Appl 20140294867 for Sanofi-Genzyme). These above methods have produced nearly homogeneous product profiles, but they are required antibody-engineering processes and reoptimization of cell culture conditions. Moreover, expression yields for genetic encoding of an unnatural amino acid were typically not promisingly high enough (Tran, F., et al, 2014, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. Ill, 1 7 6 6 - 7 1 ) w h i c h h a s a s i g n i f i c a n t i m p a c t o n t h e c o s t o f g o o d s o f t h e A D C . I n a d d i t i o n , i t has been known that ADCs obtained by conjugation to cysteine side chains often display limited stability in circulation, leading to premature disconnection of the cytotoxic payload before the tumor site is reached (Junutula, J. R., et al 2008, Nat. Biotechnol. 26, 925-32). The disulfide bond structures of the four subclasses of IgG antibodies were known in the 1960s (Milstein C. Biochem J 1966, 101:338 - 351; Pink JR, Milstein C. Nature 1967, 214:92-94; Frangione B, Milstein C. Nature 1967, 216:939 - JR, Milstein C. Nature 1967, 216:941 -942; Frangione et J et al Biochemistry, 1975, 10, 2157-63 ). Disulfide bond structure is critical for the structure, stability, and biological functions of IgG molecules. Among the four subclasses of IgG antibodies, IgGi, IgG2, IgG 3 and of 12 intra-chain disulfide bonds; each disulfide bond is associated with an individual IgG domain. The two heavy chains are connected in the hinge region by a variable number of disulfide bonds: 2 for IgGi and IgGzj, 4 for IgG 2 and 11 for IgG3. The light chain of the IgGi is connected to the heavy chain by a disulfide bond between the last cysteine residue of the light chain and the fifth cysteine residue of the heavy chain. But, for IgG2, IgG 3 and IgGzj, the light chain is linked to the heavy chain by a disulfide bond between the last cysteine residue of the light chain and the third cysteine residue of the heavy chain (Liu, H. and May, K., 2012, mAbs 4, 17-23). On the ranks of the susceptibility of disulfide bonds in human IgGl antibodies by experimental reduction, differential alkylation, and LC-MS analysis (Liu, H, et al Anal. Chem., 2010, 82, 5219-5226), inter chain disulfide bonds are more susceptible to reduc \u00ad tion than intra chain disulfide bonds, and the disulfide bonds between the light chain and heavy chain were more susceptible than disulfide bonds between the two heavy chains. 3 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/151081 PCT/IB2015/055264 The upper disulfide bond of the two inter heavy chain disulfide bonds was more suscepti\u00ad ble than the lower one. Furthermore, disulfide bonds in the CH2 domain were the most susceptible to reduction. Disulfide bonds in VL, CL, VH, and CHl domains had similar and moderate susceptibility, while disulfide bonds in the CH3 domain were the least susceptible to reduction (Liu, H, et al Anal. Chem., 2010, 82, 5219-5226). Based on the more susceptibility of inter chain disulfide bonds in human IgGl anti\u00ad bodies, several institutions and companies adopted the chemically specific conjugation strategy through rebridging reduced interchain disulfide bonds of a native antibody, such as, using bromo or dibromo-maleimides, called next generation maleimides (NGMs) (Schumacher, F.F., et al 2014, Org. UCL Inst.), applying bis-alkylating reagents a three-carbon Bioconjug. Chem. WO2013/190272, WO2014/064424 for 2015/0105539 through di-maleimide as also used bromo maleimide and dibromomaleimide linkers to conjugate both drugs and antibodies for a quite while (WO20 14/009774, PCT/IB2012/053554). However, these above bridge linkers were designed in the way to conjugate only one cytotoxic agent to a pair of disul \u00ad fide bonds, and therefore at most of time they only produced ADCs at DAR less than 2 (drugs per antibody), due to limited numbers (about only two pairs) of reduced disulfide bonds are more accessible for conjugation. As one of the major issues for ADCs is the limited numbers or amount of cytotoxic compounds that ultimately reaches the tumor, and the favorable DAR over 3 is much important factor for improvement of ADC therapeutical index (Epenetos, A. A. et al, CancerRes., 1986, 46, 3183-3191; Chari, R. V. Acc. Chem. Res., 2008, 41, 98-107, Zhao, R. Y. et al, 2011, J. Med. Chem. 54, 3606-3623), we therefore disclose novel disulfide bridge linkers of this invention that are able to conjugate two or more drugs per linker for achieving higher DARs (>4) via re-bridging the susceptible a pair of thiols on the inter chain of IgG antibody that are reduced by TCEP and DTT. And the other reduced disulfide bonds that are inaccessibly reached by the bridge linkers, due to the big size of bridge linker containing two cytotoxic agents, can be recoupled (regenerated) by an oxide, e.g. dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA) or Cu (II), at the end of conjugation. In a word, these bridge linkers of the invention can make homogeneous production of specific ADCs in a simple way. 4 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/151081 PCT/IB2015/055264 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides linkers containing a hydrazine to link two drugs to a cell-binding agent (e.g., an antibody).

The conjugatable thiol atoms can gener \u00ad ally be generated from reduction of pairs of disulfide bonds on the cell-binding molecule with TCEP or DTT reagents. Drugi and Drug 2 represent the same or different cytotoxic agents, which linked to the cell-binding agent via Rii R2i R3 and R4 are described the same previously in Formula (I). In a further aspect, the present invention provides a modified cell-binding agent of Formula (III), in which the cell-binding agent, Cb, has reacted with the bridge linker, which has Zi and Z2, the function groups capable of reacting with a drug: Wherein Cb, Zi, Zo Rii R2i R3 and R4 are defined the same as in Formula (I) and (II).

The bridge linkers containing hydrazine can be introduced by direct condensation of hydrazine with an acid, an acid halide or acid anhydride, following by introduction of the function groups capable of reaction with a cell-binding agent and drugs. The synthesis of these bridge linkers is exampled in the Figures 1-11 and in the experimental section. Preferably, the bridge linkers are compounds of the Formula (I) and Y2 are the same or different a functional group that enables reaction with a pair of sulfur atoms of a cell-binding agent, to form disulfide, thioether, or thioester bonds. The preferred function groups for Yi and Y2 are, but not limited CH2; R5 is Ri, aromatic, heteroaromatic, or aromatic group wherein one or several H atoms are replaced independently by -Ri, - halogen, the other anhydride, e.g. acetyl anhydride, formyl anhydride; or a intermediate molecule generated with a condensation reagent for peptide coupling reactions, or for Mitsunobu reactions. Zi and Z2 are the same or different a function group that enables to react with a cyto \u00ad toxic drug. The functional group Zi or Z2 can react to a cytotoxic drug R4 are the same or different, and are absent, linear alkyl having from 1-8 carbon atoms, branched or cyclic alkyl having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms, linear, branched or cyclic alkenyl or alkynyl, or 1-8 carbon atoms of esters, ether, amide, or 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/151081 PCT/IB2015/055264 polyethyleneoxy unit of formula (OCH 2CH2)p, wherein p is an integer from 0 to about 1000 , or combination thereof. Additionally Rii R2, R3 and R4 are respectively a chain of atoms selected from C, N, O, S, Si, and P, preferably having 0-500 atoms, which covalently connects to Yi or Y2 and Zi or Z2. The atoms used in forming the Rii R2. R3 and R4 may be combined in all chemi \u00ad cally relevant hydroxamic acids, or combination thereof. Examples of the functional group, Zi and Z2, which enable linkage of a cytotoxic drug, include groups amide bond. Such functional groups include, but are not limited the functional group, Zi and Z2, that enable reaction with the terminal of amine of a drug/ cytotoxic agent can anhy\u00ad dride, formyl anhydride; or a intermediate molecule generated with a condensation reagent for peptide coupling reactions, or for Mitsunobu reactions. With the terminal of thiol can be, as but not limited to, pyridyldisulfides; nitropyridyldisulfides ; maleimides; haloacetates and carboxylic acid chlorides. With the terminal of ketone or aldehyde can be, as but not limited to, amines; alkoxyamines; hydrazines; or acyloxylamine; With the terminal of azide can be, as but not limited to, alkyne. In preferred embodiments, the functional groups, Zi and Z2, react to Drugl and Drug2 through condensation of an acid and an amine to form an amide bond.

In addition, Ri, R2, R3, and R4 can be cleavable by a protease. 16 WO 2015/151081 PCT/IB2015/055264 The detail examples of the synthesis of the bridge linkers are shown in the figures 1-11. Normally the bridge substituent of hydrazine R2, R3, and R4 containing function groups capable to react to drug compounds and thiol molecules. 5 10 15 20CELL-BINDING AGENT-DRUG CONJUGATES The conjugates of the present invention can be represented by the following formula, Cb=t|?LCg rr\"|l) n \u00ae2 , wherein Cb is L is a linker, Dmgl and Drug2 are a drug molecule, n is an integer from I to 20, and two S (sulfur) elements from Cb bridgely link to L, which covalently connects two or more drugs (per bridge linker L). The bridge linker L may be composed of one or more linker components. Exemplary linker units (\"EO\" or \"PEO\"). Additional linker components are known in the art and some are described herein. Example structures of these components containing linkers are: (MC, 6-maleimidocaproyl containing) p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl PCT/IB2015/055264 5 sulfo- S PDB antibody; Dmgi and Dmg 2 represent the same or different drugs/cytotoxic agents, linked to the cell-binding agent via bond, or combination thereof. Inside the bracket (parentheses) are the linker-drug components that are conjugated to a cell-binding molecule via a pair of thiol atoms. The conjugatable thiol atoms can gener \u00ad ally be generated from reduction of pairs of disulfide bonds on the cell-binding molecule with TCEP or DTT reagents. n is I ~ 20; Rii R2, R3 and R4 are described the same previously in Formula (I). As described in more detail below, Drugi and Drug 2 can be any of many small mole \u00ad cule drugs, including, conjugate, the cell-binding agent can be first modified with the bridge linkers of the present invention through reduction of disulfide bonds of the cell\u00ad binding molecule. The yielded a pair of free thiols can react to the bridge linker of Formu\u00ad la (I) at pH 5-9 aqueous media with or without addition of 0-30% of water mixable (miscible) organic solvents, such as DMA, ethanol, methanol, acetonitrile, THF, isopropanol, dioxane, propylene glycol, or ethylene diol, to the reactive groups of Zi and Z2, whose reactive cytotoxic agent reacts to the modified cell-binding molecule accordingly. For example, synthesis of the cell-binding agent-drug conjugates linked via disulfide bonds is achieved by a disulfide exchange between the disulfide bond in the modified cell-binding agent and a drug containing a free thiol group. Synthesis of the cell-binding agent-drug conjugates linked via thioether is achieved by reaction the maleimido or haloacetyl or ethylsulfonyl modified cell-binding agent and a drug containing a free thiol group. Synthesis of conju \u00ad gates bearing an acid labile hydrazone can be achieved by reaction of a carbonyl group with the hydrazide moiety in the linker, by methods known in the art (see, for example, P. Hamann et ah, Hinman, F. M., et al, Cancer Res. 53, 3336-334, 1993; B. Faguzza et ah, J. Med. Chem., 32; 548-555, 1959; P. Trail et ah, Cancer Res., 57; 100-105, 1997). Synthesis of conjugates bearing triazole linkage can be achieved by reaction of a 1-yne group of the drug with the azido moiety in the linker, through the click chemistry (Huisgen 19 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/151081 PCT/IB2015/055264 cycloaddition) (Lutz, J-F. et al, 2008, Adv. Drug Del. Rev. 60, 958-970; Sletten, E. M. et al 2011, Acc Chem. Research 44, 666-676). Alternatively, the drug can react with the bridge linkers of the present invention that have conjugated to a cell-binding molecule to give a modified cell-binding molecule linker of Formula (III) bearing functionalities. For example, a thiol-containing drug can react with the modified cell-binding molecule bridge linker of Formula (III) bearing a maleimdo, or a haloacetyl, or an ethylsulfonyl substituent at pH in aqueous molecule-drug conjugate a thioether linkage. A thiol-containing drug can undergo disulfide exchange with a modified bridge linker of Formula (III) bearing a pyridyldithio moiety to give a conjugate a disulfide bond linkage. A drug bearing a hy\u00ad droxyl group or a thiol group can be reacted with a modified bridge linker of Formula (III) bearing a halogen, particularly the alpha halide of carboxylates, in the presence of a mild base, e.g. pH 7.5-9.5, to give a modified drug bearing an ether or thiol ether link. A hydroxyl group containing drug can be condensed with a bridge cross linker of Formula (I) bearing a carboxyl group, in the presence of a dehydrating agent, such as EDC or DCC , to give ester linkage, then the subject drug modified bridge linker undergoes the conjugation with a cell-binding molecule. A drug containing an amino group can condensate (III) to give a conjugate via amide bond linkage. The conjugate may be purified by standard biochemical means, such as gel filtration on a Sephadex G25 or Sephacryl S300 column, adsorption chromatography, and ion ex\u00ad change or by dialysis. In some cases, a small molecule as a cell-binding agent (e.g. folic acid, melanocyte stimulating hormone, EGF etc) conjugated with a small molecular drugs can be purified by chromatography such as by HPLC, medium pressure column chroma \u00ad MODIFIED cell-binding agent modified by reaction with linkers of the present invention are preferably represented by the Formula (III) 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/151081 PCT/IB2015/055264 Wherein Cb, Zi, Za, n, Rii R2. R3 and R4 are defined the same as in Formula (I) and (). In preferred embodiments, Zi cell\u00ad binding agent can be prepared via a reaction of the cell-binding agent with the bridge linkers of Formula (I) as described in Formula (II) above. In order to achieve a higher conjugation yield for the reaction of the function groups Y1 and Y2 on the bridge linkers of Formula (I) with a pair of free thiols on the cell-binding molecule, a small percentage of organic co-solvent may be required to add to the reaction mixture, as well added in the solution after the reaction to maintain solubility of the For\u00ad mula (III) in aqueous solution. To modify the cell-binding agents, the cross-linking rea\u00ad gent (bridge linker) of Formula (I) can be first dissolved in a polar organic solvent, which is miscible with water, for example different alcohols, such as methanol, tion, for example 1-500 mM. Meanwhile, the cell-binding molecule, such as antibody dissolved in an aqueous buffer pH 5-9.5, preferably pH 6-8.5, at 1-35 with 1-20 equivalent of TCEP or DTT for 20 min to 12 hour. After the reduction, DTT can be removed by SEC chromatographic purification. TCEP can be optionally removed by SEC chromatography too, or can be staying in the reaction mixture for the next step reaction without purification. Furthermore, the reduction of antibodies or the other cell-binding agents with TCEP can be performed in the presence of a bridge linker of Formula (I), for which the conjugation reaction can be achieved simultaneously along with the TCEP reduction. After conjugation reaction, the over reduced free thiols on the cell-binding molecules can be oxidized with DHAA or Cu (II) to regenerate the disul \u00ad fide bonds, or the free thiols can be capped with a thiol-reactive molecule, such as N-ethyl maleimide, sodium iodoacetate, sodium bromoacetate, bromoacetic acid methyl ester. The aqueous solutions for the modification of cell-binding agents are buffered be\u00ad tween pH 6 and 9, preferably between 6.5 and 7.5 and can contain any non-nucleophilic 21 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/151081 PCT/IB2015/055264 buffer salts useful for these phosphate, triethanolamine HC1, HEPES , and MOPS such as cyclodextrins, sucrose and salts, for examples, NaCl and KCL After the addition of the bridge linker of Formula (I) into the solution containing the reduced cell-binding mole \u00ad cules, the reaction mixture is incubated at a temperature of from 4 0C to 45 0C, preferably at ambient temperature. The progress of the reaction can be monitored by measuring the decrease in the absorption at 254 nm, or increase in the absorption at 280 nm, or the other changes at an appropriate wavelength. After the reaction is complete, isolation of the modified cell-binding agent can be performed in a routine way, using for example gel filtration chromatography, or adsorptive chromatography. The extent of modification can be assessed by measuring the absorbance UV spectra. For the conjugation without a chromophore group, the modification or conjugation reaction can be monitored by LC-MS , preferably mass (CE-MS). The bridge cross-linkers described herein have diverse functional groups that can react with any drugs, preferably cytotoxic agents that possess a suitable substituent. For examples, the modified cell-binding molecules bearing an amino or hydroxyl substituent can react with drugs bearing an N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester, the modified cell-binding molecules bearing a thiol substituent can react with drugs bearing a maleimido or haloacetyl group. Additionally, the modified carbonyl (ketone react with drugs bearing a hydrazide or an alkoxyamine. One skilled in the art can readily determine which linker to use based on the known reactivity of the available functional group on the linkers. MODIFIED CYTOTOXIC DRUGS The cytotoxic drugs modified by reaction with cross-linkers of the present invention are preferably represented by the Formula (IV): Y1\u2014R1-N-R 3-Drug Ri, R2, R3 and R4 are defined the same as in Formula (I) and (II). In preferred embodiments, Yi and Y2 are a disulfide ethenesulfonyl; modified drugs can be prepared via reaction of the drug with the linkers of the Formula (I) to give a modified drug of Formula (IV) bearing functionality of Yi and Y2 groups capable of reacting with a pair of thiol groups of a cell-binding agent. But for drugs containing a thiol, or the drugs undergoing to link a cell-binding molecule via the bridge linkers through thioether, thioester or disulfide bond, it is therefore preferred that the Drugi or Drug 2 may be synthesized to connect to R3, or R4 in a piece of components via the linkage of thioether, thioester or disulfide bond first. Then the synthesized R3-Drugi or R4- Drug 2 component is assembled to a hydrazine group to form the bridge linker modified drugs of Formula (IV). For examples of the synthesis, a thiol-containing drug can be reacted with the linker of components R3 or R4 bearing a maleimdo substituent at neutral pH in aqueous buffer to give a R3-Drugi or R4-Drug 2 compartment bearing thioether linkage, and following by condensation with a compartment of hydrazine group containing function Yi and Y2 groups to give a modified drug of Formula (IV) bearing thioether linkage. A drug bearing a hydroxyl group can be reacted with a linker component R3 or R4 bearing a halogen, or a tosylate, or a mesylate, in the presence of a mild base, to give a R3-Drugi or R4-Drug 2 compartment bearing ether linkage, and following by condensation with a compartment of hydrazine group containing function groups Y1 and Y2 to give a modified drug of Formula (IV) bearing thioether linkage. A hydroxyl group containing drug can be condensed with a linker of Formula (I) bearing a carboxyl group, in the presence of a dehydrating agent, such as EDC or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) , to give a modified drug of Formula (IV) via ester linkage. A drug bearing a thiol group can also react the linker of components R3 or R4 bearing a maleimido or a vinylsulfonyl, or a haloacetyl group, give a R3-Drugi or R4- Drug 2 compartment bearing thioether linkage, and following by condensation with a compartment of hydrazine group containing function groups Yi and Y2 to give a modified drug of Formula (IV) bearing thioether linkage. An amino group containing drug can similarly undergo condensation with a carboxyl group on the bridge linker of Formula (I) to give a modified drug of Formula (IV) bearing amide bonds. The modified drug can be purified by standard methods such as column chromatography over silica gel or alumina, 23 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/151081 PCT/IB2015/055264 crystallization, preparatory HPLC . CELL-BINDING AGENTS The cell-binding molecule that comprises the conjugates and the modified cell\u00ad binding agents of the present invention may be of any kind presently known, or that be\u00ad come known, molecule that binds to, complexes with, or reacts with a moiety of a cell population sought to be therapeutically or otherwise biologically modified. The cell binding agents include, but are not limited to, large molecular weight proteins such as, for example, full-length antibodies (polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies); single antibodies; antibodies such as F(ab') 2, Fv, [Parham, J. Immunol. 131, 2895-2902 anti-idiotypic (anti-id) antibodies, CDR's, diabody, triabody, and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above which immuno-specifically bind to cancer cell antigens, viral antigens, microbial antigens or a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing, binding to a specific antigen or exhibiting the desired biological activity (Miller et al (2003) J. of Immunology 170:4854-4861); interferons (such as type I, MSH (melano\u00ad cyte-stimulating androgens and melano\u00ad cyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) ; growth factors as epidermal growth factors (EGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM- CSF), transforming growth factors (TGF), such as TGFa, TGFp, insulin and insulin growth factors (FGFs); smaller molecular weight proteins, poly-peptide, peptide as leukemia and such as J. Biol. Chem. 932-937 (1985)]; proteins or lipoproteins, such as lectins; cell nutrient-transport molecules; and small molecular inhibitors, such as pro state-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) inhibitors and small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors 24 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/151081 PCT/IB2015/055264 (TKI), non-peptides or any other cell binding molecule or substance, such as bioactive polymers (Dhar, et ACS Nano, 2008, 19, 1309-12; Medarova, et al, Nat. Med. 2007, 13, 372-7; Javier, et al, Bioconjugate Chem. 2008, 19, 1309-12); liposomes (Medinai, et Des. capsides (Flenniken, et al, Viruses Nanotechnol. 2009, 327, 71-93). In general, a monoclonal antibody is preferred as a cell-surface binding agent if an ap\u00ad propriate one is available. And the antibody may be murine, human, humanized, chimeric, or derived from other species. Production of antibodies used in the present invention involves in vivo or in vitro pro\u00ad cedures or combinations thereof. Methods for producing polyclonal anti-receptor peptide antibodies are well-known in the art, such as in U.S. Pat. No. 4,493,795 (to Nestor et al). A monoclonal antibody is typically made by fusing myeloma cells with the spleen cells from a mouse that has been immunized with the desired antigen (Kohler, G.; Milstein, C. (1975). Nature 256: 495-497). The detailed procedures are described in \"Antibodies \u2014A Laboratory Manual \", Harlow and Lane, eds., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York (1988), which is incorporated herein by reference. Particularly monoclonal antibodies are produced by immunizing mice, rats, hamsters or any other mammal with the antigen of interest such as the intact target cell, antigens isolated from the target cell, whole vims, attenuated whole vims, and viral proteins. Splenocytes are typically fused with myeloma cells using polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000. Fused hybrids are selected by their sensitivity to HAT (hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymine). Hybridomas producing a monoclonal anti\u00ad body useful in practicing this invention are identified by their ability to immunoreact specified receptors or inhibit receptor activity on target cells. A monoclonal antibody used in the present invention can be produced by initiating a monoclonal hybridoma culture comprising a nutrient medium containing a hybridoma that secretes antibody molecules of the appropriate antigen specificity. The culture is main \u00ad tained under conditions and for a time period sufficient for the hybridoma to secrete the antibody molecules into the medium. The antibody-containing medium is then collected. The antibody molecules can then be further isolated by well-known techniques, such as using protein-A affinity chromatography; anion, cation, hydrophobic, or size exclusive chromatographies (particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after protein A, and 25 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/151081 PCT/IB2015/055264 sizing column chromatography); centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. Media useful for the preparation of these compositions are both well-known in the art and commercially available and include synthetic culture media. An exemplary synthetic medium is Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM; Dulbecco et ah, Virol. 8, 396 (1959)) supplemented with gm/1 glucose, 0-20 mM glutamine, 0-20% fetal calf serum, several ppm amount of heavy metals, such as Cu, Mn, Fe, or Zn, etc, or/and the heavy metals added in their salt forms, and with an anti-foaming agent, such as polyoxyethylene- polyoxypropylene block copolymer. In addition, antibody-producing cell lines can also be created by techniques other than fusion, such as direct transformation of B lymphocytes with oncogenic DNA, or transfec \u00ad tion with an such Epstein-Barr (HHV-4)) be produced via an anti-receptor peptide or peptides containing the carboxyl terminal as described well-known in the art. See Niman peptide analog is used either alone or conjugated to an immunogenic carrier, as the immunogen for producing anti-receptor peptide monoclonal antibodies. There are also a number of other well-known techniques for making monoclonal anti\u00ad bodies as binding molecules in this invention. Particularly useful are methods of making fully human antibodies. One method is phage display technology which can be used to select a range of human antibodies binding specifically to the antigen using methods of affinity enrichment. Phage display has been thoroughly described in the literature and the construction and screening of phage display libraries are well known in the art, see, e.g., Dente et al, Gene. 148(1):7-13 (1994); Little et Science 246:1275-1281 (1989). Monoclonal antibodies derived by hybridoma technique from another species than human, such as mouse, can be humanized to avoid human anti-mouse antibodies when infused into humans. Among the more common methods of humanization of antibodies are complementarity-determining region grafting and resurfacing. These methods have been extensively described, see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,859,205 and 6,797,492; Liu et al, 26 5 10 15 25 30WO 2015/151081 PCT/IB2015/055264 Natl. USA. 1 0 3 ( 1 0 ) : 3 5 5 7 - 6 2 ( 2 0 0 6 ) e a c h i n c o r p o r a t e d h e r e i n b y r e f e r e n c e . F u l l y h u m a n a n t i b o d i e s can also be prepared by immunizing transgenic mice, rabbits, monkeys, or other mam \u00ad mals, carrying large portions of the human immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, with an immunogen. Examples of such mice are: the Xenomouse. (Abgenix/Amgen), the HuMAb-Mouse (Medarex/BMS), therapy, murine variable re\u00ad gions and human constant regions can also be fused to construct called \"chimeric antibod\u00ad ies\" that are considerably less immunogenic In addition, site-directed mutagenesis in the varia\u00ad ble region of an antibody can result in an antibody with higher affinity and specificity for its antigen (Brannigan et al, Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 3:964-70, (2002)); Adams et al, J Immunol Methods. 231:249-60 (1999)) and exchanging constant regions of a mAb can improve its ability to mediate effector functions of binding and cytotoxicity. Antibodies immuno specific for a malignant cell antigen can also be obtained commer \u00ad cially or produced by any method known to one of skill in the art such as, e.g., chemical synthesis or recombinant expression techniques. The nucleotide sequence encoding anti\u00ad bodies immuno specific for a malignant cell antigen can be obtained commercially, e.g., from the GenBank database or a database like it, the literature publications, or by routine cloning and sequencing. Apart from an antibody, a peptide or protein that bind/block/target or in some other way interact with the epitopes or corresponding receptors on a targeted cell can be used as a binding molecule. These peptides or proteins could be any random peptide or proteins that have an affinity for the epitopes or corresponding receptors and they don't necessarily have to be of the immunoglobulin family. These peptides can be isolated by similar tech\u00ad niques as for phage display antibodies (Szardenings, J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2003; 23(4):307-49). The use of peptides from such random peptide libraries can be similar to antibodies and antibody fragments. The binding molecules of peptides or proteins may be conjugated on or linked to a large molecules or materials, such as, but is not limited, an albumin, a polymer, a liposome, a nano particle, a dendrimer, as long as such attachment permits the peptide or protein to retain its antigen binding specificity. 27 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/151081 PCT/IB2015/055264 Examples of antibodies used for conjugation of drugs via the bridge linkers of this prevention for treating cancer, autoimmune disease, and/or infectious disease include, but are not limited to, 3F8 (anti-GD2), Abagovomab Inst, for melanoma and solid tumors), J591 (anti-PSMA, Weill Cornell Medical School for prostate cancers), 225.28S [anti-HMW-MAA (High molecular weight-melanoma- associated Cancer colorectal and gastric cancers), CYT- 356 (Oncoltad\u00ae, for prostate cancers), HNK20 (OraVax Inc. for syncytial ImmuRAIT (from MEDI-500 [T10B9, anti-CD3, TRaP (T receptor alpha/beta), complex, MedImmune Inc for Graft-versus-host disease], RING SCAN [ anti-TAG 72 (tumour associated glycoprotein 72), from Neoprobe Corp. for Breast, Colon and Rectal Avicidin (anti-EPCAM cell signal transducer I), Colon, Ovarian, Prostate cancers and NHL]; LymphoCide (Immunomedics, NJ), Smart IDlO (Protein Systems, NJ) and Cetuximab (ImClone, NJ) .

According to a further object, the present invention also concerns pharmaceutical compositions comprising the conjugate via the bridge linkers of the invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient for treatment of cancers, infec \u00ad tions or autoimmune disorders. The method for treatment of cancers, infections and auto\u00ad immune disorders can be practiced in vitro , in vivo , or ex vivo. Examples of in vitro uses include treatments of cell cultures in order to kill all cells except for desired variants that do not express the target antigen; or to kill variants that express undesired antigen. Exam \u00ad ples of ex vivo uses include treatments of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) prior to the performance of the transplantation (HSCT) into the same patient in order to kill diseased or malignant cells. For instance, clinical ex vivo treatment to remove tumour cells or lym\u00ad phoid cells from bone marrow prior to autologous transplantation in cancer treatment or in treatment of autoimmune disease, or to remove T cells and other lymphoid cells from allogeneic bone marrow or tissue prior to transplant in order to prevent graft-versus-host disease, can be carried out as follows. Bone marrow is harvested from the patient or other individual and then incubated in medium containing serum to which is added the conjugate of the invention, concentrations range from about I pM to 0.1 mM, for about 30 minutes to about 48 hours at about 37 \u00b0C. The exact conditions of concentration and time of incuba\u00ad tion (=dose) are readily determined by the skilled clinicians. After incubation, the bone marrow cells are washed with medium containing serum and returned to the patient by i.v. infusion according to known methods. In circumstances where the patient receives other treatment such as a course of ablative chemotherapy or total-body irradiation between the time of harvest of the marrow and reinfusion of the treated cells, the treated marrow cells are stored frozen in liquid nitrogen using standard medical equipment. For clinical in vivo use, the conjugate via the linkers of the invention will be supplied as solutions or as a lyophilized solid that can be redissolved in sterile water for injection. Examples of suitable protocols of conjugate administration are as follows. Conjugates are given weekly for 8-20 weeks as an i.v. bolus. Bolus doses are given in 50 to 500 ml of normal saline to which human serum albumin (e.g. 0.5 to 5 mL of a concentrated solution of human serum albumin, 100 mg/mL) can be added. Dosages will be about 50 pg to 100 mg/kg of body weight per week, i.v. (range of 10 pg to 50 mg/kg per injection). 4-20 weeks after treatment, the patient may receive a second course of treatment. Specific 44 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/151081 PCT/IB2015/055264 clinical protocols with regard to route of administration, excipients, diluents, dosages, times, etc., can be determined by the skilled clinicians. Examples of medical conditions that can be treated according to the in vivo or ex vivo methods of killing selected cell populations include malignancy of any types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, graft rejections, and infections (viral, bacterial or parasite). The amount of a conjugate which is required to achieve the desired biological effect, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the chemical characteristics, the potency, and the bioavailability of the conjugates, the type of disease, the species to which the patient belongs, the diseased state of the patient, the route of administration, all factors which dictate the required dose amounts, delivery and regimen to be administered. In general terms, the conjugates via the linkers of this invention may be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing 0.1 to 10% w/v conjugates for paren \u00ad teral administration. Typical dose ranges are from I Eg/kg to 0.1 g/kg of body weight per day; a preferred dose range is from 0.01 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg of body weight per day, or per week, or an equivalent dose in a human child. The preferred dosage of drug to be adminis\u00ad tered is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, the formulation of the compound, the route of admin\u00ad istration (intravenous, intramuscular, or other), the pharmacokinetic properties of the conjugates by the chosen delivery route, and the speed (bolus or continuous infusion) and schedule of administrations (number of repetitions in a given period of time). The conjugates via the linkers of the present invention are also capable of being ad\u00ad ministered in unit dose forms, wherein the term \"unit dose \" means a single dose which is capable of being administered to a patient, and which can be readily handled and packaged, remaining as a physically and chemically stable unit dose comprising either the active conjugate itself, or as a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, as described hereinafter. As such, typical total daily/weekly/biweekly/monthly dose ranges are from 0.01 to 100 mg/kg of body weight. By way of general guidance, unit doses for humans range from I mg to 3000 mg per day, or per week, per two week or per month. Preferably the unit dose range is from I to 500 mg administered one to four times a week, and even more prefera \u00ad bly from I mg to 100 mg, once a week. Conjugates provided herein can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions by admixture with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Such unit dose compositions may be prepared for use by oral administration, particularly in the form of tablets, simple capsules or soft gel capsules; or intranasal, 45 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/151081 PCT/IB2015/055264 particularly in the form of powders, nasal drops, or aerosols; or dermally, for example, topically in ointments, creams, lotions, gels or sprays, or via trans-dermal patches.
