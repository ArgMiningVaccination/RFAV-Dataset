Even the descriptions used -phytotherapy, herbal medicine, herbalism,traditional and natural medicines - are confusing, meaning different things to differentpeople. Herbal reference books may add to thisconfusion by including natural products such asvitamins, minerals and diet supplements, which areessentially foods, but can be therapeutic in some casesof deficiencies and disease. Herbal medicines containsubstances of plant origin where all or part of the plantis used to produce an infusion, medicine, tablet orapplication. Herbal pharmacopoeias may includehundreds of remedies, from aloe vera, through garlic,ginkgo biloba and ginseng to ziziphus jujuba. A significant number of plants and herbs originally provided natural sources for extremely valuable drugsthat have now been identified, purified, evaluated forrisk/benefit and eventually Theseinclude quinine (cinchona bark) andantibiotics such as penicillin. Definitions Herbal remedies can conveniently be described as over-the-counter products, not subject to closeregulation and obtainable from pharmacies and healthfood stores without specific diagnosis or prescriptionfrom a health professional. Around five million peoplein the UK use these products regularly. Herbalism (herbal medicine) as an alternative medical therapy is defined as the use of plants orsubstances derived from them, in treating disease,usually by medical herbalists without an orthodoxmedical qualification. Before the relatively recentapplication of scientific method into diagnosis andtherapeutics, traditional medicines were mostly herbal. More than 1,500 herbalists practise in theUK at present. Origins From the earliest times, whether by accident, through inspiration or in desperation, plants have notonly provided food, cosmetics and embalmingointments, but also a plethora of easily availableremedies for the maladies of mankind. The use oftreatments based on plants developed across theworld, usually with strong religious associations. T raditional Chinese Herbal Medicine is based on T aoism and the principle of balancing chi, theuniversal life force or energy; Ayurvedic Indianmedicine has strong Hindu associations involvingchakras (energy medicine had closely interrelatedherbal medicine and religious traditions. Englishherbal medicine, certainly when practised byCulpeper, the modem pioneer of Western herbalism,had strong astrological connections. Archaeological findings of medicinal plants have been found in ancient Iraqi burial sites but the firstwritten pharmacopoeia occurs in the Egyptian Ebers Papyrus c 1500 BC. The Indian Vedas (poems also c 1500 BC) listed plants with medicinal actions. 2 Although the early use of herbal preparations was often associated with the mystical and magical,Hippocrates (460-377 BC) appears to haveattempted a more scientific approach. Galen (130-200 AD), physician to the Emperor Aurelius,recommended herbal preparations to balance thefour humours of the body. 12 TRIPLE HELIX IIAUTUMN 04review George Smith continues his series on complementary and alternative medicines KEY POINTS Herbal medicines contain substances of plant origin and in generalare available as over-the-counter products, notsubject to close regulation.Whilst many valuable drugshave been identified,purified, evaluated forrisk/benefit and eventuallysynthesised from plants, theeffectiveness of most herbalmedicines is still unprovenand concerns about toxicityand drug interactions arereal. In addition the historyof the origins and presentpractices of the manyvarieties of herbal medicineindicate that they are rootedin and still associated withnon-Christian belief systems.Christian doctors should becautious herbs bothfrom a Christian andmedical perspective.Herbs in MedicinePhoto: PAreview A Doctrine of Signatures evolved which suggested that the medicinal value of certain herbs was divinelysignalled by their resemblance to the conditions ororgans they treated. Pilewort was used because itsknobbly tubers Similarly,the spotted pattern of Pulmonaria was suggestive oflung tissue and so was used for respiratory problems. 3 The popularity of herbalists and herbal medicines continued to wax and wane in conflict with orthodoxmedicine. Nicholas Culpeper (1616-1654), describedas an astrologer/physician, rebelled against thehorrific medical practices of his day such as purgingand blood letting. He fought for the acceptance ofnatural herbal medicines but emphasised astrologicalinfluences that he believed controlled them. 4 Culpeper produced his first pharmacopoeia or Herbal in 1652. The National Institute of MedicalHerbalists (NIMH) was formed in 1864, an attemptto regulate British herbalists and their medicines. Over the next 150 years scientific research and development moved rapidly, leading to more exactknowledge of therapeutics and evidence basedmedicine. There are now university courses inphytotherapy, leading to a BSc in herbal medicine.Yet there is still a wide gap between herbalism andorthodox therapeutics. Medical checklist Does it work? This is extremely difficult to assess. Whilst many active chemical constituents can be identified,standardisation of unrefined medicines from plants iscomplicated, making scientific evaluation and clinicaltrials difficult. Little reliable scientific informationexists although reference books are available to adviseon efficacy and safety. The powerful placebo effectmust always be considered. There have been attempts to perform scientific investigations into some popular herbal products. TheDesktop Guide to Complementary and Alternative Medicinereviewed investigations into 44 such products but didnot find any convincing evidence of efficacy. Forexample, the popular evening primrose oil '...has notbeen established as an efficacious treatment for anycondition'. 5There is little evidence of significant benefit from echinacea.6Another 60 medicinal herbs are listed where there is insufficient evidence to makeuseful assessments. Recent investigation by theNational Cancer Institute showed no evidence tosupport the suggested beneficial effect of viscum alba(mistletoe) for cancer. 7 Is it safe? It is commonly believed that all herbal medicines and natural substances used as remedies mustinherently be safe. Brief references, however, as to thetoxicity of some plants (for example, DeadlyNightshade, certain fungi and berries) show this to bea fallacy. Interactions with other drugs can also beharmful: 78 herbal products may react with heartmedication, 58 with anti-coagulants, 35 with diabeticmedication and 9 with oral contraceptives. Someproducts interfere with the accuracy of diagnostic tests and 64 drugs and food supplements requiretherapeutic monitoring, generally unavailable to non-medically qualified herbalists. 8 A recent article in the British Journal of General Practice emphasised these safety concerns, particularly in relation to reactions between anticoagulants andherbal preparations. 9Whilst there is some evidence that St John's Wort (hypericum) is reasonably effectivein mild to moderate depression, there are increasingconcerns about its safety, particularly in UK, Japan andCanada. It has now been banned in France. 10 The results of a five-year survey by the Medical T oxicology Unit at Guy's & St Thomas' Hospitalshighlighted possible links between many herbalproducts and adverse reactions. Earlier this year theWorld Health Organisation issued a warning againstthe unregulated and often unsafe use of alternativemedicines including herbal medicines and foodsupplements. 11 Christian checklist Can it be recommended with integrity? So far, investigation into the vast majority of these products has produced little evidence for their efficacybut has raised many safety concerns. What are its roots? History of the origins and present practices of the many varieties of herbal medicine indicate that theyare rooted in and still associated with non-Christianbelief systems. Are there spiritual dangers? Belief in the healing properties of plants, part of God's creation, is naturally attractive to Christians butwe must not ignore experience and reason. Ascientifically evaluated active ingredient of a plant issurely safer than the unrefined original preparation. Whilst plants in themselves have no specific spiritual influence, the religious beliefs of thepractitioner (particularly T raditional ChineseMedicine, Ayurvedic Medicine and New Agetherapists) can be spiritually harmful. Biblical references to herbs and spices almost exclusively relate to their use in food preparation,anointing and embalming rather than their healingproperties. Conclusion Although many herbal preparations contain therapeutically active ingredients, these are toovariable to be used with confidence, and harmfulside effects are well documented. From a medicalstandpoint, the use of herbal medicine does not, ingeneral, reach the high standards of clinicalexcellence now required. From a Christianperspective, the roots of the therapy and thetherapist's belief system also raise serious concerns.
