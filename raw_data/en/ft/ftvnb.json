[SHUTTERSTOCK/PEAKSTOCK] EURACTIV is part of the Trust Project >>> Print Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram This article is part of our special report Life with SMA: challenges and solutions.An early diagnosis of a rare disorder can be a matter of survival for babies as starting a treatment at the right time can considerably transform the progress of the disease. But unequal access to screening at birth persists across Europe. Screening newborns allows the detection of rare diseases right after birth, in order to start treatment as early as possible if needed. If the disease is discovered years later, it may be more difficult or even too late to treat the patient. \"Newborn screening enables us to avoid the diagnostic odyssey, the delays of diagnosis after the apparition of irreversible clinical manifestations, the misdiagnosed and the inadequate treatments\", Yann Le Cam, chief executive officer of the European Organisation for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS), told EURACTIV. With 30 million Europeans living with one rare disease or other, screening remains the best way to detect these diseases as soon as possible and offer treatment to the patient. \"When one of these new medicines is targeted for a disease which appears in newborns, infants or children, and has the potential to prevent the apparition of the first clinical manifestations, the symptoms and its first impairments, newborn screening becomes vital,\" Le Cam explained. An international neonatal screening day was launched in 2021 and will be held every year on 28 June to promote the importance of screening programmes for newborns. However, access to screening, and more particularly to newborn screening, strongly varies from one country to another in Europe. Push to revamp rare disease EU framework intensifies before Czech presidency Improving screening tools and strengthening the incentive system for orphan drugs are among the main suggestions for overhauling the European legislation on rare diseases, a topic included in the health priorities of the forthcoming Czech presidency of the EU. 'Huge' inequalities For Le Cam, inequalities across Europe are \"huge\" while access to screening should be \"immediate in all countries\" to prevent newborns with a rare disease from a \"life of physical, psychological and social suffering\". A recent study conducted and published in 2021 by EURORDIS found a variation ranging from two diseases being screened in some countries to 50 diseases in others. One of the rare diseases that could be detected at birth is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). In Norway, Germany, and the Netherlands, this genetic condition is systematically screened in newborns. \"The most advanced countries today are Italy and the Netherlands, which are screening over 40 diseases and are planning to scale up. Slovenia is also planning to reach over 40 diseases in 2022,\" Le Cam said. On the other hand, countries screening only a few diseases are progressively increasing, like Czechia or Sweden, while others are revisiting their strategies, such as Germany and France, with the latter screening only six diseases. Many countries are launching pilot projects but neo-natal screening remains expensive and time-consuming. To encourage member states to set up national newborn screening programmes in maternities and hospitals, Eurordisis published a list of recommendations in February 2021. \"The cost-effectiveness of newborn screening should be calculated and set against the costs of the diagnostic odyssey and costs to the health and social systems in the absence of an accurate diagnosis,\" the report said. EU cooperation key for rare diseases research, accessible treatment, says expert France is \"ahead of the curve\" when it comes to treating rare diseases, but with 36 million Europeans affected, cooperation at the EU level to advance research and make treatments more accessible is essential, an expert warned. EURACTIV France reports. Call to Action In April 2020, 30 EU lawmakers signed the \"Call to Action - Newborn Screening for Rare Diseases\" addressed to the European Commission, together with the International Patient Organisation for Primary Immunodeficiencies (IPOPI), the International Society for Neonatal Screening (ISNS), and the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID). \"The EU's added value in the field of rare diseases is well known. From the European Reference Networks (ERNs) to the EU research funding programmes, positive strides have been taken on health-related matters\", their statement said. The ERNs is an EU-wide cooperation project that helps share knowledge and expertise in the bloc. A report on rare paediatric neurological diseases published in February said that ERNs are \"a major step in the right direction\" but added that \"aspects of their work still need improvement.\" On 1 January 2022, 620 new members joined the Network, \"increasing both the geographical scope and the diseases covered to now more than 1,400 specialised centres across all member states\", Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides told a ministerial conference organised by the French EU Council presidency at the end of February. The MEPs and the NGOs wrote in their 2020 call that \"extrapolating best practices from the member states has also played a crucial role and it is undoubtedly clear that this extrapolation has improved the lives of rare disease patients\", But for them, \"it is evident, however, that the EU cooperation on Newborn Screening for Rare Diseases (NBS for RD) is still an underdeveloped area.\" The proponents of the call urged the Commission to help member states in preparing their national healthcare systems for implementing NBS for specific rare conditions. Signatories also called for the creation of an EU-wide platform on newborn screening for rare diseases to make it easier to share data on rare diseases between countries, Yann Le Cam said for his part that the Commission should \"go faster\" by including a \"joint action on newborn screening in its EU4Health 2023 work programme\". In reply to a parliamentary question on the matter, Commissioner Kyriakides said specific actions related to newborn screening may be addressed by the annual EU4Health work programmes and be adopted by means of implementing acts. EU calls for stronger cooperation to fight rare diseases Marking the World Rare Disease Day, Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides and health ministers called for stronger coordination around rare diseases with high hopes on European Reference Networks (ERNs).
