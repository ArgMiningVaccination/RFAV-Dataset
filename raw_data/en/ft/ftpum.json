Is there an exclusion policy that covers this? What is difficult about this case? Curriculum for Managing Infectious Diseases- Module 1 Daily Health Check Routine of greeting parents/children every day Form of communication between parents and caregiver/teacher May enable caregivers/teachers to identify illness while parents are still present Module 3 17Curriculum for Managing Infectious Diseases- Module 1 What to Do When Kids Get Sick After the Daily Health Check?
