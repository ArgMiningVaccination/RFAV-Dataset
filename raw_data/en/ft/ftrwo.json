Extensive training in these fields has provided her with much insight and practical knowledge to go along with multiple domestic and international certifications. Regarding her training, she has commented, \"I am infinitely grateful for the remarkable mentors and beloved teachers who, over the past forty plus years, have helped me to recognize and incorporate into my practice the natural laws of nature, always reminding me that what we eat, breathe, touch and think is all vitally and equally important to our health. COAH utilizes the ancient as well as the more current and advanced methods of healing, working almost entirely with clients dealing with chronic illnesses of all types, from cancer to diabetes and much more. We do not work with traditional dietary therapies or medical treatments. Our holistic pathway is \"alternative\" in its perspective and multi-layered in its approach. A key intention here at COAH is to empower people to \"be their own healer\" so they can consciously work in tandem with their chosen practitioners. For those suffering with illness and who need a \"jump start\" toward improved health, we offer daytime appointments as well as 4-day and 5-day live-in stay here at COAH. We provide a peaceful, safe, non-toxic, feng shui space to learn, rest and heal.
