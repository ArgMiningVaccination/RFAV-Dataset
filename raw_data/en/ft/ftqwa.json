Montross-Thomas, PhD,1-3Emily MD3,5 Abstract Objectives: Research demonstrates the benets of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in myriad environments. Yet, the majority of CAM services are offered in outpatient settings. Incorporating CAM intohospital settings may lead to increased patient comfort, well-being, and overall satisfaction with hospital ad-missions. Few studies have examined CAM services among inpatients. Therefore, this study assessed inpatients'preferences and beliefs regarding CAM, as well as their stated willingness to pay for these services. Design: Adult patients ( n=100), ranging in age from 19-95 years ( M=53 years; SD=19.2 years), were recruited during their hospitalization in the University of Californi a, San Diego, Healthcare System. The inpatients completed a brief individual interview to gather their perspectives on common CAM services, including acupuncture, aroma-therapy, art therapy, guided imagery, healthy food, humor th erapy, massage therapy, music therapy, pet therapy, Reiki, and stress management. Inpatients were asked which CAM therapies they perceived as being potentially the mosthelpful, their willingness to pay for those therapies, and thei r perceived beliefs regarding the use of those therapies. Results: Inpatients most commonly perceived healthy food (85%), massage therapy (82%), and humor therapy (70%) to be the most helpful, and were most willing to pay for healthy food (71%), massage therapy (70%), and stress management (48%). Inpatients most commonly believed CAM treatments would provide relaxation (88%), increase well-being (86%), and increase their overall satisfaction with the hospitalization (85%). Conclusions: This study suggests that CAM services may be a benecial addition to hospitals, as demon- strated by inpatients' interest and stated willingness to pay for these services. These ndings may help orga-nizational leaders when making choices regarding the development of CAM services within hospitals,particularly since a signicant percentage of inpatients reported that CAM services would increase their overallsatisfaction with the hospitalization. These results merit further attention given the need to increase cost savingswhile enhancing the overall patient experience in today's medical marketplace. Keywords: complementary and alternative medicine, inpatients, holistic care, integrative medicine, patient satisfaction, patient preferences Introduction Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to care that is patient-centered and healing-oriented using therapeutic approaches that have not historically been apart of conventional Western medicine.1CAM treatments provide a holistic approach to healing, with an emphasis on addressingindividualized needs. These treatments can often be provided at a lower cost, with less negative side effects, with the ultimate aims of relieving pain and improving patients' quality of life.2,3 1Department of Psychiatry;2Moores Cancer Center, Psychiatry and Psychosocial Services, Patient and Family Support Services; 3Department of Family Medicine and Public Health;5Center for Integrative Medicine; University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA. 4True Wellness Acupuncture, San Diego, CA.THE JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE Volume 23, Number 2017, pp. 259-263 259 Downloaded by Ucsd Libraries University of California San Diego from www.liebertpub.com at 12/06/18. For personal use only. Food/nutrition, supplements, yoga, meditation, Traditional Chinese Medicine/acupuncture, and massage are some of the most widely used CAM therapies in the United States.4 Currently, 63% of individuals self-refer for CAM services inthe medical setting and primarily receive services in an out- patient setting for preventive care and treatment of chronic ailments.5Many outpatient services such as acupuncture, massage therapy, meditation classes, and mind-body thera- pies are most often paid for by patients themselves rather than from insurance.4The demonstrated health benets of outpa- tient CAM services, coupled with patients' interest in paying for those services, has increased national attention regarding the successful provision of CAM in hospital settings.5 Approximately 52% of the 29 large primary-care centers afliated with a hospital, healthcare system, medical, and/or nursing school sampled in the 2012 Bravewell report offered inpatient CAM services.4When available, common com- plementary and alternative treatment offerings for patients while they are in the hospital include: acupressure, aroma- therapy, biofeedback, expressive arts, guided imagery,massage therapy, mind-body therapies, mindfulness ther- apy, music therapy, pet therapy, relaxation therapy, and Reiki/therapeutic touch.4,5Hospitals often rely on patient demand, evidence of efcacy, and practitioner availability when choosing what services to implement and must rely on out-of-pocket payment or philanthropic funds to supportCAM services in the hospital.5 A small but growing body of literature suggests there are signicant health benets, such as reductions in anxiety, dis- tress, fatigue, nausea, and pain when patients are given theopportunity to receive CAM services during their hospital stay.6-9St. John's Riverside Hospital in New York reported that when inpatients ( n=122) were offered CAM therapies, the inpatients experienced decreased anxiety (40%), reduced pain (34%), and improved sleep (34%). The inpatients additionally reported nding new ways to cope with their illness (31%).10 In regards to pain management, the Penny George In- stitute for Health and Healing in Minnesota reported a 55% reduction in self-reported pain among inpatients ( n=1837) receiving CAM services. The majority of these patients hadnever received complementary and alternative services prior to admission (66%). The inpatients receiving therapies also had a shorter length of stay in the hospital (average of3.99 days vs. 4.41 days for all patients at the hospital), although this nding was not statistically signicant. 11 Furthermore, studies demonstrate signicant cost savings related to complementary and alternative therapies, partic- the Beth Israel (NewYork) inpatient medical oncology unit. This study found theaverage medication cost was reduced from $889 per inpa- tient for a 3-day stay to $420 per inpatient (47% reduction in the mean cost of medication), with the most dramatic de-creases found in anti-anxiety and anti-nausea medications. 12 These studies show promise for the ability of CAM servicesto not only minimize inpatients' anxiety and pain, but also toreduce their medication costs. Although the benets of providing CAM services to in- patients are increasingly evident, it can be difcult to beginoffering such services in hospital settings. Common barriers include prohibitory hospital regulations or policies, a lack of understanding about CAM among practitioners or adminis-trators, and a lack of current insurance reimbursement for such services. 2Furthermore, there appears to be a lack of knowledge regarding inpatients' preferences for CAM ser-vices, and no study to date has specically examined inpa-tients' preferences for these services. Are inpatients interested in receiving these services during their hospital stay? If so, how do they believe these services would be helpful, andwould they be willing to pay for these services themselves if necessary? The current study aims to address these questions, thereby increasing the understanding of inpatients' perspec-tives regarding CAM services, and striving to improve the overall landscape of inpatient care and satisfaction. Materials and Methods Participants Participants were recruited from the University of Cali- fornia, San Diego, Healthcare System, Family Medicine In- patient Service, between November 2013 and August 2014. Inclusion criteria were purposely broad so as to gather a widearray of inpatient preferences: being aged 18 years old, cur- rently hospitalized as an inpatient, and the ability to conduct an individualized interview in English. Potential study partici-pants were excluded if there was a current diagnosis of severe dementia, delirium, or other cognitive impairments. The re- search design, participant recruitment plan, as well as all otherfacets of the study were reviewed and approved by the HumanResearch Protections Program and Institutional Review Board at the University of California, San Diego. Procedure This cross-sectional study utilized a researcher-derived individual interview to learn about the inpatients' prefer- ences for CAM services. The interview also examined pa-tients' perspectives on how those services could be helpful and whether they would be willing to pay for those services if they were offered in the hospital. Inpatients were in-formed that these services were not currently offered in theUniversity of California, San Diego, hospital, but that the aim of the study was to learn more about what services, if offered, would be valued by inpatients. During each interview, the researcher described 11 commonly provided complementary and alternative ser- vices: acupuncture, aromatherapy, art therapy, guided im-agery, healthy food, humor therapy, massage therapy, music therapy, pet therapy, Reiki, and stress management. 4The CAM services described in this study were suggested bystakeholders and practitioners during an inpatient needs assessment that was conducted in September 2013 at the University of California, San Diego. Because patients hadvarying levels of familiarity with each of these services, abrief standardized denition (derived by our interdisciplinary team) and list of services was provided (see Table 1 for a list of the treatment descriptions used). As each service was de-scribed, the inpatients were asked, ''Do you think [these services] would be helpful to you during your hospital stay?'' (yes or no). If yes, the inpatient was asked, ''Would you bewilling to pay for these services yourself?'' (yes or no). In- patients were also asked to state whether they believed each service could: (1) help them relax, (2) help them recovermore quickly, (3) help them cope with being in hospital,260 MONTROSS-THOMAS ET AL.

(4) decrease their pain, (5) decrease emotional difculties, (6) increase their sense of well-being, and (7) increase theiroverall satisfaction with the hospitalization (yes or no). Each interview, lasting an average of 30 min, was conducted at the bedside of the inpatient and was administered by the researchteam of trained health professionals. Results A total of 100 inpatients participated in the study (please see Table 2 for detailed inpatient demographics). The inpatients ranged from 19 to 95 years of age ( M=53 years; SD=19.2 years). The majority (77%) of inpatients were admitted to thehospital through the emerge ncy room, whereas 19% were admitted as part of a planned visit. The average length of hospital stay was 6 days ( SD=10.0 days; range 1-86 days). Descriptive statistics were completed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows v21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). In- patients most commonly reported that healthy food (85%),massage therapy (82%), and humor therapy (70%) would be helpful during their hospital stay. Additionally, inpatients in- dicated they would be most willing to pay for healthy food(71%), massage therapy (70%), and stress management(48%). Figure 1 lists the percentage of inpatients' who stated the complementary and alternative treatments or services would be helpful, and the percentage of inpatients who statedthey would be willing to pay for these services. Figure 2 presents the ways in which inpatients believed CAM services would be of benet, with the majority ofpatients indicating that complementary and alternative ser- vices could help them relax (88%), increase their well-being (86%), and increase their overall satisfaction with the hos-pitalization (85%).Discussion Summary To the authors' knowledge, this is the only study to date that has examined inpatients' preferences, beliefs, andwillingness to pay for CAM services. The ndings suggestTable 1.Denitions of the Complementary and Alternative Medicine Services, as Described to the Inpatients in This Study ( n=100) Acupuncture Acupuncture involves the insertion of extremely thin needles through your skin at certain points on your body to relieve pain and promote calmness. Aromatherapy Aromatherapy uses naturally extracted aromatic essences from plants to promote the health of body, mind, and spirit. Art therapy Art therapy encourages painting or drawing to reduce stress. Guided imagery Guided imagery uses your imagination to visualize a relaxed, focused state of mind. Healthy food Healthy food uses the natural healing power of food to rejuvenate and protect the body from disease. Humor therapy Humor therapy is the use of humor for the relief of physical or emotional pain and stress. Massage therapy Massage involves pressing, rubbing, and manipulating your skin and muscles to reduce pain or stress. Music therapy Music therapy is the use of recorded or live music (such as piano therapy and harp therapy) to increase well-being. Pet therapy Pet therapy uses dogs or other animals to help soothe people and help them better cope with health problems. Reiki or healing touch Reiki is a no-touch form of massage that uses energy visualization to target and reduce areas of pain or stress in the body. Healing touch is similar but does involve gently touching the skin. Stress management Health professionals talk to you about your stress and help create a plan for how to reduce stress while in the hospital and once you return home.

For personal use only. that inpatients are interested in CAM services as part of their hospital stay and believe these services would be of benet. Specically, inpatients reported the highest preferences for the incorporation of healthy foods, massage therapy, andhumor therapy. Inpatients most commonly indicated that CAM services could help them relax, increase their well- being, and improve their recovery. Inpatients also viewedCAM services as being able to help them cope with their hospitalization, and felt that they could increase their overall satisfaction with the hospitalization. All of these self-reported inpatient beliefs suggest a strong interest in CAM services being provided within hospitals. While many of the inpatients in this study indicated an interest in CAM services, health literacy may play an im-portant role when assessing interest or implementation of complementary and alternative services among inpatients. Inadequate health literacy affects 36% of Americans and ismore prevalent among minority groups. 13A recent study examining CAM usage among inpatients found that those with a higher health literacy utilized services more oftenthan those with a lower health literacy.14Therefore, in order for CAM services to be of benet and utilized in hospitals, itis important that inpatients are educated regarding CAM treatments and that the modalities are tailored and designed for those who may have a lower health literacy in order to ensure successful implementation of services. A signicant number of inpatients reported that having a CAM service would increase their overall satisfaction with the hospitalization experience. Given the growing need forhospital systems to improve inpatient satisfaction for a range of reasons, including shorter hospital stays, increased cost savings, fewer potential lawsuits, and enhanced compe-tiveness in the medical system marketplace, this nding merits further study. 15,16 Limitations Although benecial to hear about inpatients' preferences and beliefs regarding CAM services, there were several lim- itations when interpreting the results of this study. First, this study utilized a convenience sample of inpatients in onesouthern California hospital, and the relevance of these ndings in other geographic regions is unclear. Also, although inpatients reported they would be willing to pay for services, FIG. 1. Helpfulness of comple- mentary and alternative medicine services and willingness to pay for services, as reported by inpatients(n=100). FIG. 2. Ways in which inpatients believe complementary and alter-native medicine services are bene-cial ( n=100).262 MONTROSS-THOMAS ET AL. Downloaded by Ucsd Libraries University of California San Diego from www.liebertpub.com at 12/06/18. For personal use only. the services were not currently being offered in the hospital. Thus, it is unclear if the inpatients would actually submit payment when called upon for services, and whether it wouldbe feasible to charge a separate fee for CAM services while inthe hospital. Additionally, it is unclear how much the inpa- tients would be willing to pay for each service, as a dollar amount regarding the price of the services was not indicatedwhen the services were described to inpatients in the study. Conclusions There is a dearth of literature currently available regarding inpatients' preferences for CAM and the successful im- plementation of those services. While various studies have examined the effects of CAM therapies on specic symptomssuch as anxiety, nausea, pain, and relaxation,6-9,17to the authors' knowledge, no studies have examined inpatients' beliefs and preferences for CAM services and their related patient satisfaction. Furthermore, while inpatients in thepresent study expressed that CAM services may lead to im- provement in their overall satisfaction with hospitalization, little to no research has been able to determine a causal re-lationship between service provision and improved patient satisfaction. 18The preference ratings for CAM services re- ported in this study could help guide hospital administratorswhen deciding how to implement new inpatient programs.Future qualitative studies could examine how CAM services enhance hospital satisfaction and why inpatients may feel more satised when hospitals offer these services. Such datacould in turn assist advocates when lobbying insurance companies for coverage of these important services. Furthermore, it is unclear how CAM services may impact inpatients longitudinally. It may be important to develop CAM hospital programs that allow for the maintenance of these services when patients are discharged to their respective out-patient settings, thereby allowing for even greater continuity of care. Nonetheless, the ndings from this study may be valuable to those developing and implementing CAM programs withinhospital settings, particularly when aiming to provide servicesthat are perceived to be benecial by patients and those that may enhance the overall patient experience.
