Vaccines can cause severe inju ries such as seizures, death, anaphylaxis, brain damage and othe r reactions. The type and severity of reactions may vary from vaccine to vaccine and child to child. The effects of a vaccine injury may be temporary or permanent. If you notice any changes in your child's condition after receiving a vaccine, you should contact your doctor immediatel y or go to a hospital. Vaccines have never been proven to be saf e or effective and your child may contract the dise ase even if he is vaccinated. What has been proven is that you can ge t the disease from the vaccine or from coming into contact with a recently vaccinated person. The polio vaccine is ju st one example. It is a known fact that most health care providers do not fully inform patients of the side effects a vac cine can have on the body, brain and immune system. Because of the highly toxic ingredients all vaccines contain, you should thoroughly research vaccines for yourself be fore making such an important decision. DO NOT allow someone else, e ven your healthcare provider, scare or force you in to making this decision without being fully informed. Many he althcare providers have not researched vaccine hist ory or toxicology and are not fully informed. Always provide a detailed history of your child's health to your doctor. Make sure they know of allergies, neurological problems, nutritional deficiencies, an y immune system disorder and skin diseases such as eczema. Most physicians and nurses do not warn parents that if t heir child's health is compromised in any way, such as having a common cold or previous reaction to a vaccine, they should not receive vaccines. Benefits of Non-Vaccination When you choose to not vaccinate your child, you have the responsibility to educate yourself on how to maintain the well-being of not only their body but also thei r mind and spirit as well. Childhood diseases can r esult in minor symptoms to severe complication or death depending on the child's immune system and treatment protocol s followed. The stronger the immune system, the less severe are the symptoms of the disease. A child that goes thr ough the full expression of the disease (i.e. fever and skin erup tions, without suppressing any of these symptoms) u sually acquires immunity from that disease for life. Good nutrition and cleanliness play a major role. The risk of con tracting various diseases can vary over time or locality. Symptoms o r complications of these diseases may be treatable by alternative methods or may resolve without treatment. Educate y ourself on childhood diseases from informed alterna tive sources. Fear of these diseases comes from not being properl y informed. For More Information To make a truly informed decision there are num erous sources of information on the risks of vaccin es and the risks and benefits of childhood diseases. Sources of info rmation to determine if the risks associated with v accines outweigh any perceived benefits include: vaccine package ins erts, the Physicians Desk Reference, the U.S. Cente r for Disease Control and Prevention, public and medical librarie s or state and local health agencies.

Reporting Reactions If you do decide to vaccinate, report vaccine re actions to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Syst em (800) 822- 7969. Always get the vaccine name, vaccine manufact urer and lot number. Keep records of day to day rea ctions from the time of vaccination for at least 6 months to 2 years, no matter how slight the reactions. Long-ter m effects of vaccines have not been well documented by the allop athic community and are just now being researched. If your child has been injured by a vaccine, he may be eligible f or compensation under the National Vaccine Injury C ompensation Program.
