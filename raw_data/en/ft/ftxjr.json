ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 CHAPTER 1 GENERAL INFORMATION ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 INTRODUCTION The fee system for the Alabama Department of Public Health is a critical operation. The policies and procedure s for collectio n and accountabilit y of fees by count y healt h department s are established in the Fee System Manual . It is imperative that county health departments adhere to the policies and procedures outlined in this manual. GENERA L INFORM ATION This manual provides uniform procedures for collection and accountability of fees charged in the count y healt h departments . Fees collecte d includ e Famil y Plannin g fees , Environmenta l fees, Health Statistics fees, Other Clinic fees, and Miscellaneous receipts. Instructions are designed for employees who are directly responsible for the collection of fees. All clinic staff should be knowledgeable about the Fee System. Questions and situations not fully covered in this manual should be referred to the: Local administrator , healt h officer , or offic e manager, Area administrator or clerical director, Office of Program Integrity, Bureau of Financial Services. Why do we have a Fee System? All counties charge fees for services. All counties charge for family planning services and for certified copies of Health Statistics records. Fees are assessed based on federal or state law. Some counties charge for additional services where fee legislation or a fee bill has been passed. Each Fee bill identifie s the specifi c authorit y that designate s the service s that fees may be charged and designates who sets the fee. Disclaimer: This is not an all exclusive manual for certain detailed instructions may need to see your supervisor. 1-1ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 Why do countie s charg e fees ? In som e instance s (famil y plannin g and healt h statistics) charging fees is require d by law. Fee legislatio n was sough t to obtai n revenu e for the county health departments to help offset the cost of providing services. Who benefit s from chargin g fees ? Fees collecte d in the count y healt h department s are deposited into a local \"Depository Account\" or \"Fee Account \". Fee accounts are interest -bearing accounts , which provide another source of revenue for the county . Fees are transferred on an as - needed basis by ADPH Financial Services - Budget and Receipts Office to the State Treasury to meet county pa yroll or other county expenses. Required procedures: The Fee System Manual provides a standardized method for collection and accountabilit y of fees . Som e informatio n may not appl y to ALL healt h departments ; the procedures were written to address any issue, which may arise . Although the Fee System Manual addresse s issue s that may not appl y to all count y healt h departments , it is necessar y to understand the procedures to obtain fee certification. Othe r issues : The Fee System Manua l also addresse s the Impres t Accoun t and othe r bank account s maintaine d and operate d by the count y healt h department . Thes e account s are also covered on the fee certification test. Fee Certification : All employee s who perfor m dutie s associate d with the Fee account , the Imprest account, or any other health department bank account must be certified to handle cash . This process includes: de f i n i n g tasks and assigning employees to tasks, t r a i n i n g and testing of employees, and r e p o r t i n g tasks and employees on the Cash Accountability Plan. Personnel assigned to WIC who perform income assessments for WIC eligibility do not have to be fee certified . Thes e individual s mus t be knowledgeabl e of the informatio n containe d in Chapter 2, Income Assessments . Since these assessments can be used as the basis for collecting fees in other clinic services, documented training is required . The income assessment portion of the fee certification test will be administered . The income assessment portion requires a passing score of 85 or above. The Imprest section requires a passing score of 85 or above . A passing score of 102 or above on the Fee Depository test is required and the rated test results are put in the employee's file at each health department for review by Program Integrity. The maximum possible score on the test is 128. 1-2ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 FEE COLLECTION All client s mus t understan d fees will be charge d for services . Client s mus t also understan d their responsibility in the fee collection process . Clinic staff should make every effort to inform clients of the followin g facts . Client s shoul d know: Befor e they arriv e at the clinic , that ther e will be a fee charge d for services . If possible , the client should know the fee amount and come prepared to pay. They may be asked to show proof of income. Wha t is covere d by the fees, e.g., supplies , tests , exams , and othe r services , The client will not be harassed and will be treated fairly and courteously regardless of ability to pay. The approximate cost of services, such as the cost per patient or cost per visit. The client will not be pressured but will be expected to pay the full amount due as soon as possible (preferably at the first visit). Clinic visits will remain confidential and if requested the patient will not receive phone calls or bills in an effort to obtain payment. Contributions help keep the clinic operational. The followin g method s may be used to infor m client s and the public that fees are a routine part of clinic services: Posters in the clinic Pamphlets News releases Word -of-mouth Distribution of fee information/material to other agencies, i.e., Department of Human Resources and Mental Health Wor k throug h the local Advisor y Council NOTE: Clients must be provided services without regard to religion, race, color, national origin, handicapping cond ition, age, gender and number of pregnancies or marital status . Clients must not be denied services or be subjected to any variation in quality of services because of the inability to pay. 1-3 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITY Knowledge of the Fee System is every clinic employee's responsibility . Clients may ask anyone a question regarding fees . All county health department employees should answer questions or refer the client to an employee who can answer questions. The clerk or othe r designate d employe e who has initia l contac t with clients , eithe r in person or by phone , will receiv e the majorit y of questions . The initia l contac t employe e hold s the key to the succes s of the Fee System . The clerk' s initia l impac t with the clien t does not minimize the importanc e of othe r employees . For example , client s may wait until they are talkin g with the nurs e or nurs e practitione r befor e askin g a question , or perhap s the clien t will trust an aide and expec t the aide to answe r questions. It is important that the way information is given, the amount of information that is given, and the tone of voice in which it is given, will affect a client's response . Nonverbal cues such as facial expression or the amount of eye contact may seem unimportant but will affect client/ staff relationships . Employees should realize that a client might not be comfortable with paying a fee . Whe n an employe e respond s to a client' s question s and answer s each fully , the issue of fees should not arise again. If you have questions regarding fees, contact the appropriate departmental contact person listed on the following page. 1-4 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 DEPARTMEN T CONTACTS Question s regardin g the Fee Syste m Manua l shoul d be directe d to the employe e or office listed below: CERTIFICATION CLINIC FEES GENERAL INFORMATION MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS E-DAY SHEET SYSTEM / ONE -WRITE SYSTEM (BACKUP SYSTEM) County Office Manager See directory Area Clerical Director See directory Program Integrity PHONE: 334 -206-5312 FAX: 334-206-5844 CLINIC SERVICES Family Health Services 334 ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES Environmental Services PHONE: 334 -206-5373 FAX: 334-206-5788 FEE SYSTEM MANUAL CHANGE, COMMENTS OR REVISIONS Bureau of Professional and Support Services PHONE: 334-206-5226 FAX: 334-206-5663 HEALT H STATISTIC Health Statistics PHONE: 334-206-5426 FAX: 334-206-2659 LOCAL FEE POLICY Local Administrator See directory County Office Manager See directory MONTHL Y RECAPS Financial Services Budget and Receipt PHONE: 334 -206-5250 Office -206-5668 FAX: 334-206-0333 1-5 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 SAFE PROGRAM As you are aware, the county health departments maintain funds on deposit outside the state treasury that must be insured. You will also remember that the SAFE Program (Security for Alabama Funds Enhancement program) was implemented in 2001 and was design ed to provide security for public funds on deposit in local banks. You have done well to ensure that your local accounts are with financial institutions participating in the SAFE Program, and Program Integrity has been able to verify this by obtaining cop ies of the banks' SAFE Certificates. The Examiners of Public Accounts informed us that we need to ensure the security of the department's funds on deposit. It is not enough to verify the bank holds a SAFE Certificate; we must verify that all public accou nts are included in the SAFE pool for collateral purposes. What is included? The SAFE law, Section 41 -14A-3, Code of Alabama, 1975, requires public deposits to be secured. INCLUDE in SAFE DO NOT INCLUDE in SAFE Fee Account Employee Coffee Fund Imprest Account Employee Flower Fund Miscellaneous Account - Money goes to fee account at end of account life Miscellaneous Account - Reverts to donor at end of account life Car Seat Account - Funded with federal money Building Fund (Ask Program Integrity for guidance) (Ask Program Integrity for guidance) 1-6 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 SAFE PROGRAM What is required?

Also, do we charg e our patient s for copie s of their own records ? Do we charg e othe r state agencies? Answer : A flat fee based on the latest approved fee schedule will be charged regardless of the number of pages copied from the CHR. In other words, whether copying one page, or all pages in the record the charge is the flat fee based on the latest approved fee sc hedule. This fee will be assessed for non -medical information requests only. No fee will be charged for copies of medical records sent to other providers to ensure continued quality of patient care. In other words, the patient or other state agencies will only be charged if the copies are for non -medical information purposes. Question : Some insurance companies send more than the flat fee based on the latest approved fee schedule for a medical record copy. Can the county keep the extra? Answer: Yes, the county may keep the extra and put the excess as a donation. 1-9 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 CHAPTER 2 INCOME ASSESSMENT ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 PATIENT REGISTRATION/INCOME ASSESSMENT PURPOSE: The purpose of this form is to provide basic identification and demographic data for patient care; direct and third party billing; computerized data entry; and documentation for standardized assessment of income and family size to determine eligibility for and percentage of charge, if applicable, for all Health Department services. Documentation may be based upon a declaratio n, except for WIC eligibility. For WIC eligibility, proof of identity, residence, and income is required and is documented by entering the type of proof document in PHALCON during the income assessment and prior to Food Instrument issuance. See the WIC Pr ocedure manual for explanation of proof requirements. PATIENTS SHOULD NOT BE DENIED SERVICE FOR FAILURE TO PRESENT DOCUMENTATION EXCEPT FOR WIC. The Income Assessment is an essential tool for implementation of the Fee System. County health departments ch arge fees on a sliding scale based on family size and income which is captured on the income assessment. The Income Assessment: provides documentation of income assessment; records income and family size; determines eligibility for all applicable health department services; determines percentage of charge for services; and is completed at each client's first visit to the clinic, when a client volunteers an update and annually thereafter except WIC. Income assessments are completed at each WIC certificatio n or recertification and when there is knowledge of a change in income . All sections of the CHR -2 must be completed. Fees are charged based upon the last annual income assessment. A new income assessment must be completed if the last assessment is more than 12 months from the date of the signed declaration or the client declares a change in status. Family size and income must be documented to validate the percentage of charge. Income assessments without this i nformation are audit exceptions. The client/parent/legal guardian/legal custodian/proxy signature signifies client understands his/her rights and responsibilities. Determining Percentage of Charge Family size and income from the income guidelines determine if the percentage of charge will be either 100%, 75%, 50%, 25% or 0%. The percentage of charg e identifies the client's payment category and the fee amount. Medicaid eligible clients are exempt from fee charges for cover ed services. 2-1 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 PATIENT REGISTRATION/INCOME ASSESSMENT Status of Medicaid eligibility must be checked at every Child Health, Family Planning, Maternity, Immunization and Care Coordination visit using the Medicaid swipe card, or the web -eligibility verification (AVRS), with the fee based upon the last income assessment.

Patients applying for the Plan First Program will be provided services eligible under the Family Planning Waiver without charge. During the application process, patients should be informed that if it is determined they are not eligible for the Family Planning Waiver; they will be responsible for any bills since the time of the application. NOTE: On subsequent visits if the client does not yet have a Medicaid card, status of Medicaid eligibility must be checked.

Agriculture means all activities which include: - Cultivation and tillage of the soil; - Cultivation, growing, and harvesting of any commodity grown in or on the land; - Or as an adjunct or part of a commodity grown in or on the land including logging or harvesting of trees. When determining income for migrants at certifications, annual income is often more reliable and more easily obtained than current income. The migrant farm worker family who presents expired VOC cards/letters indicating that income eligibility was accomplished within the previous 12 months does not need income reassessed. They are considered income eligible. 21. Payment Bracket: After calculation of annual income and family size, the income percentage is written in this section to indicate the payment class for fees (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, or 0%). Income schedules, also known as Poverty Guidelines, are generally released annually by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). PHALCON is updated to accommodate the income changes and counties must use the most recent schedule when assessing clients for charges. NOTE: When the income schedul e/poverty guidelines are released and PHALCON is updated, the payment bracket may change for the client and may vary from the information printed on the CHR -2 located in the chart. Clerks need to be cognizant of this possibility and will need to reprint the CHR -2 with updated information and charge clients appropriately if applicable. No fee is charged to clients receiving services under WIC, STD, and TB programs, or service covered by Medicaid. 22. Income Self -Declared - Self-declared income (annual amount) and sources of income must be entered. (For WIC, verification of self -declared income is not required if patient qualifies due to adjunctive eligibility). Indicate \"No\" if the income is not self -declared. Indicate \"Yes\" if the income is self -declared. Note: Self -declared income must also be entered on the WIC Proof screen in PHALCON. 23. Student/School: Mark the box to indicate if the client is a student. List the name of the school if applicable. 24. Special Circumstances: At times there will be special circumstances which impact a client's ability to pay. The Income Assessment should include questioning about special circumstances. Examples include extreme medical expenses, temporary layoffs, unemployment or layoff for an extended period followed by rece nt unemployment. 2-12 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 PATIENT REGISTRATION/INCOME ASSESSMENT Special Circumstances: continued Family Planning Fees must be waived for individuals with family incomes above the amounts shown in the schedule who, as determined by the assessor/supervisor, are unable for good cause, to pay for family planning services. The county health department Administrator or Ar ea/Clinic supervisory staff is required to approve waived fees for services as recommended by intake assessor. The approver is to initial in the Special Circumstances box. This is self declared information. Proof of cause is not required (example: hospita l bill). Fees may be waived for services and/or supplies when the client meets any one or more, but not limited to other reasons deemed reasonable, of the following definitions of \"Good Cause\". *Recent layoff from employment *Recent diate family member (**) *Recent Medical/Hospital Costs Extraordinary ongoing monthly prescription costs Recent Bankruptcy Recent Natural Disaster Loss (uncompensated costs for fire, flood, tornado, etc.) * Recent is defined as no more than six months from the date of the event. ** Immediate family for this purpose includes spouse, children, parents, step parents, parent -in-law, grandchildren, grandparents, brothers, sisters, and stepchildren. WIC - when calculating income for WIC, special circumstances cannot be allowed. 25. Interim Visits: Medicaid - Indicate \"NO\" if client is not receiving Medicaid benefits. Indicate \"YES\" if client is receiving Medicaid benefits. Status of Medicaid eligibility must be checked at every Child Health, Immunization, Family Planning, Maternity, and Care Coordination visit using the Medicaid swipe card, Web Eligibility verification or 1 -800 numbers on the card, with the fee based upon the last income assessment. If after a Medicaid status check is completed and the patient is no longer eligible for Medicaid, complete a new assessment. NOTE: If the most recent Income Assessment indicates that the patient is no longer eligi ble for WIC services, the patient and each participating family member shall be terminated and a WIC 119, Notifications Form given. If the assessment indicates that the patient has been assessed incorrectly for fees, correct fees shall be charged. 26. VFC Eligibility - VFC eligibility must be verified every visit where the client is age appropriate for VFC (up to the 19th birthday). Indicate \"NO\" if the patient is not VFC eligible. Indicate \"YES\" if patient is VFC eligible. If \"Yes\" the qualifier should be circled. Enter the initials and date of the person verifying information. 2-13 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 PATIENT REGISTRATION/INCOME ASSESSMENT INCOME SCHEDULE THE INCOME SCHEDULE (Poverty Guidelines): with the Patient Registration/Income Assessment Form (CHR-2) assesses each patient 's income eligibility determines the percent of fees, if any, will be charged to a client for Family Planning and other clinic services is released each spring from the Department of H ealth and Human Services (DHHS) is bas ed on DHHS poverty guidelines is effective for use upon receipt at county health department through PHALCON release Shows the percent of fee to charge for services based on family size and income 2-14 PERCENT OVER MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF POVERTY INCOME PERCENT TO CHARGE FOR SERVICES 250% OVER 200% - 250% 150% 150% PLAN = 133% AND UNDER 100% AND UNDER 100% 75% 50% AUTOMATIC ELIGIBILITY 25% AUTOMATIC ELIGIBILITY 0% The current Income Schedule should be used with the Form CHR -2 to assess each client's income eligibility.

Some programs, like the Family Planning program, have services offered in all counties and fees charged in all counties, as described later, based on federal grant requirements. Services under the Maternity and Child Health programs are also offered in all counties but are not as widely used. Charges for these program services are authorized only in counties with local authority and approval. NOTE: Fees are set by the state leve l except for Mobile and Jefferson Counties which are required to utilize a sliding scale but use their own rates. Maternity and Child Health programs can only be charged in those counties where local authority exists. Certification All employees who process clinical fees must be certified to handle cash. Cash certification procedures are detailed in Chapter 8, County Depository Account. 4-1 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 FAMILY PLANNING I. PROGRAM PHILOSOPHY - All family planning clients must be given the opportunity to make two fundamental choices: the choice of participation and the choice of contraceptive method. II. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS The following guidelines are designed to comply with the federal Title X regulations which require a sliding scale fee assessment based on the client's self declared income and family size. All clients are to be income assessed as described in this manual and informed that services will not b e deni ed based on inability to pay. The fees described in this section are applicable to the Family Planning Program and are set at the state level only based on a cost analysis which reflects the reasonable cost of providing services. The county cannot ch ange the Family Planning service descriptions or amounts when providing these services. The following are program mandates: A. Provide services without regard to religion, race, color, national origin , creed, disability, or gender , number of pregnancies, mari tal status, age, contraceptive preference, or inability to pay. B. Target services to low -income individuals with priority in the provision of services are given to persons from low -income families. C. Provide services without subjecting individuals to any coe rcion to accept services or employ or not to employ any particular methods of family planning. Services must be provided solely on a voluntary basis and not be made a prerequisite or eligibility for, or receipt of, any other services, assistance from or p articipation in any other program of the applicant. Project personnel must be informed that they may be subject to prosecution under Federal law if they coerce or endeavor to coerce any person to undergo an abortion or sterilization procedure. D. Provide se rvices in a manner which protects the dignity of the individual. E. Assure client confidentiality and provide safeguards of individuals against the invasion of personal privacy as required by the Privacy Act. If requested, the client has the option of not being contacted at home by phone or mail for billing purposes. F. No charge for services provided to any persons from a low -income family except to the extent that payment will be made by a third party authorized to or under legal obligation to pay this char ge. G. Provide that charges will be made for services to persons other than those from low -income families in accordance with a schedule of discounts based on ability to pay. This is designed to recover reasonable cost of providing services. 4-2 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 FAMIL Y PLANNING - continued III. INCOME DETERMINATION - Income determination is based on family size and household income. Determination of income is by self -declaration and is documented as annualized income. IV. INTAKE PROCESS A. Inform all clients of the financial assessment process including the sliding fee scale. Indicate that the clinic charges fees, but discounts are available based on the income and family size of each client. The clinic receives money from State and Federal sources wh ich must be used to support all aspects of the clinic and fees collected allow clinics to continue to provide services. B. Complete an income assessment based on client's self -declared income and family size as outlined in this manual. C. If client is eligibl e for Medicaid, initiate the application process or verify Medicaid status. For additional information, see section below for Charging Fees. D. If non -Medicaid client, inform him/ her of the pay category. Services will be provided regardless of inability to pay. E. The charging of applicable services should ideally be done following completion of service(s); however, counties should set up the system that works best for their setting. For example, a county can opt to charge established clients for a supply vis it at the beginning, however, new clients who have not chosen a birth control method may be charged at the end of the visit. F. Inform the client of the applicable charges incurred today and ask how much she/he can pay on the bill. Enter the service on the day sheet for all non -Medicaid clients. G. Print the receipt/invoice and review with client (see sample below). For those with a remaining balance, the clerk can provide the client with a self -addressed envelope to send back with a payment at a later date. 4-3 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 FAMILY PLANNING - continued V. CHARGING FEES A. All non -Medicaid family planning clients will be assessed a fee depending on their family size, declared income, and type of visit , or service. B. Fees are determined by the ADPH by performing a cost analysis of the services provided statewide. Fees are assessed locally by applying the schedule of discounts to the total charges based on the client's Federal Poverty Level. C. If a client comes in for one type of visit and it is determined that another type of visit is needed at the same time, (e.g. in for GYN problem and it is determined that emergency contraception is indicated), the client should be billed for only one (1) visit, as well as any othe r billable services that were provided. D. Should a client be deemed ineligible for Medicaid (example, over the income criteria), the fee for this service should be charged to the client. If the client appears eligible for Medicaid, and the application process has been initiated, do not charge the client for services provided on that date of service. If client is denied Medicaid coverage, county is to charge fees appropriately, including al l visits/services provided since the application was taken. These visits/services are to be recorded on the E-Day Sheet and the client billed as appropriate. If the application remains pending after 45 days, the H ealth Department is to check with the Medicaid out stationed worker on the status prior to sending a bill. The patient is not to be charged or billed until the Medicaid status is confirmed as approved or denied. (See VII Billing/Collection Section of this chapter ). E. Clients whose income falls at or below 100% of the federal poverty level will fall into a zero % pay category. All non -Medicaid clients will have services recorded on the E lectronic Day Sheet, including those in the zero % pay category . The transaction will generate an invoice/rec eipt for the client which will show the gross charge, net charge, amount paid and current balance. All clients are to be given this statement. F. Clients who indicate they do not know their income, or decline or refuse to declare their earnings are to be sh own the current income schedule/poverty guidelines and are to be asked to point to the amount that best describes their family income so that they can self declare. Clients should be informed of this process at the time of the call for appointment. At the time of the visit, the clerk is to explain that we are not a free clinic and that the purpose of the sliding fee scale is to determine the discount eligibility for the client. In addition, these fees are used to maintain the clinic, pay our staff, and en able the health department to provide services to the clients who need it. Clients may also be informed that no proof of income is required in the Family Planning Program. 4-4 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 FAMILY PLANNING - continued If after assisting the client through this process, and he/she still refuses to declare an income, inform them that they will be charged the full pay fee (100% fee category), thus waiving the sliding scale assessment, but they will not be denied services i f he/she will not pay. The clerk is to indicate the circumstances on the Income Assessment such as \"Client refused to disclose income to determine sliding scale discount\" or \" Client waived sliding scale assessment\" or similar language. G. Fees charged to a ny client for services must be in accordance with the ADPH approved Fee Schedule. H. No client will be refused service or be subjected to any variation in quality of services based on inability to pay. I. Clients who return to the clinic for lost, misplaced or otherwise missing contraceptive packets of pills, patches or rings will be charged as specified on the Family Planning Fee Schedule. J. The County Health Department or Area/Clinic supervisory staff may waive the fee for an individual \"for good cause.\" a. Definition of \"Good Cause \" - Fees may on occasion need to be waived due to unusual circumstances for clients who would be required to pay for services and/or supplies, based on their income and family size. However, these clients are unable to pay based o n a temporary or one -time catastrophic financial event. The county health department Administrator or Area/Clinic supervisory staff may waive fees for services and/or supplies when the patient's circumstances indicate \"Good Cause\". Examples of \"Good Cause\" are described below. This is self declared information. Proof of cause is not required (example: hospital bill) : i. *Recent layoff from employment ii. *Recent Funeral Costs of immediate family member (**) iii. *Recent Medical/Hospital Costs iv. Extraordinary ongoing monthly prescription costs v. Recent Bankruptcy vi. Recent Natural Disaster Loss (uncompensated costs for fire, flood, tornado, etc.) *Recent is defined as no more than six months from the date of the event. ** Immediate family for thi s purpose includes spouse, children, parents, step parents, parent - in-law, grandchildren, grandparents, brothers, sisters, and stepchildren. 4-5 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 FAMILY PLANNING - continued K.

DONATIONS Voluntary donations from clients are permissible. Clients must not be pressured to make donations, and donations must not be a prerequisite for the provision of services and supplies. Donations from clients do not waive the billing/charging requirements specified above. Donation amounts should not be suggested. It is acceptable to display notice regarding acceptance of donations. 4-7 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 FAMILY PLANNING - continued Sample scripts for requesting donations: Donations #1 There are no charges for your services today because it is based on your family size and income; however, we do accept donations.

The following information should be given to the client at the time the appointment is scheduled: A fee may be charged for service s and supplies. Any fee will be based on income and family size. Payment is due at the time of the service, however, services will not be denied based on inability to pay. A fee may not be charged if client appears eligible for Medicaid and applies at the time of the visit (pending enrollment). If deemed ineligible, client will be charged appropriately from the time of the application as described in section V. Charging Fees , D. Clients deemed ineligible for billing based on confidentiality purposes, will not have mailings sent to their home. A donation will be accepted. B. At the time of services, each client must be given an invoice containing the following information: 1. Name of Client 2. Date of service 3. Gross charges 4. Net charges 5. Amount paid this date 6. Current balance C. Clients unable to pay in full at the time of service should be asked to make a partial payment. D. Clients should be mailed an invoice for the unpaid balance of their bill. Clients who have requested confidential services must not be mailed an invoice or be contacted by phone unless alternative address/contact # has been established. 4-8 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 FAMILY PLANNIN G - continued VIII. THIRD PARTY BILLING A. Clerk must establish that billing third party insurance is not a breach of confidentiality for the client and if statements or bills can be received through mailings. B. Private insurance providers will be attempted to be billed on eligible non -confidential clients. See \"FP Billing Private Insurance Users Guide\", later in this chapter for further details. D. Provide patients whose encounters are being filed for public (Medicaid) or private insurance with a Family Planning Services Receipt (ADPH -FHS-645). Instructions include: Purpose To provide the non -self pay Family Planning recipients with a receipt detailing the cost of the visit on that date of service (includes those with private insurance or public insurance such as Medicaid). The Health Department will file all appropriate third party claims on behalf of the recipient. If the claim is denied, the recipient will be charged for the services based on family size and income. NOTE: Self pay or fee pay ing recipients will be entered into the electronic Day Sheet and printed a receipt from that system. 4-9 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 FAMILY PLANNING - continued Procedure 1.

Answer : Yes 4-18 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 FAMILY PLANNING Billing Private Insurance Users Guide 4-19 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 Family Planning Billing Private Insurance Users Guide The following guidelines are to be used when assessing Family Planning clients for the processing of insurance claims. Clients must give approval in order to file a claim requesting payment of eligible medical coverage benefits to be provided to ADPH. Clie nts who do not want a claim submitted will be responsible for any charges utilizing the established Fee schedule. Blue Cross/Blue Shield (BCBS) of Alabama is the primary carrier utilized at this time and is detailed when applicable throughout this section . Why is Third Party Collection Important? Reductions in state and federal funding; Escalating operating costs; We are not a free clinic - we are a confidential, non -profit entity; It is a requirement of Title X; It is included as a requirement in the Affordable Care Act; The money collected helps pay for the facility, salaries, medical supplies and medications and helps provide services to all clients who need it. The Mission vs. the Business: Our mission is providing accessible, affordable family planning services to our clients. The business is about providing services that can be competitive in terms of quality and integration with the rest of the delivery system. Bottom line, we need money to operate. When scheduling the appointment with client over the phone : Ask the client if she has private insurance coverage, and if so, would she agree to the Health Department filing claims for her when she comes in for services. Inform her to bring a copy of the insurance card to the appointment. At th e time of the appointment : 1. Perform the intake process in the usual manner to include the collection of the demographic information, income assessment as appropriate and insurance information. The name pulled from PHALCON for billing is from the demographi cs page therefore, it should be the legal name and more than likely should match the name used by Blue Cross. Keep this in mind when initiating a new CHR record and when updating existing records. 2. Complete the CHR -3, Authorization for Services form (see below). Make sure the client has reviewed the section \"Permission to Bill\" authorizing the Health Department to release applicable medical information to process a claim. 4-20 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 On the ADPH Clinical Services Encounter Form (ADPH -ENC-300), the clerk is to complete the section \"Private Insurance\" indicating the client's preference regarding the filing of an insurance claim. Valid options include: Bill Insurance, Not Applicable, and Do Not Bill Insurance - This is a required field. Bill Insurance - If the client agrees to file a BCBS claim, enter \"Bill Insurance\" into PHALCON. If this is not marked, the claim will not be submitted for payment. NOTE: If client has Medicaid and BCBS, enter all insurance information and mark \"Bill insurance\". Finance will process the appropriate claims to each entity. Do Not Bill Insurance - We MUST protect our clients who have requested confidentiality. We do not want any client to receive an ins urance claim form (EOP - Explanation of payment) from an insurance carrier in the mail by accident, so make sure they consent to the processing of the claim and the entry is made in PHALCON. If they do not want an EOP to be sent to the home from Blue Cros s, we will not file a claim. These encounters will be marked as \"Do Not Bill Insurance\". The clients, who opt to not have a claim filed, are to be charged fees in the usual manner based on the established FP sliding scale utilizing the E -Day sheet with r eceipt. Not applicable - Indicated if client has no insurance; has private insurance other than BCBS; is only covered by Medicaid; or the visit is not eligible for filing (ex: RN only visit with pills issued as method). 3.

Copy Card : If active coverage is identified and client has agreed to ADPH filing a claim, make a copy of the insurance card if available. Counties may keep a copy in a separate file pending payment or denial of claim. Note the following to look for on the card: a. Format for the BCBS Policy number is generally 3 character codes (such as EIB) followed by 9 digits; or \"R\" with 8 digits. There are some exceptions for out of state BCBS card holders. When entering the policy number in PHALCON, do not enter any dashes or extra characters in this field which could result in an invalid entry. b. If the client has a card wit h \"XAD\" as the first three prefixes, this is for DENTAL only and not Family Planning services. Ask the client if they have another card with XAA or PPA. If not, they are to be charged for the visit. 5. ALL Kids clients : Utilize the same process descr ibed above for BCBS. On the insurance screen, indicate \"All Kids\" as the insurance carrier. These encounters will be billed through the same process as BCBS. 6. Assessment of Fees : For clients who agree to ADPH processing a BCBS claim, inform them that if the claim is denied, they may receive a bill in the mail for the services received. Provide client with a Family Planning Services Receipt (ADPH -FHS-645). See instructions below. 4-30 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 Family Planning Services Receipt (ADPH -FHS-645): Purpose To provide the non -self pay Family Planning recipients with a receipt detailing the cost of the visit on that date of service (includes those with private insurance or public insurance such as Medicaid). The Health Department will file all appropriately appr oved third party insurance claims on behalf of the client (currently includes BCBS and Medicaid). If the claim is denied, the client will be charged for the services based on family size and income. NOTE: Self pay or fee paying clients will be entered int o the electronic Day Sheet and printed a receipt from that system. Procedure Place a PHALCON label here. Indicate which Family Planning visit type the client received and contraceptive method as appropriate. For methods such as OCs, patch and vaginal rings, indicate the number of monthly packs/cycles issued on that specific date of service. The receipt should be marked by the nurse or Nurse Practitioner after services have been received. The client may be provided the receipt by the nursing or clerical staff based on county discretion. NOTE: If the client has questions about ADPH rates on the receipt versus what they receive on a BCBS EOP, inform them that ADPH files public/private insurance for the services at the agreed upon rates with those agencie s. Services that are not covered by Medicaid or insurance may be billed to the client. If the client is billed, the charges may be lower than those listed on the receipt based on their family size and income. Services will not be denied because of inabil ity to pay. 4-31 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 7. PHALCON Data Entry : For clients who agree to ADPH processing a BCBS claim, enter the required information into PHALCON as follows. Upon entry of the encounter into PHALCON, Health Finance will pull the applicable data for billing. a. Demographics Page - It is important that when initiating a CHR record, the name on the demographics page should be the legal name and more than likely should match the name used by Blue Cross. b. Financial Information/Insurance Screen - Enter as much insurance information as possible into PHALCON (policy and group number, policy holder name and relationship, etc.) It is critical that the information put in PHALCON is accurate for billing to be succ essful. Company name - Enter the name of the insurance carrier to be billed for the visit/ services. Blue Cross/Blue Shield is the primary carrier at this time. We will also file claims for ALL Kids recipients. In this case, choose \"ALL Kids\" from the dr opdown list. Generally, the format for the Policy number is 3 character codes (such as EIB) followed by 9 digits or \"R\" with 8 digits. Do not use dashes, special characters, etc. Out-of-state BCBS Card Holders: We will attempt billing of out -of-state BCBS card holders. This will be more common for the counties that border other states. Policy Holder - Enter the last, first, and middle name of the policy holder. Utilize the Blue Cross web portal to confirm the policy holder and make sure to enter the name as known by Blue Cross (the name must be spelled exactly as it is on the card). Remember - this may not be the client sitting in front of you, so make sure you use the correct person. Relationship - Indicate the relationship of your \"client\" to the subscriber/policy holder (the person whose name is on the card). It may be child, spouse, or if the client is the subscriber/policy holder the relationship will be self. Example: Sally Doe is the client and is the daughter of Jane Doe. Jane Doe is the subscriber. The relationship in this case would be \"child\". 4-32 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 c. Encounter Form - The clinician (MD or Nurse Practitioner) performing the visit must enter their assigned 4 digit provider # on the encounter form for entry into PHALCON. This is critical for successful billing. Provider Information - In order to add a new clinician (MD or NP) or to make changes to existing providers, the designated staff person with administrative rights in PHALCON may access the \"Provider Setup\" through the appointment icon. This process is vital in connecting the correct provider with BCBS and the appropriate encounter. Requirements include: 1. The provider must be listed by name. Do not use generic titles such as \"Visiting NP\" 2. New NPs can be added utilizing their approved 4 digit provider # (last 4 digits of SS# preferred). If the NP provides services at different locations, he/she is to use the same 4 digit # at each site. 3. If the provider is already listed, make sure to only change their provider number to the newly assigned 4 digit number in order to preserve all prior history. All 4 digit #s must be approved through the Nurse Practitioner Director at the central office. 4. Do not create a new provider if he/she already exists. This will compromise any prior data on the provider. 4-33 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 5. Do not reuse a provider/record from the list such as from a NP who no longer works for the department or a generic provider such as \"Floating NP\". In this case, make that provider record inactive. Provider Information Screen d. Billable Visits/Services: Visits - The billable visits to BCBS are only those where the MD/Nurse Practitioner has seen the client . This includes the Initial, Annual, Periodic Revisit and GYN Problem/Lab/ Counseling Visit. A diagnosis code should be u sed when a problem is identified. See e. below for additional guidance. Therefore, clients will need to be informed that RN only visits will continue to be charged to them based on family size and income. Services/Contraceptives: - BCBS will allow the billing of Depo -Provera/Medroxyprogesterone Acetate during a RN only visit under the prescriptive order of the MD/NP. In this case, the NP does not have to be present, but the appropriate provider # must be entered with the encounter in order to bill the i njection. Make sure to enter the correct MD/NP (who signed the order at the time of the exam, etc.) with the encounter. - BCBS allows for the billing of in -office, procedure driven contraceptive methods such as IUDs (including insertion and removal), and Implants (including insertion and removal) when performed by the MD/NP. 4-34 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 Services/Contraceptives: continued - BCBS does not pay ADPH for other pharmaceutical contraceptives such as oral contraceptives, patches and vaginal rings because our agency is not considered a pharmacy provider. As a Title X provider, we will continue to provide contraceptives directly to cl ients in the usual manner and do not plan to send them to pharmacies for supplies. e. Diagnosis Codes: All medical insurance claims submitted to insurance companies must be accompanied by a medical code for the condition, treatments, diagnosis and any procedures performed by a healthcare provider. Routine screening exam visits (Initial, Annual), a proble m focused visit ( GYN problem, repeat Pap smear, contraceptive problem, etc.), applicable contraceptives, and billable services will be pulled from PHALCON following the completion of the encounter and must be accompanied by the MD/NP Provider #. Diagnosi s codes are to be utilized when a condition is identified that plays a role in the care of the client such as anemia, hypertension, and weight gain, etc. The documentation in the record must reflect the diagnosis (ex: BP reading, counseling on weight, ch ange in method, return for repeat BP, etc.) The MD/NP is to document the applicable diagnosis code(s) on the encounter form for entry into PHALCON. The MD/NP is to utilize the \"Patient Referral\" box in the lower right hand corner of the encounter form to document all applicable diagnosis codes. Diagnosis codes can be found in PHALCON on the encounter screen. Select from the dropdown list of FP diagnosis codes. More than one may be entered if indicated . 4-35 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 Encounter Screen See Appendix A below for a listing of diagnosis codes. f. Final Step : All aspects of the visit, services and provider numbers should be reviewed prior to completion of the encounter to ensure the billing will be successful. Upon entry of the encounter into PHALCON, Health Finance will pull the applicable data for billing. Counties will be notified regarding payment or denial of the claim. If denied, the county is to go back and charge the client for the visit and method as appropriate. 4-36 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 APPENDIX A - Diagnosis Codes Used by MD/NP FP Abnormal Pap FP Amenorrhea vomiting FP Weight Gain 4-37 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 TOOLS: NOTE: Dual Coverage: If patient has BCBS and Medicaid coverage, complete all insurance screens in PHALCON and enter \"Bill Insurance\" on the encounter form.

The Division assists county staff with: 1. the process of reviewing and managing claims through an Explanation of Payment (EOP) or claim denial statements; 2. making appropriate changes and corrections to the claim through the use of Billing Inquiry Spreadsheets as applicable; and 3. crediting and rebilling claims as appropriate. Each county site should assign a trained billing staff person to work the county's EOPs and handle claims' issues. Each trained billing staff person must be certified before submitting any billing inquiry spreadsheets or correspondence to the Revenue Reco very Division. Only trained and certified staff will be allowed to correspond with the Revenue Recovery Division. Training: Clinic EOP Training is available through LCMS. County staff may access the training materials in the Document Library under the Revenue Recovery tab. Complete and detailed instructions should be reviewed before attempting to view the modules and/or take the post test. Each video segment in the training module must be viewed and the test completed successfully before EOP certification is granted. Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) Training is available in the Document Library. County staff may access t he training materials located under the FHS -Blue Cross and Blue Shield tab. All training material should be reviewed thoroughly before county staff begins to work claim denial statements. County staff must be trained and certified in Clinic EOP Training before submitting Blue Cross and Blue Shield spreadsheets to Revenue Recovery Division.

These counties should complete the income assessment as normal (including family size, income, and payment bracket.) \"Waive Fee\" should be circled at the bottom of the income assessment form and \"Eligible for BCCP\" should be indicated. This will identify the services that will be paid for through the Breast and Cervical Cancer Program (BCCP). The services would be listed on the day sheet with the gross charges at the 100% amount and the net charges would be 0.00, since the fee is waived. The BCCP client never actually pays for any BCCP services. 4-45 Percentage Fee 100% $8 $0 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 CANCER DETECTION - continued For counties without a fee bill or with no approval to charge cancer detection services, there would be no entry on the day sheet for a BCCP eligible client who receives services, and the client would not pay for any BCCP services received.

Additionally, it serves to document the receipt of all collections from other sources not receipted and deposited into another account. Brief descriptions of the components of the Fee System are provided below. Change Fund - The change fund is used for making change for clients who pay for their services with cash. The change fund in each county was established at the beginning of the Fee System, and was based on the needs of the county. The amount was determined by the administrator or office manager with the approval from Financial Services - Chief Accountant . The amount of the change fund may be adjusted based on needs of the county, with written approval from Financial Services - Chief Accountant . The amount of the Change fund must be reported to the Office of Program Integrity. Contact the Budget & Receipts Office or the Office of Program Integrity for specific procedures to increase or decrease the change fund in the county. Electronic Day Sheet System - The E-Day Sheet System is the automated version of the One-Write System. System advantages include pre -populated, customized fee schedules; calculated discounts for services, and legibility of day sheets. From one point of entry, the E-Day Sheet System generates the Prenumbered Receipt, the Client Ledger Record, the Day Sheet, and the Monthly Recap of Fees. A Prenumbered Receipt is generated by the system when the clerk enters the visit/service transaction. The receipt is given to the client at the time servic es are rendered. It reflects any previous balance, the gross amount (full fee amount) of the service, the net amount of the service (the gross amount less any applicable discounts), the amount paid, and the current balance. Client Ledger Record is an electronic record that tracks charges and payments for services rendered by the county health department. This internal record also shows the previous balance, voided transactions, and other adjustments to the client's financial record. The client ledger record should always reflect the current balance, which is also known as the accounts receivable balance. The Day Sheet is generated at the end of the day. It summarizes the transactions that occurred during the day. This document is necessary to balance the day's activity with the daily deposit. 7-1 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 One -Write System - The One -Write System was the original charging and accounting process used when the Fee System was established. Although it was replaced by the E- Day Sheet System for routine, day -to-day operations, it still serves as the manual back up to the E-Day Sheet System and is to be used when the E-Day Sheet is unavailable. The One-Write System consists of three parts: the prenumbered receipt, the ledger car d, and the day sheet. (NOTE: Carbon paper is often needed between the ledger card and the day sheet to improve legibility of the day sheet.) Prenumbered Receipts are written by the clerk on the date the visit/service is rendered and the receipt is given to the client. It reflects any previous balance, the gross amount (full fee amount) of the service, the net amount of the service (the gross amount less any applicable discounts), the amount paid, and the current balance. Client Ledger Card is a documen t that tracks charges and payments for services rendered by the county health department. It also reflects voided transactions and other adjustments to the client's accounts. The ledger card is filed in the client's medical record to serve as an accounts receivable record. The (manual) Day Sheet of the One -Write System is used to capture temporarily the financial transactions for each day the E-Day Sheet System is unavailable. When the E-Day Sheet System becomes available, the transactions posted on th e One-Write (manual) day sheet must be entered into the E-Day Sheet System to update the accounts receivable records. This process also ensures the accuracy of the Monthly Recap of Fees that will be electronically transmitted to Health Finance. Bank Accou nt - All collections from the Fee System are deposited into local banks into interest bearing accounts known as fee accounts (also referred to as a fee depository accounts). The county health department can only make deposits into the account. Health Fin ance - Budget and Receipts Office is responsible for withdrawals from the account. Bank statements are sent directly to Budget and Receipts Office , for reconciliation. Monthly Recap of Fees - The Monthly Recap of Fees is created by the E-Day Sheet System. At the end of the month, the county office manager, or designee, will create, print, and reconcile the report. After the report has been verified, the office manager, or designee, will submit the report to Financial Services -Budget & Recei pts Office who reconciles the report with the bank statements. 7-2 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 SECURITY POLICY Security of Cash Drawers/Change Fund All cash drawers should be maintained by the office manager/designee in a single, secure location, during non -business hours. The cash drawers should be retrieved and counted by employees at the start of each business day, and returned and counted at the end of each business day. If feasible, single drawer accountability should be maintained. Daily Opening Process Empl oyees responsible for collection of fees, and who have access to a \"change fund,\" must count their starting funds to verify they are starting the day with the approved change fund amount. If multiple employees make change from the same fund, designate staff to verify the starting funds. A signed log (see example provided) or statement attesting to the starting balance should be completed. This statement should be forwarded to the office manager/designee and compared to the previous day's closing balance fo r that change fund to verify accuracy. 7-3 Date/Time Received By/From Amount Verified By Notes 10/10/2013 8:00 AM Debbie Smith 100.00 Kathy Green N/A 10/10/2013 4:00 PM Debbie Smith 100.00 Kathy Green N/AChange Fund/Cash Drawer LogALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 Daily Closing Process At the end of each day, the \"change fund\" must be counted to ensure the approved amount is on hand. Important Note: If fee collections did not occur, the change fund must still be counted for verification. A signed log or statement attesting to the ending balance should be completed. This statement should be forwarded to the office manager/designee. Making Change for Cash Payments When a customer pays by cash, take the payment, but make change before placing the money into the cash drawer. This ensures that employees will know exactly what was given to them by the customer. Change must be counted back correctly to the customer. The count should be done twice, once silently as the employee takes it from the cash drawer, and a second time, aloud as the employee hands it to the customer. Cash drawer must never be left unattended. 7-4 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 CREDIT POLICY It is Departmental policy to ask a client with an outstanding balance for payment when the client returns to the clinic for services. A client who cannot pay the entire outstanding amount should be encouraged to pay whatever towards the balance. Partial payments are accepted. MEDICAL SERVICES CANNOT BE DENIED Medical s ervices cannot be denied based on inability to pay. PAYMEN T MAY BE REQUESTED If a client does not make an effort to pay the outstanding balance: Stress the importance of fees for clini c operations , physicians' time , supplies , etc. Encourage the client to make a partial payment on the outstanding balance. If the client refuses to make payment, informs the client that : - current services will be provided 7-5 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 ACCOUNT S RECEIVABL E WRITE -OFF POLICY County Health Departments can establish account receivable records and attempt to collect amounts charged to patients for services provided under the Fee System. Departmental Policy allows county health departments to write off uncollected balances of terminated patients. The concept behind processing aged accounts receivable reports and writing off dormant account balances is to provide an accurate accounts receiv able report. Quarterly, it is necessary to adjust a client's account balance for the outstanding balance over 120 days that will not be collected. Page 8 -18 provides instructions for writing off account balances manually of terminated patients in case the E-Day Sheet system is down. When the E-day Sheet system is available then follow the instruction in the E -Day Sheet System in Chapter 9. Refer to the Electronic Day Sheet Users' Guide for Aging and Write off instructions. CHECK /MONEY ORDER POLICY When a check is received for services, be sure: It is made payable to the Health Department. - Do not accept two -party or payroll checks. It is written for the correct amount. - Excess amount will be posted as donation, excluding Option II payments. Identification is presented with chec k.

In order t o restrictively endorse the back of the check write FOR DEPOSIT ON LY as soon as it is received. - Each check must be listed on the deposit slip by name and amount. -When the payer listed on the check is different than the client's name on the day sheet, both names must be on the day sheet. For example, \"Client/Mom's name\" in the name column. If no CHR, # is used such as with Environmental and Health Statistics, both the CHR # column and the name column can be used. 7-6 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 RETURNE D CHECK S AND OTHE R ADJUSTMENT S POLICY Returned checks are sent directly to th e county health department from Financial Services - Budget & Receipts Office. An entry must be made on the Day Sheet using the One -Write System to add the unpaid charges back to the client's account. If the check can be redeposit , an entry must be made on the Day Sheet. The entry is necessary to make the collection s on the Day Sheet agree with the deposit for the day. If the check cannot be deposited again , it should be held in the client's medical record until the client returns to the clinic. When the client returns to the clinic, payment should be requested by cash or a cashier check . When payment is received on a check that has not been turned over to the local district attorney you will give the returned check to the client. As soon as the check is made good, a new receipt is made and recorded on the Day Sheet as payment on account.

Overages and Shortages must be investigated and resolved immediately. OVERAGE S AND SHORTAGES Overage s and shortage s in the count y impres t accoun t are amount s over -reimburse d or under -reimbursed by Financial Services - Payable Section. Shortages: The only shortage s in the accoun t are amount s not reimburse d by Financia l Services - Payable Section. All unreimbursed items must be repaid by the employee responsible for the fund, if additional documentation to the Payable Section does not prove acceptable for reimbursement . Whe n repaymen t deposits are made , deposi t the amoun t on a separate deposi t slip marke d \"paymen t of item s (specif y check numbe r or type of error ) not reimbursed by Payable Section.\" EXAMPLE: \"Sales tax paid in error, CK # 1756.\" Overages: Duplicate reimbursements or reimbursements greater than the amount of the check result in an overage . This does sometime s happen , identif y wha t cause d the overag e (submitted travel voucher twice for payment and paid twice). To correct Overages or Shortages : Adjus t the vendor' s next check , wheneve r possible . For example , this is vendo r used on a regula r basis. - Telephon e bill is over paid on previou s balanc e by $30. - Count y healt h departmen t submit s Field Vouche r for reimbursement. - Financia l Service s deduct s $30 from Field Vouche r (HF-2) and check. - Impres t accoun t is $30 short. - Whe n the next telephon e bill is receive d for curren t charge s of $50. - Write a chec k for $20 to telephon e compan y to offse t $30 paid the previou s month. - Submi t Field Vouche r for reimbursemen t of $50 for curren t charges. - Financia l Service s will reimburs e curren t telephon e expens e for $50. - The impres t accoun t is in balanc e and no longe r shor t by $30. - The telephon e compan y is paid up-to-date. 10-9 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 OVERAGE S AND SHOR TAGES (continued ) If unabl adjus s next check , contrac t the Offic e of Progra m Integrity at 334-206-5312.

In absence of the assistant area administrator then the Health Officer or Area Administrator may be authorized to sign checks if they are on the signatur e card. Authorization to sign checks below the level of assistant area administrator must be granted by Area Administrator or higher classification.) Authorization of more than two signatures on the check must be approved by ADPH Chief Accountant in writ ing. Several names may be on the signature card and these names must be designated by the Area Administrator. Voide d check s must be retaine d in numerica l sequenc e by fisca l year.

Fund balanc e reconciliation s must be: - completed every month - signed and dated by preparer - reviewed, dated, and initialed monthly by someone other than preparer 10-10 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 USE OF CREDIT CARDS The use of charge cards for local purchases is not much different from the local \"charge accounts\" that some of our counties currently have with some of their vendors. The basic thing to remember, imprest account rules and restrictions still apply. Credit card purchases are still limited to $500 per vendor per reimbursement period (in this case you are looking at the reimbursement period being one month or one billing cycle). Authorizati on: The administrator, also being responsible for county operations and shortages in the imprest account, need s to specify who has the authority to open accounts in the health department's name. This function can only be performed by the Area or Assistan t Area Administrator. The charge card needs to be in the name of the c ounty health department. ( For example Etowah County Health Department) If possible, do not put an individual's name on the card. This potentially limits the flexibility of allowing someone other than the named employee from using the card. Also, having the individual's name on the card could potentially impact their perso nal credit ratings, etc. If the vendor requires a specific name, make sure the county health department name is also present. Administrators must then determine who may use the cards and have a letter on file (maintained locally) that specifies the individuals who may use the cards. This is similar to the letter maintained locally which specifies who can sign checks for the impr est account. Administrators also need to determine who will authorize specific purchases. Since administrators are responsible for the shortages in the account, in theory, administrators should be approving all purchases. Some office managers have b een given great latitude in authorizing certain purchases through mostly informal means. However, administrators should communicate expectations and authorizations to the employees in writing. The administrator should also communicate any spending restri ctions for those individuals. (For example, purchase of items over $200.00 requires administrator approval.) Purchases: An employee, identified on the list of authorized card users, will s ign a log showing they have received the card from the health department to make purchases (Credit Card check out/check in log). They will then go to the store and purchase the items with the card. The sales receipt will be signed by the employee who use d the card for the purchases. (If the employee's electronic signature from the keypad does not print on the receipt, the employee making the purchase will physically sign the itemized sales receipt.) Another employee will verify the items were purchased and received at the health department. Purchases with charge cards cannot exceed any limits or restrictions for other purchases through the imprest account. Credit cards cannot be used to obtain cash advances. Utilize state contracts inste ad of charge cards, charge accounts, or the imprest account when possible. 10-11 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 Documentation: Itemized sales receipts, signed by both the purchaser and the employee who verified receipt of the goods, must be maintained and matched with the monthly billing statements. The monthly billing statement will be processed through the local imprest accou nt. The monthly billing statement and the itemized sales receipts must be submitted to Health Finance with the imprest account reimbursement request. Remember, if credit card purchases exceed imprest limitations, the imprest account will reflect a shorta ge. The administrator is responsible for shortages in the imprest account. Security: The administrator needs to know how many cards are on the account and who has them. Do not allow employees to maintain these cards in their possession; instead, keep t he cards in a secure location at the health department and issue to employees to make purchases only when needed. This is similar to the requirement to maintain the blank check stock in a secure location. Administrators will also maintain a \"Credit Card check out/check in\" log to assist with accountability of purchases. Credit Card Account Limitations : When establishing the account with the vendor, keep the credit limitation to $1,500.00 or less. This will allow ample time for payment processing and c ontinued use of the credit card. It will also limit liability should the card become lost or stolen. 10-12 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 10-13 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 10-14 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 COUNTY IMPREST FUND REIMBURSEMENT After expenditure has been incurred an d the invoice has been received.

The law requires an annual report be filed and unclaimed property remitted to the State of Al abama Treasurer's Office, Unclaimed Property Program. An annual report must be filed with the State Treasury before November 1 of each year for the unclaimed property accounting period July 1 through June 30. The law also requires holders of unclaimed pro perty to report and remit unclaimed property which was not reported, but due, from earlier report years. A holder who fails to report, pay or deliver property within the prescribed guidelines shall face a civil penalty. Public Health just recently became aware of unclaimed property reporting requirements that apply to dormant vendor and expense checks written from the Imprest accounts. The Treasurer's Office is allowing the 2008 report year to be the compliance catch up year for the department for all pr evious years. Penalties that are usually accessed for failure to file an unclaimed property report will be waived for this catch up year. Please follow the guidelines below when submitting funds to the Unclaimed Property Division: Outstanding checks w ritten from the Imprest Fund for mileage expense reimbursements and vendor payments that are over three years old (dormancy period for expense and vendor checks) must be remitted to the State Treasurer's Office, Unclaimed Property Program. The current report year is 2008, covering the period July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005. Any outstanding checks that become three years old during this period must be included on the 2008 report. As this is the compliance catch up report year for Public Health , all prior year outstanding checks dated June 30, 2004 or before must also be included on the current year's report. A written notice must be sent to the apparent owner at his/her last known address informing him/her that the county health department is in possession of property that may be presumed abandoned. The notice must be sent not more than 120 days or less than 60 days before filing the report. A standard notification form letter is attached. The letter should be printed on department letterhea d and sent by first class mail to the owner. The annual report is due on or prior to November 1 of each year. Public Health requires each county to submit Unclaimed Property reports on October 15th of each year. In order to give the required notice, the notification letters to the owners should be sent between July 1 and August 15 of each year. The owners should be given thirty days to respond. No written notice is required if there is no known address or the property has a value of less than $50. 10-18 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 Alabama Treasury Department Report Form 1 and Report Form 2 must be submitted along with a check made payable to the Treasurer's Office for the total amount of the outstanding checks. The required forms are attached. A copy of all the requ ired paperwork should be kept on file in the county health department. The Office of Program Integrity will provide guidelines for record retention to ensure compliance with the Alabama Uniform Disposition Act of 2004. They will also provide guidance on how to handle the transaction in the Imprest Fund when property is remitted to the Treasurer's Office. No Unclaimed Property report is required to be filed if there is no unclaimed property to remit for the report year. Information is also available on the Department of Treasury's website at: http://www.treasury.state.al.us/Content/Business_Owners.htm . 10-19 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 July 30, 2012 Owner's Name Address City, State and Zip Code NOTICE OF UNCLAIMED FUNDS Our records indicate that we are holding unclaimed property of at least $50 due to the person/company listed above.

You can contact them at: State of Alabama Treasurer's Office Unclaimed Property Division Post Office Box 302520 Montgomery, Alabama 36130 -2520 Telephone Number: 1 -888-844-8400 Sincerely, Holder's Typed Name for Signatu re 10-20 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 COMMON QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS IMPREST ACCOUNT Question: What is done with interest earned on the imprest checking account? Answer: The total interest earned for the year must be transferred to the depository account each Januar y. To accomplish this, record the deposit as miscellaneous revenue on the day sheet (you mus t writ e a prenumbere d receipt) . The amoun t will be recorde d on the monthl y reca p under other and designated as imprest account interest. Question: Is the fund balance of the Imprest Account reconciled monthly? Answer : Yes. The reconciliatio n is important . It is a good way to tell whethe r or not all expenditures have been reimbursed or whether reimbursement is pending. Common reconciliation items consist of unreimbursed expenditures. For example, a lost receipt was never sent to the Bureau of Financial Services, or an expenditure, or part of expenditure, was not reimbursable by the Bureau of Financial Services. 10-21 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 Quicken Instructions The Quicken software is used by the county health departments to process and track transactions of the local imprest accounts. The software can be obtained through the Department's Bureau of Information Technology. It accounts for all financial transacti ons, including deposits into the account, checks drawn on the account, and any adjustments. The Quicken software is also used to handle the monthly bank reconciliation. The instructions that follow are not intended to address every situation you will enc ounter. It does not attempt to illustrate routine processes such as completing or printing checks. Rather, the instructions address functions that are often misunderstood or overlooked. Security Requirements The account must be password protected. It i s recommended that at least two people know the password, but the password for the program should not be common knowledge. The password should be changed periodically. It must be changed if responsibilities change. o If you are locked out of the account, th en the Quicken software would have to be re - installed by assigned IT personnel. The check stock used with the Quicken software must also be secured when not in use. Retain voided checks. Establishing a New Account All imprest accounts are currently oper ating with the Quicken software. If you have the need to establish a new imprest account or miscellaneous account, please call the Office of Program Integrity for guidance. Working With an Existing Account Deposits: Deposits must identify the date of the transaction, the date deposited with the bank. If the deposit includes multiple field vouchers, include only the total amount since the total of the deposit will be listed on the bank statement. If separate deposi t entries are made for each field voucher, list each deposit separately since the bank statement will also list the deposits individually. Checks : Checks must be used in sequential order. All checks must be accounted for on the check register. If a check is voided, the check must still be listed in the register. 10-22 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 Voids The \"void function\" in Quicken can only be used in the current month to affect a current month's transaction . [Edit - Transaction - Void or CTRL+V] For example, if you print chec ks today and notice the alignment is off, you can \"void\" the transactions. Quicken will replace the check amounts with a zero or a blank amount in the payment column and adjust the ending balance accordingly. The check numbers will be maintained in the n umber column so that there is no break in the sequence of check numbers. The \"void function\" must not be used to void a check from a previous month, and must not be used to void a check in the current month that has already been issued . While Quicken will allow the void function to be used in this manner, it is not proper accounting procedures, doing so destroys the history and thus deletes the audit trail. It is like using the magic whiteout pen in the check register. To void a check from a previous mon th, or one that has already been issued: o Make an entry with today's date to add back lost/stale check number xxx (deposit entry). This is an offsetting entry in the same amount as the check that was originally written. o Issue a new check to replace the old check in the same amount as the original check. (Be sure to follow the Unclaimed Property Procedures should those apply.) o Do not ask for reimbursement of the newly issued check since you should have already received reimbursement from Health Finance for the original expenditure. o The next time you perform the bank reconciliation, mark the old check number and the offsetting deposit entry as cleared, even though neither transaction actually processed through the bank. The two transactions have a zero sum e ffect on the bank reconciliation since the payment amount and the deposit amount are the same. o The newly issued check will be reconciled only after it is processed by the bank. Bank Reconciliations Bank reconciliations are to be prepared promptly. Promptl y is defined as by the end of the following month. (January should be completed before the end of February.) Reconciliations need to be prepared as of the end of the month. (There are a few counties whose bank cut off dates are in the middle of the month . For these counties, reconciliations will still be through the end of the month even though the bank statement cutoff was earlier in the month. For example, the bank cutoff date is January 20. The bank reconciliation is prepared on February 5. The rep ort date for the reconciliation will be January 31.) The person preparing the reconciliation needs to sign/initial and date the reconciliation to verify compliance with the county Cash Accountability Plan. The person assigned the responsibility to review t he reconciliation will also need to sign/initial and date the reconciliation to verify compliance with the county Cash Accountability Plan. 10-23 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 Bank Adjustments Sometimes the bank will process a transaction for the wrong amount. For example, you wro te the check for $156.29 but the bank processed the check for $159.29. They took $3.00 too much from your account. You cannot correct this issue by adjusting the check amount, because you didn't write the check for that amount. Likewise, you do not need to let Quicken prepare the \"balance adjustment\" for you. The balance adjustment prepared by Quicken is nothing more than a plug figure to force the account to balance. There is no audit trail with this process. To properly handle this issue, consider t he following: o Let us assume you are preparing the bank reconciliation for January 2013. o Open the register and record an entry in the register to reflect a transaction on the last business day of January. (Remember, you are reconciling through the end of t he month.) o The number column will be blank. o The payee column will be \"Bank Error.\" o In this case, the bank took $3.00 too much from your account, so you will need to record $3.00 in the payment column. o The memo line will reflect the check number that the bank processed in error. o Return to the reconciliation process and mark this entry as cleared, along with the check that processed through the bank. o You must contact the bank to bring the error to their attention, and tell them to correct the error. o The $3. 00 will be shown as a shortage on the fund balance reconciliation since this represents an amount that Health Finance is not going to reimburse. o Unfortunately, errors of this nature usually take more than one month to resolve. Reprinting Previous Reconcili ations Occasionally you have the need to reprint the previous bank reconciliation. You can only do this for the last reconciliation performed. For example, it is February 2013. You prepared the January 2013 reconciliation a few days ago, but you have mi splaced the report. To reprint the report: select \"reports\" from the top row, below the blue Quicken title bar (not the reports icon). From the drop -down box, select \"cash flow.\" This will bring up another drop -down box; select \"reconciliation.\" Enter the report title (optional), and identify the report date. Remember, you want to \"Show reconciliation to bank balance as of\" the end of the month. For this example, you will use 01/31/2013. End of Year Close -out When should this be done ? This process is recommended at the end of the fiscal year in which the Office of Program Integrity performed an administrative audit. This occurs about every 3 years. 10-24 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 Why should we perform year -end closeout ? The year -end close out is designed to mi nimize the file size and therefore reduce the amount of time it takes to back -up your account data. It therefore minimizes the amount of data loss in the event of hardware or software failure. How do we perform Year -end close out ? (Steps to start a new year - Quicken 2003 version) Open register Click \"File\" (at the top of the screen, below the blue Quicken title bar) Click \"File Operations\" Click \"Year -end Copy\" Click \"Start New Year.\" (Read this screen. It will help you understand what we are trying t o accomplish.) Type in file name for the backup. (I recommend county name and the year -end date (county 092012)). Type in \"start date\" where prompted. (Use 09/30/2012 in this example.) Identify file to use for New Year (this should be the default). What does this process do ? It sends everything up to 09/30/2012 (in this example) to a file (a backup file). The computer identifies the \"cleared\" balance as of 09/30/2012 and uses it as the \"opening\" balance for the New Year's file. Any transactions prior to 09/30/2012 that have not cleared the bank will be listed in the New Year's file and also in the old file. (These outstanding items will be listed in the new file, probably before the cleared balance of 09/30/2012 but this is OK. Also, the check numbers and dates of transactions will be pulled forward.) When the outstanding items clear the bank, you will not have to go back to the old file. (When the item is cleared, it will only be listed in the new file since you are no longer working in the old file.) Backups Backups of your data should be performed monthly. Store backup data in a secure location. 10-25 ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 CHAPTER 11 MISCELLANEOUS BANK ACCOUNTS ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FEE SYSTEM MANUAL Revised August 2013 Type s of Miscellaneou s Bank Account s includ e but are not limite d to: Buildin g Fund Child Restraint Employe e Fund Specia l Bank Accounts - Indigent - Marc h of Dimes - Donation The Buildin g Fund: Maintain s funds.
