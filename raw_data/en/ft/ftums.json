Homeopathic remedies are extremely diluted medicines that stimulate a healing response within your body. The very small concentrations lead to a response in which the remedy will cure the condition it would otherwise cause in larger doses. This is the principle of \"like curing like.\" The symptoms you are experiencing are a window to the right homeopathic remedy for you. Homeopathic medicine follows the naturopathic philosophy of working with your body's own healing mechanisms. Homeopathy is available at the [Sonoran University Medical Center](http://patients.sonoran.edu/medical-center/). "}
