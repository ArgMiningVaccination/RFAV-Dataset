Chronic coughing, sneezing, and sniffling can be frustrating. People dealing with allergy symptoms often want to find ways to treat the problem naturally. Patients should always speak with a healthcare provider to learn more about [allergy medication](https://renuerx.com/understanding-medication-allergies/) and supplement options. Additionally, there are 5 natural options that may be worth looking into. 1. Bromelain This supplement is an enzyme mixture that comes from the stem and fruit of a pineapple. [Bromelain](https://www.healthline.com/health/bromelain) is commonly used as a natural way to decrease inflammation and swelling. This can work in the nasal passages to thin mucus and make breathing easier. Bromelain can work particularly well when coupled with medication for sinus infections. 2. Stinging nettle This botanical supplement contains a mix of vitamin K, carotene, and quercetin. [Stinging nettle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5963652/) is a common supplement for allergy symptom relief, especially in cases of hay fever. The plant can help to reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms such as sneezing, watery or itchy eyes, and a runny nose. 3. Quercetin One of the ingredients in the stinging nettle plant, quercetin is also found in wine and many fruits and vegetables. The supplement can work as a natural antihistamine, decreasing inflammation. While research is still ongoing, preliminary studies have found the supplement works well and has few side effects for most patients. 4. Butterbur One of the most popular natural remedies for allergies, [butterbur](https://www.webmd.com/diet/features/allergies-allergy) has some of the most evidence of working to treat allergies. The herb helps to block some of the chemicals that can lead to swelling in the nasal passages, causing a stuffed up nose or sneezing. Some research has even shown that butterbur can be just as effective at treating allergy symptoms as over-the-counter antihistamines. 5. Vitamin D Most people know the benefits of vitamin D for boosting bone health and improving mood. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22192170) has also shown a link between vitamin D, immune function, and the development of allergies. One study found that patients who were deficient in the vitamin experienced allergy symptom improvement from taking a supplement. What else can I do? Besides taking supplements, people can make some lifestyle changes to relieve [allergy symptoms](https://www.webmd.com/diet/features/allergies-allergy) naturally. Pay attention to allergy triggers and work to remove [pollen](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322256), dust, or other allergens from the home.
