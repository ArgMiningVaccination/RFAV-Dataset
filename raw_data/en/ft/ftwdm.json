Keywords: Food Allergy, Peanut Allergy, Childhood Asthma, Swasa Roga, Aahar Asatmyata Introduction Peanut Allergy is a type of food allergy to peanuts which is different from tree nut allergies, with peanuts being legumes and not true nuts. It occurs due to a type I hypersensitivity reaction of the immune system. It is recognized as one of the most severe food allergies due to its prevalence, persistence, and potential severity of allergic reaction. The allergic reaction occurs due to the presence of proteins in the peanut that bind to IgE antibodies of the person's immune system. This triggers the person's immune defence system, leading to reactions that can be mild or very severe. The symptoms of peanut allergy can occur within seconds of ingestion, with peak occurrence by 30 minutes. Major target organs of an allergic reaction include the gastrointestinal tract (GI), respiratory tracts and skin. The symptoms are relevant to a food allergy when ingestion occurs in the appropriate time frame expected for food-induced allergic reactions. The strict avoidance of a particular food allergen can place a significant burden on a patient's quality of life.
