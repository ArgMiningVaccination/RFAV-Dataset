Overview: This page is for disputing the existence of terms or senses. It is for requests for attestation of a term or a sense, leading to deletion of the term or a sense unless an editor proves that the disputed term or sense meets the attestation criterion as specified in [Criteria for inclusion](/wiki/Wiktionary:CFI#Attestation), usually by providing citations from three durably archived sources. Requests for deletion based on the claim that the term or sense is nonidiomatic or \"sum of parts\" should be posted to [Wiktionary:Requests for deletion](/wiki/Wiktionary:Requests_for_deletion). Requests to confirm that a certain etymology is correct should go in the [Etymology scriptorium](/wiki/Wiktionary:ES), and requests to confirm pronunciation is correct should go in the [Tea Room](/wiki/Wiktionary:TR). Adding a request: To add a request for verification (attestation), add the template {{ or [rfv](/wiki/Template:rfv)}} {{ to the questioned entry, and then [rfv-sense](/wiki/Template:rfv-sense)}} [make a new section here](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Wiktionary:Requests_for_verification/English&action=edit\u00a7ion=new). Those who would seek attestation after the term or sense is nominated will appreciate your doing at least a cursory check for such attestation before nominating it: [Google Books](https://books.google.com/) is a good place to check, others are listed [here (WT:SEA)](/wiki/Wiktionary:Searchable_external_archives). Answering a request by providing an attestation: To attest a disputed term, i.e. prove that the term is actually used and satisfies the requirement of attestation as specified in [inclusion criteria](/wiki/Wiktionary:CFI#Attestation), do one of the following: - Assert that the term is in clearly widespread use. (If this assertion is not obviously correct, or is challenged by multiple editors, it will likely be ignored, necessitating the following step.) - Cite, on the article page, usage of the word in [permanently recorded media](/wiki/Wiktionary:List_of_searchable_archives), conveying meaning, in at least three independent instances spanning at least a year. (Many languages are subject to other requirements; see [WT:CFI](/wiki/Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion#Number_of_citations).) In any case, advise on this page that you have placed the citations on the entry page. Closing a request: After a discussion has sat for more than a month without being \"cited\", or after a discussion has been \"cited\" for more than a week without challenge, the discussion may be closed. Closing a discussion normally consists of the following actions: - Deleting or removing the entry or sense (if it failed), or de-tagging it (if it passed). In either case, the edit summary or deletion summary should indicate what is happening. - Adding a comment to the discussion here with either RFV failed or RFV passed (emboldened), indicating what action was taken. This makes automatic archiving possible. Some editors strike out the discussion header at this time. In some cases, the disposition is more complicated than simply \"RFV failed\" or \"RFV passed\" (for example, two senses may have been nominated, of which only one was cited). Archiving a request: At least a week after a request has been closed, if no one has objected to its disposition, the request should be archived to the entry's talk page. This is usually done using the [aWa](/wiki/MediaWiki:Gadget-aWa.js/documentation) gadget, which can be enabled at [WT:PREFS](/wiki/Wiktionary:PREFS).

[DCDuring](/wiki/User:DCDuring) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:DCDuring)) 16:07, 19 March 2023 (UTC) - Modern taxonomy is based on cladistics, so subgenera should all be clades- by definition. The taxonomic literature is full of articles explaining why subdivisions at one rank or another aren't natural clades and are therefore invalid. The only way this sense wouldn't fit under sense 1 would be if there was a subdivision of a genus that wasn't itself a clade, i.e., containing part, but not all of more than one clade. As for haplogroups, they would presumably be clades, but I'm certainly not well read at all in the literature that discusses haplogroups, so I don't know if subclades are part of the terminology. - This has all the markings of a guess by someone skimming through a subject they knew nothing about- which describes a great deal of SemperBlotto's work in the life sciences.

Only we and those who seem to be copying us, have this definition. Etymologically gobio is an inflected form of gobius (\"gudgeon\"), but gobius has been appropriated for fish that somewhat resemble gudgeons, but are not very closely related. I am not sure how to find instances of use of this mistaken def. or whether to call it mistaken.

I can also find goby used in the names of various other fish which Wikipedia assigns to the family Oxudercidae, not Gobiidae, but on closer inspection Wikipedia seems to regard those families as interchangeable.

Freshwater Fishes of North-eastern Australia has Stenogobius psilosinionus as bare \"goby\", and Awaous acritosus (which a book which refer to Kessler's goby as being in Gobio, but this is outdated as it has been reassigned as Romanogobio kesslerii.

April 2023[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Wiktionary:Requests_for_verification/English&action=edit\u00a7ion=7)] I am adding another RFV for the English word [suffusion](/wiki/suffusion#English), sense 4, a flush of red color on the surface of an object. It's possible that both this and the unfilled French sense are both medical senses, perhaps specifically meaning a suffusion of blood in both languages, visible from the surface of the skin in some cases if someone has a particularly serious infection under the skin. Thats just a guess though. I wasnt able to turn up anything obvious in which the word suffusion by itself in English refers to blushing or subcutaneous bleeding or anything else that could turn skin red, nor could i find reference to inanimate objects turning red without the word red being juxtaposed to make it clear.

But I will say this: To me, any English speaker who goes out of their way to use anything other than ['](/wiki/%27)(straight apostrophe) or ['](/wiki/%E2%80%99)(basic curl) in their running text has the requisite intent to create an alternative form. Diversity of apostrophes is absolutely LOATHED both on Wiktionary itself and by the typographical-industrial complex (lol). If you use anything but those two apostrophes, you're gonna get an internet comment section worth of sand kicked in your face. And there apparently seem to be such cases of authors going out of their way to use the backtick, at least for [Hawai`i](/wiki/Hawai%60i). So I would preliminarily support keeping this in an RFV or an RFD, pending some kind of cultural-linguistic investigation to figure out the mindset behind why this backtick form is out there. The investigation would look into whether this is purely some accomodation to keyboard issues or is perhaps in some situations a bona fide expression of authorial intent-- the intended form they wanted to write, maybe an \"alternate [okina](/wiki/%CA%BBokina)\" or a \"layman's okina\". nevermind! -- [Geographyinitiative](/wiki/User:Geographyinitiative)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Geographyinitiative)) 17:13, 19 May 2023 (UTC) (Modified) - From my point of view, the backtick has an established (although deprecated) use as a representation of the opening quotation mark (cf. Wikipedia: \" [As surrogate of apostrophe or (opening) single quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtick#As_surrogate_of_apostrophe_or_(opening)_single_quote)\"). I've seen some old-fashioned people who routinely write (or wrote) quotes `like this'; they aren't going out of their way to do it, that's just how they were used to representing quotation marks.

Therefore, I would not see \"Hawai`i\" as a contrastive alternative to \"Hawaii\", but just an alternative representation of the same sequence of graphemes, used by people who find it more convenient to type the character as ` or who aren't familiar with the correct codepoint to use.-- [Urszag](/wiki/User:Urszag)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Urszag)) 19:07, 19 May 2023 (UTC) - And my follow up to this kind of \"merely an convenient accomodation\" theory might be: that this usage could have \"started out\" that way, but later bloomed into something with a real cultural connection and real cultural use (or perhaps nascent use?). Check those cites, because we're not talking stale stuff here. The Twitter account of the Governor of Hawai`i uses it: [Office of the Governor, State of Hawai`i](https://twitter.com/GovHawaii).

That's evidence for exactly the phenomenon that Urszag is talking about. The League of Women Voters of Hawaii also uses [the straight apostrophe](/wiki/%27)and the [left single quotation mark](/wiki/%E2%80%98). I'm guessing that's from different people working on different parts of the page, which could be interpreted either way. The YouTube video consistently uses the backtick. The NPS page uses the backtick in the body, but the apostrophe in the sentence at the end. The Surf Art page uses the backtick when referring to the island, but the [right single quotation mark](/wiki/%E2%80%99)in the name of the University of Hawaii. The comment sections of the NYTimes Learning Network blog mostly use the backtick, but some commenters use the right single quotation mark or the [turned comma/okina](/wiki/%CA%BB). Taken as a whole, there's usage that can't be explained as OCR errors, but it's also all over the map as far as which character is used. It looks more like no one really knows the right character, so they use whatever they have handy. Not particularly compelling one way or the other.

Same thing with [a version that uses a standard English apostrophe](/wiki/Hawai%27i).

On the other hand, this is for English users within English trying to understand where this mark came from.

In this case, someone looking up [Drzewieccy](/wiki/Drzewieccy)could understand it from the #Polish entry even if there's not an #English entry, but what if English-language texts were using a similar -y plural of a Russian surname, like \"M. and I. [Putiny](/w/index.php?title=Putiny&action=edit&redlink=1)and their son A. Putin\"? The Russian entry is at [](/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B#Russian)(P\u00fatiny) so [Putiny](/w/index.php?title=Putiny&action=edit&redlink=1)is unintelligible without an entry. And we do include, say, [Smiths](/wiki/Smiths)as the plural of [Smith](/wiki/Smith). And/but in French it'd be different (Poutiny). If both were attested, would the act of transliteration make something like Putiny more keepable than something like Drzewieccy? What about if the name were spelled in Polish with diacritics but English dropped the diacritic but kept the -y? Mehhh. For given names we gesture at a not-well-defined distinction between ~\"was born in an English-speaking country where their birth was recorded in English and in Latin letters\" (which makes it an \"English name from Russian\" or whatever, like [Sasha](/wiki/Sasha)) vs \"was born in countries where it would've been spelled in e.g. Cyrillic and then transliterated\" (like [Yaroslav](/wiki/Yaroslav)), or both matches your \"native Polish\" vs \"Polish Americans\" distinction here, but (although not in this rare name's case, yet in other cases) names in fiction then complicate things again... if English authors populate non-Earth fantasy or sci-fi worlds with the occasional Yaroslav (or use a 'non-English' plural for their surnames), with no indication the characters are considered to all have birth certificates saying , is that still a \"transliteration\" or is it now a name? (Do we try and cleave off \"names used in fiction\" as a third thing distinct from real names and transliterations of names? But then, are we also splitting Harry into \"A real given name\" and \"A fictional given name\"? No, that's probably not wise.) Sorry, thinking aloud!

There does seem to be at least something worth saving, but even one site where I saw \"witfish\" used to describe albula indica also uses it for another fish called Teniae dictae, also calling that \"witt fish\" and week fish ( [weakfish](/wiki/weakfish)?) which suggests it may never have had a pinned down definition like what we normally expect with species names.

[Equinox](/wiki/User:Equinox) [](/wiki/User_talk:Equinox) 02:04, 3 June 2023 (UTC) - I created this mostly because Spanish [-lotodo](/wiki/-lotodo)exists and at the time I was pretty sure I could at least turn up hits for [eat-it-all](/w/index.php?title=eat-it-all&action=edit&redlink=1). I do think that [know-it-all](/wiki/know-it-all)can be analyzed as know + -it-all, and that the -it-all suffix should be analyzed as a unit. I could explain why if anyone is interested, but it's not important for this RFV if we can't turn up more examples. Still, since [know-it-all](/wiki/know-it-all)is amply cited, I'm not sure how exactly I would go about verifying this suffix in isolation? There will never be three cites for [-it-all](/wiki/-it-all)because it can't stand alone as a word. But there are three cites for [know-it-all](/wiki/know-it-all)and there could be many more. Thanks, [\u2014](/wiki/User:Soap) [Soap](/wiki/User_talk:Soap) [\u2014](/wiki/Special:Contributions/Soap)05:44, 3 June 2023 (UTC) - I would rather defend both this and [-all](/wiki/-all)at an RFD. Expecting me to find three cites for [-it-all](/wiki/-it-all)in isolation is an impossible hurdle because people don't normally use bound morphemes that way. By the same logic we could delete [-o-](/wiki/-o-). I assume that's not your intent. But, if we accept that a use of a word with an affix counts as use of that affix, then this passes automatically because [know-it-all](/wiki/know-it-all)exists and has three cites.

Indeed, the CFI criteria dont mention affixes at all, so I wonder if this RFV should even be here. If we decide to go forward with it, though, I'd say it's cited, as three uses of [know-it-all](/wiki/know-it-all)imply three uses of [-it-all](/wiki/-it-all). If we say otherwise, then we're making up a new policy on the spot, and applying it retroactively to a pre-existing discussion.

I will look for more words, ... [do-it-all](/w/index.php?title=do-it-all&action=edit&redlink=1)clearly fits the pattern. I've held off on [eat-it-all](/w/index.php?title=eat-it-all&action=edit&redlink=1)because Im not finding it in the sense I expected .... but I'm fairly confident I can find another word. I only ask that someone write into the CFI page that an affix subject to RFV needs to pass the test of being used in three distinct words, and that those three words do not need to have three cites apiece. In other words, that we don't need two layers of RFV's. As this is how I understand the reply to my other statement below.

[DCDuring](/wiki/User:DCDuring)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:DCDuring)) 11:21, 3 June 2023 (UTC) - Thanks, Im pretty sure I could find two other words within the next month if they're not bound by a 3x3 criterion. For example, do-it-all exists, and has much the same meaning as [hacelotodo](/wiki/hacelotodo#Spanish). But I don't want to yield so easily, as this isn't in our CFI policy at all, and if we're making up policy on the fly, at the end of the month people could just say that it isn't enough and we're going to delete the page anyway. Our current CFI page makes no mention of needing anything more than three cites for a given word, and makes no mention of affixes at all. I'd say that either affixes should be treated as words, in which case this passes solely through [know-it-all](/wiki/know-it-all), or this should be moved to RFD as should [-all](/wiki/-all).

One term is not enough to make a suffix. - I agree with DCDuring that we need three instances of a putative suffix being used (if all we have are three cites of the term foobar-baz, there's no reason to have an entry [-baz](/w/index.php?title=-baz&action=edit&redlink=1)because it doesn't exist independent of foobar-baz). And it would need to be being used as a suffix and not a (collocation of multiple elements of a) compound, blend, etc; I agree with Equinox that know-it-all is not a use of a suffix -it-all; as with e.g. [google books:\"a show-it-all\"](http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&q=%22a+show-it-all%22), it looks like know/show + it + all, not know + *-it-all \u2014 compare [forget-me-not](/wiki/forget-me-not), which is not forget + *-me-not! [- -sche](/wiki/User:-sche) [(discuss)](/wiki/User_talk:-sche)20:41, 5 June 2023 (UTC) - I stand by what I've written, and I still strongly oppose deleting [-all](/wiki/-all)as I've said below, but when I created this page I was sure [eat-it-all](/w/index.php?title=eat-it-all&action=edit&redlink=1)would be easy to find cites for, and it's clearly not the case. It's the name of an ice cream company I remember from childhood, still in use as a label but long since defunct as a company. But it stuck in my mind somehow and I was sure that it would be the translation of Fr mangetout and Sp [comelotodo](/wiki/comelotodo). In fact, it seems the best translation for those words is [eat-all](/w/index.php?title=eat-all&action=edit&redlink=1). And Sp lo isnt a perfect semantic match for Eng it anyway. So, while with show-it-all (thank you, -sche) and [know-it-all](/wiki/know-it-all)we have two words, and I found a few people using do-it-all, I'd rather just let this go. If people decide to keep it listed anyway, I won't oppose that, but I've essentially lost interest.

[Equinox](/wiki/User:Equinox) [](/wiki/User_talk:Equinox) 02:04, 3 June 2023 (UTC) - If it isnt a suffix then what would it be? It creates nouns from verbs. And although all can be a noun, it isnt a noun in the sense that's used here, since the all in \"catch-all\", \"cure-all\", and so on is the object of the verb, not the agent. If this were a simple compound, then \"all\" would be the head, so \"catch-all\" would need to mean \"an all that catches\", and so on, which is not what it means. I oppose deletion on grammatical grounds, but this seems like an RFD question more so than RFV, because as above, how would we turn up three cites for [-all](/wiki/-all)in isolation? Best regards, [\u2014](/wiki/User:Soap) [Soap](/wiki/User_talk:Soap) [\u2014](/wiki/Special:Contributions/Soap)05:48, 3 June 2023 (UTC) - Just wanted to point out - that \"[i]f this were a simple compound, then 'all' would be the head, so 'catch-all' would need to mean 'an all that catches'\" isn't particularly true, in terms of V+(Pro)N compounding in English. There is an inherent error to this argument, viz. a compound is a lexicalised object and cannot be analysed phrasally. But more importantly, please consider the following six (Group A): [pickpocket](/wiki/pickpocket#English), not \"a pocket that picks,\" but [daredevil](/wiki/daredevil#English), not \"a \"one devil\"; [spoilsport](/wiki/spoilsport#English), not \"a sport that spoils\", but \"one who the sport (=entertainment)\"; [killjoy](/wiki/killjoy#English), not \"a joy that kills\", but \"one joy\"; [breakfast](/wiki/breakfast#English), not \"a that but \"one fast\"; [pastime](/wiki/pastime#English), not \"a time that passes,\" but \"that which is done to pass the time\"; - - and the following (Group B): [singsong](/wiki/singsong#English), \"a piece of verse\" < \"an instance of singing a song\" = \"song - of 'go ahead!'\" only be parsed as \"N that V\", then none of the above would be valid compounds, and -pocket, -devil, etc., by your reasoning, would have to be considered as suffixes. (Along the same line, V+ProN compounds like [do-little](/wiki/do-little#English), [do-nothing](/wiki/do-nothing#English), [know-nothing](/wiki/know-nothing#English)also exist and conform to Group A, as well as [say-so](/wiki/say-so#English), which conforms to Group B. If -all should be analysed as a suffix it would only seem fair for -nothing, -little, and -so to also follow suit.) This is obviously infeasible. Catch-all, know-it-all, etc., in fact follows the exact same wordformation pattern as those in Group A; I don't particularly see why they shouldn't be analysed as compounds as well. - Cheers, [](/wiki/User:Fawknerfawk)fawk. [tell me](/wiki/User_talk:Fawknerfawk)if i did anything wrong. 12:53, 3 June 2023 (UTC) - Yes Im familiar with endocentric compounds. I see a few differences between those words and the words using [-all](/wiki/-all)and [-it-all](/wiki/-it-all). I'll just treat Group A together: - These compounds always omit a linking word. In all cases but the first, the patient is indefinite, so the missing word is the. Nobody says *break-the-fast. - These compounds always have the second element as a noun, whereas [-it-all](/wiki/-it-all)and [-all](/wiki/-all)end with what I would prefer to call a determiner, although I guess there is some debate about that. However this point may be irrelevant so I wont stress it. - Most importantly, though, in these compounds, both morphemes are fixed. [breakfast](/wiki/breakfast#English)is a word familiar to anyone, but outside of ad-hoc coinages, nobody says *makefast or *breakmeal. By contrast, [-it-all](/wiki/-it-all)and [-all](/wiki/-all)can attach to multiple words. Only one morpheme is free. I admit that this helps me understand why it is important, as stated above, that [-it-all](/wiki/-it-all)cannot pass CFI just based on [know-it-all](/wiki/know-it-all). Maybe this paragraph is the only really important thing in my reply, but I want to make clear why I'm being so insistent. - As for the others .... Group B just looks like another instance of the Group A pattern to me. I guess it's not endocentric, but it is head-first, which is the most relevant characteristic of English endocentrics as it is the one that's shared by constructions such as [know-it-all](/wiki/know-it-all). As for Group C, I'd say it's just a lexicalized quote; it's not a compound at all, any more than [thank-you](/wiki/thank-you)is. - That's all I have to say for now.

Going by should also be considered a suffix. [](/wiki/User:Fawknerfawk)fawk. [tell me](/wiki/User_talk:Fawknerfawk)if i did anything wrong. 13:48, 3 June 2023 (UTC) - I would say [-nothing](/w/index.php?title=-nothing&action=edit&redlink=1)qualifies as a suffix, yes, although your last word is another lexicalized quote, and doesnt form a set with the rest. Perhaps being two syllables long explains the scarcity of examples. If [naught](/wiki/naught)weren't archaic, perhaps we'd have more words like [dreadnought](/wiki/dreadnought). - Regarding the pronouns ... if all and it-all are pronouns, it seems hard to argue that expressions ending in them could be nominal compounds, even endocentric ones. But I get the impression there are more than two sides here, and we have as many opinions as we have people in this thread. [\u2014](/wiki/User:Soap) [Soap](/wiki/User_talk:Soap) [\u2014](/wiki/Special:Contributions/Soap)18:39, 3 June 2023 (UTC) - yes, good-for-nothing doesn't fall in with other verb-headed -nothings, that was on me; but I don't get why you'd classify it as a \"lexicalised quote.\" (Also - circling back a little - I don't know if compounding necessarily excludes lexicalised quotes, but maybe we are operating under different theoretical frameworks.) - I also fail to see why \"if all and it-all are pronouns, it seems hard to argue that expressions ending in them could be nominal compounds\". All, it-all being pronouns doesn't say anything against compounds, per Bloomfield's definition of endo- and exo-centric compounding. - I'm sorry that I'm probably dragging this discussion unwelcomedly long; I didn't have time to properly respond to your previous reply, and I keep being distracted by the smaller points we're making. Mostly I'm just really confused as to why you would insist that know-it-all, catch-all and do-nothing are stem+suffix constructions, when they are semantically and syntactically motivated in the exact same way as daredevil and pickpocket. (the point 1 you made in your previous reply was a non-argument, as English pronouns like all or nothing cannot take determiners in the first place.) [](/wiki/User:Fawknerfawk)fawk.

The last has no hyphen, but as it is a noun, and does not mean \"an all that is over\", it can only be using the same [-all](/wiki/-all)suffix as the other two words. More examples can be found ... there is an expression the end-all be-all, though I don't know how often those words are untethered. Collins lists cover-all, with or without hyphen, to describe a similar garment to overalls. - As for the original question of why this is a suffix, I think I've amply addressed that above.

You would be yourself an [autist](/wiki/autist)if you assumed that people actually mean what they claim. - Nowadays in developed countries those who continue to practice religion have a general awareness that they are phoneys, but it works. So contrary to how discourse makes it appear, choice of religion is secondary to previously fostered social convictions. The occurrence patterns of religiosity, i.e. communication that indicates allegiance to a god of choice, have been [studied in their environments with the observation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00691-9)of their being \"determined by the need to moralize others and ultimately by the level of social trust (i.e., what people think of others' level of cooperation)\". Consistent with this observation, that everyone is directed towards in practice, Wiktionary already defines the particular sense of \" [belief](/wiki/belief)\" in question as \"religious faith\" and the sense of \" [faith](/wiki/faith)\" as \"a religious or spiritual belief system\", probably not even circularily referring to the same sense of \"belief\": the system character is substantial, the religiosity or spirituality [accidental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident_(philosophy)). Hence, religion is the adherence to a cult, by definition structured around supernatural entities. You can thus define an atheist as someone not believing in a cult, i.e. the value systems espoused by it. Do you really think that people are that decided about particular meaning restrictions as provided in our dictionary entry [atheist](/wiki/atheist)when they use the word? The proscribed sense, which comes to the mind of @ [Andrew Sheedy](/wiki/User:Andrew_Sheedy)as that of the lot of people and thus attains the greatest support of usage as opposed to mention that deliberates about the term, is with this footing the only sense, the rest is theology, to be rejected as partisan instead of descriptive. - Consequentially, [freedom of religion](/wiki/freedom_of_religion)is incorrectly comprehended as someone's freedom \"to carry out any practices in accordance with those beliefs\", since people don't even causally act on beliefs which don't exist, and such specific provisions cannot be a mere [general power of competence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_power_of_competence)on religious grounds. So in spite of the more popular definition, containing a confused causality, the minority definition in legal literature is more accurate, according to which freedom of religion is only freedom to perform ritual acts, exercitium religionis and devotio domestica, which has been [defined](https://archive.org/details/der-begriff-des-exercitium-religionis-publicum)since the [Peace of Westphalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia).

While it is in any legal opinion that religion as opposed to [weltanschauung](/wiki/weltanschauung)is distinguished by making reference to deities or at least [transcendental](/wiki/transcendental)reference, so I repeat that belief in a deity is accessory to religiousness and the distinction in our entry nonsensical.

If people claim they ascribe truth to their god it is actually to manipulate people in the desired direction as they believe in the commandments and recommendations structured around the particular god figure and thus ascribe truth to them; [value judgments](/wiki/value_judgment)and [factual claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de:Tatsachenbehauptung)are And [perlocutionary](/wiki/perlocutionary) [speech acts](/wiki/speech_act)also use to look exactly the same as any statement. The gods a religion has are just brand variations: Like if I like to wear [A Bathing Ape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bathing_Ape)because of the qualities and fits and designs and flex and attitude transmitted by items etc. I believe in that ape and the A Bathing Ape\u00ae and BAPE logos and their powers\u2014what does that even mean? It is a breviloquence for what I exactly believe in, that this is the top brand to wear. Religion is also presented in the demeanours of people like clothing, rather than being believed by anyone only in its naked [main character](/wiki/main_character). Hence \"A person who does not believe in any religion\" is the only definition of [atheist](/wiki/atheist). Because people don't believe in gods, as only symbolic for the complete religion. It wouldn't make sense to say, e.g., I believe in the Christian God, without ascribing some traditional properties to him which then serve as a guideline to behaviour and then make an [ingroup](/wiki/ingroup)and [outgroup](/wiki/outgroup); and even if you believe in only some kind of God then you have an ingroup of religious people and outgroup of nonreligious people, people see similarities between him who believes in a god and them who don't: as this is still a distinction in how people operate, it was a requirement to be categorized as [gottgl\u00e4ubig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gottgl%C3%A4ubig)to be [in the SS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_aspects_of_Nazism). - You could instead add a particular language rule, gloss or usage note, to \" [believe](/wiki/believe)\" as applied to the brands created by religions, but then the \" [true](/wiki/true)\" linked in its first definition \"to accept as true\" has enough diverse meanings. If people believe in this or that god, they accept his system as \"genuine; legitimate, valid\" or \"fair, unbiased\". So don't people comprehend gods as \"conforming to the actual state of reality or fact\"? In spite of being meaningless due to facts and reality never being some otherworld, which itself would have to be interconnected with the real world, the idea pops in, only to reinforce the religion by [motte and bailey](/wiki/motte_and_bailey); in no case the alleged beliefs in gods are exclusively in them without even their religions. The quotes given for the \"belief in god\" senses of [atheist](/wiki/atheist)can easily be analyzed as \"somebody who does not support, i.e. consciously furthers the practical effect of, the religion of a particular brand having the god X\". And [agnostic](/wiki/agnostic)is someone who is doubtful or uncertain what he does of religious teachings.

[Equinox](/wiki/User:Equinox) [](/wiki/User_talk:Equinox)23:19, 11 June 2023 (UTC) - @ [Equinox](/wiki/User:Equinox): I make the claims extra-easy for Equinox: Nobody is advancing deities without religion. When arguing something with reference to gods specifically vs. their religions, adherents of them play [motte and bailey](/wiki/motte_and_bailey). Ultimately the goal is to further or reject a religion. If the context of quotes is broad enough we may witness this lack of the former meaning in each individual case. Why is a [Christian](/wiki/Christian)according to Wiktionary one who \"believes in Christianity\", a whole religion, or one \"who seeks to live his or her life according\" to the founder's church while an atheist can be one merely rejects any deity of the religion? This distinction is contradictory and contrafactual\u2014an atheist is conceptualized by the language community as someone who does not ascribe to a religion even if people aren't that explicit about it as I can. People aren't that exact and speak in figures. (Elaborated in detail.) - So we should change the definitions of \" [atheist](/wiki/atheist)\" to e.g. after our current structure \"A person who does not ascribe [or adheres] to a religions\", broader sense: doubts whether he should follow one\", loose sense: \"one who is unaware of the reality of religions\", uncommon sense \"a person who does not ascribe to a particular religion (but may ascribe to another one)\". Religions are supported like football clubs. They all believe very much in their teams. And because they have been so pervasive, we have this term for outsiders.

Or do you think there's a better way of wording the definition that captures this sense better? [Andrew Sheedy](/wiki/User:Andrew_Sheedy)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Andrew_Sheedy)) 17:26, 17 July 2023 (UTC) - @ [Andrew Sheedy](/wiki/User:Andrew_Sheedy): Buddhists in most parts of the world do in fact \"believe in deities or gods\", as sense 1 has it\u2014see the whole wp article on [Buddhist deities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_deities)\u2014so listing atheists alongside Buddhists is not proof of much. Sense 1 also fits fine for the Beaman and Seidman quotes. I don't think there's anything wrong with the wording of the sense if it can actually be verified, but as far as I can tell what the quotation selection actually seems to be getting at atm is atheist meaning \"an opponent of religion\" (rather than just not believing), but since opponents of religion in general will almost by definition be atheists according to sense 1 anyway that's quite hard to disentangle as a separate sense. \u2014 [Al-Muqanna](/wiki/User:Al-Muqanna) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Al-Muqanna)) 17:43, 17 July 2023 (UTC) - @ [Al-Muqanna](/wiki/User:Al-Muqanna): I see your point, though from my (admittedly limited) studies of Buddhism, my understanding is that those aren't deities or gods in the normal sense of the word, making the Wikipedia article a bit inaccurate. What the definition is trying to capture is the sense in which atheist is often used as a religious category, on par with \"Christian\" or \"Buddhist\". Many people would find the list, \"Christians, Hindus, Muslims, and people who believe in gods\" a bit incongruent (one would expect \"and other people who believe in gods\"), but not the list, \"Confucians, Taoists, Buddhists, and atheists,\" which suggests that for many people, \"atheist\" means not so much \"person who does not believe in a god\", but rather, \"person whose religious beliefs are that there is no god\". Note that the capitalization of \"Atheist\" in the 2002 quote supports the understanding that \"Atheism\" is a category of religious belief on par with Buddhism, rather than simply describing one aspect of religious belief, which could equally be applied in the strict sense to Buddhists. You may however be right about the two most recent quotes.

The way it reads now, it looks like we're endorsing the pedophiles' view of themselves as normal and anyone who opposes pedophilia as irrational. It's possible that this word could also be used to denote someone who sees imaginary pedophiles everywhere, as I hinted at in my first post, such that they could be described as having an irrational fear of pedophiles. I would consider such a usage to be completely separate from the use implied by the cite at [pedophobic](/wiki/pedophobic), where it should be clear from context that it means anyone who opposes pedophilia (NAMBLA is an organization that supports legalizing pedophilia). However Im not sure we have a term for what I call the irrational sense, as such people can be described as paranoid or overprotective.

However, no lemmings contain an entry for this word. And the ngram evidence is striking. Even raw Google result numbers indicate that the \"correct\" form vastly outnumbers the \"wrong\" form.

It's true that the sum of its Ancient Greek parts adds up to \"in the form of a porcupine\", but he got the taxonomic rank all wrong. The term really refers to one of the major subdivisions of the world's rodents (it has to do with jaw muscles being of the type that porcupines have), which includes [a very small] part of the hystricomorphs, pretty much all of the Google Books hits I've seen refer to things that are definitely not [Old World porcupines](/wiki/Old_World_porcupine) as hystricomorphs. I was tempted to just change it, but the definition has been there for almost a decade and a half and it's theoretically possible that someone, somewhere has used it in this sense sometime in the past few centuries. The hard part is going to be figuring out which sense is meant in passages that mention only porcupines, since this sense is, by definition, a subset of the wider one- all [Old World porcupines](/wiki/Old_World_porcupine) are hystricomorphs in both senses.

I couldnt find anything specificallyabout a seal as the whole animal, though, just the seal's head emblazon. All other hits on Wikisource seem to be using seal in the sense of a design.

For example: - How the Tin Man Found His Brain: One Attorney's Path for Perceptual Development, by Danute Debney Shaw (2020). Admittedly, the Tin Man character in the story book was missing a *heart*, not a brain, but a somewhat off-key reference is still a reference, right? - Heartless as a Tin Man, by Kendra Moreno (2021). More true to the original Tin Man's character. - Tin Man: Memoirs of a Sociopath, by Barbara Peterson (2015). - Heart of the Tin Man: The Collected Writings of Jack Haley, by Jack Haley and Mitchell Cohen (2000). - That's four direct uses of the phrase just looking at book titles, not even in the text of the books. That should be sufficient to show widespread figurative usage outside the context of the Oz universe. - Also, I found this first, and it seems perhaps unnecessary now, but I didnt want to waste the effort ... does [this Star Trek episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_Man_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation))count?

The term has persisted mainly in Scots (which, as we recall, is not clearly distinguished from Scottish English by OED).

[- -sche](/wiki/User:-sche) [(discuss)](/wiki/User_talk:-sche) 08:09, 13 July 2023 (UTC) - Murrey and sanguine are usually regarded as the same tincture\u2014a dark, purplish or brownish red, vaguely defined and rarely seen, while tenn\u00e9 is orange or brownish yellow. I forget if the poetic notion of blazoning by jewels for nobility and planets for royalty is discussed in Fox-Davies or Boutell\u2014I'm sure I have a good source or two for this in my library\u2014but if memory serves, sardonyx is sanguine (since sard is dark red, not yellow) while tenn\u00e9 is represented by jacinth (hyacinth\u2014the stone, not the flower, obviously). The same two tinctures are the ones represented by \"dragon's head\" and \"dragon's tail\" (i.e. the constellations/asterisms Serpens Cauda, as the seven classical planets\u2014Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn\u2014were already used for or, argent, purpure, vert, gules, azure, and sable, respectively). However, I forget which is supposed to represent which, and in any case this use is almost entirely hypothetical; it will occur in various treatises on heraldry, but sanguine and tenn\u00e9 are hardly ever encountered in historical heraldry (modern heraldry probably makes some use of them), and the practice of blazoning by planets does not seem to have been very common even amongst royalty\u2014and I'm not aware of any royal arms containing sanguine or tenn\u00e9. However, I suspect that this theoretical use may be found in a lot of heraldic textbooks, so it's probably worth documenting, even if no real-world examples are known of \"dragon's head\" or \"dragon's tail\" can be found.

The OED has two quotes, and if I input long-enough snippets of them, I can find the works at Google Books, whereas I could not find any uses at all when I initially just searched Google Books for \"und\"/\"unds\"... which makes me suspect there may be at least one more cite out there that just isn't showing up in the results, in which case at least a combined sense would meet CFI.

And most serious students of heraldry will have run across them and perhaps remembered them even if no examples of their use are known (but to verify that, we'd need resources that simply aren't available online). So I think they need to be noted under their respective entries even if their use is entirely theoretical. Of course, that might be your intention, in which case I didn't need to say anything, but it'd be nice to know if that's the case! [P Aculeius](/wiki/User:P_Aculeius)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:P_Aculeius)) 17:19, 25 July 2023 (UTC) - In reviewing the entry for \"sardonyx\" in OED, I saw a citation to Legh, The Accedence of Armorie, 1562 for the heraldic use as an equivalent to sanguine, and on reviewing the book at Archive.org, I see that Legh (spelled \"Leigh\" in the book!) provides all four \"Iacinth\" at page 11, \"Dragons taile\" and \"Sardonix\" at page 12 (I note that this pagination treats each double-page spread as one page). No examples of their use are provided, although the arms of Hunzaker and Finers are cited as examples of English arms using tenn\u00e9, which I hadn't seen before. I did not search for \"und\", since I'm not sure where in the book to find it; you've already got the citations from the entry in OED, which I did check. [P Aculeius](/wiki/User:P_Aculeius)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:P_Aculeius)) 18:23, 25 July 2023 (UTC) - Also Woodward's Treatise on Heraldry (1892) has all of these terms.

Not sure how this occurred, as it contradicts all of the other sources I know of\u2014possibly plain error, or switched by mistake in the table. Besides being contrary to the other sources, it doesn't make sense in terms of the gems, since jacinth is yellow and sardonyx dark red, so I'm certain it's a mistake, even if I can't be sure how it was made. Shame, given that Woodward is really a lovely book! But given how blazon by jewels and planets is always a minor, if interesting detail, the mistake may simply have slipped through the editing process. I also note that our article in Wikipedia distinguishes sanguine and murrey, which I gather might be done in some sources\u2014but not in any of the ones cited here, all of which explicitly identify the two as the same colour. The article on tenn\u00e9 also needs some attention, as it seems to insist that the colour should be rendered as tan or brown, even while acknowledging that it's also identified with orange, and is usually depicted as orange in English (and American) heraldry.

Not sure how this occurred, as it contradicts all of the other sources I know of\u2014possibly plain error, or switched by mistake in the table. Besides being contrary to the other sources, it doesn't make sense in terms of the gems, since jacinth is yellow and sardonyx dark red, so I'm certain it's a mistake, even if I can't be sure how it was made. Shame, given that Woodward is really a lovely book! But given how blazon by jewels and planets is always a minor, if interesting detail, the mistake may simply have slipped through the editing process. I also note that our article in Wikipedia distinguishes sanguine and murrey, which I gather might be done in some sources\u2014but not in any of the ones cited here, all of which explicitly identify the two as the same colour. The article on tenn\u00e9 also needs some attention, as it seems to insist that the colour should be rendered as tan or brown, even while acknowledging that it's also identified with orange, and is usually depicted as orange in English (and American) heraldry. - @ - Alas, such mentions are also all I can find...

It's not even clear to me whether the quote supports this sense. It seems that it costs three halfpence to travel on the train, and there are two intending passengers, so \"two three-halfpennies\" is a metonymy for \"two three-halfpence fares\". In the mind of the speaker, it does seem as though \"three-halfpennies\" is in some respect the plural of \"three-halfpence\", or at least, \"three-halfpenny\" as an attributive form. - Sense 1 (\"a silver coin\") is conceptually, even if not linguistically, countable what would be the that and the other](/wiki/User:This,_that_and_the_other)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:This,_that_and_the_other)) 09:45, 14 July 2023 (UTC) - Yeah, in the 2011 quote, \"two three-halfpennies, please\" seems to be using \"two three-halfpennies\" elliptically to mean \"two fares of three-halfpennies\"; I'm sure I've seen other amount-terms used similarly to refer to the things which are those amounts, e.g. [google books:\"two dozens of\"](http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&q=%22two+dozens+of%22).

(The second instance, \"two fares (Margo and me) of three halfpennies each\", is arguably not using a lexeme three halfpennies at all, but rather two lexemes, halfpennies and then three to indicate how many of them.)

Some background: There is a tree, [Strychnos nux vomica](https://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strychnos_nux_vomica), that bears extremely poisonous seeds which are the original source of [strychnine](/wiki/strychnine). The name [nux vomica](/wiki/nux_vomica#English) is from Latin, and presumably refers to [emetic](/wiki/emetic) properties. For hundreds of years, [pharmacology](/wiki/pharmacology) mainly dealt with various plant, animal and mineral substances, all of which were named in Latin much as is still done in [taxonomy](/wiki/taxonomy). That would make [nux vomica](/wiki/nux_vomica) strictly a Translingual pharmacological term, except that it also has been used in English as a common name for the species. The English term [nux vomica](/wiki/nux_vomica#English) doesn't, however, refer literally and specifically to the seeds, as illustrated by the phrase \"nux vomica seeds\", which seems to be moderately attested. There is also a smattering of cites for \"nux vomicas\" (both with and without hyphens), some of which may refer to some concept in [homeopathy](/wiki/homeopathy) for [nux vomica](/wiki/nux_vomica#English) that we don't have a definition for, but none of which seem to refer specifically to more than one seed. I am thus challenging the term \" [nuces vomicae](/wiki/nuces_vomicae#English)\" as English. I think we should create a Translingual pharmacological-Latin entry for [nux vomica](/wiki/nux_vomica) and change this English plural entry to a Translingual plural entry to cover the existing usage. The English headword at [nux vomica](/wiki/nux_vomica) should be changed to have \"nux vomica\" and/or \"nux vomicas\" as the plural(s). The reason for the long explanation is that there's a decent amount of attested usage in English sentences, but as citation of the pharmacological Latin, just as the synonym semen strychni is also used (and very similar to usage in German and other European languages). To be English, this needs to be used (not mentioned), and integrated into normal English sentence structure without italics.

The actual normative form here is on the lines of picard though, as Chuck points out, which is well-attested in modern English although we don't have an entry; for modern English the OED also reports picard, pickard, pekart, picart, pichard, and they have an entry piker pointing to picard although it's not cited. That word is now historical rather than obsolete\u2014there's plenty of historical literature using it\u2014but the specific spelling pykar does not look attestable to me for modern English. \u2014 [Al-Muqanna](/wiki/User:Al-Muqanna) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Al-Muqanna)) 10:51, 22 July 2023 (UTC) - Yes, I'm sure that it's from [Picard](/wiki/Picard)now, too. And that the word I found is already listed at [piker#Middle_English](/wiki/piker#Middle_English), though I suppose it couldn't hurt to add one more variant spelling. But as for the boat word, should we list it as an alternate spelling of Middle English Picard (which we don't have a separate entry for yet), or did the boat sense break off into a new sense of its own with this as the dominant spelling?

[Binarystep](/wiki/User:Binarystep) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Binarystep)) 00:45, 31 July 2023 (UTC) - To complicate things further, it comes from Ancient Greek [](/w/index.php?title=%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%87%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82&action=edit&redlink=1)(mokhlik\u00f3s), an adjective having to do with levers. Most often it's a reference to a treatise of [Hippocrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates)that seems to be about mechanical methods for moving dislocated bones into place. Such references generally are capitalized proper nouns, as in \"the Mochlic\". Apparently the word can also refer to drastic purgatives- I guess on the analogy of prying loose the contents of one's digestive tract.

That is the etymology, but I'm having difficulty finding instances where it actually means being knighted. Even in the early modern examples on EEBO where it's not already figurative it's distinguished from the actual act of being knighted, e.g. someone \"won his Spurs by divers generous Actions, and received the Honour of Knighthood\". If this can't be verified in a strict sense it might make more sense to merge into sense 1, achieving recognition, and note that it specifically meant achieving recognition that led to being knighted. \u2014 [Al-Muqanna](/wiki/User:Al-Muqanna) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Al-Muqanna)) 20:52, 2 August 2023 (UTC) - Well, do we distinguish between the act done to earn knighthood and the ceremony itself? Think of graduation ... I would say that once I've had my last day of school, I've graduated, even if the ceremony is a week away.

I don't know if DeSantis was the first to use the term as a noun, but his use and the attention it got in the media definitely popularized this to such a degree that also people who see \"being woke\" as a good thing started using the term as a noun.

It seems like the Tory MPs Kami Badenoch and Suella Braverman didn't utter the exact phrase 'War on Woke' but they expressed 'anti-Woke' sentiments that got described as such, so they sometimes get attributed as the originators of the phrase but my money would be on Andrew Neil.

Nothing on EEBO etc. other than the one \"specially when wee would abstergifie\" cite you'll find on Google Books, which the OED notes is a (half-arsed) 17th-century translation from Italian [astergere](/wiki/astergere#Italian). \u2014 [Al-Muqanna](/wiki/User:Al-Muqanna) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Al-Muqanna)) 23:20, 15 August 2023 (UTC) \"A game played with acorns by the [Miwok](/wiki/Miwok) people of California, USA.\" (If it's actually attestable, then needs a real definition describing the type of game.) I think one of Luciferwildcat's socks must have created this. [Equinox](/wiki/User:Equinox) [](/wiki/User_talk:Equinox) 23:31, 15 August 2023 (UTC) - Yes, this was created by a LW sock. His later socks were focused on finding dictionaries of specific American Indian languages and then pretending to be an expert on those languages. This is a prime example of the stupidity that results. The whole purpose of this entry is to host the Central Sierra Miwok translation, which was copied from a CSM dictionary (AFAIK there's only one). I'm sure LW had no clue what that term meant, but felt he had to pretend that he did. I'm also sure the Spanish translation is something bogus he made up. Based on [this discussion of cognates](https://books.google.com/books?id=lV3nBQAAQBAJ&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&lpg=PA209&dq=Miwok%20acorn%20game&pg=PA209#v=onepage&q=Miwok%20acorn%20game&f=false)I think the game in question is one where half-acorns are used as dice: you put them in a basket, shake it, throw them on a surface, and count how many land flat-side-up vs. round-side-up. Other peoples in the area did the same, or used empty acorn cups or native walnuts the same way. I can't really see how anyone would use this specific term for specifically the CSM version of the game except as a reference to the CSM-dictionary entry. There are so many California Indian cultures that such oddly specific things don't get mentioned a lot in the literature.

[Here](https://books.google.com/books?id=S48MAQAAIAAJ&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&pg=PA150#v=onepage&q=%22%C3%A6thogen%22&f=false)is what seems to be the first published use, and [here is someone else using it](https://books.google.com/books?id=ppMvAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22%C3%A6thogen%22&lr=lang_en&pg=PA26#v=onepage&q&f=false), though they apparently consulted Balmain for the information on how to make the stuff. The rest seems to be mostly in German (without the ligature) and/or mentions. There may be more, but Google's OCR has intermittent problems with the \"\u00c6\" ligature that make it hard to be sure. Then there are the compounds of this substance which were called \"\u00e6thonides\". [Chuck Entz](/wiki/User:Chuck_Entz)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Chuck_Entz)) 07:31, 20 Milton?

Since a single definition \"# Any vice attributed to the English\", would indeed be SoP, wouldn't it? It's certainly a grey area; at one extreme, I'm not sure any use of \"Russian president\" to refer to a Russian president could be idiomatic\u2014the referent of that phrase would probably have to become something else, like how [dead president](/wiki/dead_president)doesn't refer to a deceased president but to money.

I'm not sure what forum is best to raise this in. I suspect this entry from 2010 is just exemplifying the old practice of \"give multiple ways of phrasing the definition, but put them on multiple lines as if they are different definitions\". But I could be wrong: in theory you could give a lecture about clarification and it could be a \"clarificatory lecture\" in the way a lecture about anatomy would be an \"anatomical lecture\". But in practice I think \"clarificatory\" would only be used if your lecture clarified things, and not if it was confusing, so I think sense 1 should be removed or folded into sense 2.

Based on how you phrase it I assume you mean the measurement, but our Webster link marks the \"claw\" sense as obsolete as well, and it seems rather odd to have a soft c when the original Latin word ended in -us. I'm skeptical of both words now, ... I found [a book](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Cursory_Notes_on_Various_Passages_in_the/A3c4AAAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22when+i+was+about+thy+years,+hall%22&pg=PA17&printsec=frontcover)that mentions that the word exists, though to be honest I dont really know what Im looking at. Also, to anyone else doing a search for the measurement, a lot of hits for ounce will show up as unce just due to scanning errors .... I found plenty while looking for the claw sense but no actual uses of either sense (though I didnt search very hard for the measurement). [\u2014](/wiki/User:Soap) [Soap](/wiki/User_talk:Soap) [\u2014](/wiki/Special:Contributions/Soap)20:43, 6 September 2023 (UTC) - Claw sense is a hapax in the OED. The ounce sense is easy to cite from EEBO, I've cited it and changed it to an altform entry (I don't think it needs special ety info). \u2014 [Al-Muqanna](/wiki/User:Al-Muqanna) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Al-Muqanna)) 22:10, 6 September 2023 (UTC) RFV of ety 1, \"sable\" (the animal). I have only been able to find ety 2 (the plant thing), and a few scattered italicized mentions of this being a Slavic word for sable. I tried searching for the plural, \"of sobol\", 2 adjective: \"Pertaining to [upcoming](/wiki/upcome#English).\" I don't think this could be attested as an adjective in this sense (rather than the separate ety 1 \"happening soon\" sense); even if something like upcoming gear for \"ascent gear\" existed, it would seem more logical to view it as the noun which is also asserted to exist, or the verb; I can't picture e.g. \"very upcoming\" in this ety as opposed to ety 1.

If there's a proverb sense here it's also not familiar to me: something like \"we need to clean up the bathroom eventually\u2014the house always wins\" comes off as a bit weird. I think there is a missing figurative sense or scope here though: afaik it's also used broadly to suggest that something is rigged to benefit some person or group, which isn't covered by the limited wording of sense 2. \u2014 [Al-Muqanna](/wiki/User:Al-Muqanna) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Al-Muqanna)) 22:53, 7 September 2023 (UTC) - It reminds me of what we're calling [Ginsberg's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginsberg%27s_theorem)on Wikipedia ... a metaphorical restatement of the laws of thermodynamics in the form of a card game ... you can't win, you can't break even, and you can't quit the game. (The zeroth law was added in later.) And I saw something similar in a popular science book about entropy, though I can't find it now. There are a few websites using the phrase the house always wins as a metaphor about entropy. But a metaphor isn't a definition, I suppose ... I'm not really sure if we can use this or not, ... it just seems to me that the metaphor need not always be a complaint about human affairs, it can simply be a restatement of natural law. [\u2014](/wiki/User:Soap) [Soap](/wiki/User_talk:Soap) [\u2014](/wiki/Special:Contributions/Soap)00:13, 8 September 2023 (UTC) - @ [Soap](/wiki/User:Soap): Yes, it occurred to me that people can use it in reference to things like death and entropy, with a vague idea of anthropomorphising the force they're talking about (you can't cheat Death). What I would do, I think, is change sense 2 to refer to things being systemically rigged or biased more generally than just one specific point about economics, and have a third sense with a second, even further extension to things like natural laws without any actual people involved. I think the RFV'd sense is probably just missing the point a bit. \u2014 [Al-Muqanna](/wiki/User:Al-Muqanna) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Al-Muqanna)) 00:21, 8 September 2023 (UTC) - [(discuss)](/wiki/User_talk:-sche) 05:38, 8 September 2023 (UTC) Rfv-sense - verb. This is only ever used as an interjection in my experience. Sometimes the interjection is elongated with a cuz or similar, but I have never heard someone say something like \"he was talking to the hand because my face didn't care\". - [TheDaveRoss](/wiki/User:TheDaveRoss) 16:54, 8 September 2023 (UTC) - Are all full sentences interjections, or just imperative and interrogative sentences? [DCDuring](/wiki/User:DCDuring)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:DCDuring)) 19:51, 8 September 2023 (UTC) - Indeed I don't think this can be called interjection: the \"elongated\" use demonstrates that it's still being used and understood as a verb phrase. A better solution would be an \"imperative\" or \"usually imperative\" label (there are a few examples of non-imperative use, e.g. describing an argument with a threat of violence, \"Against one of them, they could talk to the hand, but if they managed to immobilize me, game over\" [[71]](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f7PQDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA129)). \u2014 [Al-Muqanna](/wiki/User:Al-Muqanna) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Al-Muqanna)) 19:54, 8 September 2023 (UTC) - Indeed I don't think this can be called interjection: the \"elongated\" use demonstrates that it's still being used and understood as a verb phrase.
