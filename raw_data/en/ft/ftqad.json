INTRODUCTION History In 1984, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveil lance System (BRFSS) working in an ongoing fashion with several states to assess the health status and health risk behaviors of their citizens. In 1988, Iowa began full participa - tion in BRFSS. The BRFSS is now conducted in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. Nature of the Survey The Iowa Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an ongoing telephone survey. It is financially and technically supported by the CDC with further financial support from public and private sources. The BRFSS is designed to collect information on the health conditions, health -related behaviors, attitudes, and awareness of residents age 18 and over. It also monitors the prevalence of these indicators over time. The indicators surveyed are major contributors to illness, disability and premature death. This report focuses on the data collected during calendar year 2011. Some of the health -related issues discussed are: general health status, health care access, hyper tension, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, body weight, physical activity, diet, diabetes, respiratory conditions, immunizations, and HIV/AIDS awareness. Objectives The objectives of the BRFSS are: 1. To determine the state specific prevalence of perso nal health behaviors related to the leading causes of premature death. 2. To develop the capacity of state health departments to conduct credible telephone surveys. 3. To advance the understanding that certain health -related behaviors are critical indi cators of health. Use of BRFSS Data The CDC developed the BRFSS to help states assess health risks and monitor trends. Comparable surveillance methods are used in all states. This allows for comparisons among states and for the assessment of geographic patterns of risk factor prevalence. The BRFSS information is used to design, implement, and support public health activities. These activities are designed to reduce the premature death and disability of Iowa residents. State public health departments are responsible for planning, implementing, and evaluating disease 2 prevention programs. Many of these programs involve health risk behavior modification. Examples of health risk behavior modification programs in Iowa are the Diabetes Prevention and Contr ol Program, nutrition and physical activity campaigns such as Iowans Fit for Life, tobacco cessation and counter -marketing campaigns, and campaigns against problem drinking. One way to assess program effectiveness is to monitor the prevalence of risk fa ctors in the population. Comparing different times, demographic groups, or geographic areas may be quite useful in developing, implementing and evaluating intervention programs 3 2. Methodology Questionnaire Design The questionnaire consists of three sec tions: 1) the core questions required of all states participating in BRFSS; 2) a set of standardized modules developed by the CDC which states may opt to include in their survey; and 3) state -added questions which are designed and administered by individua l states to address locally identified health problems. Core and optional module questions were previously tested. Changes in them were discussed and determinations were made to include them at the annual national BRFSS conference. A group of interested individuals from the Iowa Department of Public Health guided by the state coordinator met to discuss which optional modules and state -added questions to include in the coming year. The BRFSS questionnaire is updated each calendar year by the CDC and by e ach participating state. In 2011, some optional modules were included for only a part of the year. The H1N1 epidemic prompted the inclusion of influenza like illness (ILI) modules from January through March. In addition, state added questions to evaluat e the media campaign \"The flu ends with U\" to encourage influenza vaccination were also included during this time period. The questionnaire that appears in appendix 3 will not show the modules included for only part of the year. Furthermore, the response s from these questions will not be discussed in this report. Participation by Iowans in the BRFSS survey is random, anonymous, voluntary and confidential. Survey participants are requested to provide such demographic information as age, sex, race, marita l and employment status, annual household income, educational level, and location of residence by county and zip code. This location information is suppressed in public use data when the numbers are so small that the respondent might be identified. Sampl ing Process Only adults age 18 years and older residing in households were interviewed. People residing in group homes or institutions were not sampled. Households were selected using list -assisted random -digit dialing. This method provides a list of r andomly chosen phone numbers from the pool of all existing phone numbers. These numbers are not drawn in a simple random fashion, but use what is known as the disproportionate stratified sampling technique (DSS). This sampling methodology was designed to produce a random sample of Iowa telephone numbers, including unlisted numbers and new subscribers in an efficient fashion. The DSS method divides landline phone numbers into two strata. The first stratum is residential but unlisted. The second stratum is composed of residential listed numbers. Each stratum was sampled at a different rate. The listed residential numbers were sampled at the highest rate. Some numbers were marked by the list provider as not to be called because they have been predeterm ined to be nonresidential or nonworking. There was no set number to be sampled per group, and completed interviews were not thrown out. The landline sample was also stratified into six geographic regions. These regions are the same regions used by healt h resource and emergency planning groups within the state. Geographic regions were represented at the same proportion as their population within the state. Four of 4 these regions were further subdivided into counties having a relatively high minority popu lation and counties having low or no minority population based on the most recent census estimates and past survey experience. The minority counties were sampled at a higher rate than the non - minority counties in an effort to better represent minority gro ups in the Iowa sample. Increasingly many people, including the young, unmarried , ethnic minorities, and renters are opting not to use traditional landline telephone service in favor of cell phones.2,3 Therefore, another stratum was added devoted to hous eholds having cell phones only. All other strata excluded cell phones. However, if they had both cell phones and landline phones, it was considered that they could be included in the landline sample, and, therefore, not interviewed on their cell phone. The cell phone only sample was a statewide sample of adults and was not further stratified geographically. These respondents were only asked the core questions in the survey along with some procedural questions. For instance, they were asked if they were doing anything that would make it unsafe to conduct the interview and not interviewed if they were. One thousand two hundred nineteen interviews were conducted with this cell phone sample by our data collection contractor. However, there were occasions when cell phone interviews were done involving people living in other states. The number of cell phone interviews in our sample is, therefore, larger than the number called by our contractor. Approximately equal numbers of interviews per month were condu cted from January through December in 2011 for a total sample size of 7,354. Since optional modules and state added questions were not included in the cell phone stratum, only 6,011 respondents were asked those questions. Interviews were conducted in bot h English and Spanish. There were 91 Spanish interviews. In spite of only one sixth of the sample being done with cell phones, 35 of the 91 Spanish interviews were done on cell phones. Interviewers made multiple attempts to reach a number to complete an interview before replacing that number. One person 18 years or older residing in the home was randomly selected to answer the survey. If the person selected was not available, an appointment was made to complete the interview at another date and time. If the person was not available during the interview period, or if the person refused to participate, no other member of that household was interviewed. Attempts were made to convert initial refusals into participants. The Interview Process The intervie ws were conducted daytime, evenings, and weekends with appointments made as needed to schedule or complete interviews. The average time to complete a landline interview varied greatly per month as the part -year modules were added and removed. The response rate, defined as completed interviews + partial completes divided by all eligible households called, was 38.9 percent for landline and 24 percent for cell phones. Although the response rates seem rather low and have been declining in recent years, they a re better than most states produce. A partial complete is an interview that was terminated before it was complete, but sufficient data had been collected to use for most measures. This means that results from questions later in the questionnaire are dete rmined from a somewhat smaller sample than earlier questions. Even when not restricted to some sub -sample such as a parti cular age group. See Appendix 3 for the questions and their order. 5 A Computer Aided Telephone Interviewing (CATI) system was used. T he CATI system not only assists interviewers in presenting the questionnaire and recording the responses, it also helps keep track of appointments and call -back attempts, and reports statistics of call dispositions. Data then were edited for accuracy and completeness using software provided by CDC. After editing, monthly data were submitted to the CDC and to the Iowa Department of Public Health. Advantages and Limitations Telephone interviews provide a means to conduct affordable surveys to monitor th e prevalence of behavioral risk factors. Surveys based on telephone interviews are much faster to complete than surveys based on in -person interviews. In one hour, an experienced telephone interviewer can handle busy numbers, calls not answered, and refu sals to participate, and still successfully complete one and one -half interviews. In contrast, in one day of in -person interviewing, many miles of travel may be required with few interviews completed. Another advantage of telephone surveys is the much higher response rate compared to self - administered surveys, such as mail surveys. Supervision and administration are simpler for telephone interviews than for in -person interviews. All calls can be made from one central location, and supervisors can moni tor interviewers for quality control. There is one main limitation to telephone surveys. All Iowans are not reachable by traditional telephone service. Some do not live in households but are in institutions such as nursing homes or prisons. Some househo lds do not have telephones. Persons of low socioeconomic status are less likely than persons of higher socioeconomic status to own telephones and are therefore under -sampled. Furthermore, the percentage of households with a telephone varies by region New telephone technology such as caller I.D., and call blockers that block telemarketers also pose problems for telephone surveys. Despite these limitations, prevalence estimates from the BRFSS correspond well with findings from surveys based on in -person in terviews, including studies conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics and the American Heart Association. Some inaccuracy is expected from any survey based on self -reported information. For example, respondents are known to under -report thei r weight and inaccurately recall socially undesirable habits. The potential for bias must always be kept in mind when interpreting self -reported data. Analysis of the Data Unless everyone in the state was asked questions about his or her health, there w ould be no way to know exactly what these answers would be. When analyzing BRFSS data, conclusions are to 6 be drawn about the entire adult population of the state of Iowa based on only a sample of randomly chosen people. The true prevalence in the populat ion can only be estimated. The judgment of the value of prevalence in a population, such as the state based on the prevalence within a sample, always involves educated guesswork. The prevalence values from the survey and the true state prevalence values may differ by some amount, but a range of \"true\" state values can be determined with a high degree of confidence from the prevalence in the sample. Most charts and tables in this report will indicate a range of values in which there is a 95% chance of th e true Iowa value falling. This range is referred to as a 95% confidence interval (CI). Charts will indicate this by use of a black line at the end of the bars in the chart. The end of the bar is the sample value, while the value in the population is pr obably somewhere in the range represented by the line. It is usually the case that when the CIs of two or more groups do not overlap, their population values are truly different. An important factor in determining how well we can judge the response of al l Iowans from the survey sample is the number of responses to the questions. The smaller the number of responses, the poorer is our ability to draw a conclusion about the whole state. Analyzing the data by such categories as age, sex, income, and educati onal level means there are a smaller number of interviews in each particular group than in the whole survey. Furthermore, many questions are only answered depending on the answer to previous questions. For instance, a person would only be asked at what a ge they were diagnosed with diabetes if they answer ed \"yes\" to whether they have ever been told they had diabetes. These smaller numbers decrease the ability to determine statistically significant differences. Some data may not be reported as significant solely due to small sample sizes. In general, data in which the number of responses is less than 50 or the 95% confidence interval is larger than 20% will not be reported since this data is considered highly unreliable. Some people refuse to answer sele ct questions but choose to respond to the majority of the questions. Those interviews were still used in the final count for the total sample size. However, they were not counted on the specific questions they refused. Unless otherwise indicated, preval ence measures do not include those who refused to answer a question or said they did not know. A Change in How Data are Weighted Generally, the best guess for how many Iowan adults would answer a question a certain way would be the same as how many adult s in the sample answer that way. This is true, however, only if everyone in the state had an equal chance of being in the sample. This is not the case. The number of adults per household and the number of phone numbers per household influence a person's likelihood of being included in the survey. Furthermore, certain demographic groups may be over or under -represented in the sample based on their ease of being reached and willingness to respond. For instance, about half the adult Iowa population is male , but typically only about 40 percent of the sample interviewed is male. To solve these problems the data in the 7 sample is weighted to the state population. That means several of the above factors are used to give each interview a weight that represents a certain distinct number of people in the state population. In 2011, BRFSS has chang ed the method used to weight its data. Two reasons for this are the inclusion of cell phones and the increase in computer power. A landline telephone is seen as a ho usehold appliance, while a cell phone is more frequently seen as an individual possession. This means the old weighting method will not work for cell phones. Adults per household and phone numbers per household become irrelevant for cell phones. The incr ease in computer power allows a larger number of factors to be considered in the weighting process. Formerly, only age and gender combined were considered as demographic factors in Iowa. In the new method these will be considered separately plus the addi tion of race/ethnicity, marital status, education level, home ownership, geographic region, and cell vs. landline telephone. The values estimated for the Iowa population may differ for the different weighting methods. The new method frequently will produ ce less healthy more risky values. This is partly because of the inclusion of cell phones, but the weighting method itself is predominantly responsible. The old weighting method did not adjust such important factors as educational level that are known t o be strongly related to health. Unfortunately, the change in weighting method is going to disrupt trend information for the data. The estimate for the state value can be a few percentage points different depending on which method is used. This will var y by topic. Trend information will not be given in this report. Information should be as sound as ever for comparing demographic groups or for comparing states and regions. It should also be possible to establish solid trend information going forward.

GENERAL HEALTH STATUS AND HEALTH -RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE Background General health status defined by responses to a single question such as \"How is your health, in general?\" have been found to be sign ificant predictors of mortality. Additional studies that controlled for objective health status, age, sex, life satisfaction, income, residence, and other factors continue to find that the risk of mortality is two to six times greater for those individuals who had reported earlier that their health was bad or poor, compared to those who had reported their health as excellent.2 The risk associated with poor self -rated health was actually higher than the risks associated with poor health status assessments b y a physician.2 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has defined health -related quality of life (HRQOL ) as \"an individual's or group's perceived physical and mental health over time \"1. Physicians have often used HRQOL to measure the effec ts of chronic illness in their patients to understand better how an illness interferes with a person's day -to-day life. Similarly, public health professionals use health -related quality of life to measure the effects of numerous disorders, short - and long -term disabilities, and diseases in different populations. Tracking health -related quality of life in different populations can identify subgroups with poor physical or mental health and can help guide policies or interventions to improve their health.1 Self-ratings of health, or health -related quality of life, seek to determine how people perceive their own health and how well they function physically and psychologically during their usual daily activities. These indicators are important because they ca n assess dysfunction and disability that are not measured by standard morbidity and mortality measures. General Health Status Results In 2011, when asked how their health was in general, 18.4 percent of respondents reported that it was excellent. Anot her 36.7 percent said it was very good. While 31.9 percent reported good health, 13 percent rated their health as fair or poor. Nothing can be said about trends over years due to the introduction of the new weighting methodology into BRFSS this year,. Age, education, household income, and race/ethnicity all had a significant impact on reported health status (see table 4.1). Household income had the most impact on reporting fair or poor health. While only 4.1 percent of those with incomes of $75,000 or over reported fair or poor health, 33.2 percent of those with incomes below $15,000 did so (see figure 4.1). Other respondents who were more likely to report having fair or poor health were those with less than a high school education, Hispanics, and tho se 75 years old and older. Those with a college education, those with household incomes $50,000 or higher, and those age 18 to 34 years all reported less than eight percent with fair or poor health. In answer to the question about how many days during th e past 30 days was their physical health not good, 69. 2 percent of respondents reported none of the days and 9 percent reported 14 days or more. 11 Figure 4.1: Percent of Iowans Reporting Their Health as Fair or Poor by Household Income 2011 As shown in Table 4.2, males had fewer days of physical health not being good than females. There were also fewer bad physical days with younger age, higher education, and higher income. Once again, household income had the greatest impact. People with household incomes less than $15,000 reported 2 2.3 percent having 14 or more bad physical health days, while people with household incomes of $75,000 or more had only 4.2 percent. When responding to the question of how many days during the past 30 days their mental health was not good, 69.4 percent of the respondents indicated none of the days and 9.2 percent reported 14 or more days. Table 4.2 shows the pattern for bad mental health days. Fourteen or more days in the past 30 of bad mental health is referred to a s frequent mental distress (FMD). Men, White/Non -Hispanics, older people, those with high education, and those with high income had a lower prevalence of FMD. Once again annual household income made the most difference. An annual household income of $15 ,000 or less had the most people with FMD (26.3%), while only 3. 9 percent of those with $75,000 or more had FMD. 12 Table 4.1: Percentage of Self -Reported Fair or Poor General Health Status, 2011 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS General Health Status Fair or Poor % C.I.

On the other hand, 11.5 percent said 14 days or more. This level increased with inc reasing age, decreasing education, and decreasing income. Comparison with Other States The percentage of people rating their health as fair or poor throughout the states and District of Columbia ranged from 1 2 percent to 25.1 percent. The median value w as 16.9 percent. Iowa ranked quite well with only 13 percent rating their health as fair or poor. Only two states had a lower percent of residents reporting fair or poor health.

INSURANCE COVERAGE AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE Background Access to health care is important for the prevention of disease, the detection of illness through screening, treatment, and m anagement of illness and injuries. Adults who have a usual source of care are much more likely to use the health -care system and obtain needed services.1 For those who lack health insurance, it may be impossible to obtain adequate health care. This not only includes expensive surgery and hospital stays, but also preventive care, management of chronic disorders such as diabetes or hypertension, and emergency treatment. Such a lack of access to health care allows small easily treatable problems to become major health problems for many individuals.2 Accurate estimates of the uninsured are important to obtain. The landscape of health -care coverage is rapidly changing with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. It will be necessary to evaluate the effects of vast changes in the health -care delivery system over the next few years. Health -care costs are escalating at an ever -increasing rate. This is especially true of particular sectors of costs such as pharmaceuticals. Such increases hit harder on individuals without health insurance and those living on fixed incomes. Both access and affordability of health care are important areas to monitor. Insurance Coverage and Access to Health Care Results In 2011, 11.6 percent of the survey respondents r eported they had no health insurance. No trend information is available due to the changes in BRFSS methodology in 2011. Coverage measures were among the most affected by these changes. Table 5.1 shows that more males lacked health insurance than female s. Furthermore, younger people, less educated people, people with lower incomes, and racial and ethnic minorities were more likely to lack any health -care coverage. Hispanic or other non -White respondents had the highest percentage of individuals without health -care coverage (33.4%). Almost everyone age 65 years and older had health -care coverage due to Medicare. In fact, if only those age 18 to 64 years old are considered, 14.2 percent are without coverage. Two other demographic variables that had a m ajor impact on health -care coverage were employment status and marital status. Unemployed respondents had 22.2 percent reporting they were not covered by health insurance. Only 2.2 percent of retirees were without health insurance. People who were marri ed were much more likely to have health -care coverage than those who were not. Only 6.6 percent of married respondents were without coverage, while 18 percent of unmarried respondents were without it. 15 When asked if there was a time in the past 12 months w hen they needed to see a doctor but could not because of the cost, 10.3 percent said that there was. The percentage was higher for females, younger people, people with less education, people with lower incomes, and racial and ethnic minorities. The lowes t percentage (2. 5%) was for people age 65 years and older. This was followed closely by people with annual household income of $75,000 or more. The highest percentage (2 2.5%) was for people earning an annual household income less than $15,000. This was closely followed by non-white or Hispanic respondents . Since it is important that care be coordinated, respondents were asked if they had one person they thought of as their personal doctor or health care provider. A positive reply was given by 75 percen t of respondents. Women, White non -Hispanics, older people, people with more education, and people with higher household incomes were more likely to report a regular provider. Non -White or Hispanic respondents were least likely to report one regular provi der (54.6%), while those age 65 years old and older were most likely (85.6%). When asked how long it had been since their last regular check up, 69 percent said less than one year. On the other end, 1.3 percent said they had never had a checkup. People w ho were female or older were more likely to have a checkup in the past year. Respondents who were 65 years old or older were most likely to have a checkup (8 5.5%), while those from age 25 to 34 were least likely ( 53.6% ). Comparison with Other States In the 50 states and District of Columbia, the percent of non-elderly people without health insurance ranged from 7.8 percent to 34.7 percent. The lowest was from Massachusetts , which was the first state to pass major health reform legislation. S ix states h ad an equal or lower percentage of residents without health insurance than Iowa. Iowa had 1 4.2 percent of its non- elderly respondents reporting not having any insurance. The median for states and territories was 21.3 percent. Health Objectives for Iow a and the Nation The Healthy People 2020 and Healthy Iowans goals for health insurance coverage are to see all people be covered by some form of health insurance. In Iowa, 88.3 percent of all adults and only 85.8 percent of non -elderly adults have covera ge. This is far short of the goal. Having one specific source of primary care also missed the mark. Healthy People 2020 has separate goals for people age 18 to 64 and people 65 and over. The goal for 18 to 64 is 89.2 percent, while the goal for age 6 5 and over is 100 percent. The results for Iowa were 7 2.4 percent and 8 5.6 percent respectively. 16 Table 5.1 Percentage of Responses to Health Care Coverage and Access Questions in Iowa, 2011 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS No Health Insurance Coverage Time Couldn't Afford Help Have One Person as Health Provider Had Checkup in Past Year % C.I.

CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES Back ground \"Cardiovascular diseases\" (CVD) refer in principle to any or all of the many disorders that can affect the circulatory system. CVD most often means coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke, taken together, which are the circulatory system disorders of greatest public health concern in the United States today. \"Heart disease\" most often includes coronary heart disease, heart attack (myocardial infarction), or heart failure. \"Stroke\" refers to a sudden impairment of brain function, sometim es termed \"brain attack\", which results from interruption of circulation to one or another part of the brain. Heart disease and stroke are mainly consequences of clogged arteries (atherosclerosis) and high blood pressure (hypertension). Heart disease and stroke are the most common cardiovascular diseases. They are the first and third leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for nearly a third of all annual deaths.1 Deaths are only part of the picture. More than 80 million Americans curre ntly live with a cardiovascular disease. For example, coronary heart disease is a leading cause of premature, permanent disability in the U.S. workforce. Stroke alone accounts for disability in nearly 1 million Americans. Each year, fifteen to 30 per cent of stroke survivors are permanently disabled. More than seven million hospitalizations each year are because of cardiovascular diseases.3 The economic impact of cardiovascular diseases on our nation's health care system continues to grow as the populatio n ages. The cost of heart disease and stroke in the United States was estimated to be $444 billion in 20 10, including health care expenditures and lost productivity from death and disability.1 In Iowa, heart disease is the number one cause and stroke is t he fourth leading cause of death. Even so, deaths from heart disease have steadily declined. The rate per 100,000 population has gone from 344.6 in 1990 to 224.9 in 2010. The rate of deaths from stroke has gone from 73.4 in 1990 to 50.2 in 2010 .2 These decreases are mostly a result of emergency response, medicines, surgical procedures and improved systems of care after an acute event . At the same time mortality has declined, the BRFSS is documenting noteworthy increases in many risk factors that lead t o heart disease and stroke. Reducing cardiovascular disease risk requires an integrated strategy that includes: 1) Lifestyle behavior change -- weight management; increased physical activity; no tobacco use; a low -fat, low -cholesterol diet with moderate so dium, sugar and alcohol intake; and control of high blood cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and diabetes. 2) Community environmental support such as population screening to identify individuals with high levels of blood cholesterol, blood pressure, bloo d glucose, and other individuals at risk for heart disease. Community support also includes interventions that teach the skills necessary for behavior change that make living a healthier life easier. One popular example is the establishment and upkeep of bicycle trails for use by the public. 19 3) Development of public policies that encourage healthy lifestyle behaviors. These may be implemented in the form of laws, regulations, standards, or guidelines that contribute to setting these and other social and e nvironmental conditions. For example, dietary patterns result from the influences of food production policies, marketing practices, product availability, cost, convenience, knowledge, choices that affect health, and preferences that are often based on earl y-life habits.1 Cardiovascular Diseases Results In 2011, 3.9 percent of adult Iowans had been told by a doctor that they had had a heart attack or myocardial infarction; 3.8 percent had been told they had coronary heart disease or angina, and 2.4 percent had been told they had a stroke. Although these percents may seem small, they represent around 90,000 Iowans with a heart attack or heart disease and 60,000 with a stroke. About 7.5 percent of Iowans reported being told they had any of the three conditi ons. Table 6.1 shows the distribution of these conditions by demographic groups. To get at all heart disease conditions, myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease/angina are combined when looking at the influence of various demographic factors. More cardiovascular conditions were experienced by men, older people, people with lower education and people with lower household incomes, and non-Hispanics, Age is the variable with the most impact on having had these conditions. Less than two percent of those under age 45 reported a heart condition, while 20.5 percent of those 75 years or older reported a heart condition and 26.8 percent reported any of the three cardiovascular conditions. There was no sex difference for having had a stroke. These resul ts represent those who have survived these cardiovascular events. That may not match the actual prevalence of these conditions. Events ending in death on their first occurrence could not be considered here. Mortality data is required to complement the i nformation from this survey. References 1.

HYPERTENSION AWARENESS Background Blood pressure is the force of blood against the walls of arte ries. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it ca n damage the body in many ways. High blood pressure (HBP) is a serious condition that can lead to coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, and other health problems.3 Bloo d pressure is typically recorded as two numbers \u2014 the systolic pressure (as the heart beats) over the diastolic pressure (as the heart relaxes between beats). A consistent blood pressure reading of 140 mm Hg or higher systolic or 90 or higher diastolic mm Hg is considered high blood pressure. Those with systolic blood pressure of 120 -139 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of 80 -89 mm Hg are now classified as pre -hypertensive, requiring health -promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent cardiovascular dise ase. There is also an exception to the definition of high blood pressure. A blood pressure of 130/80 or higher is considered high blood pressure in persons with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.3 High blood pressure , which often has no symptoms, is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. L owering of diastolic blood pressure by a mere 2 mm could result in a 17 percent decrease in the prevalence of hypertension, a 6 percent decrease in coronary artery disease, and a 15 percent reduction in str oke.1 The population -based lifestyle intervention recommendations are weight loss, dietary sodium restrictions, increased physical activity, moderation in alcohol consumption, and a heart -healthy diet rich in fiber and low in saturated and total fat.2 People who have HBP can take steps to control it and reduce their risks for related health problems. Key steps include following a healthy lifestyle, taking medication , and following the treatment plan that your doctor prescribes. 3 Hypertension Awareness Resu lts In 2011, 29.9 percent of all respondents reported ever being told they had high blood pressure. An additional 0.9 percent reported being told they had borderline or pre -hypertension. Nothing can be said about trends over years due to the introductio n of the new weighting methodology into BRFSS this year, Age had the greatest impact on the percentage of respondents reporting high blood pressure. The highest percentage was 65.4 percent among respondents age 75 years and older, while the lowest was am ong those age 18 to 24 (7.5%) (see figure 7.1). The prevalence of reporting a high blood pressure diagnosis also increased with lower levels of education and household income. Non -White or Hispanics reported a low percentage of being told they had high blood pressure (see table 7.1). 22 Figure 7.1: Iowans Ever Told Blood Pressure is High by Age, 2011 Of those reporting high blood pressure, 77 percent reported taking medication for their condition. Like high blood pressure itself, this percentage in creases steadily with age reaching a high of 94.8 percent for those 75 years old and over. Unlike high blood pressure itself, more females with high blood pressure took blood pressure medicine than males (83.2% versus 70.7%), while education and income s howed no systematic relation to use of blood pressure medication. Comparison with Other States Among all the states and the District of Columbia prevalence of reported hypertension ranged from 22.9 percent to 40.1 percent. The median value was 30.8 perc ent. Iowa's prevalence of 29.9 percent was better than the median. Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation According to Healthy People 2020 , the objective for high blood pressure is that only 26.9 percent of the adult population should report having h igh blood pressure. This is less than what is currently the case in Iowa (29.9%) . Another Healthy People 2020 goal is for 77.4 percent of people with high blood pressure to be taking medication to lower it. The Healthy Iowans goal for this is a rate of 75 percent. Iowa's figure was 77 percent. This is better than the Healthy Iowa ns goal and about equal to the Healthy People 2020 goal. 23 Table 7.1: Percentage of Iowans Told Blood Pressure Is High, 2011 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS % C.I.

The higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater is your risk for developing heart disease or having a heart attack. Cholesterol is a waxy, f at-like substance that's found in all cells of the body . in your blood cholesterol travels in small packages called lipoproteins . When there is too much cholesterol, it builds up in the walls of your arteries. Over time, this buildup causes \"hardening of the arteries\" so that arteries become narrowed and blood flow to the heart is slowed down or blocked. The blood carries oxygen to the heart, and if enough blood and oxygen cannot reach your heart, you may suffer chest pain. If the blood supply to a portio n of the heart is completely cut off by a blockage, the result is a heart attack.1 High blood cholesterol itself does not cause symptoms; so many people are unaware that their cholesterol level is too high. It is important to find out what your cholester ol numbers are because lowering cholesterol levels that are too high lessens the risk for developing heart disease and reduces the chance of a heart attack or dying of heart disease, even if you already have it. Lowering Cholesterol is important for ever yone --younger, middle age, and older adults; women and men; and people with or without heart disease. Everyone age 20 and older should have their cholesterol measured at least once every 5 years. High cholesterol means a total cholesterol level greater than or equal to ( >) 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). Not all cholesterol increases the risk of heart disease. The cholesterol carried by low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (the so -called bad cholesterol) increases the risk; the cholesterol carried by hig h-density lipoproteins (HDL) (the so -called good cholesterol) lowers the risk and is beneficial. A level less than 40 mg/dL of HDL is low and is considered a major risk factor because it increases your risk for developing heart disease. HDL levels of 60 mg/dL or more help to lower your risk for heart disease. Cholesterol standards are more stringent for those people at high risk of heart attack due to other factors such as diabetes or coronary heart disease.1 The main goal of cholesterol -lowering treatm ent is to lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol level enough to reduce your risk of developing heart disease or having a heart attack. Methods include: Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) --include a cholesterol -lowering diet (called the TLC diet), physical ac tivity, and weight management. TLC is for anyone whose LDL is above goal. Drug Treatment if cholesterol -lowering drugs are needed, they are used together with TLC treatment to help lower your LDL1 25 Table 8.1: Blood Cholesterol in Iowans, 2011 Demogr aphic Groups Had Blood Choles - terol Checked in Past Five Years Ever Been Told Blood Cholesterol High % C.I. (95%) (31.6 -37) Cholesterol Awareness Res ults In 2011, the percentage of Iowans reporting ever having their blood cholesterol checked was 78.2 percent. When asked whether they had their blood cholesterol checked by a health professional during the past five years, 73.7 percent of respondents r eported having it. Women, respondents in older age groups, people with more education and higher household income were more likely to report having a blood cholesterol test within the last five years. Hispanics and non-White races were less likely to hav e a cholesterol test in the past five years (see table 8.1). Of the respondents who had their cholesterol tested, 38.1% reported that they had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that their blood cholesterol was high. Nothing can be 26 said about trends over years due to the introduction of the new weighting methodology into BRFSS this year,. Age made a considerable difference in reporting high cholesterol with the 75+ year old age group reporting more than six times greater prevalence of high cholesterol than the 18 to 24 year - olds (55.1% vs. 8.8%) (see figure 8.1). People with higher education and income were somewhat less likely to report high cholesterol as were non -Whites or Hispanics (see table 8.1). Comparison with Other State s The percentage of people having their cholesterol checked within the past five years among all the states and the District of Columbia ranged from 66.3 percent to 83.7 percent. Iowa's value of 73.7 percent was below the median of 75.5 percent. In terms of those tested being told their cholesterol was high, the range was from 33.5 percent to 42.3 percent. Iowa's value of 38.1 percent was very close to the median of 38.4 percent. Figure 8.1: Tested Iowans Ever Told Their Cholesterol Was High by Age, 2011 Health Objectives for the Nation Based on the national health objectives for the year 20 20, 82.1 percent of adults should have their blood cholesterol checked within the past five years. In 20 11, only 7 3.7 percent of Iowans 27 age 18 and older hav e had their blood cholesterol checked within the past five years. High cholesterol should be experienced by only 13.5 percent of all people over age 20 according to the HP 2020 goals. The level in Iowa was more than double that amount at 30.8 percent. References 1.

OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY Background Overweight and obesity are probably the most serious health problems in America today. Obesity is a condition linked to risk factors for heart disease, cancer, and stroke, which are the first, second and third leading causes of death. It is associated with Type II diabetes, atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), gout, asthma, hypertension, sleep apnea, and osteoarthritis.5 Obesity has been increasing so rapidly that it may be regarded as an epidemic. The origin of overw eight involves many factors. It reflects inherited, environmental, cultural, and socioeconomic traits. The increase in the prevalence of being overweight is a result of a shift in energy balance in which energy taken in from food is greater than energy u sed in physical activity.1 Strateg ies to combat obesity would seek to advance policies that Increase the availability of affordable healthy foods in all communities; Increase the frequency, intensity, and duration of physical activity; Improve access to safe and healthy places to live, work, learn, and play; Limit screen time; and Encourage employers to provide workplace wellness programs. Exact measurements of body fat require sophisticated equipment. To eliminate this problem obesity is often estim ated from weight standards that are adjusted for body frame. Carefully measured weight and height remain the most easily performed and useful means to determine nutritional status and to predict mortality for the general population.2 Body mass index (BMI ) is used to determine the appropriateness of weight for a person's height. BMI is defined as a person's body weight in kilograms divided by their height in meters squared [weight (kg)/height (m2)]. Estimations of the prevalence of overweight and obesity in this report are based on BMI determined from self -reported weight and height. In adults, overweight is considered to be a BMI value greater than or equal to 25 and less than 30. Obesity is considered to be a BMI greater than or equal to 30. This se lf report method is likely to result in an underestimation of the actual extent of obesity. However, comparisons among demographic groups, years, and geographic regions (states) are likely to be valid. Furthermore, this is the only measure of overweight and obesity available on the state level. The medical care costs of obesity in the United States are staggering. In 2008 dollars, these costs totaled about $147 billion.2 There are other costs as well that are harder to pin down. For instance, obese peop le miss more work. Because people are fatter, airlines spend more on jet fuel, and the obese themselves spend more on gas.3 The obesity epidemic is a big contributor to the skyrocketing health care costs in the United States. As the Baby Boomer generatio n ages, obesity -related costs to Medicare are likely to grow significantly because of the large number of people in this population and its high rate of obesity. It is estimated that Iowa could save 5.7 billion dollars by 2030 if BMI were lowered by just five percent.4 29 Overweight & Obesity Results The BRFSS data show that in 2011 35.8 percent of non -pregnant adult Iowans are overweight and 29 percent are obese, based on BMI. The combined percentage of individuals who are overweight or obese is 64.8 per cent. Demographic factors behave somewhat differently for overweight and obesity. The self -reported weights show many more males than females are overweight and obese. Prevalence of overweight and obesity increase with age until late middle age after wh ich a decline is seen in obesity. More males are not more obese than females at all age groups. In fact, more females are obese than males until age 45 years. At that point obesity no longer increases with age for females, while it increases for males until age 55 years. Obesity prevalence shows a very sharp decrease for both sexes in the 75 year old and over age group (see figure 9.1). There is a much stronger sex difference for overweight than for obesity. More men are overweight than women at all age groups and there is no decline at the oldest age group. The effects of income are different for overweight and obesity. The percentage of overweight tends to be lower at lower incomes but remain level at incomes higher than $25,000. On the other han d, obesity tends to be lower at both high and low income extremes (see table 9.1 and figure 9.2). Figure 9.1: Obesity by Age and Sex, 2011 30 Table 9.1: Overweight and Obese Iowans Based on BMI, 2011 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS Overweight Obesity % C.I. -32.2) 61.1 (55.3 -67) AGE GROUP 18 - 24 25.6 (20.5 -30.7) 14.4 (10.5 -18.3) 40.0 (34.3 -45.7) HOUSEHOLD INCOME 28.3 (23.6 -33) 58.0 (52.7 -63.3) The demographic group with the highest prevalence of people over their healthy weight (combined overweight and obesity) is people aged 55 to 64 years with 75.1 percent. The group with the lowest prevalence over their health y weight is those 18 to 24 years old (40%). Comparison with Other States Iowa's figure of 2 9 percent obese in 20 11 was well above the median of 27. 8 percent . The range of prevalence among the 50 states and District of Columbia for obesity was from a l ow of 20.7 percent to a high of 34 .9 percent. 31 Figure 9.2: Overweight and Obesity by Income, Iowa 2011 Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation The Healthy People 2020 objectives for the nation to be achieved on weight call for increasing the preval ence of healthy weight (neither overweight nor obese) to 33.9 percent among adults age 20 years and older. Iowa does not quite make this target having 32.2 percent at healthy weight. The Healthy People 2020 goal for obesity is 30.6 percent. Iowa has a prevalence of 29.8 percent for those over age 20. This is actually under the HP 2020 target. The Healthy Iowans goal for obesity is 27 percent. Iowa's figure of 29 percent for all adults fails to achieve this goal. References 1.

DIABETES Background Diabetes mellitus is a group of diseases characterized by high levels of blood glucose resulting from defects in insulin production, insulin action, or both. Diabetes can be associated with serious complications and premature death. Diabetes rates in the United States are approaching epidemic proportions. Diabetes may affect persons of all ages, although prevalence increases with age. It is estimated that almost 200,00 0 persons 20 years of age and older have been diagnosed with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. Skyrocketing costs accompany this epidemic with an estimated total annual cost (direct and indirect) in 2007 of $174 billion. This includes direct medical costs of 116 billion and indirect costs of another $58 billion resulting from increased absenteeism, reduced productivity, disease - related unemployment disability, and loss of productive capacity due to early mortality . People with diagnosed diabetes, on average, have medical costs that are approximately 2.3 times higher than the costs would be in the absence of diabetes. Approximately $1 in $10 health care dollars is attributed to diabetes.2 The good news is that research studies have found that positive lifestyl e changes can prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes among high -risk adults. Lifestyle interventions included diet modification, weight loss and moderate -intensity physical activity (such as walking for 2 \u00bd hours each week). The complications of d iabetes are many and severe. They can include heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, kidney disease, blindness, diseases of the nervous system, dental disease, compli - cations of pregnancy, lower extremity amputations, biochemical imbalances such as k etoacidosis and diabetic coma, and lower resistance to other diseases. However, complications can be minimized when diabetes is diagnosed early and the patient is taught to self manage their disease through blood glucose control, weight control, taking me dications appropriately, decreasing unhealthy lifestyles such as smoking, and implementing healthy lifestyle interventions.1 The Diabetes Prevention and Control Program at the Iowa Department of Public Health acts as a resource for health care professio nals regarding the latest guidelines for diabetes care, coordinates a statewide diabetes network, and collaborates with local community projects to develop initiatives on public awareness, prevention, and other areas of disease management. It also certifi es programs for Medicaid reimbursement and assists certified programs in maintaining quality standards for outpatient education. Diabetes Results In 2011, 8.2 percent of respondents had ever been told by a physician that they have diabetes, excluding wo men told only during pregnancy. No trend can be determined due to the changes in weighting methodology. 34 Table 10.1 shows that the rate of diabetes is much higher when respondents are older, lower in education, and have a lower household income. The demo graphic group with the highest percentage of diagnosed diabetics is people age 75 years and older (18.3%), while the group with the lowest percentage is people age 18 to 24 years (0.3%) (see table 10.1). When asked if they had a test for diabetes in the p ast three years, 54 percent said they had. Table 10.1: Iowans Ever Told They Had Diabetes, 2011 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP % C.I.

It is thought that people who catch their diabetes before it is fully developed stand a good chance of avoiding it altogether by making lifestyle changes. In 2011, 5.4 percent of non - diabetic respondents were told they had pre - diabetes. Among individuals who had been told they had diabetes, the highest percenta ge reported being first diagnosed at age 46 to 60 years old (40.2%). The age group in which the least reported being first diagnosed was less than age 16 years (2.1%). Of those ever told by a physician that they have diabetes, 27.9 percent reported currently taking insulin. When asked how many times they had seen a health professional for their diabetes in the last year, the most common answer was four (31.4%), while 8 percent said never. Respondents told by a physician they had diabetes were asked ho w many times they had their blood sugar checked in the past 12 months. About 61.9 percent checked their blood sugar at least once a day themselves or with the help of a friend or family member. About 8.4 percent reported never testing their blood sugar. Around 90.8 percent had it checked at least once within the past year by a health professional through a glycosylated hemoglobin test, frequently referred to as an A1C. Around 5.3 percent reported not having had the A1C test. Another 3.9 percent repo rted they had never heard of such a test. It is recommended that this test be done at least twice a year and at least three months apart. 35 Individuals with diabetes should check their feet daily for sores and irritations and should have them checked at le ast once a year by their health care provider. When asked how often they check their feet, 66.4 percent of respondents who were ever diagnosed with diabetes claimed to have checked them at least daily. Another 13 percent said they never checked them. Ar ound 77.2 percent of respondents with feet reported they had their feet checked by a health professional at least once within the past 12 months. Because persons with diabetes are at high risk of eye complications leading to blindness, regular eye examina tions, including pupil dilation, are important. Respondents who reported ever having diabetes were asked when they had their last eye exam where their pupils were dilated. About 76.3 percent reported within the last year, while 2.1 percent reported never having such an examination. Among Iowans with diabetes, 19.3 percent had been told it had affected their eyes. Learning how to manage diabetes is very important to those who have the condition to keep it from leading to deteriorating health. Only 63.2 percent of those with diabetes in 2011 reported having taken a class on how to manage it. Comparison with Other States The median prevalence of diagnosed diabetes for the 50 states and District of Columbia was 9.5 percent in 2011. Prevalence ranged fro m 6.7 percent to 12.4 percent. The figure for Iowa was well below the median at 8.2 percent. Only seven states had a lower prevalence of diagnosed diabetes. Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation Healthy People 2020 and Healthy Iowans had objectives for the management of diabetes. In HP 2020 of all people with diabetes 58.7 percent should receive annual dilated eye exams. For Healthy Iowans the goal was 85 percent. The figure obtained in 2011 was 76.3 percent. This is much better than the Healthy People 2020 goal, but misses the Healthy Iowans goal. Of all people with diabetes 71.1 percent should receive a glycosylated hemoglobin test at least twice a year according to Healthy People 2020 . The figure was 75.6 percent at least twice a year. This meets the Healthy People 2020 goal. Healthy People 2020 also has the goal to Increase the proportion of adults with diabetes who perform self -blood glucose -monitoring at least once daily to 70.4 percent. In 2011, only 61.9 percent of Iowan diabetics said they do this. This is short of the goal. A final Healthy People 2020 goal in this area is to Increase the proportion of persons with diagnosed diabetes who receive formal diabetes education to 62.5 percent. Iowa's current figure of 63.2 percent ex ceeds this goal. References 36 1. American Diabetes Association. Diabetes Basics. 2012. Available at http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes -basics/. 2.

RESPIRATORY DISEASES Background Few things are as immediately important to life as the ability to breathe. Several respiratory diseases exist that can make breathing difficult. A few common ones are asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the lungs in which the airways beco me blocked or narrowed causing breathing difficulty. It is characterized by recurrent wheezing, breathlessness, coughing, and chest tightness.3 This chronic disease affects nearly 24 million Americans of all ages.2 Asthma is the most common chronic disea se of childhood. About seven million children in the U.S. suffer from asthma. Prevalence among adults and children has increased sharply since 1980.2 More than 200,000 Iowans now have asthma of which 148,000 are adults.1 The causes of asthma are not com pletely understood, but are most likely a combination of personal and environmental risk factors. Those risk factors for asthma include family history of asthma and allergies, acute respiratory infections, exposure to indoor air pollution (tobacco smoke, animal dander, dust mites, cockroaches, occupational exposures to more than 250 substances), outdoor air pollution (burning leaves, pollen, air pollutants), obesity, and lack of exercise. Diet and early exposure to certain infectious agents may provide so me protection. After developing asthma, a person often becomes especially sensitive to any exposures to the environmental risk factors listed.3 Asthma is a leading cause of inpatient admission and of unscheduled emergency department and physician office visits. Many of these admissions and visits could be avoided if medical and self-management of asthma were carried out according to national guidelines. Self management of asthma involves the use of drugs and the avoidance of known triggers. People who s uffer from asthma are encouraged to develop an asthma management plan. Poor asthma control continues to be associated with increased emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and medical costs. The estimated total cost of asthma to society, includin g medical expenses ($50.1 billion per year), loss of productivity resulting from missed school or work days ($3.8 billion per year), and premature death ($2.1 billion per year) was $56 billion (2009 dollars) in 2007; a $3 billion (5.7%) increase from 2002. Medical expenses associated with asthma were $3,259 per person per year during 2002 --2007 .2 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) includes both chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is one of the most common lung diseases. Chronic bronchitis is defined by a long-term cough with mucus , while e mphysema is defined by destruction of the lungs over time . Most people with COPD have a combination of both conditions.4 Smoking is the leading cause of COPD. The more a person smokes, the more likely that pe rson will develop COPD . Another cause is exposure to secondhand smoke or air pollution. 38 There is no cure for COPD. However, there are many things you can do to relieve symptoms and keep the disease from getting worse. Persons with COPD must stop smoki ng. This is the best way to slow the lung damage. Medications may also be used to treat COPD symptoms. Oxygen therapy at home may be needed if a person has a low level of oxygen in his/her blood. Respiratory Diseases Results In 2011, 11.8 percent of r espondents reported ever being diagnosed by a physician with asthma. Out of all respondents in Iowa, 8.3 percent currently had asthma, and 3.3 percent formerly had asthma.* Table 11.1: Iowans Currently and Formerly Having Asthma, 2011 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP S Current Asthma Former Asthma % C.I.

Racial and ethnic differences seemed to be the most powerful factor determining asthm a prevalence. African Americans had a much higher rate of current asthma (16.5%), while Hispanics had the lowest rate (2.5%). These were both significantly different from White/non -Hispanics despite the wide confidence intervals found with racial and eth nic minorities. Lower household income and education level were also associated with higher rates of current asthma. In fact, the highest current asthma prevalence was among those with annual household incomes less than $15,000 (17. 1%) (see table 11.1). Even though an adult is interviewed in the BRFSS survey, two questions about asthma are asked for a randomly determined child in the household. Reports indicated that 8.4 percent of the Table 11.2 Iowans who have been told they have COPD DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS COPD % C.I.

Contrary to the situation for adults, a larger percent of boys were reported to currently have asthma than girls ( 7.6 vs. 3.8 percent). Starting in 2006 the BRFSS has collected a considerable amount o f information from the people who reported they or their children had ever had asthma in a special call-back survey. Most of the data from that survey is not included in this report, but will be presented separately. From the 20 10 call- back survey, howev er, it was found that adults with asthma having asthma -related emergency or urgent care visits was only 4.2 percent needing such visits. When asked if they had been told they had COPD, 5.1 percent said they had. This was more common among women, older pe ople, people with less education, and people with lower household income. Blacks and Hispanics were less likely to report COPD, but other non -Hispanic respondents were higher (see Table 11.2). The highest prevalence of having COPD was found among those with annual household incomes less than $15,000 (12.7%). The condition was least prevalent in those respondents age 25 to 34 years (1.1%). Comparison with Other States While Iowa reported 8 .3 percent of the entire adult population currently suffering. 40 from asthma, the median for the nation was 9.1 percent. Prevalence ranged from a low of 6.4 percent to a high of 12 .1 percent References 1. Iowa Department of Public Health.

Cancer is a very common disease and the second most common cause of death in t he United States . Cancer may arise almost anywhere in the body, though some locations are more common than others. Skin cancer is a very common form of cancer. Other common types are lung, breast, prostate, and colon cancer. Early detection of cancer is key to surviving the disease, and regular screening is key to detecting the disease early. Not all types of cancer lend themselves to screening tests, but for those that do, screening saves lives. There may be no detectable symptoms apart from screening until the disease is quite advanced. Colorectal cancer is one type that gr eatly benefits from screening. Colorectal cancer usually develops from abnormal growths known as precancerous polyps in the colon and rectum. In the early stages there are often no symptoms. Screening tests can detect polyps so they can be removed befor e they turn into cancer.3 An estimated 141,210 new cases of colon and rectal cancer exist ed in the United States in 2011.2 There were estimated to be 49,380 deaths.2 Incidence and mortality rates have been decreasing for most of the last two decades. Th e decline has been steeper in the most recent time period, partly due to an increase in screening, which can result in the detection and removal of colorectal polyps before they progress to cancer.4 The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men and women who are not at special risk begin regular screening for colorectal cancer at age 50.1 If everybody aged 50 to 75 had regular screening tests, as many as 60 percent of deaths from colorectal cancer could be prevented. For the past 40 years w e have been fighting \"a war on cancer\". While cancer is still a very common disease, more people are surviving cancer. Overall, the American Cancer Society predict ed 1,596,670 new cancer cases in the United States and 571,950 deaths in 2011. However, de ath rates for all cancer types fell by 1.9 percent a year from 2001 to 2007 in men and by 1.5 percent a year in women from 2002 through 2007.5 Steady overall declines in cancer death rates have meant about 898,000 who would have died prematurely from canc er in the past 17 years did not. These cancer survivors have unique needs and concerns as they move forward with their lives. There is the fear that their cancer may return. There are side effects of the cancer treatments. The cancer may still be prese nt but being held in check for the moment. The survivor may have been or may still be experiencing great pain from either the cancer or the treatments for it. It is worthwhile, then, to try to look at the condition of cancer survivors in Iowa, as more th an half of them are living more than five years after their diagnosis. 42 Cancer Screening and Survivorship Results In 2011, 5.8 percent of Iowans had ever been told they had skin cancer, while 6.2 percent reported having been told they had some other type o f cancer. Skin cancer behaves somewhat differently from other types of cancers, which themselves may vary in prevalence and prognosis according to type. Most cancers, however, are more common with age. Skin cancer is more common among white non -Hispanic s. It is somewhat less common among respondents with high household incomes. Other cancers, on the other hand, were more common among females and people with lower income and less education. The highest prevalence of ever having cancer was for people ag e 75 and over. In this age group the prevalence was 21.3 percent for skin cancer and 17.9 percent for other cancers. Both Hispanics and Blacks as well as those age 18 to 24 years had a skin cancer prevalence less than half a percent, while for other canc ers only people age 18 to 24 years had the lowest prevalence (0.9%) (see table 12.1). Since 2004, a number of questions have been included in the survey concerning colorectal cancer screening. A few findings from these are given here. Questions on othe r forms of screening may be found in reports for data from even years. Respondents 50 years old and older reported that a health care professional talked to him or her about colorectal cancer screening in 76.1 percent of the cases. When the health care p rofessional talked about screening, 92.4 percent recommended having a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Of the respondents who had a test recommended, 8 3.4 percent then had the test. Out of all respondents50 years old and older, 61.6 percent reported seeing articles or advertising in the past six months about colorectal cancer screening. Television was the main medium of exposure to this advertising ( 72.9%). Over half of the respondents (5 3.5%) considered that they had a low risk of colorectal cancer. Only 4.9 percent considered it was high. When asked why they did not have the recommended test or why they did not plan to be tested, one of the most common answers was not having any symptoms ( 30.5%). Colorectal cancer does not necessarily have symptoms. As for cancer survivors: the age at which a survivor had been told they had cancer was quite variable ranging from 4 to 96 years. The median age when a cancer survivor had been told they had cancer was 55 years. Over one fourth (25.8%) of cancer diagnoses had been between ages 60 and 70 years. Of all the Iowa cancer survivors 7.6 percent were currently receiving treatment. Of all cancer survivors, 2 7.9 percent had received a summary of cancer treatments received. A set of instructions for follow -up was received by 6 6.4 percent of survivors. For about 70.1 percent these instructions were written or printed. Health insurance was reported to have paid for all or part of cancer treatments for 9 8.6 percent of cancer survivors. Having health or life insuran ce denied because of cancer was reported by 6.4 percent of cancer survivors. 43 Table 12.1 Prevalence of Iowans reporting ever having Cancer , 2011 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS Ever Had Skin Cancer Ever Had Other Cancer % C.I.

OTHER CHRONIC CONDITIONS Background The Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System asks people if they ha ve a number of chronic health conditions. Several of these are covered in other chapters of this report such as cardiovascular disease, asthma, cancer, arthritis, and diabetes. This chapter looks at the remaining conditions about which information is col lected. Although these conditions are important, the amount of information on each condition does not warrant a separate chapter. Other Chronic Conditions Results In 2011, 15.2 percent of adults reported that they had ever been told they had a depressiv e disorder. The prevalence of depression was greater among women and lower income individuals and less among the elderly. The highest prevalence was among those with annual household incomes less than $15,000 (29.6%). The lowest prevalence was among tho se age 75 years or more (8.3%) (see table 13.1). In 2011, 1.5 percent of adults reported they had ever been told they had kidney disease. The highest percentage of kidney disease was among African Americans (5.4%). The lowest was among those between a ge 35 and 44 years (0.2%). This was closely followed by those between age 18 and 24 years (see table 13.1). In 2011, 18.5 percent of adults reported they had ever been told they had visual impairment in one or both eyes. Visual impairment was more pre valent among women, the elderly, people with less education, and people with lower income. The highest prevalence was among those age 75 and older (42.9%). The lowest was among those age 35 to 44 years old (9.7%) (see table 13.1). Health Objectives for t he Nation Healthy People 2020 has a goal of 6.1 percent of people experiencing a major depression episode. The 2011 Iowa BRFSS shows 15.2 percent of adult Iowans reporting ever having a depressive episode. Although it is not certain if all these would h ave been considered major depression, Iowa very likely exceeds the goal. Healthy People 2020 has a goal of 13.6 percent reporting chronic kidney disease. Iowa's level of 1.5 percent is far lower than this goal. 46 Table 13.1 Prevalence of Other Chronic Conditions in Iowa, 2011 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS Depressive Disorder Kidney Disease Visual Impairment % C.I.

EXERCISE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Background A lifestyle lacking in regular physical activity has been associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular illness, cancer, osteoporosis, and other debilitating conditions.2 Despite its risks, a large proportion of people remain inactive. Although the percentage of people who do not engage in regular physical activity remains high, many effort s are underway to try to increase the physical activity level of Iowans. Iowans Fit for Life, a program of the Iowa Department of Public Health and its partners , is actively working to increase the physical activity levels of Iowans.1 Interventions to inc rease physical activity include: 1) An increased number of great recreational trails. 2) Increased regular media attention to physical activity and related topics. 3) Development of worksite wellness programs. 4) Creating a culture where physical activity is the ea sy choice. 5) Continuous promotion of physical activity 6) Continued development of programs by Parks and Recreation Departments. 7) The individual commitment of thousands of Iowans to make healthier choices. Encouraging people to have a less sedentary l ifestyle by engaging in regular physical activity continues to be a significant step toward a healthier Iowa. Exercise & Physical Activity Results In 2011, 74.1 percent of respondents reported that they had engaged in some sort of physical activity for exercise during the past month other than their regular job. A larger proportion of younger respondents reported engaging in leisure physical activity than older respondents. The percentage of respondents who exercised also increased with education and household income. This percentage was also higher for White non -Hispanics than for other racial or ethnic groups. The lowest percentage of all examined demographic variables was for those having less than a high school education (62.6%), while the highes t was for those with a college degree (84.4%) (see table 14.1). Physical activity may be classified as either moderate or vigorous. Vigorous activities cause large increases in breathing or heart rate while moderate activities cause small increases in breathing or heart rate. The recommended level of aerobic physical activity may be either regular moderate physical activity or regular vigorous physical activity. The recommended level of regular moderate physical activity is defined as moderate activity for 150 or more minutes per week. Recommended r egular vigorous physical activity counts double the time of regular moderate activity. The BRFSS determines the level of physical activity by asking about two activities the person engages in for the most a mount of time. These activities are determined as moderate or vigorous based on a complex formula involving several factors. Then the time to which the person 48 Table 14.1: Percentage Participating in Leisure Exercise in Past Month in Iowa, 2011 Demogra phic Groups Any Leisure Physical Exercise in Past Month % C.I. (95%) TOTAL (74.1 -78.9) College Graduate to each of these activities is determined. There is also a question asked about activit ies designed for strengthening the muscles. The recommendation is that people engage in muscle strengthening activity at least twice a week. The percentage of respondents who met the recommended level of aerobic physical activity in 2011 was 47.6 percent. The percentage of respondents who met the recommended level of strengthening activity was 27.5 percent. Both recommendations were met by 17.2 percent. The relation of meeting the recommend - ations for aerobic and strengthening activity differed among the demographic groups. The percentage of respondents reporting they had engaged in the recommended amount of aerobic activity w as higher for people with higher income and higher education. It was a little higher with older age and for White non -Hispanics. The group with the highest percentage meeting the aerobic recommendation was those with household incomes greater than $75,00 0 per year (57.7%). The lowest percentage was among those who had less than a high school education (36.1%). The somewhat surprising relation of age to meeting the aerobic recommendation may be due to activities that are considered moderate for younger p eople being considered vigorous for the older people. The strengthening recommendation was met by a higher percentage of men, Non -White or Hispanics, younger people, people with more education, and people with higher incomes. The highest percentage wa s found among those age 18 to 24 years (45.6%).The lowest percentage was found among age 75 years and older (16.8%). The percent of people meeting both types of physical activity was slightly higher for males than for females. In addition, it decreased with age. A larger percentage of those who had more education engaged in the recommended amounts of both types of physical activity. Only the highest household income level showed an increase in meeting the recommended physical activity levels for both ae robic and strengthening activity (see table 14.2). 49 Table 14.2: Percent of Iowans Receiving Recommended Levels of Physical Activity, 2011 Demographic Groups Recommended Level of Physical Activity Aerobic Strengthening Both Aerobic & Strength % C.I.

Iowa ranked almost at the median on not engaging in leisure time physical activity. Iowa was at 25.9 percent, while the me dian for the nation was at 26.2 percent. Iowa did not fare as well on meeting the recommended levels of physical activity. Aerobic physical activity recommendations were met by 39 percent to 61.8 percent of people in the 50 50 states and District of Columbi a. The median was 51.7 percent, while Iowa had only 47.6 percent. The strengthening recommendation was met by 20.2 percent to 36.1 percent of state residents. The median was 29.6 percent, while Iowa had only 27.5 percent. Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation The national target for reducing the proportion of adults who engage in no leisure -time physical activity, is 32.6 percent. Iowa's level of 25.9 percent is better than this target. The national target to incre ase the proportion of adults engaging in the recommended amount of regular moderate or regular vigorous aerobic physical activity is 47.9 percent. Iowa respondents report 47.6 percent achieving this recommendation either by itself or along with the streng th- ening criterion. Iowa is almost at the target for recommended aerobic activity. The national target for meeting the recommended strengthening goal of two or more times per week is 24.1 percent. Iowa respondents report 27.9 percent achieving this re commendation either by itself or along with the aerobic criterion. Iowa is better than the target for recommended strengthening activity. The Healthy Iowans goal is that 55 percent of adult Iowans should attain the recommended level of aerobic physical activity. Iowa's level of 47.6 percent falls short of this. References 1.

DIET AND NUTRITION Background Eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables as part of an overall healthful diet can help lower chronic disease risk and aid in weight ma nagement. Fruits and vegetables contain essential vitamins, mineral, fiber, and other bio -active compounds; a diet high in these foods is associated with lower risk for numerous chronic diseases, including certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases.1,3 Fruits and non -starchy vegetables are generally low energy -dense foods and may have a role in preventing weight gain that could lead to obesity - a risk factor in some cancers. Evidence that vegetables and fruits protect against some cancers is supported by evidence on foods containing various micro -nutrients, found especially in vegetables, fruits, and pulses (legumes), and nuts and seeds, as well as in cereals, roots, tubers, and other plant foods.4 Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables by ind ividuals is a practical and important means for optimizing nutrition to reduce disease risk and maximize good health. The most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2010) recommends at least 2 cups of fruits and 2 \u00bd cups of vegetables each day for adu lts.2 These should i nclude a variety of dark green and orange vegetables , legumes, starchy vegetables, and other vegetables. The Dietary Guidelines also recommends consum ing a variety of foods, rich in nutrients, in all food groups. People should limit t heir intake of saturated fats and trans fats (usually found in hydrogenated fats and oils), cholesterol, added sugars, salt, and alcoholic beverages. The concern is that high -calorie, nutrient -poor sugary foods and beverages are replacing more nutritious foods, and adding to the overweight issue.2 Diet and Nutrition Results The BRFSS asks a series of six questions about how often the respondent eats various fruit or vegetables. From the answers to these questions indices are computed showing the total a verage consumption per day of fruit and vegetables. The questions involved juice, fruit, beans, dark green vegetables, orange -colored vegetables, and other vegetables. Many instructions and examples are given concerning what should count in each category . Unlike the other BRFSS measures, the change from past years is not merely due to the change in weighting methodology. It is also affected by the change in the types of foods asked about and the addition of more instructions and examples. Looking at fruit consumption, 40.6 percent of adult Iowans reported consuming fruit one to two times per day. An additional 13.2 percent consumed them two to three times per day. For vegetables, 43.6 percent of adult Iowans reported consuming them one to two times per day, while 17.5 percent consumed them two to three times per day. 52 By adding the average times per day each was consumed we get the total times per day fruit and vegetables were consumed. The percentage of Iowans who eat five or more servings of fru its and vegetables per day was 13.5 percent in 2011. Table 15.1 shows that significantly more females ate fruits and vegetables five or more times per day than males. Also, older Iowans were more likely to report meeting the five -a-day standard than yo unger Iowans. This was also true for those with a higher education. Differences in race and ethnicity were also quite evident. The demographic group most likely to eat fruit and vegetables five or more times a day was Hispanics (19.7%), while those leas t likely were males (9%).

When asked \"How often do you drink soda or pop containing sugar\", the median response was 0.5 times per week. The mean, however, was 3.6 times per week. This indicates that, although nearly half the respondents drank soda less than once a week, a few drank it many times. Actually, 41.7 percent said they did not drink it at all. Around 4.8 percent said they drank sweetened soda three or more times a day. When asked \"How often do you drink sweetened fruit drinks\", 53.1 percent said they did not drink them at all. On the other hand, 3.8 percent drank sweetened fruit drink once a day or more. When asked if calorie information availability in restaurants was helpful in ordering, 18.6 percent said it was always helpful. However, 44.6 percent said it never was helpfu l. Another 2.1 percent said they never noticed such information. Comparison with Other States Consumption of five or more servings of fruit or vegetables per day in the 50 states and District of Columbia ranged from a low of 7.9 percent to a high of 25. 5 percent. Iowa's level of 1 3.5 percent is well below the median of 16.6 percent. 53 Health Objectives for Iowa Healthy Iowans has the objective of 20 percent of Iowans eating five or more fruit and vegetables per day. The figure obtained from Iowa B RFSS of 13.5 percent falls far short of this goal. References 1. Blanck HM, Gillespie C, Kimmons JE, Seymour JD, Serdula MK.

TOBACCO USE Background Tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of premature death in the United States. An estimated 46 million American adults currently smoke cigarettes and annually cigarette smoking causes more than 443,000 deaths each year, or one in every five deaths.1 For every person who dies from tobacco use, another 20 suffer with at least one serious t obacco -related illness. Cigarette smoking costs the nation more than $96 billion per year in direct medical expenses as well as more than $97 billion annually in lost productivity.1 Secondhand smoke costs more than $10 billion (i.e., health care expendit ures, morbidity, and mortality).1 Tobacco use is known to cause heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic lung disease, as well as cancers of the lung, larynx, esophagus, pharynx, mouth, bladder, pancreas, kidney, and cervix. In fact, smoki ng causes diseases in nearly every organ of the body.2 Consequences of smoking during pregnancy include spontaneous abortions, low birth weight babies, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).2 Secondhand Smoke (SHS) increases the risk of heart disease a nd lung cancer in adults. SHS also affects children by increasing lower respiratory tract infections and asthma and by decreasing pulmonary function. According to the surgeon general there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke.3 Public health efforts to reduce the prevalence of tobacco use began after the health risks were announced in the first surgeon general's report on tobacco in 1964. Many steps are being taken to prevent use of tobacco. Some of these include reducing exposure to envi ronmental tobacco smoke, smoking prevention education, the restriction of minors' access to tobacco, the treatment of nicotine addiction (cessation), and working toward changing social norms and environments that support tobacco use. The last component in volves counter - advertising and promotion, product regulation, and economic incentives against tobacco. The legal environment has recently made it much more difficult to continue smoking. In March of 2007, the Iowa state legislature passed a one dollar in crease in the tax on a pack of cigarettes. In the long run this should further reduce the number of smokers by inducing people to try to quit and by making it less likely that new people will start. On July 1 of 2008 a smoking ban in most public places i n the state took effect. This not only made it more difficult for smokers to find a place to smoke, but was quite beneficial at reducing exposure to secondhand smoke. Nationally, in 2009 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was given authority to regul ate tobacco products. Tobacco Use Results Current smoking was defined as smoking at least 100 cigarettes in a lifetime and smoking everyday or some days during the past 30 days. Of all respondents surveyed in 2011, 20.4 percent reported being a current smoker. Unfortunately, trend information is not available due to 55 the change in weighting methodology. The large jump in prevalence from previous years is due to this change involving the inclusion of exclusive cell phone users The proportion of current smokers was higher for males than for females. Smoking generally declined with increasing age, education, and income. People of minority race/ethnicity had a higher proportion of smokers. Respondents with household incomes less than $15,000 reported the highest proportion of current smokers (38.6%). Only 3.9 percent of respondents age 75 years and older were current smokers (see table 16.1). Nearly 25 percent of respondents were former smokers. This means that they had smoked at least 100 cigarettes i n their lifetime, but did not smoke now. While more males were former smokers than females, the age trend for former smokers was the opposite of that for current Table 16.1: Percentage of Current and Former Smokers in Iowa, 2011 DEMOGRAPHIC Current Sm oker Former Smoker GROUPS % C.I.

The 18 to 24 year age group had only 5.5 percent former smokers, while the 65 to 74 year age group had 45.7 percent (see figure 16.1). White non -Hispanics had a higher prevalence of former smokers than minority racial or ethnic groups. When former smokers were asked how long it had been since they last smoked cigarettes regularly, the majority (58.8%) said ten or more years. When asked about attempts to quit smoking, 54.8 percent of Iowa's current smokers reported they quit smoking for a day or more during the past year. Women were more likely to try to quit than men. Little could b e said about other demographic groups since the small number of smokers in these groups led to a lack of confidence in the interpretation of the resulting figures. As the number of current smokers declines, this inability to show differences will become e ven more pronounced. In order to look at the use of other tobacco products besides cigarettes, all respondents were asked if they currently use chewing tobacco, snuff, or snus. Only 4.2 percent said they used one of these everyday or some days . All curr ent and former cigarette smokers were asked if they were smoking fewer cigarettes but using more smokeless tobacco over the past year. Only 3.4 percent said this was the case. When Figure 16.1: Percentage of Current and Former Smokers by Age, 2011 57 asked the reason for this, most chose more than one of the five listed options. All options were chosen by more than half of the respondents. The most frequently given reason, however, was the ban on smoking in public places (97%). Of smokers who had seen a doctor in the past year, 64.7 percent of them reported that the doctor had advised them to quit smoking. Of those doctors advising to quit, 61.1 percent had offered some form of assistance. Most Iowans (82.6%) said they had rules against smoking anywhere in their home. However, 7.8 percent said they allowed smoking anywhere in the house, and 1.9 percent had no rules concerning smoking in the house. The majority of respondents (73.5%) had rules against smoking in their motor vehicle. Another 8.3 percent allowed smoking anywhere in motor vehicles, while 1.8 percent had no rules on the matter. Comparison with Other States In all the states and District of Columbia, smoking prevalence ranged from a low of 11.8 percent to a high of 29 percent. Iowa's current smoking prevalence of 20.4 percent was below the median of 21.2 percent for all states. Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation The goal for Healthy People 2020 is to reduce the percentage of smokers to 12 percent, while the goal for Healthy Iowans is 15 percent. The prevalence of those reporting currently smoking is 20.4 percent in Iowa which is well above both goals. The Healthy People 2020 goal for use of smokeless tobacco is only 0.3 percent. Iowa's prevalence of such use is 4. 2 percent. There is a need for improvement in this area. Iowa fell far short of the Healthy People 2020 goal of 80 percent of current smokers attempt to quit in the past year. At 54.8 percent the rate still falls more than 20 percentage points short of the goal. Iowa also missed the Healthy People 2020 goal for recent smoking cessation success by adult smokers. 4.3 percent of former smokers said they had not smoked regularly for six months to a year, while the goal was eight percent. The Healthy Iowan s goal was 87 percent for people having rules against smoking in their home. Only 82.6 percent said they had such rules. References 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION Background Consumption of alcohol is a very widespread prac tice in our society. However, a large number of people face serious trouble because of their consumption of alcohol. Alcohol consumed on an occasional basis will pose little risk to most people and may even promote health. Even at this level, factors su ch as family history, health condition, and use of medications can mean a person should not drink at all. Furthermore, many people find it impossible to consume alcohol in a controlled manner. Several million adults engage in risky drinking that could l ead to alcohol problems. These patterns include binge drinking (drinking too much at one time) and chronic heavy drinking (drinking a large quantity of alcohol on a regular basis).1 Alcohol dependency and abuse are major public health problems carrying a large economic cost and placing heavy demands on the health care system. In fact, excessive alcohol use is the 3rd leading lifestyle -related cause of death for people in the United States each year.1 Chronic alcohol use affects every organ and system o f the body. It can lead to medical disorders (e.g., fetal alcohol syndrome, liver disease, cardiomyopathy, and pancreatitis). Heavy drinking can increase the risk for certain cancers. Drinking increases the risk of death from automobile crashes as well as recreational and on -the-job injuries. Furthermore, both homicides and suicides are more likely to be committed by persons who have been drinking.2 Binge drinking is a serious problem. It has been a particularly serious problem on college campuses. S tudents who binge drink are more likely to damage property, have trouble with authorities, miss classes, have hangovers, and experience injuries than those who do not. Among men, research indicates that greater alcohol use is related to greater sexual ag gression. Binge drinkers appear to engage in more unplanned sexual activity and to abandon safe sex techniques more often than male students who do not binge.1 Alcohol Consumption Results In the BRFSS survey, a standard drink is defined as one 12 -ounce beer, one 5 -ounce glass of wine, or a drink with one shot of hard liquor. In 2011, 60.6 percent of Iowans reported that they had at least one drink of alcohol in the past 30 days. On the days when they drank, 36.3 percent had only one drink. The median was two drinks. About 15.9 percent reported drinking five or more drinks per day on the average. In our analysis, chronic heavy drinking was defined to be an average of greater than two drinks per day for men and one drink per day for women. According t o this definition, 8.1 percent of all respondents were heavy drinkers. In spite of the fact that men had to have a larger number of drinks to be considered heavy drinkers, 10.8 percent of men were considered to be heavy drinkers, while only 5.5 percent of 60 Table 17.1 Heavy Drinking Among Iowans, 2011 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS Heavy Drinking % C.I.

Age and race/ethnicity were also associate d with the prevalence of heavy drinking. The highest prevalence of heavy drinking in all groups studied was among the 18 to 24 year age group (14.4%). Only two percent of those respondents age 75 and over and other non -Hispanics reported heavy drinking ( see table 17.1). There were more heavy drinkers among men than women at all ages (see figure 17.1). Binge drinking is defin ed as a man drink ing more than five drinks or a woman drink ing more than four drinks on one occasion. Among all adult Iowans, 23 .1 percent reported at least one binge episode in the last 30 days. 61 Even with the lessened requirement on females, nearly twice as many males binge drink than females (30.8 percent versus 15.8 percent. In addition, the likelihood of binge drink ing decreas es with age from 38.8 percent for 18 to 24 year olds to only 1.7 percent for those 75 years old and older. Unlike most risky behaviors, respondents with higher education and those with a higher household income were somewhat more likely to binge drink. R acial minorities are also somewhat less likely to report binge drinking (see table 1 7.2). Men are more likely to women to binge drink at all age levels (see figure 1 7.2). Comparison with Other States The prevalence of people reporting heavy drinking in the 50 states and District of Columbia ranges from 3.4 percent to 9.8 percent . Iowa's figure of 8.1 percent is high. The median for the states is 6.6 percent . Only four states report a higher percentage of heavy drinkers than Iowa. For binge drinking, prevalence range s from a low of 10 percent to a high of 2 5 percent with a median of 1 8.3 percent. Iowa's figure of 23.1 percent is well above the median. There are only three states with a higher prevalence of reported binge drinking. Seven out of eight of the states reporting the highest prevalence of binge drinking are in the upper Midwest. Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation The Healthy People 2020 goal for the nation for binge drinking is 24.3 percent. This modest goal is met in Iowa with 23 .1 percent . The Healthy Iowans goal for binge drinking is 16 percent. Iowa exceeded this goal. References 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Alcohol and Public Health, 2012.

DISABILITY AND ARTHRITIS Disability Background The World Health Organization's International Classification of Impairments , Disabilities, and Handicaps , defines disability as \"any restriction (resulting from an impairment) of ability to perform an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being.\" Impairment is defined as \"any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological, or anatomical structure or function.2 Chronic physical, mental, and emotional conditions can limit the ability of adults to carry out important activities such as working and doing everyday household chores. With advancin g age, an increasing percentage of adults experience limitation of activity. The latest U.S. Census estimates for 2006 found that 38.4 million people 16 years old and older in the United States and 361,000 in Iowa had a disability that prevented or limite d their ability in some way.3 Arthritis and other musculo -skeletal conditions are the most frequently reported cause of activity limitation among both working -age and older adults However, people can experience a wide range of types and severity of impa irments. Many disabled Americans use Assistive Technology Devices (ATDs) to accommodate mobility impairments and other sensory and mental impairments. These can allow a person with a disability to work and otherwise live an independent life. Disability Results In 2011, 20.2 percent of Iowans responded \"yes\" to being limited in any way in activities due to an impairment or health problem. When asked whether they had a health problem requiring the use of special equipment, 6.3 percent of adult Iowans sa id they needed such items as a cane, a wheelchair, a special bed, or a special telephone. Whether someone is considered to have a disability in this analysis is based on a positive response to either of these two questions. In 2011, 21.7 percent, of res pondents were considered to have a disability. As shown in Table 18.1, females, older people, people with less education, and people with lower household incomes reported higher percentages of disability. Of the five demographic variables analyzed, peo ple age 18 to 24 years reported the lowest percentage (10%) with those 25 to 34 years old only slightly higher. Those with household incomes less than $15,000 reported the highest percentage of disability (48.4%). Many disabled people are unable to work due to their disability. The second highest reporting group was those age 75 and over (43%). This group is the most rapidly growing group in the population. 64 Figure 18. 1: Percent of Iowans with a Disability by Age, 2011 Arthritis Background Arthri tis is the name given to a group of over 100 different rheumatic diseases and conditions that result in pain and reduction of functionality in and around the joints. The most common are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, fibromyalgia, and gout.1 Arthritis may be caused by a wearing down of cartilage, a change in bone composition, or inflammation in the joints. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in the United States. Each year, arthritis results in 992,100 hospitalizations and 44 mill ion outpatient visits .1 It also limits everyday activities and adversely affects the physical and mental health of those who are affected by it. Arthritis may affect people of all ages, but it is particularly common in the elderly. Due to the aging of t he population, it is predicted that the number of Americans with doctor diagnosed arthritis will reach 67 million by 2030.1 Self-management education interventions such as the Arthritis Self -Management Program can teach people how to manage arthritis and lessen its effects. It is important that people with arthritis keep physically active. It is possible to live well with arthritis. 65 Arthritis Results In 2011, a doctor had told 24.4% of Iowans that they had some form of arthritis. . More women than m en reported having arthritis. The prevalence decreased with greater education and income. Far fewer Hispanics reported having arthritis than other race /ethnic groups.

The group with th e lowest prevalence was people age 18 to 24 years old (2.6%) (see table 18.2). Of people who had been told they had arthritis, 43 .6 percent said they were limited in some way in their activities by arthritis or joint symptoms. When asked if arthritis o r joint symptoms now affect whether they work, the type of work they do, or the amount of work they do, 2 7 percent said it did. When asked during the past 30 days, to what extent their arthritis or joint symptoms interfered with their normal social activi ties, such as going shopping, to the movies, or to religious or social gatherings , 15.2% said a lot. When asked to rate their joint pain on a ten point scale with zero being none and 10 being very severe , there was a wide range of ratings. The median was 4, while the most frequent rating (17.1%) was 5. These limitations were worse for people with less education or household income. Figure 18.2: Percent of Iowans with Arthritis by Age, 2011 Comparison with Other States The percent of people in the 50 states and District of Columbia reporting being disabled ranged from 20.6 percent to 33 percent with a median of 25.8 percent. There were only four states with a lower rate of disability than Iowa at 21.7 percent. 67 For diagnosed arthritis the range w as from 18.2 percent to 35.9 percent. The median of all states was 24.4 percent. Iowa was right at the median. This figure is not too bad considering the high numbers of elderly in Iowa and that the state prevalences are not adjusted to control for diff er- ences in age. Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation The Healthy People 2020 goal for people with arthritis who are limited in their activities is 35.5 percent. For Healthy Iowans it is 38 percent. In Iowa, the percent of those with doctor diagno sed arthritis who report being limited is 43.6 percent. This is higher than both Iowa and national goals. Healthy People 2020 also had the goal of 29.8 percent of people whose work was limited due to arthritis. Only 27 percent of Iowans reported this, s o that this goal was achieved. Another national goal was for arthritis sufferers to rate their mean joint pain as 5 on a 10- point scale. The mean rating for Iowans was 4.2 which also was better than the goal. References 1.

IMMUNIZATION Background Influenza is a potentially life -threatening, contagious disease that is caused by a family of viruses that infect the nose, throat, and lungs. When influenza attacks the lungs, the lining of the respiratory tract is damaged. The tissues temporarily become swollen and inflamed, but usually heal within two or more weeks.1 Influenza and pneumonia combined ar e the eighth leading cause of death among all Americans and the seventh leading cause for people over age 65. Influenza and pneumonia together resulted in more than 50,000 deaths in 2009 in the U.S.6 and 557 in Iowa in 2010.5 Influenza can vary greatly f rom year to year in the severity of its impact. For instance, the usual seasonal influenza primarily was a problem for the elderly, while the recent H1N1 pandemic focused more on younger people. For healthy children and adults, influenza is typically a moderately severe illness. For unhealthy or elderly people, influenza can be very dangerous. Adults 65 years old and older who contract influenza are much more likely to have serious complications from this illness, which can affect their health and indep endence. Influenza can be prevented with the influenza vaccine. This vaccine is produced each year so that it can be effective against influenza viruses that are expected to cause illness that year. A yearly influenza vaccination has been reported to b e between 67 percent and 92 percent effective in preventing influenza and reducing its severity. The vaccine may be taken by a shot or by nasal spray. The nasal spray is not recommended for people at high risk, however. The best time to receive the infl uenza vaccine is soon after the vaccine becomes available in the fall of each year.4 The R ecommend ation for annual vaccination against seasonal influenza includes almost everyone in the United States population from six months old and older. . Influenz a activity and the Iowa media vaccination campaign \"The Flu Ends with U\" were monitored by the BRFSS in the first months of 2011, but will not be discussed here. Influenza is a very serious illness for anyone at high risk. Certain diseases that place peo ple at high risk include: Chronic lung disease such as asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, tuberculosis, or cystic fibrosis, Heart disease, Diabetes or other chronic metabolic disorders, Severe anemia, or Chronic kidney disease, Diseases or treatments that depress immunity. Some of the symptoms associated with influenza are fever, chills, coughing, weakness, loss of appetite, bodily aches and pains, sore throat, or dry cough. 69 Pneumonia is a lung disease usually caused by bacteria, viruses, and other infectious agents such as fungi. Pneumonia is frequently a complication of influenza and is responsible for the vast majority of deaths from the two. In 200 9, 1.1 million people in the U.S. were hospitalized with pneumonia and more than 50,000 people died from the disease.2 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that persons aged 65 years old or older receive at least one lifetime dose of pneumococcal vaccine.3 People at higher risk should receive the pneumonia vaccine at ag e 19 and higher. Such people would be smokers, people with respiratory problems such as asthma or COPD, and th ose with compromised immunity. Immunization Results In 2011, 70.2 percent of Iowans age 65 and over reported having a flu shot in the past 12 m onths. Among all adults, 46.9 percent had a flu immunization in the past 12 months. This was either in the form of a flu shot or a FluMist nasal spray. Females, older people, people with more education and income, and non -Hispanic Whites were more lik ely to have a flu immunization. The lowest percentage was found among people between age 18 and 24 years (33%), while the highest was for those age 75 and older (74.4%) (see table 19.1). In 2011, 70.9 percent of Iowans age 65 and over reported ever havin g a pneumonia vaccination. Among all adults, 30.6 percent had ever received a pneumonia vaccination. Older people, females, people with less education, and people with lower household income s, were more likely to have pneumonia vaccinations. Non -White or Hispanics were less likely to have a pneumonia vaccination. Age made the greatest difference in whether someone had a pneumonia vaccination. The lowest percentage of pneumonia vaccination occurred among those who were 35 to 44 years old (13.8%), while those 75 years old and older were highest by far (79.2%). The relationship with age was not perfectly linear since the youngest people were somewhat more likely to have had a pneumonia shot than those a few years older (see Table 19.1). Pneumonia vaccin ation did not really increase with increasing age until age 55. Since it is only recommended for those age 65 years and older except under special conditions, this is not surprising. Those who had ever been told they had diabetes or asthma were more like ly to receive their flu and pneumonia vaccinations than those who had not been told they had these conditions. Of all respondents ever told they had diabetes, 68.5 percent had a flu vaccination and 63 percent had a pneumonia vaccination. Of all those ev er told they had asthma, 48.7 percent had their flu vaccination, while 43.9 percent had a pneumonia vaccination . 70 Table 19.1: Percentage of influenza and Pneumonia Immunizations in Adult Iowans, 2011 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS Influenza Pneumonia % C.I. (95%) % C.I. (95%) TOTAL 20.0 (17.6 -22.4) Comparison with Other States The median percentage of the population age 65 and over who have had a flu shot in the past 12 months from all the s tates and the District of Columbia was 61.3 percent in 2011. The range was from 51.8 percent to 70.2 percent. Iowa had the highest value in the nation for people 65 years and over having a flu shot in the past year. The median percentage of the populati on age 65 years old and older who ever had a pneumonia vaccination was 70 percent. The range was from 62.5 percent to 76 percent. Iowa's value of 70.9 percent is above the median. 71 Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation The Healthy People 2020 and Healthy Iowans , goals for having a flu shot in the past 12 months and ever having a pneumonia vaccination for people age 65 and over are both 90%. Although much higher than the nation as a whole, Iowa's 2011 figures of 70.2 percent for having a flu shot and 70.9 percent for ever having a pneumonia vaccination have a long way to go to meet these targets. The Healthy People 2020 goal for flu immunization of people age 18 to 64 is 80 percent. Iowa misses this by an even greater amount having an immunization p revalence of only 41.2 percent. The Healthy People 2020 goal for ever having a pneumonia vaccination for people age 18 to 64 is 60 percent. Iowa 's pneumonia vaccination rate also is greatly lower than this with only 19.7 percent.

HIV is different from most other viruses because it attacks the immune system. The immune system gives our bodies the ability to fight infections. HIV finds and destroys a type of white blood cell that the immune system must have to fight disease. AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection. It can take years for a person infected with HIV, even without treatment, to reach this stage. Having AIDS means that the virus has wea kened the immune system to the point at which the body has a difficult time fighting infections.2 The HIV epidemic has now been with us for more than 30 years.3 The most recent estimates suggest that 33.3 million persons were living with HIV infection wo rldwide at the end of 2009 . In the United States, CDC estimates that 1,178,350 persons were living with HIV at the end of 2008, with 594,496 having died from AIDS . Over one fifth of these people living with HIV do not know that they are infected .1 Not knowin g puts them and others at risk. From 200 7 through 20 10, the estimated numbers of annual diagnoses of HIV infection in the 46 states with confidential name -based HIV infection reporting remained stable. In 20 10, the estimated rate of diagnoses of H IV infection in the 46 states was 1 6.1 per 100,000 population .1 Groups with the largest exposure include \"men who have sex with men\", injection drug use rs, African Americans, and Hispanics. New diagnoses are occurring among, women, and people infected he terosexually. These data must be used to ensure targeted prevention efforts to reach those in greatest need, with a primary focus on young African American and Hispanic men and women at risk through sexual and drug -related behaviors. African Americans and Hispanics continue to be over -represented among persons with HIV diagnoses when compared to the sizes of their populations in Iowa. However, it is important to keep in mind that non -Hispanic Whites account for 60 percent of HIV diagnoses and persons living with HIV/AIDS.5 HIV/AIDS prevalence continues to increase in Iowa. There were 1,828 persons living with HIV/AIDS who were diagnosed in Iowa on December 31, 2010, up from 1,733 a year earlier.5 In light of recent advances in HIV diagnostics and therape utics, the lifetime costs of health care associated with HIV have grown considerably. Modern HIV treatment offers 24 extra years of life - at $2,100 per month .6 The cost of drugs is nearly three -fourths of the lifetime expense. The cost of treatment sta rted at a late stage averages $4,700 per month. That's because hospital costs rise to almost half the lifetime expense. Estimated f uture costs will be $12.1 billion per year. Drugs will make up 70 percent of the cost .6 CDC recommends routine HIV testing in health care settings. People need to get tested so they can get treated and not infect others. Being tested will save their lives and the lives of other people.4 Treatment for HIV is better than ever before. 73 HIV/AIDS Results In 2011 26.5 percent of all adult respondents reported ever being tested for HIV, not including as part of a blood donation. It is not possible to determine a trend with this figure not only because of the change in weighting methodology but also because people over age 65 years are included for the first time this year. If people over age 65 years are not included the prevalence of HIV testing is 31.6 percent. Females, non -White or Hispanic race/ethnicity, younger people except those under 25 years, and people of lower househo ld income were more likely to be tested. The largest proportion of respondents tested was among those age 25 to 34 years (46.8%) . The smallest proportion Table 20.1: Percentage of Iowans Tested for HIV/AIDS, 2011 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS Had HIV Test % C.I. (95%) TOTAL 26.5 (25.1 -27.8) SEX Male 24.0 (22-26) 28.9 (27-30.8) or (5.7-9.3) 75+ Less than 27.4 (21.9 -33) H.S. or 20.9 (18.7 -23.2) Some Post -30.3) $75,000+ 27.0 (24.5 -29.6) reporting ever being tested was three percent of th ose. age 75 years and older (see table 20.1). This is the first year people age 65 years and older have even been asked this question. There is an interesting interaction between sex and age. Figure 20.1 shows that in people younger than age 45 years, many more women have been tested, while there is little difference in the older age groups. Finally, respondents were read a set of high risk sexual and drug use practices and asked if any of them applied to them. They did not have to say which ones. A total of 2.6 percent said that at least one of these statements applied to them. These respondents would have a very high risk of contracting HIV. Comparison with Other States The percentage of people who had a test for HIV ranged from 24.5 percent to 67.9 percent. The median percentage of people tested was 3 4.5 percent. There were only four states with a lower percentage than Iowa being tested at 26.5 percent. Five out of six of the lowest tested states were in the upper Midwest. 74 Figure 20.1: P ercentage of Iowans Reporting Ever Being Tested for HIV by Age and Gender, 2011 Health Objectives for the Nation Healthy People 2020 has the goal of 16.9 percent of adults age 18 to 44 being tested for HIV in the past 12 months. Iowa had a level of 9.9 percent. This is much below this goal. References 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention.
