Thanks Google but we know that self-care is so much more than that. Self-care isn't about being self-absorbed\u2014it's about caring for our families, communities, environments, and workplaces. For those of us who don't create routines for self-balancing behaviours (*Ryan puts his hand up), this is an important reality to remember and live. But what is this 'self' thing we speak of when we say 'self-care'? For me, self-care is dignity. Self-care is saying what needs to be said - honestly and with respect. Without speaking our truth, we lose our dignity - we lose ourselves. If we don't know our truth, let's not speak. If we do know our truth, let's speak it regardless of outcome. I have colleagues that embody this quality and I aspire to it! Last November I was fortunate to take part in an overnight ceremony on Vancouver Island. Through song, prayer, medicines, and seated meditation, I had the extreme displeasure of feeling the outcomes of moments in my life when I spoke without dignity\u2014selfishly, aggressively or manipulatively... moments when I spoke without truth. I re-experienced these moments from a 'third person' viewpoint. I actually felt the pain of losing my dignity\u2014of distorting myself\u2014and the pain it caused others. The pain was overwhelming ... (even compared to sitting in a mangled-lotus position on a dirt floor for 12 hours as a guy whose only form of yoga is vacuuming under his couches). As the eastern sky began to light up in the morning, it dawned on me: I need to stretch more. I also realized that, the quality of All our Relations is determined by the quality of our self-care. I couldn't 'un-do' the moments in my life where my relations became distorted and graceless by undignified speech, but I can recognize these moments as they arise in the future and remind myself that speaking truth is dignity. Now, for self-care, I'm trying to remember that if I don't know my truth: may silence make me strong. "}
