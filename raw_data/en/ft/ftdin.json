for Community Health Needs 10 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The McLean County Community Health-Needs Assessment is a collaborative undertaking by OSF St. Joseph Medical Center to highlight the health needs and well being of residents in McLean County. Through this needs assessment, collaborative community partners have identified numerous health issues impacting individuals and families in the McLean County region. Several themes are prevalent in this health-needs assessment - the demographic composition of the McLean County region, the predictors and prevalence for diseases, leading causes of mortality, accessibility to health services and healthy behaviors . Results from this study can be used for strategic decision-making purposes as they directly relate to the health needs of the community. The study was designed to assess issues and trends impacting the communities served by hospitals, as well as perceptions of targeted stakeholder groups. Specifically, this assessment provides a detailed analysis of: (1) McLean County area community health needs using secondary data; and (2) an asse ssment of perceptions and behaviors regarding health-related challenges in the community, including accessibility to needed health care. PHASE I - USE OF SECONDARY DATA TO IDENTIFY NEEDS Chapters 1-5 include a detailed analysis of secondary data to assess information regarding the health status of the community. In order to perform these analyses, information was collected from numerous secondary sources, including publically available sources as well as private sources of data. Strategic implications are discussed at the end of each chapter. Specifically, Phase I of the study highlights several critical areas of community needs: Demographics - With the changing demographics, forecasts indicate increase in chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, heart disease, and obesity. Three specific demographic trends in the region will have a significant impact on health issues, including: Elderly Population - Individuals in McLean County aged 60-64 increased from 3.2% to 4.4% between 2007 and 2010 and individuals aged 65-74 increased from 4.9% to 5.4% between 2007 and 2010. Poverty - Poverty has a significant impact on the development of children and youth. Poverty r ates are significantly higher for single -\u00admother led households compared to married-\u00adcouple families and all families. However, even given the recession, i n McLean County, the percentage of all families, married-\u00adcouple families, and female-\u00ad householder families living in poverty decreased between 2007 and 2010. Accessibility to Health Care - The lack of insurance coverage is more prevalent among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups that are often at high risk for disease and illness. Thus, a vicious cycle results where individuals who are at the highest risk for diseases are unable to receive screenings, thus perpetuating a cycle of disease. This is compounded b y unhealthy lifestyles. Obesity - Research strongly suggests that obesity is a significant problem facing youth and adults nationally, in Illinois, and within the McLean County region. In terms of obesity, the 11 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment McLean County area as a whole is higher than the state average and growing rapidly. There was a 13% increase in the growth of McLean County residents reporting they were overweight between 2006 (35.0%) and 2009 (39.5%). Considering that Illinois has the 6th highest obesity rate in the U.S., this is an important issue. Risky Behavior - Risky behaviors are defined as activities that include addiction, chemical dependency and risky sexual behaviors. Note that y outh substance usage in McLean County exceeds the State of Illinois averages for 12th graders in terms of alcohol usage. Mental Health -- Approximately 23% of residents in McLean County reported they had experienced 1-7 days with poor mental health per month between 2007 and 2009. Approximately 11% of residents in McLean County reported they had experienced 8-30 days with poor mental health per month between 2007 and 2009. For both segments of residents (those experiencing 1-7 days and 8-30 days with poor mental health per month), each was below the state average for the same time frame. Women's Health - While the percentage of women who report the time since their last mammogram was more than one year ago is lower in McLean County than in the State of Illinois (McLean: 28.5% vs. Illinois: 43.6%), growth rates for this category are dramatically higher in McLean County (135% growth between 2006 and 2009) than in the State of Illinois (15% growth between 2006 and 2009). Morbidity Issues - Several different diseases have seen significant growth between 2008 -2011. Asthma - Asthma rates are higher in McLean County than in the State of Illinois (18% and 13.3% respectively) and growth rates for asthma are significantly higher in McLean County than in the State of Illinois . Diabetes - There was a significant increase in the percentage of McLean County residents reporting they were informed they had Ty pe II diabetes between 2006 (3.6%) and 2009 (6.8%). Cardiovascular Disease - The number of cases of inpatient heart failure at Bloomington area hospitals from the McLean County region has increased 6% between 2009 (269 cases) and 2012 (285 cases) for individuals 65 years of age and older . Mortality - For McLean County, the two leading causes of mortality are heart disease and cancer. While there are other categories for mortality, heart disease and cancer are significantly more prevalent than all other categories. PHASE II - COLLECTION, ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF PRIMARY DATA A comprehensive understanding of targeted stakeholders was completed in Chapters 6-9. Specifically, it was important to understand how \"at risk\" or economically disadvantaged people perceived: (1) relative importance of health issues; (2) relative importance of unhealthy behaviors; (3) access to health care, dental care, counseling and prescription medications. Through this type of research, opportunities were identified for improving how community 12 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment health needs are addressed; and insights into how perceptions are affected by demographic characteristics. Critical findings include: Misperceptions of community health issues - Inconsistencies exist between people's perception of health issues and actual data. Based on results from the survey, respondents incorrectly perceived \"lung disease,\" \"heart disease\" and \"stroke\" as being relatively less important health concerns to the community. These results conflict with: the number of cases of COPD, a contributing factor of lung disease, increased for older individuals at McLean area hospitals between 2009 and 2012; mortality data that indicates heart disease is the leading cause of death in McLean County; the number of cases of stroke increased at McLean area hospitals between 2009 and 2012; Perceptions of the importance of access to health services - Access to health services is rated as one of the highest determinants to quality of life across all categories. Access to Medical Services - Several issues relating to health service access were identified. Choice of Medical Care - Only 53% of people living in deep poverty seek medical services at a clinic or doctor's office. For this segment of the population, it is very common to seek medical services from an emergency department (24%), or even more concerning is that 16% of this segment of the population will not seek any medical services at all. Access to Medical Care and Prescription Medications - Over 44% of the population living in deep poverty indicated there was a time in the last year when they were not able to get medical care when needed. The leading causes were lack of insurance and inability to afford a copayment or deductible. Similar results were found for access to prescription medicatio n. Access to Dental Care - While significant research exists linking dental care to numerous diseases, including heart disease, only 51% of the aggregate McLean County population had a checkup in the last year. Specifically, men, younger respondents, non-White ethnicity, less educated people, lower household income and the homeless were less likely to visit a dentist. Access to Counseling -- Approximately 25% of people living in deep poverty indicated they were not able to get counseling when they needed it over the last 12 months. Leading indicators are younger people, less education, lower household income and homelessness. While affordability and insurance were the leading reasons, fear and emba rrassment were also significant. Access to Information - Across categories, residents of the McLean County area get most of their medical information from doctors . The next most prevalent source of information is the Internet for the aggregate population and friends/family for those living in poverty . 13 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Type of Insurance -The most prevalent type of insurance for the aggregate population is private or commercial; however, those living in poverty are disproportionately more reliant on Medicaid. Also for those living in poverty, 45% do not have any type of insurance at all. Healthy Behaviors - Several issues relating to healthy behaviors were identified. Physical Exercise -More educated people with higher income are more likely to engage in physical exercise. Although only 17% of the population engages in exercise at least 5 times a week. Healthy Eating - Only 7% of the population consumes at least the minimum recommended servings of fruits/vegetables in a day. Those that are more likely to have healthy eating habits include women, older people, people with higher education and more income. Homeless people are less likely to exhibit healthy eating habits. Decrease Smoking - Smoking is on the decline, however, less educated people, men, younger people, non-White residents, those with lower income and homeless people are still more likely to smoke. Self-Perceptions of Health - In terms of self -perceptions of physical and mental health, almost 90% of the population indicated that they were in average or good physical health. Similar results were found for residents' self -perceptions of mental health. PHASE III - PRIO RITIZATION OF HEALTH-RELATED ISSUES The identification and prioritization of the most important health-related issues in the McLean County region are identified in Chapter 10. After summarizing all of the issues in the Community Health Needs Assessment, a comprehensive analysis of existing community resources was performed to identify the efficacy to which health-related issues were being addressed. Finally, a collaborative team of leaders in the healthcare community used an importance/urgency methodology to identify the most critical issues in the area, including: o Obesity o Risky Behaviors-Substance Abuse o Mental Health o Healthy Behavior o Access to Health Services o Dental Specific criteria used to identify these issues included: (1) magnitude to the community; (2) strategic importance to the community; (3) existing community resources; (4) potential for impact; and (5) trends and future forecasts. 14 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment I. INTRODUCTION Background The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act), enacted March 23, 2010 adds new requirements on tax-exempt hospitals to conduct community health -needs assessments and to adopt implementation strategies to meet the community health needs identified through the assessments. This community health-needs assessment (CHNA) takes into account input from specific individuals who represent the broad interest of the community served by OSF St. Joseph Medical Center including those with special knowledge of or expertise in public health. For this study, a community health-needs assessment is defined as a systematic process involving the community, to identify and analyze community health needs and assets in order to prioritize these needs, and to plan and act upon unmet community health needs. Results from this assessment will be made widely available to the public. The structure of the CHNA is based on standards used by the Internal Revenue Service to develop Form 990, Schedule H-Hospitals, designated solely for tax-exempt hospitals. The fundamental areas of the community needs assessment are illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 1. Community Needs Assessment Framework 15 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment The community health-needs assessment is divided into three distinct phases. Phase I focuses on collection of existing secondary data relating to a comprehensive health profile and drawing strategic inferences. Phase II focuses on primary data collection to assess perspectives of key stakeholders, including those with special knowledge of the health community. Primary data collection includes a concerted effort to target the at-risk population in the region. Phase III focuses on the prioritization of needs within the community. Design of the Collaborative Team: Community Engagement, Broad Representation and Special Knowledge In order to engage the entire community in the CHNA process, a collaborative team of health-professional experts and key community advocates was created. Mem bers for the Collaborative team were carefully selected to ensure representation of the broad interests of the community. Specifically, team members included representatives from OSF St. Joseph Medical Center, administrators from the County Health Department, physicians/administrators from clinics serving the at-risk population, representation from the United Way. Note that numerous partner and agency organizations also participated in this study. Specific discussion of these organizations can be f ound in the METHODS section. Engagement occurred throughout the entire process, resulting in shared ownership of the assessment. The entire collaborative team met in November of 2012 and in February 2013.

Definition of the Community In order to determine the geographic boundaries for OSF St. Joseph Medical Center, analyses were completed to identify what percentage of inpatient and outpatient activity was represented by McLean County. Data show that McLean County alone represents 73% of all patients for the hospital. 19 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment In terms of patient categories for this CHNA, in addition to defining the community by geographic boundaries, this study will target the at-risk populations as an area of potential opportunity to improve the health of this population. Purpose of the Community Health-Needs Assessment In the initial meeting, the collaborative committee identified the purpose of this study. Specifically, this study has been designed to provide necessary information to health -care organizations, including hospitals, clinics and the health departments, in order to create strategic plans in program design, access and delivery. Results of this study will act as the platform to allow health-care organizations to orchestrate limited resources to improve management of high- priority challenges. By working together, the hospitals, clinics and health departments will use this CHNA to help improve the quality of health care in the defined community. When feasible, data are assessed longitudinally to assess changes and patterns and benchmarked with state averages. II. METHODS To complete the comprehensive community health-needs assessment, multiple sources were examined. Secondary statistical data were used for the first phase of the project. Additionally, based on a sample of 774 survey respondents from McLean County, phase two focused on assessing perceptions of the community health issues, unhealthy behaviors, issues with quality of life, healthy behaviors and access to health care . Data were collected to as sess the importance of specific issues, as well as access to health care. Phase I. Secondary Data for Community Health Needs Assessment We first used existing secondary statistical data to develop an overall assessment of the health-related issues in the community. Note that several tables were aggregated from numerous data sources. For example, educational report-card tables were compiled by collecting information from numerous individual school report cards and combining aggregated data into these tables. Five chapters were completed based on assessment of secondary data. Each chapter contains numerous categories. Within each category, there are specific sections , including definitions, importance of categories, data and interpretations. At the end of each chap ter there is a section on the key strategic implications that can be drawn from the data. Note that most of the data used for this phase was acquired via publically available data sets. However, for specific sections of Chapter 2 and the majority of Chapter 4, the most recent data available were from 2009. Given a purpose of this assessment is to measure subsequent improvements to community health over time, using data that are three years old is not sufficient. Theref ore we used COMPdata from 2008-2012 for all of our disease categories. This required manual aggregation of data from the hospitals serving the McLean County area. Based on several retreats , a separate OSF Collaborative Team identified six primary categories of diseases, including: age related, cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer, type 2 diabetes 20 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment and infections. We also identified secondary causes of diseases as well as intentional and unintentional injuries. In order to define each disease category, we used modified definitions developed by Sg2. Sg2 specializes in consulting for health care organizations. Their team of experts includes MDs, PhDs, RNs and health care leaders with extensive strategic, operational, clinical, academic, technological and financial experience. Phase II. Primary Data Collection This section describes the research methods used to collect, code, verify and analyze primary data. Three specific areas include the research design used for this study: survey design, data collection and data integrity. A. Survey Instrument Design Initially, all surveys used in previous health -needs assessments in the U.S. that we were able to identify were assessed to identify common themes and approaches to collecting community health-needs data. In all, 15 surveys were identified. By leveraging best practices from these surveys, we created our own pilot survey. To ensure that all critical areas were being addressed, the entire OSF collaborative team was involved in survey design/approval through several fact-finding sessions. Specifically, for the community health need assessment, five specific areas were included: Ratings of health problems in the community - to assess the importance of various community health concerns. Survey items included areas assessing topics such as cancer, diabetes and obesity. In all, there were 20 choices provided for survey respondents. Ratings of unhealthy behaviors in the community - to assess the importance of various unhealthy behaviors. Survey items included areas assessing topics such as violence, drug abuse and smoking. In all, there were 14 choices provided for survey respondents. Ratings of issues with quality of life - to assess the importance of various issues relating to quality of life in the community. Survey items included areas as sessing topics such as access to health care, safer neighborhoods and effective public transportation. In all, there were nine choices provided for survey respondents. Accessibility to health care - to assess the degree to which residents could have access to health care when needed. Survey items included areas assessing topics such as access to medical, dental and mental care, as well as access to prescription drugs. Healthy behaviors - to assess the degree to which residents exhibited healthy behavi ors. The survey focused on areas such as exercise, healthy eating habits and smoking. Finally, demographic information was collected to assess background information necessary to segment markets in terms of the five categories discussed above. 21 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment After the initial survey was designed, a pilot study was created to test the psychometric properties and statistical validity of the survey instrument. The pilot study was conducted at the Heartland Community Health Clinic's three facilities. The Heartland Clinic was chosen as it serves the at-risk population and also has a facility that serves a large percentage of the Hispanic population. A total of 130 surveys were collected. Results from the pilot survey revealed specific items to be included/excluded in th e final survey instrument. Selection criteria for the final survey included validity, reliability and frequency measures based on responses from the pilot sample. Note that these surveys were not included in the final sample. A copy of the final survey is included in Appendix 1. B. Sample Size In order to identify our potential population, we first identified the percentage of the McLean County population that was living in poverty. Specifically, we multiplied the population of the county by its respective poverty rate to identify the minimum sample size to study the at-risk population. Poverty rate for McLean County was 12.9 percent. The populations used for the calculation was 170,556, yielding a total of 22,002 residents living in poverty in the McL ean County area. We assumed a normal approximation to the hypergeometric given the targeted sample size. n = (Nz 2pq)/(E2 (N-1) + z2 pq where: n = the required sample size N = the population size pq = population proportions (set at .05) z = the value that specified the confidence interval (use 95% CI) E =desired accuracy of sample proportions (set at +/- .05) For the total McLean County area, the minimum sample size for those living in poverty was 374. Note that for aggregated analyses, an additional 271 random surveys were needed from those not living in poverty in order to identify and analyze general perspectives. In order to satisfy sampling requirements for both those living in poverty as well as aggregate perspectives, the data collection effort for this CHNA yielded a total of 774 usable responses. This met the threshold of the desired confidence interval. Final results for data collection yielded a total of 415 respondents living in poverty for this CHNA and data for the total aggregate population yielded a total of 774 usable responses. This exceeded the threshold of the desired 95% confidence interval. Specifically, these numbers met the 99% confidence interval threshold for the aggregate population. 22 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment C. Data Collection The partner organizations for McLean County were: Western Ave Community Center (Food Pantry), Bloomington Clare House (Food Pantry), Bloomington Home Sweet Home (multiple services, including homeless shelter), Bloomington Loaves & Fishes (soup kitchen), St. Mary's parish, Bloomington Salvation Army/Safe Harbor (homeless shelter), Bloomington Heartland Head Start (education), Bloomington Eastview Christian Church (Food Pantry), Normal YWCA, Bloomington Bloomington Public Library, Bloomington John M. Scott Center, City of Bloomington (multiple services) Peace Meal sites: Lexington Community Center; Woodhill Towers (Bloomington); Normal Township Senior Activity Center Mt. Pisgah Church, Bloomington To collect data in this study, two techniques were used. First, an online version of the survey was created. Second, a paper version of the survey was distributed. In order to be sensitive to the needs of respondents, surveys stressed assurance of confidentiality and anonymity. To specifically target the at-risk population, surveys were distributed at all homeless shelters and soup kitchens. Specific partner organizations are mentioned above and also include the United Way of McLean County and the McLean County Health Department. Note that since we specifically targeted the at-risk population as part of the data collection effort, this became a stratified sample, as we did not specifically target other groups based on their socio -economic status. However, when using convenience-sampling techniques, we made a concerted effort to assure randomness in order to mitigate potential bias in the sample. D. Data Integrity Comprehensive analyses were performed to verify the integrity of the data for this research. Without proper validation of the raw data, any interpretation of results could be inaccurate and misleading if used for decision making. Therefore, several tests were performed to ensure that the data were valid. These tests were performed before any analyses were undertaken. Data were checked for coding accuracy, using descriptive frequency statistics to verify that all data items were coded correctly. This was followed by analyses of means and standard deviations and comparison of primary data statistics to existing secondary data. Additionally , for regression models, residual analyses were performed to ensure that the data met assumptions of the underlying models. Specifically, residuals were analyzed to make sure (1) the data were normally distributed, (2) no patterns existed among residuals (e.g., heteroscedasticity) and (3) no significant outliers biased the outputs. 23 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment E. Analytic Techniques In order to ensure statistical validity, we used several different analytic techniques to assess data. Specifically, frequencies and descriptive statistics were used for identifying patterns in residents' rating of various health concerns. Additionally a ppropriate statistical techniques were used for identification of existing relationships between perceptions, behaviors and demographic data. Specifically, we used Pearson correlations, x 2 tests and tetrachoric correlations when appropriate, given charact eristics of the specific data being analyzed. 24 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment PHASE I - SECONDARY DATA RESEARCH FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS In this section of the community health needs assessment, there are five chapters that assess different aspects of the general community as well as specific health-related issues. All of the information in this section is taken from secondary data sources. As described in the METHODS section, some data sources are publically available and other data sources are comprised of aggregated hospital data from 2012. The chapters are as follows: C HAPTER 1. DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE CHAPTER 2. PREVENTION CHAPTER 3. SYMPTOMS /PREDICTORS CHAPTER 4. DISEASES /MORBIDITY CHAPTER 5. MORTALITY 25 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment CHAPTER 1. DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE 1.1 Population Importance of the measure: Population data characterizes the individuals residing within the jurisdictional boundaries McLean County.

As indicated in Table 1.3-1, the number of family households within McLean County decreased between 2007 and 2010. Table 1.3-1 Number of Family Households in McLean County, 2007-2010 Source: 2010 US Census; of Family Households in McLean County, 2007-\u00ad2010 36 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 1.3.1 /1.3.2 Single and Related Family In McLean County, data from 2010 suggest a 0.1% increase from 2007 in the number of male households with no wife present. Between 2007 and 2010, the percentage of husband-wife families decreased in McLean County by 2.4%. When children under the age of 18 are considered, there has been a decrease in the percentage of children living in a family comprised of a female householder only, with no husband present from 6.3% in 2007 to 5.5% in 2010.

Between 2006 and 2009, McLean County saw a greater net decrease in teenage births (-5.8%) than the State of Illinois (-4.0%) during the same time frame. Table 1.3.4-1: Births to Teenage Mothers in McLean County vs. State of Illinois, 2009 vs. 2006 Source: Illinois Department of State of Illinois Births to Teenage Mothers in McLean County vs. State of Illinois, 2009 vs. 2006 2009 2006 39 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 1.4 Economic information Importance of the measure: Median income divides households into two segments with one half of households earning more than the median income and the other half earning less. Because median income is not significantly impacted by unusually high or low-income values, it is considered to be a more reliable indicator than average income. To live in poverty means to not have enough income to meet one's basic needs. Accordingly, poverty is associated with numerous chronic social, health, education, and employment conditions. 1.4.1 Median income level For 2007 and 2010, the median household income in McLean County exceeded the State of Illinois median household income. Table 1.4.1-1: Median Household Income for McLean County, 2007 vs. 2010 Source: 2007 & 2010 American State of Illinois Median Household Income for McLean County, 2007 vs. 2010 2010 2007 40 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 1.4.2 Unemployment For the years 2007 to 2011, the McLean County unemployment rate has been lower than the State of Illinois unemployment rate. Between 2008 and 2009, the unemployment increased from 5.0% in 2008 to 7.1% in 2009 and rising to a peak of 7.8% in 2010. Data from 2011 suggests the unemployment rate in McLean County was 7.2% compared to the overall State of Illinois unemployment rate of 9.8%. Table 1.4.2-1: Average Annual Unemployment Rate for McLean County Region, 2007-2011 Source: Bureau 2009 2008 2007 Average Annual Unemployment Rate for McLean County, 2007-\u00ad2011 McLean County State of Illinois 41 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 1.4.3 Families in poverty Poverty has a significant impact on the development of children and youth. Poverty r ates are significantly higher for single-mother led households compared to married -couple families and all families. In McLean County, the percentage of all families, married-couple families, and female -householder families living in poverty decreased between 2007 and 2010. Table 1.4.3-1: Percentage of Families Living in Poverty in McLean County, 2010 vs. 2007 Source: 2010 and 2007 American Percentage of Families Living in Poverty in McLean County, 2010 vs. 2007 All families Married-\u00adcouple families Female householder, no husband present 42 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 1.5 Education Importance of the measure: According to the National Center for Educational Statistics, \"the better educated a person is, the more likely that person is to report being in 'excellent' or 'very good' health, regardless of income\" (NCES, 2005). Educational attainment and reading/math scores are well researched, with findings strongly related to an individual's propensity to earn a higher salary, gain better employment, and foster multifaceted success in life. As such, research suggests that the higher the level of educational attainment and the more successful children are in school, the better one's heath will be and the greater likelihood of one selecting healthy lifestyle choices. 1.5.1 3 rd/8th grade reading and math In 2012, nearly all of the school districts in McLean County had higher averages than the State of Illinois averages. However, one district (Lexington) scored lower than the State of Illinois 3rd grade reading average (76.1%). Table 1.5.1-1 Grade 3 Student Achievement in McLean County 2012 Source: Illinois State Boar d of Education, School Year 2012 District Report Card 4 Leroy CUSD 2 Lexington CUSD 7 McLean County USD 5 Olympia CUSD 16 Ridgeview CUSD 19 Tri Valley CUSD 3 Grade 3 Student Achievement in McLean County 2012 3rd Grade 2012 Reading 3rd Grade Math 43 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Similar to the 3rd grade scores, most of the school districts in McLean County had higher averages than the State of Illinois averages for 8th grade students. However, one district (Ridgeview) scored lower than the State of Illinois 8th grade math average (85.0%) and two districts (Bloomington and Ridgeview) scored lower than the State of Illinois 8th grade reading average (86.2%).

The causes of truancy vary considerably for young children; however, truancy of middle - and high-school students is more likely a result of the inappropriate behav ior and decisions of individual students. Primary school truancy often results from decisions and actions of the parents or caregivers of the children rather than the students. Zero school districts in McLean County exceed the State of Illinois average truancy rate for 2012.

This condition can make it difficult for a person to do activities such as walking, climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning, or remembering. This condition can also impede a person from being independent, from being able to go outside the home alone or to work at a job or business. This condition can also impact a person's ability to achieve an education and can influence a person's ability to access appropriate health care. 1.6.1 Physical Approximately 33% of residents in McLean County reported they had experienced 1 -7 days with poor physical health per month between 2007 and 2009. This percentage grew 64% since 2004-2006. With regard to residents experiencing 8 -30 days with poor physical health per month, McLean County residents were slightly below the state average for the same time frame, as 11.5% of residents reported poor physical health. Table 1.6.1-1 Percentage of McLean County Respondents with Days of Physical Health Rated \"Not Good\" Per Month, 2004-2006 vs. 2007-2009 Source: 8-\u00ad30 days McLean County State of Illinois Percentage of McLean County Respondents with Days of Physical Health Rated \"Not Good\" Per Month, 2004-\u00ad2006 vs. 2007-\u00ad2009 2007-\u00ad2009 2004-\u00ad2006 47 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 1.6.2 Mental Approximately 23% of residents in McLean County reported they had experienced 1-7 days with poor mental health per month between 2007 and 2009. For both segments of residents (those experiencing 1-7 days and 8-30 days with poor mental health per month), each was below the state average for the same time frame. Table 1.6.1-2 Percentage of McLean County Region Respondents with Days of Mental Health Rated \"Not Good\" Per Month, 2004-2006 vs. 2007-2009 Source: 8-\u00ad30 days McLean County State of Illinois Percentage of McLean County Region Respondents with Days of Mental Health Rated \"Not Good\" Per Month, 2004-\u00ad2006 vs. 2007-\u00ad2009 2007-\u00ad2009 2004-\u00ad2006 48 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Demographic Profile: Strategic Implications Changing demographics and health care: Recent data in May 2012 from the Kaiser Family Foundation 1 and Congressional Budget Office2 suggest that the number of individuals 65 years and older in the United States will increase by one-third between 2012 and 2022. With the changing demographics, it is anticipated an increase in chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and heart disease, and obesity will contribute to the growing cost of health care3. In addition, advances in medical technology and medicine may enable individuals to live longer, thus requiring extensive medical care. These national trends are prevalent in the State of Illinois and McLean County as seen in Chapter 1. Of particular note, individuals in McLean County aged 60-64 increased from 3.2% to 4.4% between 2007 and 2010 and individuals aged 65-74 increased from 4.9% to 5.4% between 2007 and 2010. Additionally, the median age of individuals in McLean County increased from 30.8 years to 32.0 years between 2007 and 2010. As individuals age and live with disabilities, it greatly impacts the degree of self - sufficiency and medical care required to maintain satisfactory well -being. With the changing demographics resulting from the aging of baby boomers, it is anticipated McLean County will experience an increase in the number of elderly individuals living with disabilities and chronic conditions. Educational attainment and health care: For over two decades, empirical research strongly suggests a positive r elationship between education and health 4,5,6,7 (Adams, 2002; House et. al, 1990; Ross & Wu, 1995; Sander, 1999). The predominant way education impacts better health is through enhancing the decision - making capabilities of an individual. In this way, wh en an individual is better educated, he or she tends to have a better understanding of symptoms, be better equipped to explain symptoms to a doctor, and make better choices with regard to individual health inputs. Accordingly, more effective treatments and positive outcomes result later in life. A symbiotic relationship exists between health and education. Consider that healthier children miss fewer days of school and are more \"ready to learn.\" Success in school begins prior to kindergarten as new research on cognitive development shows the importance of health, nutrition, and intellectual stimulation during the first years of life. To be prepared to learn in kindergarten, children need pre-literacy skills. They must also be able to make and keep frie nds, develop positive relationships with adults, and feel a sense of opportunity and excitement for the world around them. As their child's first teacher, much of this responsibility falls upon parents. Research tells us the most reliable predictor of educ ational success for children is whether they are reading at grade level by the end of 3rd grade. Note that according to data presented in Chapter 1, while nearly all school districts are above the State of Illinois average s, Lexington school district scored lower than the State of Illinois 3 rd grade reading average. According to research, a child from a low -income family who completes algebra has virtually the same chance of going to college as a child from an upper -income family who passes the course. Thus, it is not about the math, it's about learning to problem solve. 49 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Economic well-being and health care: Educational attainment also impacts economic well -being. Research suggests that the more education obtained by individuals, the better jobs th ese individuals earn8. Better jobs yield greater earning and benefits, including health insurance. Furthermore, if educated individuals are unemployed, research suggests that these individuals are unemployed for shorter durations than less educated individuals9. For many individuals, insurance coverage is a primary consideration when evaluating whether or not to seek medical treatment. Using health care appropriately, instead of the ER in non-emergencies, is better for patients and lowers cost of health care to society. Accordingly, the uninsured are less likely to access preventive care or seek early treatment of illness and therefore may miss more time at work. Similarly, it is difficult to hold a job when a person is not healthy. Unemployment leads to poverty and has far-reaching impacts within society. Poverty disproportionately impacts families and children. Fortunately, McLean County has seen percentage of families living in poverty decrease between 2007 and 2010. Additionally, in 2010 the McLean County median household income was greater than the State of Illinois median household income. Finally, early sexual activity can contribute to child poverty. Again, it is fortunate that current rates for births to teenage mothers in McLean County are significantly lower than the State average. 50 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Endnotes for Chapter 1 1 Kaiser Family Foundation, \"Health Care Costs: Key Information on Health Care Costs and Their Impact,\" May 2012. 2 Congressional Budget Office, CBO's 2011 Long-Term Budget Outlook, June 2011, p.ix, http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/122xx/doc12212/06-21-Long-Term_Budget_Outlook.pdf 3 Kaiser Family Foundation, \"Health Care Costs: Key Information on Health Care Costs and Their Impact,\" May 2012. 4 Adams, S.J.

PREVENTION 2.1 Accessibility Importance of the measure: It is critical for health care services to be accessible to the constituencies who will take advantage of its benefits. Therefore, accessibility to health care must address both the financial costs associated with health care and the supply and demand of medical services. 2.1.1 Insurance Coverage With regard to medical insurance coverage, d ata gathered from the Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System suggest that residents in McLean County possess health care coverage at a higher percentage than the State of Illinois average. Table 2.1.1-1 Percentage of McLean County Respondents with Health Care Coverage, 2004-2006 vs. 2007-2009 Source: Illinois Behavioral State of Illinois Percentage of McLean County Respondents with Health Care Coverage, 2004-\u00ad2006 vs. 2007-\u00ad2009 2007-\u00ad2009 2004-\u00ad2006 52 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment With regard to dental insurance, the most recent data from the Illinois BRFSS indicate 75.1% of McLean County residents possessed dental insurance coverage in 2007 -2009 compared to 67.9% of McLean County residents in 2004-2006. Table 2.1.1-2 Percentage of McLean County Respondents with Dental Insurance, 2004- 2006 vs. 2007-2009 Source: Illinois Behavioral Respondents with Dental Insurance, 2004-\u00ad2006 vs. 2007-\u00ad2009 53 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment With regard to Medicare Coverage, approximately 17% of McLean County residents received Medicare coverage between 2007 and 2009. Table 2.1.1-3 Percentage of McLean County Respondents with Medicare Coverage, 2007- 2009 Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 17.1% 82.9% Percentage of McLean County Respondents with Medicare Coverage, 2007-\u00ad2009 Covered by Medicare Not Covered by Medicare 54 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 2.1.2 Access and utilization Physician capacity can be measured using various metrics. One commonly utilized method is to evaluate what percentage of individuals have a usual health care provider. A usual health care provider signifies that these individuals are more likely to parta ke in wellness check- ups and less likely to utilize emergency room visits as their primary health care service. Tables 2.1.2-1 and 2.1.2-2 reflect the number of emergency room visits by condition. Of particular note, the number of emergency room visits for cardiovascular conditions has increased for the Bloomington-area hospital (defined as OSF/ St.Joseph Medical Center and Advocate BroMenn Medical Center) by 27% between 2009 and 2012. Note however that as of 2010, Prompt Care was no longer counted as ER visits. It now falls under physician office visits. This may impact year-to-year changes, so growth rates should be interpreted with caution .

Between 2004 -2006 and 2007-2009, the percentage of residents in McLean County reporting a usual health care provider increased by 4.2%. Similarly, the percentage of State of Illinois residents increased by 3.0% during the same time frame.

With regard to the capacity of dentists , McLean County is significantly better than the State of Illinois average for 2007-2009. Furthermore, McLea n County denoted negative growth in the percentage of respondents who have not visited a dentist in two or more years, as 10.4% of McLean County residents have not visited a dentist in 2 or more years. Table 2.1.2-4 Percentage of McLean County Respondents who have not Visited a Dentist in 2+ Years, 2004-2006 vs. 2007-2009 Source: Illinois State of Illinois Percentage of McLean County Respondents who have not Visited a Dentist in 2+ Years, 2004-\u00ad2006 vs. 2007-\u00ad2009 2007-\u00ad2009 2004-\u00ad2006 58 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 2.2 Wellness Importance of the measure: Preventative health care measures, including scheduling routine well-visits, engaging in a healthy lifestyle, and undertaking screenings for diseases, are essential to combating morbidity and mortality and help reduce health care costs. 2.2.1 Check up Numerous health problems can be minimized when detected early. Therefore regularly scheduled routine checkups can be very important. According to the latest data from the Illinois BRFSS, 73.1% of residents in McLean County report having had a routine checkup within the last year. In addition, 26.9% of McLean County residents report that it has been more than one year since their last check-up or they have never had one.

The percentage of residents who report they have high cholesterol is lower in McLean County (28.9%) than the State of Illinois average of 37.3%. In addition, 65.1% of residents in McLean County report having had a cholesterol screening within the last year. These data for 2007 -2009 are lower than the State of Illinois average of 68.4%.

With regard to mammograms, 94.3% of individuals over the age of 40 in McLean County report that they have had a mammogram at some point in their life. These data are higher than the State of Illinois average of 92.1%. With regard to the time elapsed since one's last mammogram, nearly 72% of residents from McLean County reported they had had a mammogram within one year or less. This statistic is significantly better than the State of Illinois average (56.4%).

Residents in McLean County adhere to regular sustained physical activity guidelines at a higher propensity than the State of Illinois average (37.7%). The most recent data f rom 2007- 2009 indicate that 48.5% of McLean County residents meet or exceed the regular and sustained physical activity guidelines. With regard to work-related activity, upwards of 70% of McLean County residents mostly sit or stand to execute their job tasks. The specific percentage in 2007-2009 for McLean County (68.7%) is higher than the State of Illinois average of 65.2%.

Residents in McLean County report approximately 40% of individuals meet the moderate activity (based on heart rate) standard compared to 22.6% of individuals in the State of Illinois as a whole. The moderate activity standard is defined as five, 30-minute sessions per week. With regard to the vigorous activity standard, defined as three high-intensity 20-minute sessions per week, McLean County residents lag the state average. Table 2.2.4-4 Percentage of McLean County Residents Who Meet Moderate Activity Standard (5x per week for 30 minutes per day) Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor State of Illinois Percentage of McLean County Residents Who Meet Moderate Activity Standard (5x per week for 30 minutes per day) 2007-\u00ad2009 2004-\u00ad2006 72 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Table 2.2.4-5 Percentage of McLean County Residents Who Meet Vigorous Activity Standard (3x per week for 20 minutes per day) Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor State of Illinois Percentage of McLean County Residents Who Meet Vigorous Activity Standard (3x per week for 20 minutes per day) 2007-\u00ad2009 2004-\u00ad2006 73 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Nutrition and diet are critical to preventative care. Nearly half (43.9%) of McLean County residents report low consumption (0-2 servings per day) of fruits and vegetables. This percentage is lower than the State of Illinois average of 44.9% for the same measure. Note however that the percentage of McLean County residents who consume 5 or more servings per day is lower (13.7%) than the State of Illinois percentage (22.6%). Table 2.2.4-6 Total Servings of Fruits/Vegetables Consumed by McLean County Residents Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk of Illinois Total Servings of Fruits/Vegetables Consumed by McLean County Residents 0-\u00ad2 servings/day 3-\u00ad4 servings/day 5 or more servings/day 74 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 2.2.5 Oral Health Research suggests that poor oral hygiene leads to more serious medical concerns. For the 2007-2009 time frame, 78.9% of McLean County residents had their teeth cleaned within the last year. The percentages for McLean County are significantly better than that of the State of Illinois average (66.3%). Table 2.2.5-1 Time Since Last Teeth Cleaning by McLean County Region Residents Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor State of Illinois Time Since Last Teeth Cleaning by McLean County Residents, 2007-\u00ad2009 More than one year/ never 75 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Prevention: Strategic Implications Increase health care insurance coverage: Research suggests that private health insurance companies cover nearly 1/3 of the national health expenditures. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, private health insurance companies comprised 32.7% of the health expenditures in the United States for 2010. 1 While this percentage has held constant around 32% since 1990, it marks an increase of approximately 11% since 1960. Medicare covered approximately 20.2% of national health expenditures in 2010, up nearly 4% since 2000. In addition, data sugg est the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by individuals has steadily decreased, from a high of 33.4% of national health care expenditures in 1970 to 14.7% in 2000, and now 11.6% in 2010. The data are clear: Americans are paying less for out-of-pocket health care expenditures and relying more and more on private or public insurance policies to shoulder the financial burdens of health care. Private funds provided approximately 55% of health care payments in 2010 compared to 45% from federal and local government funds. 2 The rising cost of health care services has resulted in a significant number of families cutting back on care and electing to postpone or cancel treatments. A 2011 Kaiser Health Tracking Poll found that 50% of Americans have cut back on me dical treatments in the past 12 months based on cost concerns. 3 Furthermore, 40% reported being \"very worried\" about having to shoulder more of the financial burden for their health care. Data seem to reinforce this concern, as health insurance premiums have consistently outpaced inflation and the growth in worker earnings. In McLean County, approximately 17% of residents rely on Medicare coverage as their primary insurance coverage. Recent data suggest nearly 97% of McLean County residents possess medical health care coverage. This percentage is well above the 86% response rate for the State of Illinois. Similarly, dental insurance coverage across McLean County is higher than the state average, as 75.1% of McLean County residents report possessing dental insurance coverage. Increase the prevalence of preventative health care screens: There appears to be a relationship between individuals who have health insurance and individuals who take advantage of preventative health care screenings. Re search for over twenty years suggests that the strongest predictors of failure to receive screening tests was lack of insurance coverage. 4 Furthermore, research suggests that lack of insurance coverage is more prevalent among socioeconomically disadvanta ged groups that are often at high risk for disease and illness. 5 Thus, a vicious cycle results where individuals who are at the highest risk for diseases are unable to receiving screening, thus perpetuating a cycle of disease and high health care expenditures. Screening guidelines from the United States Preventative Services Task Force offer insight on appropriate preventative care and screenings for youth, adults, and older individuals. 6 Adherence to these guidelines provides data-driven benchmarks from physicians in the fields of primary care and preventative medicine. Above all, it is critical for physicians and patients to 76 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment engage in thorough evaluation of treatment options and engage in high-quality shared decision- making regarding treatment options. 7 Routine physicals are essential to detectin g adverse medical conditions. Research suggests many rural communities have dramatic medical professional shortages.8 With regard to women's health issues, while the percentage of women who report the time since their last mammogram was more than one year ago is lower in McLean County than in the State of Illinois (McLean: 28.5% vs. Illinois: 43.6%), growth rates for this category are dramatically higher in McLean County (135% growth between 2006 and 2009) than in the State of Illinois (15% growth between 2006 and 2009). With regard to immunizations, the Center for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends everyone 6 months and older receive a flu vaccination every year. 9 In McLean County, the percentage of residents who obtained a flu shot is considerably lower than the recommendations from the CDC.

SYMPTOMS AND PREDICTORS 3.1 Tobacco Use Importance of the measure: In order to appropriately allocate health care resources, a thorough analysis of the leading indicators regarding morbidity and disease must be conducted. In this way, health care services and personnel can target affected populations more effectively. Research suggests tobacco use facilitates a wide variety of adverse medical conditions. Smoking significantly impacts the health status of individuals. Smoking rates have decreased in McLean County and smoking rates are lower than the State of Illinois averages. There was a 23% decrease in the percentage of McLean County residents reporting they were current smokers between 2006 (20.8%) and 2009 (16.1%). For comparison, there was an 8% decrease in the percentage growth of Illinois residents reporting they were current smokers between 2006 (20.5%) and 2009 (18.8%). Approximately two -thirds of McLean County residents classify themselves as non-smokers, whereas approximately 20% of residents are former smokers. Table 3.1-1: Smoking Status of Residents in McLean County Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor State of Illinois Smoking Status of Residents in McLean County smoker former smoker non-\u00adsmoker 78 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Many individuals begin smoking tobacco as teenagers. 34% of McLean County residents began smoking regularly before the age of 18. Table 3.1-2: Reported Age that McLean County Residents Began Smoking Regularly Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 34.0% 66.0% Reported Age thatMcLean County Residents Began Smoking Regularly, 2007-\u00ad2009 Under age 18 Age 18 or older 79 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Family units have different rules regarding smoking at home. 78.9% of McLean County residents report that they are not allowed to smoke in their home. Table 3.1-3: Rules for Smoking in the Home by McLean County Residents Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor not allowed anywhere inside your home Smoking is allowed in some places or at some time Smoking is allowed anywhere inside the home There are no rules about smoking inside the home Rules for Smoking in the Home by McLean County Residents McLean County 2007-\u00ad2009 McLean County 2004-\u00ad2006 80 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Attitudes toward smoking in restaurants have changed in the past six years. In 2004- 2006, 43.2% of McLean County residents believed that smoking should be allowed in some areas within restaurants. However, by 2007-2009, the percentage of respondents who agreed with that statement had dropped significantly to 15.7%. Table 3.1-4: McLean County Resident Options Regarding Smoking in Restaurants Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Some areas Not allowed at all McLean County Resident Options Regarding Smoking in Restaurants 2007-\u00ad2009 2004-\u00ad2006 81 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 3.2 Drug and Alcohol Abuse Importance of the measure: Alcohol and drugs impair decision-making, often leading to adverse consequences and outcomes. Research suggests that alcohol is a gateway drug for youths, leading to increased usage of substances in adult years. Accordingly, the values and behaviors toward substance usage by high school students is a leading indicator of adult substance abuse in later years. Compared to the State of Illinois average (17.5%), McLean County has a higher percentage of residents at risk for acute or binge drinking. Table 3.2-1: Percent of McLean County Residents at Risk for Acute/Binge Drinking Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Data from the 2008 Illinois Youth Survey, which measures illegal substance use (alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs - mainly marijuana) among adolescents, suggest emerging trends for adult substance usage. In McLean County among 8 th graders, the average age at first use of alcohol, tobacco and marijuana is 13.0, 11.5 and 12.3 years respectively. The same average age for 12th graders is 16.0, 14.7 and 15.4 years respectively. In McLean County, the past 30-day use is higher for alcohol use (12th graders) when compared to State of Illinois State of Illinois Percent of McLean County Residents at Risk for Acute/Binge Drinking 2007-\u00ad2009 2004-\u00ad2006 82 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Table 3.2-2: Reported Substance Abuse Usage of McLean County 8th Graders, 2008 Source: http://iys.cprd.illinois.edu/PDFs/2008_CountyCharts_Full_Report.pdf Table 3.2-3: Reported Substance Abuse Usage of McLean County 12th Graders, 2008 Source: http://iys.cprd.illinois.edu/PDFs/2008_CountyCharts_Full_Report.pdf 83 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 3.3 Overweight and Obesity Importance of the measure: Individuals who are overweight and obese place greater stress on internal organs, thus increasing the propensity to utilize health services. In terms of obesity and being overweight, Table 3.3 -1 shows that in McLean County, the number of people who have trouble with their weight has increased over the five years from 2004 to 2009. Note specifically that both the percentages of obese and overweight people experienced a significant increase. Table 3.3-1: Percentage of People Diagnosed with Overweight or Obesity in McLean County and Illinois Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor State of Illinois Percentage of People Diagnosed with Overweight or Obesity in McLean County and Illinois underweight/normal overweight obese 84 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment With regard to those individuals advised by a medical professional about their weight, nearly 21% of residents in McLean County have been advised about their weight during the 2007-2009 time frame. In Table 3.3-3, over one-third of McLean County residents are attempting to lose weight and Table 3.3-4 illustrates the percentage of McLean County residents attempting to maintain their current weight. Table 3.3-2: Percent of McLean County Residents Advised About Weight Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Table 3.3-3: Percent of McLean County Residents Now Trying to Lose Weight Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor McLean County Residents Now Trying to Lose Weight 85 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Table 3.3-4: Percent of McLean County Residents Now Trying to Maintain Current Weight Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor McLean County Residents Now Trying to Maintain Current Weight 86 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Symptoms/Predictors: Strategic Implications Effectively combating youth obesity: Research strongly suggests that obesity is a significant problem facing youth and adults nationally, in Illinois, and within McLean County. The US Surgeon General has characterized obesity as \"the fastest-growing, most threatening disease in America today.\" 1 According to the Obesity Prevention Initiative from the Illinois General Assembly, 20% of Illinois children are obese2. Data from 2010 indicate 62% of Illinois adults are obese or overweight, with a disproportionate number of obese or overweight individuals living in rural areas. The financial burden of overweight and obese individuals is staggering, as the estimated annual medical costs attributed to obesity in Illinois for 1998-2000 exceeded 3.4 billion dollars, ranking Illinois 6th in the nation for obesity-attributed medical costs3. With children, research has linked obesity to numerous chronic diseases including Type II diabetes4, hypertension, high blood pressure, and asthma. Adverse physical health side effects of obesity include orthopedic problems with weakened joints and lower bone density5. Detrimental mental health side effects include low self -esteem, poor body image, symptoms of depression and suicide ideation6. Obesity impacts educational performance as studies su ggest that overweight students miss one day of school per month on average and school absenteeism of obese children is six times higher that of non-obese children7. With adults, obesity has far-reaching consequences. Testimony to the Illinois General Assembly indicated that obesity-related illnesses contribute to worker absenteeism, slow workflow, and high worker compensation rates.8 A Duke University study on the effects of obesity in the workforce noted 13 times more missed work days by obese employee s than non- obese employees. Nationwide, lack of physical activity and poor nutrition contribute to an estimated 300,000 preventable deaths per year. Within McLean County, leading indicators suggest obesity is a growing concern. With regard to nutrition, evidence suggests residents in McLean County are not eating enough fruits and vegetables. Table 2.2.4-6 indicates that between 2007 and 2009, only 13.7% of McLean County residents consumed 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day. These figures are considerably less than the 22.6% of Illinois residents who eat more than 5 servings per day . Furthermore, approximately 50% of McLean County residents consume 0-2 servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Research indicates physical activity helps to prevent illness and obesity 9. Data regarding the values toward exercise and the actual time spent exercising may contribute to obesity in McLean County. For example, data from the Center for Disease Control indicate that 66% of children walked or biked to school in 1973. By 2000, that figure had decreased to only 13%.10 As seen in Table 2.2.4-4, residents in McLean County report approximately 40% of individuals meet the moderate activity standard compared to 22.6% of individuals in the State of Illinois as a whole. However, this means approximately 60% of residents do not meet the moderate activity standard. 87 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Aggressively addressing youth substance abuse: The use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs is a significant contributor to the escalating costs of health care service delivery. According to the Center for Disease Control, tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. 11 On a societal level, alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use leads to accidents, violent behavior, emotional trauma, and assaults. It is estimated that drug-induced related risky behavior needlessly drains community resources such as police intervention, emergency services, and criminal justice costs. The Surgeon General contends that \"alcohol remains the most heavily abused substance by America's youth.\" 12 Dr. Peter Monti, Director of the Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies at Brown University notes that alcohol disrupts the continued growth of an adolescent's brain and \"impacts the brain's ability to learn life skills.\" 13 Studies show that an adolescent needs to only drink half as much alcohol as an adult to suffer similar adverse brain effects. 14 Research shows that cigarette smoking as a teenager leads to higher risks for lung cancer as an adult, reduces the rates of lung growth, and the maximum l evel of lung function that could be achieved. 15 Financially, underage drinking is estimated to cost the nation upwards of $62 billion dollars annually in deaths, injuries, and other economic losses.16 A Columbia University study examining the impacts of substance abuse in mid-sized cities and rural America suggested that tobacco use was more prevalent in mid -sized cities and rural areas than large metropolitan areas; specifically, young adults in mid-sized cities and rural areas were 30% more likely than adults in larger cities to have smoked a cigarette in the last month. 17 In McLean County, smoking rates have decreased since 2004-2006 and are now significantly lower than the state of Illinois average. Conversely, youth substance usage in McL ean County exceeds the State of Illinois averages for 12th graders (alcohol) and a higher proportion of residents engage in binge drinking (19.0%) versus 17.5% overall in the State of Illinois.

DISEASES /MORBIDITY Note in this chapter, given the lack of recent disease/morbidity data from existing secondary data sources, much of the data used in this chapter was manually gathered from two McL ean County hospitals: OSF St. Joseph Medical Center and Advocate BroMenn Medical Center. 4.1 Age related Importance of the measure: Age related statistics regarding morbidity gain insight into the prevalence of disease within two vulnerable populations - the very young and the very old. Health care services designed to meet the needs of these populations are very expensive and therefore, a thorough understanding of the leading indicators for these populations helps with managing service delivery costs. 4.1.1 Low birth-weight rates Low birth-weight rate is defined as the percentage of infants born below 2,500 grams or 5.5 pounds. Very low birth-weight rate is defined as the percentage of infants born below 1,500 grams or 3.3 pounds. In contrast, the average newborn weighs about 7 pounds. The percentage of babies born with low and preterm birth weights in McLean County was greater than the State of Illinois averages. Table 4.1.1-1: Percentage of Babies Born Preterm or with Low Birth Weight in McLean County, 2009 Source: Illinois Department of of Illinois Percentage of Babies Born Preterm or with Low Birth Weight in McLean County, 2009 Low Birth Weight (<2500 grams) Very Low Birth Weight (<1500 grams) Preterm (<37 weeks) 90 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 4.1.2 Initiation of prenatal care Prenatal care is comprehensive medical care provided for the mother and fetus, which includes screening and treatment for medical conditions as well as identification and interventions for behavioral risk factors associated with adverse birth outcomes. Ko telchuck Index Scores are used to determine the quantity of prenatal visits received between initiation of services and delivery. Adequate (80%-109% of expected visits) and Adequate Plus (receiving 110% of recommended services) of received services is com pared to the number of expected visits for the period when care began and the delivery date. Of the babies born in 2009 in McLean County, 85.9% were born with \"Adequate\" or \"Adequate Plus\" prenatal care. This figure is significantly better than the State of Illinois average of 80.2% of babies born with similar prenatal care. Table 4.1.2-1: Percentage of Babies Born with Adequate or Better Prenatal Care based on Kotelchuck Index Scores in McLean County, 2009 Source: Illinois Department State of Illinois Percentage of Babies Born with Adequate of Better Prenatal Care based on Kotelchuck Index Scores in McLean County, 2009 91 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 4.2 Cardiovascular Importance of the measure: Cardiovascular disease is defined as all diseases of the heart and blood vessels, including ischemic (also known as coronary) heart disease, cerebrovascular disease , congestive heart failure, hypertensive disease, and atherosclerosis. 4.2.1 Hypertension High blood pressure, which is also known as hypertension, is dangerous because it forces the heart to work extra hard to pump blood out to the rest of the body and contributes to the development of the hardening of the arteries and heart failure . An average of 27 cases of hypertension complication per year is reported Bloomington area hospitals. Cases of hypertension complication peaked in FY 2010 when 27 instances were reported overall. The most recent data indicate 20 cases of hypertension and 25 case of hypertension complication in FY 2012.

In many cases, these types of injuries \u2014and the deaths resulting from them\u2014are preventable. Suicide is intentional self -harm resulting in death. These injuries are often indicative of serious mental health problems requiring the treatment of other trauma-inducing issues. 4.8.1 Intentional - suicide For McLean County in 2009, the percentage of deaths attributed to suicide is 1.9% and almost twice the State of Illinois average.

Research suggests that infants born at low birth weight are at greater risk for life-threatening complications including infections, breathing problems, neurological problems and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). 1 Other studies suggest that low birth weight babies are also at a higher risk for developmental disabilities, such as learning disabilities and attention deficits, than babies with normal birth weights. Cognitive function of low birth weight babies may also be diminished leading to higher rates of sub-average IQ (< 85) than normal birth weight babies. 2 Regular prenatal care is a vital aspect in producing healthy babies and children. The employment of screening and treatment for medical conditions as well as identification and interventions for behavioral risk factors associated with poor birth outcomes are important aspects of prenatal care. Research suggests that women who receive adequate prenatal care are more likely to have better birth outcomes, such as full term and normal weight babies. 3 Prenatal care can provide health risk assessments for the mother and fetus, early intervention for medical conditions and education to encourage healthy habits, including nutritional and substance -free health during pregnancy. According to a study by The National Public Health and Hospital Institute, cost of care and other financial barriers were cited as reasons expectant mothers did not get adequate prenatal care. 4 Emphasize the link between blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases: Research from the Center for Disease Control estimated that the total cost of cardiovascular diseases in the United States for 2010 was $444 billion. 5 In essence, one out of every six dollars spent on health care is spent on the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. 6 However, controlling one's blood pressure and decreasing one's intake of cholesterol also reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases. For example, research from the CDC suggests a \"12-13 point reduction in average systolic blood pressure over 4 years can reduce heart disease risk by 21%, stroke risk by 37%, and risk of total cardiovascular death by 25%.\" 7 Data from the Bloomington area hospitals paint a striking portrait regarding the leading indicators of cardiovascular disease. The number of cases of inpatient heart failure at Bloomington area hospitals from the McLean County region has increased 6% between 2009 (269 cases) and 2012 (285 cases) for individuals 65 years of age and older . In addition, the number of cases of inpatient disease of the venous system at Bloomington area hospitals from the McLean County region has increased 16% between 2009 (57 cases) and 2012 (66 cases). Finally, the number of cases of inpatient myocardial infarcti on for individuals 45 to 64 years of age at Bloomington area hospitals from the McLean County region has increased 35% between 2009 (75 cases) and 2012 (101 cases). 130 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Endnotes Chapter 4 1 Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University, High-Risk Newborn: Low Birthweight.

MORTALITY Importance of the measure: Presenting data that focuses on diseases provides an opportunity to analyze the ratio of sick individuals to healthy individuals in the McLea n County Region and, in addition, define and quantify what diseases are causing the most death and disability. The top two leading causes of death in the State of Illinois and McLean County are similar as a percentage of total deaths. Diseases of the Heart comprise 23% of deaths in McLean County and Cancer comprises 23% of deaths in McLean County. Both Diseases of the Heart and Cancer contribute a lower percentage of deaths in McLean County than the State of Illinois as a whole. However Alzheimer's Disease was attributed to 5.9% of deaths in 2009 in McLean County vs. 2.8% of deaths in the State of Illinois, making Alzheimer's Disease the 4th leading cause of death in McLean County compared to the 6th leading cause of death in the State of Illinois. Table 5.1-1. Top 5 Leading Causes of Death for all Races by County, 2009 Rank McLean County State of Illinois 1 Disea ses of Heart (23%) Diseases of Heart (25%) 2 Malignant Neoplasm (23%) Malignant Neoplasm (24%) 3 Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease (6%) Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease (5%) 4 Alzheimer's Disease (6%) Cerebrovascular Disease (5%) 5 Accidents (5%) Accidents (4%) Source: Illinois Department of Public Health 132 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Mortality: Strategic Implications Minimize unnecessary medical interventions to decrease mortality rates: Three decades of research suggests that more care for patients is associated with higher mortality.1 This paradox is best explained by the fact that all medical procedures possess risk and by increasing the number of interventions a patient receives, the more risk incurred by the patient. More risk increases the chances of errors and additional physicians becoming involved to treat the patient. The Institute of Medicine contends that this fragmentary nature of the US health care delivery system is one of the major drivers of poor quality and higher costs. 2 Poor quality disproportionately impacts those with chronic illnesses. Statistically, an estimated 90 million Americans live with at least one chronic illness, 70% of Americans die from chronic disease, and 90% of deaths among the Medicare population are attrib uted to just nine chronic illnesses: congestive heart failure, chronic lung disease, cancer, coronary artery disease, renal failure, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, chronic liver disease, and dementia. 3 The costs to treat chronic diseases are staggering, as inefficiencies drive up the cost of care. Patients with chronic conditions are often treated by primary care providers in addition to specialists. In most cases, little is done to coordinate treatments. Over time, as the chronic condition becomes more debilitating, patients require more care and the cost of care increases. According to the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, patients with chronic illnesses in their last two years of life account for nearly 32% of total Medicare spending. 4 Furthermore, overtreatment in the U.S. wastes an estimated 20 to 30 cents on every health care dollar spent.5 Address the diverse needs of underserved populations: Research suggests individuals of color are at greater risk to be afflicted with violent crime, perinatal conditions, and chronic diseases. The U.S. Bureau of Justice notes that a racial divide impacts the prevalence of individuals being stricken by violent crime. In 2005, national homicide rates for African Americans were six times higher than the rates for whites. 6 Adverse perinatal conditions include poor maternal health and nutrition, inadequate care during pregnancy and childbirth, and problems relating to premature births. With regard to chronic diseases including heart disease and cancer, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Minority Health suggests African Americans are 30% less likely to be diagnosed with heart disease than Whites, but are more like ly to die from it. Furthermore, African Americans are 1.5 times more likely than Whites to have high blood pressure and African American women are 1.7 times more likely to be obese. 7 The incidence of strokes disproportionately impacts African Americans , as they are 70% more prone to having a stroke than Whites. With mortality rates, Black men are 60% more likely to die from a stroke. For stroke survivors, African Americans are more often disabled than Whites.8 For cancer, Black men are 30% more likely than Whites to have new cases of prostate cancer and are twice as likely to be diagnosed with stomach cancer. The 5 -year survival rates for African Americans are lower for lung and pancreatic cancer, and they are 2.4 times as likely to die from prostate cancer. Black women are 10% less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than Whites, but they are 34% more likely to die from it. Black women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with stomach cancer and are 2.4 times more likely to die. 9 133 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Endnotes for Chapter 5 1 The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice.

Numerous opportunities may exist that are related to impacting community health benefits, but are not published in secondary research sources. Rather they a re discovered through unbiased data collection, rigorous statistical modeling and analyses, and simple, common -sense interpretations and conclusions. Through this type of research, the health -care community can expect to identify areas for self -improvement, opportunities for addressing community needs and underlying perceptions of how demographics impact the community's perceptions and effectiveness. Phase II research consists of providing structure, information, documentation and practical interpretation of data. Five specific objectives are accomplished in the primary research: Create a statistically valid research instrument to collect necessary information; Collect data using a partnership process (rather than respondent mentality); Assess perceptions of current/potential community issues; Segment markets based on key demographics; Draw conclusions and discuss potential future directions to improve the health of the community. In Phase II of the community health needs assessment, there are four chapters that assess different aspects of the general community as well as specific health -related issues for the at-risk population. The chapters are as follows: C HAPTER 6. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF RESPONDENTS CHAPTER 7. FINDINGS AND RESULTS COMMUNITY PERCEPTIONS CHAPTER 8. ACCESSIBILITY TO HEALTH CARE CHAPTER 9. HEALTH -RELATED BEHAVIORS 135 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment CHAPTER 6. G ENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF RESPONDENTS As mentioned in the Methods section of this study, data were collected via on-line surveys and paper surveys. In this chapter, the characteristics of the sample are presented. A total of 774 surveys were completed. All data includes the entire sample, except where specifically noted. Note that for most characteristics in this chapter, data are analyzed for: (1) the overall sample; and (2) by the at risk population. According to the CDC, at risk populations are characterized by economic disadvantage. Specifically, according to the CDC Public Health Workbook, at risk populations are defined as those individuals living in deep poverty, which for this study is operationalized as those with a household income of less than $20,000 . Note that 415 respondents were in this income category. 6.1 Age The average age of respondents was 42.9 years old. The distribution is reflective of the 2010 Census data, however, the mean age of surveyed respondents is slightly older, compared t o the Census average age of 32.0 years old. This occurred because survey respondents were all adults, age 18 and above. Table 6.1 Age Distribution for McLean County and Deep Poverty 1 12 19 20 25 15 8 2 18 19 21 22 12 6 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Under 20 21-\u00ad30 31-\u00ad40 41-\u00ad50 51-\u00ad60 61-\u00ad70 71 and older Percentage of Respondents Age Distribution for McLean County and Deep Poverty McLean County Poverty 136 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 6.2 Race and Ethnicity Overall demographics for race/ethnicity mirrored the secondary data assessed in Phase I. Comparing to Census data and the survey respondents, most ethnic backgrounds were similar to one another. However, higher percentages of individuals identifying as Black/African American were included in the study. Table 6.2 Race/Ethnicity Distribution for McLean County and Deep Poverty 73 17 4 0 1 1 4 64 27 7 0 1 1 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 White Black/African American Hispanic/Latino PaciSic Islander (Native Hawaiian, Samoan, Guamanian/Chamorro) Native American/American Indian/Alaska Native Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Filipino/a) Other Percentage of Respondents Race/Ethnicity Distribution for McLean County and Deep Poverty McLean County Poverty 137 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 6.3 Educational Attainment Level of education for survey respondents was similar to Cens us data; however, note that 22% of those living in poverty have not completed high school. Table 6.3 Highest Educational Attainment for McLean County and Deep Poverty 19 20 8 21 20 7 5 2 6 9 29 32 12 10 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Percentage of Respondents Highest Educational Attainment for McLean County and Deep Poverty McLean County Poverty 138 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 6.4 Income Distribution Note that income distribution for survey respondents is skewed low, as 45% of the overall sample had an income level of less than $20,000. This is a result of the targeted efforts to survey the at-risk population. Table 6.4 Income Distribution for McLean County 45 19 11 8 6 11 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Less than $20,000 $20,001 to $100,000 over $100,000 Percentage of Respondents Income Distribution for McLean County McLean County 139 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 6.5 Living Arrangements Note that overall, over twice as many respondents indicated they owned homes compared to those individuals who rented. To protect the dignity of homeless survey respondents, a specific choice of homeless was not available, rather there was a category for \"other.\" Table 6.5 Living Arrangement Distribution for McLean County and Deep Poverty 41 54 5 63 15 22 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Rent Own Homeless Percentage of Respondents Living Arrangement Distribution for McLean County and Deep Poverty McLean County Poverty 140 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 6.6 Household Composition Household composition is based on the number of individuals living in a household. Overall the most prevalent response was 2 people per household, with the exception of those living in deep poverty, where the most prevalent response was one individual living in a household. Table 6.6 Household Composition for McLean County and Deep Poverty 6.7 Employment Status For employment status, overall, 34% of respondents were employed full time, 10% were employed part time, and 16% were unemployed. The rest of the population was either retired, in school, disabled, or served in the armed forces or was a homemaker. 25 33 16 14 12 36 22 15 9 18 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 1 2 3 4 5 or more Percentage of Respondents Number of People in the Home Household Composition for McLean County and Deep Poverty McLean County Poverty 141 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 6.8 Gender The one demographic variable that was significantly skewed was gender. Overall 70% of respondents were women and 30% of respondents were men. According to Census data, men and women are evenly divided in McLean County. For this type of survey, it is expected that women would be more likely to fill out the survey compared to men. Note that in a research study performed by the Heart of Illinois United Way in 2011, a positive correlation was found between women and concern for health -care related issues. Stated differently, women are more interested in participating in these types of surveys then men.

C OMMUNITY PERCEPTIONS In this chapter results of the first three sections of the survey are analyzed and discussed. Specifically, perceptions of Health Problems in the Community, Unhealthy Behaviors and factors impacting Quality of Life are presented. First, aggregate scores are presented. Then responses are presented for those living in deep poverty. After each category, correlation analyses between perceptions and demographic variables are presented in order to identify where certain demographic characteristics influence the way respondents perceive specific attributes of the community. Note that for aggregated perceptions of the McLean County community, modifications to data were made given the skewed income data and skewed gender data. The refore specific cases were selected randomly based on income and gender, in order to replicate the demographics of the community based on Census data. The sample used for aggregated analyses contains 609 responses. 7.1 Health Problems in the Community 7.1.1 Aggregated Results The first dimension of the survey asked respondents to rate the three most important health problems in the community. Respondents had a choice of 20 different options. The health problem that rated highest was cancer. It was si gnificantly higher than other categories based on t-tests between sample means. This was followed by mental health issues and obesity identified 33 -34% of the time. Diabetes, heart disease/attack, and aging issues were identified 27-30% of the time. The next set of health problems identified were dental health and infectious diseases. Other categories were only identified less than 15% of the time. Note that perceptions of the community were accurate in some cases, but inaccurate in others. For example, while cancer is a leading cause of mortality in McLean County, the number of cases treated has been steadily declining for some cancer types. Also, obesity is an important issue and the survey respondents accurately identified obesity as an important health problem. In contrast, \"lung disease\" and \"stroke\" ranked much lower yet the number of cases of COPD, a contributing factor of lung disease, increased for older individuals at McLean area hospitals between 2009 and 2012 and the number of cases of stroke increased at McLean area hospitals between 2009 and 2012. 143 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Table 7.1.1 McLean County Frequencies for Most Important Perceived Health Problems in the Community Note: n=609 39 34 33 30 28 27 24 15 11 10 7 7 7 6 4 3 2 2 1 1 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 Cancer Mental health issues Obesity/overweight Diabetes Heart disease/attack Aging issues Dental health Infectious diseases Chronic pain Teenage pregnancy HIV/AIDS Injuries Stroke STI Lung disease Birth defects Infant death Kidney disease Lead poisoning Liver disease Percentage of Respondents McLean County Frequencies for Most Important Health Problems in the Community 144 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 7.1.2 Perceptions of Individuals Living in Poverty When assessing perceptions of those living in poverty, it can be seen that some of the health problems change in terms of importance. For example, while many of the top perceived health problems remain constant, others become more important. For example, 18% of individuals living in poverty identified chronic pain as a concern and 34% of individuals living in poverty identified dental health as a co ncern. Table 7.1.2 Frequencies for Most Important Perceived Health Problems in the Community from Individuals Living in Poverty 2 3 3 4 5 6 6 10 10 13 13 18 20 22 22 22 32 32 34 34 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Lead poisoning Kidney disease Liver disease Infant death Birth defects Lung disease Stroke Injuries STI HIV/AIDS Teenage pregnancy Chronic pain Infectious diseases Aging issues Heart disease/attack Obesity/overweight Cancer Mental health issues Dental health Diabetes Frequencies for Most Important Perceived Health Problems in the Community from Individuals Living in Poverty 145 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 7.1.4 Relationships between Perceptions and Demographics Only significant relationships are reported in this section.

Table 7.1.3 Significant Correlations among Most Important Perceived Health Problems in the Community and Demographic Variables 147 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 7.2 Unhealthy Behaviors Respondents were asked to select the three most important unhealthy behaviors in the community out of a total of 14 choices based on importance. Again note that the modified sample of 609 was used for aggregated responses in order to more accurately reflec t the characteristics of the McLean County population. 7.2.1 Aggregate Unhealthy Behaviors The unhealthy behavior that rated highest was alcohol abuse. It was significantly higher than other categories based on t-tests between sample means. This was followed by drug abuse, smoking, poor eating habits, lack of exercise, and angry behavior/general violence. Statistically, these three choices were rated similarly. The next unhealthy behaviors were domestic violence and child abuse . Other categories were only identified 14% of the time or less. Note that perceptions of the community were accurate in some cases but inaccurate in others. Table 7.2.1 McLean County Frequencies for Most Important Perceived Unhealthy Behaviors in the Community Note: n=609 46 35 33 32 31 29 20 15 14 6 6 4 4 3 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Alcohol abuse Drug abuse Smoking Poor eating habits Lack of exercise Angry behavior/violence Domestic violence Child abuse Not being able to receive a routine checkup Elder abuse Reckless driving Suicide Unsafe sex Failure to wear seatbelts 148 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 7.2.2 Perceptions of Individuals Living in Poverty When assessing perceptions of those living in poverty, it can be seen that major issues like alcohol abuse and drug abuse become significantly more important, indicating that individuals in poverty perceive more problems with substance abuse. Conversely, poor eating habits are perceived as being less important.

Again note that the modified sample of 609 was used for aggregated responses in order to more accurately reflect the characteristics of McLean County. 7.3.1 Aggregate issues impacting quality of life The issues impacting quality of life that rated highest were job opportunities and access to health services. They were both significantly higher than other categories based on t-tests between sample means. It is not surprising that job opportunities was rated high given the recent recession. This was followed by affordable housing, safer neighborhoods, healthy food choices and less poverty. Statistically, these four choices were rated similarly.

Table 7.3.3 Significant Correlations among Most Important Perceived Factors that Impact Quality of Life and Demographic Variables 154 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Community Perceptions: Strategic Implications Lung disease appears to be perceived relatively low compared to actual rates of COPD and asthma in McLean County. Individuals with more education appear to have the largest misperceptions regarding the importance of understanding lung disease in the commu nity. Similarly, instances of stroke seem to be perceived relatively low compared to actual rates of stroke in McLean County. Females and younger individuals appear to have the largest misperceptions regarding the importance of understanding stroke i n the community. Heart disease appears to be perceived relatively low compared to actual causes of mortality. Specifically, respondents who identify with Black ethnicity appear to have the largest misperceptions regarding the importance of understanding he art disease in the community. 155 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment CHAPTER 8. A CCESSIBILITY TO HEALTH CARE In this chapter, results examining access to health services are presented. Specifically, access to medical care, prescription medication, dental care and counseling are presented. First, scores are presented for McLean County. Next, responses are presented for those living in deep poverty. After each category, relationships between accessibility and demographic variables are presented in order to identify where certain demographic characteristics influence access to health services. 8.1 Choice of Medical Care Respondents were asked to select the type of health care they used when they were sick. Six different alternatives were presented, including clinic or doctor's office, emergency department, Urgent care facility, health department, no medical trea tment, and other. The modified sample of 609 was used for aggregated responses in order to more accurately reflect the demographic characteristics for McLean County. 8.1.1 Aggregate Reponses The most common response was clinic/doctor's office, where 59% of survey respondents chose this as their primary choice for medical care. This was followed by the emergency department at a hospital (11%), not seeking medical attention (10%), the urgent care (9%), other (8%), and the health department (3%). Note however that Health Department numbers may be skewed lower, as no surveys were distributed at the Health Department to ensure accurate measures for accessibility to health care. Moreover, respondents may have interpreted the Health Department as a clinic. Table 8.1.1 McLean County Frequencies for Choice of Medical Care n=609 3 8 9 10 11 59 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Health Department Other Urgent Care Center I don't seek medical attention Emergency Department Clinic/Doctor's ofSice Percentage of Respondents McLean County Frequencies for Choice of Medical Care 156 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 8.1.2. Perceptions of individuals living in poverty Note that for individuals living in poverty, 53% choose a clinic/doctor's office as their first choice for medical care and 16% of individuals living in poverty do not seek medical attention. 24% utilize the emergency department when sick. Table 8.1.2 Frequencies for Choice of Medical Care from Individuals Living in Poverty 0 5 5 16 24 53 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Other Urgent Care Center Health Department I don't seek medical attention Emergency Department Clinic/Doctor's ofSice Percentage of Respondents Frequencies for Choice of Medical Care from Individuals Living in Poverty 157 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 8.1.3 Relationships between Choice of Medical Care and Demographics Note that for Chapter 8 and 9 the homeless are added as a demographic variable. Health department tends to be rated higher by people with the following characteristics: lower income and less educated. Individuals identifying with White ethnicity tend to rate it lower. Emergency department tends to be rated higher by people with the following characteristics: men, younger, of Black ethnicity, less education, and lower income. Clinic/Doctor's office tends to be rated higher by people with the following characteristics: women, older, white ethnicity, more education, and higher income. Individuals of Latino/a ethnicity tend to rate it lower. Don't seek medical treatment tends to be rated higher by people with the following characteristics: men, younger, less education, and lower income. Urgent Care Center tends to be higher by individuals of Latino/a ethnicity , of White ethnicity, more education and higher income. Individuals of Black ethnicity tend to rate it lower. Table 8.1.3 Significant Correlations among Choice of Health Care and Demographic Variables 158 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 8.2 Frequency of Checkups 8.2.1 Aggregated responses Respondents were asked how often they had a checkup. Of respondents, 65% received a checkup in the last year, 16% in the past 1 -2 years, 7% in the last 3-5 years, 8% 5 years or more and 4% have never been to a doctor's office for a checkup. The modified sample of 609 was used for aggregated responses in order to more accurately reflect the demographic characteristics of McLean County. Table 8.2.1 McLean County Frequencies for Time Since Last Checkup Note: n=609 65 16 7 8 4 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Within the last year 1-\u00ad2 years ago 3-\u00ad5 years ago 5 or more years ago I have never been to a doctor for a checkup Percentage of Respondents McLean County Frequencies for Time Since Last Checkup 159 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 8.2.2 People living in poverty Note that people living in poverty were different than the aggregated population when going to a doctor for a checkup. Specifically, 27% of people living in deep poverty had not seen a doctor in 3 or more years.

Moreover, results of Ordinary-Least-Squared regression models show that homelessness is the most important predictor, followed by income, gender and age, based on significance levels of beta coefficients. Table 8.2.3 Significant Correlations for Time Since Last Checkup Gender - Age - Education - Income - Homeless + 161 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 8.3 Access to Medical Care Respondents were asked, \"Was there a time when you needed medical care bu t were not able to get it?\" 75% of McLean County residents were able to receive medical care, however compared to individuals living in deep poverty, only 56% were able to receive medical care. Put differently, 44% of individuals living in poverty could not get access to medical care when necessary.

Therefore a survey respondent was more likely to answer that a longer time has passed since his or her last dental checkup if they were a man, they were younger, they were of non-White ethnicity, they possessed less education, they possessed less income, and were homeless. 171 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Respondents were then asked, \"Was there a time when you needed dental care but were not able to get it?\" Note that for McLean County, only 30% respondents indicated that they were unable to obtain dental care when they needed it. Compared to the figures for people living in poverty, 44% indicated that they could not get access to dental care wh en necessary. Logistic regression modeling indicated that lower income, younger age , Black ethnicity and Latino/a ethnicity were more likely not to have access to dental care based on significance levels of beta coefficients.

Therefore a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or she needed dental care and were unable to receive it if they were younger, of non-White ethnicity, of lower income, homeless and possessed less education. 173 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment The leading causes of why someone did not have access to dental care were no insurance (73%) and the inability to afford copayments or deductib les (33%). While fear was a non-issu e with access to medical care, 6 % of respondents indicated they did not get access to dental care because they were uncomfortable going to the dentist. Note that total percentages do not equal 100% as respondents could choose more than one answer. Table 8.5.5 Frequencies for \"Why weren't you able to get dental care?\" for McLean County Note: n=147 73 33 16 9 8 6 5 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 I didn't have dental insurance I couldn't afford to pay my co-\u00adpay or deductible The dentist refused to take my insurance or Medicaid I didn't have any way to get to the dentist I didn't know how to Sind a dentist Fear Too long to wait for appointment Percentage of Respondents Frequencies for \"Why weren't you able to get dental care?\" for McLean County 174 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Table 8.5.6 Significant Correlations for \"Why weren't you able to get dental care?\" Note several significant relationships between demographic variables and the reasons why individuals were not able to obtain dental care in the past year: No insurance tends to be rated higher by individuals with less income. Refused my insurance/Medicaid tends to be rated higher by women. Fear tends to be rated higher by younger people. 175 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 8.6 Access to Counseling Respondents were asked, \"Was there a time when you needed counseling but were not able to get it?\" 14% of respondents in McLean County agreed that when he or she needed counseling, he or she was unable to obtain it. The percentage for individuals living in poverty is nearly double (25%). Logit regression results indicated that low income, younger people and homelessness were the most important predictors of no access to counseling, respectively. Table 8.6.1 Frequencies for \"Was there a time when you needed counseling but were not able to get it?\" for McLean County and Individuals Living in Poverty 86 75 14 25 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 McLean County Poverty Percentage of Respondents Frequencies for \"Was there a time when you needed counseling but were not able to get it?\" for McLean County and Individuals Living in Poverty No Yes 176 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Table 8.6.2 Significant Correlations for \"In the last year, was there a time when you needed counseling but could not get it?\" Age - Education - Income - Homeless + For relationships between needing counseling and demographic variables, note that the relationships are reverse coded. Therefore a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or she needed counseling and was unable to receive it if they were homele ss, possessed less education, possessed lower income, and were younger. 177 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment The leading causes of why someone did not have access to counseling were no insurance (50%) and the inability to afford copayments or deductibles (28%). Embarrassment was the sixth leading cause at 11%. Note that total percentages do not equal 100% as respondents could choose more than one answer. Table 8.6.3 Frequencies for \"Why weren't you able to get counseling?\" for McLean County Note: n=147 50 28 17 14 13 11 10 9 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 I didn't have insurance I couldn't afford to pay my co-\u00adpay or deductible I didn't know how to Sind a counselor The counselor refused to take my insurance or Medicaid I didn't have any way to get to the counselor Embarrassment Fear Too long to wait for appointment Percentage of Respondents Frequencies for \"Why weren't you able to get counseling?\" for McLean County 178 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Table 8.6.4 Significant Correlations for Reasons Why Individuals Were Not Able to Obtain Counseling in the Past Year Note several significant relationships between demographic variables and the reasons why individuals were not able to obtain counseling in the past ye ar: No Insurance tends to be rated higher by younger individuals, individuals with lower income, less education, and those individuals who are homeless. Can't afford copay/deductible tends to be rated higher by individuals of Black ethnicity. Too long to wait for an appointment ends to be rated higher by homeless individuals. 179 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 8.7 Access to Information Respondents were asked, \"Where do you get most of your medical information.\" The vast majority of respondents obtained information from their doctor. While the Internet was the second most common choice, it was significantly lower than information from doctors. Note that for individuals living in poverty, friends/family were more important than the Internet. There were no statistically significant relationships between access to information and demographic factors. Table 8.7.1 Frequencies for \"Where do you get most of your medical information?\" for McLean County and Individuals Living in Poverty 58 14 24 4 56 23 15 6 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Doctor Friends/family Internet Pharmacy Percentage of Respondents Frequencies for \"Where do you get most of your medical information?\" for McLean County and Individuals Living in Poverty McLean County Poverty 180 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 8.8 Personal physician Respondents were asked if they had a personal physician. For McLean County, 88% of respondents indicated that they had a personal physician. Logit regression analyses reveal that people with higher incomes, women , White ethnicity, and older people positively impacted whether someone had a personal physician, and homelessness had a negative impact on whether someone had a personal physician. Table 8.8.1 Frequencies for \"Do you have a personal physician?\" for McLean County and Individuals Living in Poverty 27 45 73 55 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 McLean County Poverty Percentage of Respondents Frequencies for \"Do you have a personal physician?\" for McLean County and Individuals Living in Poverty No Yes 181 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Numerous significant relationships exist between access to a personal physician and demographic variables. Specifically, a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or she did not have a personal physician if they were homeless, of Black ethnicity, or of Latino/a ethnicity, and was more likely to answer that he or she did have a personal physician if he or she was a woman, older, more educated, of White ethnicity, and earned more income. Table 8.8.2 Significant Correlations among Access to a Personal Physician and Demographic Variables 182 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 8.9 Type of Insurance Respondents were asked to identify the type of insurance that they had. In McLean County, the most prevalent type of insurance is private or commercial, however, those living in poverty are disproportionately more reliant on Medicaid or have no insurance. Table 8.9.1 Frequencies for Insurance Coverage for McLean County and Individuals Living in Poverty 23 21 13 23 43 11 21 45 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 McLean County Poverty Percentage of Respondents Frequencies for Insurance Coverage for McLean County and Individuals Living in Poverty Medicare Medicaid Private/commercial None 183 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Access to Health Care: Strategic Implications Approximately 50% of people living in deep poverty seek medical services at a clinic or doctor's office. For this segment of the population, while 24% seek medical services from an emergency department, approximately 16% will not seek any medical services at all or \"other\" non-traditional sources of care. Those most likely to not seek any medical services when sick include males, younger individuals, and individuals with lower incomes. 44% of the population living in deep poverty indicated there was a time in the last year when they were not able to get medical care when needed. According to regression results, this was more likely among individuals who were younger, less educated, possessed lower income, were of non-White ethnicity, and were homeless. The leading causes were lack of insurance and inability to afford a copayment or deductible. Similar results were found for access to prescription medication. Regression results indicated that homeless individu als, younger individuals, individuals with lower incomes and less education, and individuals of Black ethnicity were less likely to have access to necessary prescription medication. Again the leading causes of the inability to have access to prescription medications were lack of insurance and inability to afford copayment or deductibles. While significant research exists linking dental care to numerous diseases, includin g heart disease, 51% of McLean County residents had a checkup in the last year. Specif ically, individuals who were male, younger, were of non-White ethnicity, possessed less education, possessed less income, and were homeless were less likely to visit a dentist. Moreover, note that almost half of people living in poverty (44%) indicated that they needed dental care in the last year, but were not able to get it. Lack of dental insurance and inability to afford copayments were the leading causes. Approximately 25% of people living in deep poverty indicated they were not able to get counseling when they needed it over the last 12 months. Leading indicators are younger individuals, individuals with less education and lower income, and homelessness. While affordability and insurance were the leading reasons, embarrassment were also significant barriers to mental health services. Across categories, residents of McLean County get most of their medical information from doctors and the next most prevalent is the Internet. The most prevalent type of insurance is private or commercial, however, thos e living in poverty are disproportionately more reliant on Medicaid. Also for those living in poverty, 45% do not have any type of insurance at all. 184 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment CHAPTER 9. H EALTHY BEHAVIORS In this chapter, healthy behaviors of the community are presented. Specifically, frequency of physical exercise, healthy eating habits and smoking are examined. Additionally, overall self -perceptions of health are presented. 9.1 Physical Exercise Respondents were asked how frequently they engage in physical exercise. The majority of the population across all categories does not engage in sufficient exercise. Note that these findings are more consistent with state averages when compared to data reporte d by the Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data. Numerous significant relationships exist between physical exercise and demographic variables. Specifically, a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or she exercised regularly if they were possessed higher income and were more educated. Table 9.1.1 Frequencies for \"In the last week, how many times did you exercise?\" for McLean County and Individuals Living in Poverty Table 9.1.2 Significant Correlations among \"In the last week, how many times did you exercise?\" and Demographic Variables Education + Income + 36 45 29 27 19 15 16 13 0 10 20 30 40 50 McLean County Poverty Percentage of Respondents Frequencies for \"In the last week, how many times did you exercise?\" for McLean County and Individuals Living in Poverty None 1-\u00ad2 times 3-\u00ad5 times More than 5 times 185 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 9.2 Healthy Eating For healthy eating habits, about 34% of the population consumes at least three servings of fruits/vegetables in a day. Moreover, only about 7% of the population consumes the minimal recommended daily amount of vegetables. These findings are inconsistent with the Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, as the BRFSS data suggests approximately 14% of McLea n County residents consume 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Additional research by the CDC states that for a typical person consuming 2,200 calories per day, they should have 7 servings of vegetables. Table 9.2.1 Frequencies for \"On a typical day, how many servings of fruits and/or vegetables do you eat?\" for McLean County and Individuals Living in Poverty 6 8 60 68 27 18 7 6 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 McLean County Poverty Frequencies for \"On a typical day, how many servings of fruits and/or vegetables do you eat?\" for McLean County and Individuals Living in Poverty None 1-\u00ad2 servings 3-\u00ad5 servings More than 5 servings 186 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Table 9.2.2 Significant Correlations among Number of Servings of Fruits and Vegetables Consumed Daily and Demographic Variables Gender + Age + Education + Income + Homeless - Numerous significant relationships exist between consumption of fruits and vegetables and demographic variables. Specifically, a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or she consumed more fruits and vegetables each day if they were had earned a higher income , had attained higher levels of education , were female, and were older. Homeless individuals were less likely to consume more fruits and vegetables. 9.3 Smoking Primary data suggests that individuals living in poverty are significantly more likely to smoke. Note that when comparing these data to the Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, the CHNA survey assesses the frequency of smoking compared to whether a respondent smoked or did not smoke. Table 9.3.1 Frequencies for \"On a typical day, how many cigarettes do you smoke?\" for McLean County and Individuals Living in Poverty 72 46 6 12 7 13 6 12 9 17 0 20 40 60 80 McLean County Poverty Frequencies for \"On a typical day, how many cigarettes do you smoke?\" for McLean County and Individuals Living in Poverty None 1-\u00ad4 5-\u00ad8 9-\u00ad12 More than 12 187 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Table 9.3.2 Significant Correlations among Number of Cigarettes Smoked Daily, and Demographic Variables Gender - Age - Race (White) - Education - Income - Homeless + Numerous significant relationships exist between cigarette smoking and demographic variables. Specifically, a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or she smoked more cigarettes each day if they were male, younger, were homeless, were less educated, and earned less income. Individuals of White ethnicity were less likely to smoke. 188 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 9.4 Overall Health In terms of self -perceptions of physical and mental health, 89% of the population indicated that they were in average or good physical health. Similar results were found for residents' self -perceptions of mental health. Table 9.4.1 Frequencies for \"Overall, my physical health is __\" for McLean County and Individuals Living in Poverty Numerous significant relationships exist between overall physical health and demographic variables. Specifically, a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or she possessed better physical health if they were of earned a higher income and had attained higher levels of education. Conversely, a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or she possessed poorer physical health if they were homeless or identified with Latino/a ethnicity. Table 9.4.2 Significant Correlations among Overall Physical Health and Demographic Variables, Latino/a - Education + Income + Homeless - 11 19 38 49 51 32 0 20 40 60 McLean County Poverty Frequencies for \"Overall, my physical health is __\" for McLean County and Individuals Living in Poverty Poor Average Good 189 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Table 9.4.3 Frequencies for \"Overall, my mental health is __\" for McLean County and Individuals Living in Poverty Numerous significant relationships exist between overall mental health and demographic variables. Specifically, a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or she possessed better mental health if they were older, earned a higher income, and had attained higher levels of education. Conversely, a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or she possessed poorer mental health if they were homeless. Table 9.4.4 Significant Correlations among Overall Mental Health and Demographic Variables Age + Education + Income + Homeless - 7 15 25 33 68 52 0 20 40 60 80 McLean County Poverty Frequencies for \"Overall, my mental health is __\" for McLean County and Individuals Living in Poverty Poor Average Good 190 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Healthy Behaviors: Strategic Implications For healthy behaviors, McLean County residents who possessed higher income, or were more educated are more likely to engage in physical exercise, although 37% of the population engages in exercise at least 3 times a week. Similarly for hea lthy eating habits, about 34% of the population consumes at least three servings of fruits/vegetables in a day. Those that are more likely to have healthy eating habits include females, older individuals, people with higher education and more income, and individuals who are not homeless. Given the documented research showing the benefits of physical exercise and healthy eating, this is a concern for the community, as most primary and secondary diagnoses in the McLean County community can be mitigated, to some extent, by healthy lifestyle. Data suggests smoking is a concern in McLean County, with individuals who were male, younger, were homeless, were less educated, and earning less income as being more likely to smoke. In terms of self -perceptions of physical and mental health, 89% of the population indicated that they were in average or good physical health. Similar results were fou nd for residents' self -perceptions of mental health. 191 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment PHASE III - PRIORITIZATION OF HEALTH -RELATED ISSUES The identification and prioritization of the most important health -related issues in McLean County are identified in Phase III. To accomplish this, a summary of Phase I and Phase II were performed to provide a foundation for the prioritization process. After summarizing all of the issues in the Community Health Needs Assessment, a comprehensive asses sment of existing community resources was performed to identify the efficacy to which health -related issues were being addressed. Finally a collaborative team of leaders in the healthcare community used an importance/urgency methodology to identify the mos t critical issues in the area. Results are included in Chapter 10. CHAPTER 10. P RIORITIZATION OF HEALTH -RELATED ISSUES In this chapter, we identify the most critical health -related needs in the community. To accomplish this, first we identified the most important areas of concern. Next we completed a comprehensive inventory of community resources, and finally we identified the most important health concerns in the community. Specific criteria used to identify these issues included: (1) magnitude to the community; (2) strategic importance to the community; (3) existing community resources; (4) potential for impact; and (5) trends and future forecasts. 10.1 Summary of Community Health Issues Based on findings from the previous analyses, a chapter -by-chapter summary of key takeaways was necessary to provide a foundation to identify the most important health -related issues in the community. Considerations for identifying key takeaways included prevalence of the issues, importance to the community, imp act, trends and projected growth. Demographics (Chapter 1) - Three factors were identified as the most important areas of concern from the demographic analyses: increasing elderly population, mental health rates and poverty. Accessibility (Chapter 2) - Residents in McLean County are getting fewer routine checkups for both medical and dental visits. There was also a significant decrease in the frequency of women getting mammograms, although McLean County is still better tha n the State of Illinois averages . Symptoms and Predictors (Chapter 3) - Based on prevalence and growth rates, factors were identified as having significant impact on the community. These include, obesity, poor nutrition and risky behaviors, including drug and alcohol abuse and smoking. Diseases/Morbidity (Chapter 4) - By evaluating magnitude of morbidities and growth rates of morbidities, several specific issues were identified. These included stroke, asthma, COPD, diabetes (specifically Type II diabetes) and cardiovascular disease. 192 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Mortality (Chapter 5) - The two leading causes of mortality were heart disease and cancer. While there were other categories for mortality, heart disease and cancer were significantly more prevalent than all other categories. Community Misperceptions (Chapter 7) - Based on results from the survey, respondents to the survey incorrectly perceived \"heart disease\" \" lung disease\" and \"stroke\" as being relatively unimportant health concerns in the community. Access to Health Services (Chapter 8) - Results from survey respondents defined as living in deep poverty indicated that access to healthcare surveys is limited. This includes medical, prescription, dental and mental healthcare. Health-Related Behaviors (Chapter 9) - Results from survey respondents defined as living in deep poverty indicated that there are limited efforts at proactively managing one's own health. This includes limited exercise, poor eating habits and increased incidence of smoking In order to provide parsimony in the prioritization of key com munity health-related issues, the findings were aggregated into 12 key categories, based on similarities and duplication. The 12 areas were: o Obesity o Risky Behavior-Substance Abuse o Mental Health o Healthy Behavior/Nutrition o Access to Health Services o Respiratory Issues o Heart Disease o Cancer o Diabetes o Community Health Misperceptions o Dental o Women's Health 10.2 Community Resources After summarizing issues in the Community Health Needs Assessment, a comprehensive analysis of existing community resources was performed to identify the efficacy to which these 12 health-related issues were being addressed. There are numerous forms of resources in the community. They are categorized as recreational facilities, county health departments, community agencies and area hospitals/clinics. 193 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment 10.2.1 Recreational Facilities (3) McLean County Parks and Recreation Obesity, Healthy Behaviors, Heart Disease The McLean County Parks and Recreation Department provides opportunities for leisure activities in a variety of ways by the individual, either through their own initiative or through organized programs and educational sessions.

Table 10.2 illustrates the relationships between the community resources and the 12 summary areas identified in section 10.1. Assessment of these relationships was performed to identify potential gaps in coverage as the collaborative team prioritized health -related issues in the community. 199 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Table 10.2 Relationship between Community Resources and Community Needs 10.3 Prioritization of Community Health-Related Issues In order to prioritize the previously identified dimensions, the collaborative team considered health needs based on: (1) short-term urgency - issues that need immediate attention; and (2) long-term strategic importance - issues that will have the most significant impact on the future health of the community. Additional considerations included the magnitude of the issues (e.g., what percentage of the population was impacted by the issue), growth rate or projected trend of the issue, magnitude to the community, existing community resources, and the potential to make a significant impact to the community. Using these criteria, the collaborative team prioritized the previously identified health issues. Results can be seen in Figure 10.3. 200 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Figure 10.3 Importance/Urgency Matrix for Community Health Needs In conclusion, the collaborative identified the six most critical health-related issues in McLean County as: MENTAL HEALTH Approximately 23% of residents in McLean County reported they had experienced 1-7 days with poor mental health per month between 2007 and 2009. Approximately 11% of residents in McLea n County reported they had experienced 8 -30 days with poor mental health per month between 2007 and 2009. For both segments of residents (those experiencing 1-7 days and 8-30 days with poor mental health per month), each was below the state average for the same time frame.

Women's!Health ! 201 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment OBESITY Research strongly suggests that obesity is a significant problem facing youth and adults nationally, in Illinois, and within the McLean County region. In terms of obesity, the McLean County area as a whole is higher than the state average and growing rapi dly. There was a 13% increase in the growth of McLean County residents reporting they were overweight between 2006 (35.0%) and 2009 (39.5%). Considering that Illinois has the 6th highest obesity rate in the U.S., this is an important issue. H EALTHY BEHA VIORS Only 17% of the McLean County population engages in exercise 5 or more times per week. Note that residents with higher education and higher income are more likely to engage in exercise. With regard to healthy eating, only 7% of the population consu mes the minimum recommended servings of fruits/vegetables in a day. Those that are more likely to have healthy eating habits include women, older people, people with higher education and more income. Homeless people are less likely to exhibit healthy eatin g habits. Finally, smoking is on the decline, however, less educated people, men, younger people, non -White residents, those with lower income and homeless people are still more likely to smoke. ACCESS TO HEALTH SERVICES Results from survey respondents living in poverty indicated that access to healthcare is limited. This includes medical, dental and mental healthcare . Poverty is a key factor, as 24% of people living in poverty in McLean County consider the Emergency Department their primary source of health care. Furthermore, 44% of people in poverty were unable to obtain medical care when they needed it in the past year. Results also suggest a strong correlation between ethnicity and one's ability to obtain medical care, as survey data suggest indiv iduals who identify as Black are more likely to use the emergency department , as well as young men, low education and homelessness. With regard to prescription drugs, 46% of individuals living in poverty in McLean County were unable to fill a prescription in the past year because they lacked health care coverage. With regard to dental care, 44 % of individuals living in poverty in McLean County needed dental care and were unable to obtain it last year and 25% of individuals living in poverty in McLean County needed counseling and were unable to obtain it in the last year. \"Affordability\" was cited as the leading impediment to various types of health care. DENTAL While significant research exists linking dental care to numerous diseases, including heart disease, only 51% of the aggregate McLean County population had a checkup in the last year. Specifically, men, younger respondents, non-White ethnicity, less educated people, lower household income and the homeless were less likely to visit a dentist. 202 St. Joseph Medical Center Community Health-Needs Assessment Note that while other factors, such as community misperceptions, heart disease, women's health, respiratory issues and cancer are all important attributes, in terms of importance and urgency, the collaborative team rated the other six categories as more important.
