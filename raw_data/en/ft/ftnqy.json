That's because of combination skin. Combination skin requires extra care due to its dual nature. Fixing on a skincare routine that perfectly suits combination skin can be tricky. Thankfully the ancient science of Ayurveda recommends the use of herbal skincare that calms your [Doshas](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/ayurvedic-doshas) to bring about a holistic balance in your skin's nature. Scroll down to know some of the best natural ingredients that hydrate, control excess sebum production and rejuvenate your combination skin. Highlights: What Is Combination Skin? Your face has the most number of sebaceous glands compared to the rest of your body. Sebum produced by them moisturizes your skin and keeps it supple. In combination skin type, there is a larger concentration of sebaceous glands in your T Zone which comprises the forehead, nose, upper cheeks and the chin. Owing to this, the T-zone experiences an oily texture while the rest of the face remains normal or dry. According to Ayurveda, each individual has a [unique Prakriti](https://vedix.com/pages/vpq-skin) or body constitution that is determined by the dominance of certain Doshas (bodily humours) in their body. People who have a Vata -Kapha Prakriti are more likely to have combination skin. Here the dominance of Kapha Dosha leads to the overproduction of sebum and the effect of Vata keeps certain parts of your skin dry. An aggravation of these Doshas may lead to the formation of acne in the oily zones or dry, flaky skin in the areas surrounding the T-zone. Due to its unique nature, combination skin can be easily affected by external factors like weather changes. Dry weather can lead to [dryness in the lower cheeks and around the eyes](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/how-to-treat-dry-skin-around-eyes) whereas a rise in heat and humidity can stimulate overproduction of sebum in the oily zones. What Does Combination Skin Look Like? Considered to be one of the most common skin types, combination skin refers to skin that has dry outer and oily inner facial areas. While the T-zone becomes greasy by midday or within a few hours of washing your face, the rest of the face stays dry or normal. People with combination skin are likely to experience both dry and oily skin issues such as acne, enlarged pores along with dry skin, fine lines, uneven skin tone, dermatitis, flaking and [peeling skin](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/skin-peeling-on-face). \"It is commonly observed that the areas of skin that transition between oily, normal, and dry zones tend to suffer more,\" says Dr. Zeel Gandhi, Chief Ayurvedic Doctor at Vedix. How To Identify Combination Skin Type? The easiest way to identify if you have combination skin is through a blotting paper test. - Wait a few hours after washing your face. - Take a blotting paper and pat it on your cheeks and check for oil. - If the paper shows none to little oiliness, your cheeks are dry or normal. - Now dab it on your nose, its immediate surrounding area, forehead and chin. - If you find your blotting paper more greasy than before, there is a chance you have combination skin. Signs Of Combination Skin 1. Oiliness due to overproduction of sebum by sebaceous glands located in the T-zone or the Y-zone (upper cheeks, nose and chin). 2. Normal or dry facial areas surrounding the T-zone. 3. Chances of acne (especially whiteheads and blackheads) in the oily T-zone. 4. Enlarged pores in the T-zone. 5. Chances of dry skin issues in the outer cheeks and jawline. 6. Chances of [uneven skin tone](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/how-to-get-rid-of-uneven-skin-tone). 7. Skin sensitivity. What Causes Combination Skin? Whether combination skin is a skin type or merely the result of external and internal factors, still remains a debatable topic in the dermatological field. Certain dermatologists are of the opinion that fluctuations in skin type leading to partly oily and partly normal/dry areas on the face can be controlled and normalised with the right skincare and dietary observations. Below listed are the common trigger factors that can cause combination skin. 1. Genes According to many skin specialists, combination skin is a skin type that one may be born with. If your parents had it, you're likely to get it too. While genetic influence is out of your hand, you can follow the right skin care measures to ensure your combination skin stays healthy. 2. Weather Changes Extremes of weather can lead to dryness or overproduction of oil in combination skin. Cold, dry weather can easily dry out the areas of your face that have a lesser number of sebaceous glands. This may lead to a combination of dry and normal zones on the face. On the other hand, hot, humid climates can stimulate areas that contain more oil glands making the T or Y-zones of your face appear more oily. 3. Wrong Skincare Products The false belief that face washes and cleansers that produce a lot of foam clean better may end up dehydrating your skin. Harsh chemicals are used in many skincare products to give them a rich creamy texture and foaming nature. Such ingredients damage the skin barrier and dry out your skin with regular use. Dry skin stimulates your sebaceous glands to produce more sebum to [keep your skin hydrated](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/how-to-hydrate-skin). As a result, your skin appears greasy in the T-zone. 4. Dietary Choices According to Ayurveda, what you eat directly affects the health of your skin. Inclusion of unhealthy foods that are high on oil and sugar can affect the Dosha balance in your body. An aggravation of Vata and Kapha can lead to fluctuations in your skin's nature. 5. Hormonal Changes Changes in your estrogen and testosterone levels, especially during menstruation and pregnancy, can cause various skin conditions like dryness, acne and [excess secretion of sebum](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/what-is-sebum-how-to-balance-it) that may cause combination skin. Presence of high levels of cortisol or the stress hormone can also stimulate your oil glands. Different Types Of Combination Skin 1. Normal Combination Skin This refers to skin that has an oily T-zone with the cheeks and a jawline that is neither oily nor too dry. Normal combination skin is easier to manage as one majorly needs to focus on the oily areas that may be prone to acne. 2. Dry Combination Skin When you have an oily T-zone with dry cheeks it is called a dry combination skin. Dry combination skin needs extra care as it is prone to both dry and [oily skin problems](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/how-to-get-rid-of-oily-skin). A good Dosha-balancing herbal skincare can keep such skin issues at bay. How To Take Care Of Combination Skin? A. Skin Care Routine 1. Water Based Cleanser For Combination Skin Nowadays cleansers that are specifically formulated for combination skin are available in the market. Opt for one which is water-based and free of sulfates, artificial fragrances and colours. A mild cleanser will help remove excess sebum, dirt and unclog pores in your T-zone without drying out the outer facial areas. 2. Exfoliator For Combination Skin Combination skin needs to be mildly exfoliated 2 to 3 times a week to keep build-ups and dry skin away. Use a gentle scrub made from natural ingredients (oats, walnuts, orange peel) to keep both your oily and dry areas healthy and rejuvenated. 3. Toner A toner helps your combination skin stay balanced. Use one that is alcohol free to avoid drying out of your skin. Toners that contain rose, green tea or tea tree extracts are a good choice for combination skin. 4. Serum Active ingredients in serums go deep into your skin and hydrate from within. This keeps your skin moisturized without blocking your pores. Use a serum that has green/black tea, Vitamin C or Hyaluronic acid extracts. 5. Moisturizer Apply your moisturizer 5 minutes after applying your serum. The moisturiser repairs your skin barrier and acts like a protective layer that prevents moisture loss from the surface of your skin. Non-comedogenic, water or gel based are considered the best moisturizers for combination skin. 6. Sunscreen Sunscreen is an absolute must for combination skin every time you step out. Use a waterproof one that is non- acnegenic. Sunscreen not only prevents damage to your dry areas but also keeps your oil glands from getting triggered due to UV ray exposure. B.
