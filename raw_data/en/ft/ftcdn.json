This is a gentle energy based therapy in which practitioners consciously use their hands in a heart-centered and intentional way to support and facilitate physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health and healing. Overall health and quality of life are affected by our energy systems. By clearing, balancing and energizing these systems we can establish the natural flow of energy, allowing for harmony and balance in the mind, body and spirit. The healing traditions of many cultures, as well as Dr. Jean Watson's Theory of Human Caring and Science of Caring, emphasize the importance of human touch, compassion, healing through intention, and the subtle energy systems that flow through and around the human body. Many of these traditions stress that balancing these energy fields can assist the body, mind, and spirit in moving towards and maintaining peace and wellness. In addition to private practice, this non-invasive care is provided in many hospital and research settings to support individuals through the health care continuum. This is a gentle and non-invasive holistic way of healing. Research shows that Healing Touch Energy Healing Therapy facilitates the relaxation response in the body and improves quality of life.

During a Healing Touch session, we begin with a discussion of what brought you in, your health history, and current physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing. We will also chat about short and long term goals, and setting an intention for the current session. The client will then lie on a massage table fully clothed, and I will assess their body energetically using my hands above the body and a pendulum (diagnostic tool). With permission of the client, we can also integrate essential oils. We will begin with guided breathing and meditation to relax the mind and physical body. Energy therapy techniques are then intuitively chosen by Casey as she attunes to you and your energy, allowing that to be her guide. The energy work is given through very light touch by hands on or just above the body working with the natural energy systems that run in and around the body. As you rest and relax, Casey follows your energy to resolve imbalance bringing harmony to your mind, body and spirit. During the session, you may sense the flow of moving energy which can be felt as tingling, temperature changes, and sensations in the body. It is not uncommon for clients to fall asleep, experience deep relaxation or a peaceful rest, feelings of being supported and comforted, having imagery or an emotional release. In addition, clients may experience peace and calmness, an overall sense of wellbeing, clarity, relief from symptoms and more connected to themselves physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. An emotional release may also occur through tears, crying or laughing. Often times physical pain and emotions such as depression, stress, anxiety, anger, guilt and fear are released. Once released, the void where those emotions were held may be filled with healing, light, truth, love, forgiveness, clarity and joy. The worry is replaced by peace. Your body's intuitive wisdom will process and benefit what it knows is for your highest good. Some clients notice an immediate shift or relief of symptoms, while for others it may happen gradually over a few days as the energy continues to process. Depending on the depth of the imbalance three to four sessions may be needed to notice and feel a change. How many sessions will I need? Depending on the nature of the issues and what the client intends to achieve will determine our healing plan. Casey usually suggests 3-5 sessions to start as it may take a few sessions for there to be any noticeable benefit (though I have seen shifts in just one or two sessions!). Some individuals feel they need regular sessions for a period of time when they are going through a challenging or difficult time. While others include energy healing into their regular self-care routine for continuous support and to maintain a sense of wellbeing. Clients at times prefer just one or two session \"tune-ups\" as needed to support balance, alignment and energy flow. Through discussion we can evaluate what your goals are and create a plan that works best for you and your needs at the first session. The benefits of regular energy healing sessions are cumulative and can be supportive in making life more manageable. Sometimes it can take a few sessions for there to be a noticeable benefit. "}
