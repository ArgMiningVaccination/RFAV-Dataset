Thank you Dr. for making sure you cover all bases. I am feeling so much better now after her protocol - my energy is back, my autoimmune issues are suppressed and I feel like I am truly healing. It has been 6 months and I feel much better. I will continue to work with Dr. Korza to continue on my healing journey. Healing will take time!!! - 9/17/2021 Just called and spoke to a Gabrielle; she did not even let me finish my question and rudely cut me off. Not a good look as the first point of contact for potential new patients. Beware. - 7/16/2014First to Review My doc, Dr. Vera Singleton has diagnosed me with something that my normal doctors did not catch! I was truly surprised, because I am a pretty healthy individual. She took a detailed health history on me and was able to pinpoint exactly my health issues. She has prescribed me natural medicine and herbs to help correct the issues she found. My previous MD diagnosed me with high blood pressure, which is odd, because I am fairly young. This MD also recommended HBP meds for me. Dr. Singleton reassured me that I did NOT have HBP and recommend that I DO NOT use HBP medication since the side effects are horrendous! Needless to say, I am very glad that I've found a ND who can help monitor my health. Dr. Singleton runs appropriate labs to track the progress of my treatment and is always open to answering any questions. - 6/16/2019 Dr. Tara Levy has been my Naturopathic Doctor since 2006. She is knowledgeable and her staff members are efficient, polite and caring. - 2/20/2018 What a joke this place is. After giving birth to my daughter I hired a lactation consultant who recommended Dr. Tara Levy as a naturopath. When I called them I wasn't even able to speak to the doctor to discuss with her my issues that I was hoping she could treat. Instead I got the extremely rude and uncaring desk assistant who basically told me to just see my ob or midwife who helped me with the birth. I could hear her speaking to the doctor while she was talking to me, even though she was stating that she was busy with other clients. What kind of business of natural health just refers you back to your ob? She said they needed a diagnosis first. The whole purpose of a naturopathic doctor is to treat the root cause of your problems, not to send you back to an ob without even seeing you or understanding your issues. I have seen and spoken to other naturopathic doctors in the bay area and have never experienced an office like this. I actually see another naturopath, but she was out of town and I wanted to see if they could help with my current issue so I didn't have to wait and because she was recommended. But I wouldn't waste your time with these people. - 6/1/2017 If I could give this place zero stars I would!! Front desk staff are rude and snappy. I strongly advise not using or trusting the breast thermography. I went to see Dr. Levy after the birth of my daughter and expressed to her my concern over my changing breast tissue. She suggested the breast thermography, which I did. I had to call her multiple times just to get my results which she replied were absolutely normal. After going to see another ND, to get a second opinion, I found out that I had stage 2 breast cancer. Please do not use Dr. Levy as your ND if you value your life. After she had her 2nd son, she seemed to loose interest and focus and seemed annoyed when I would bring my daughter for an appointment and I was paying out of placket and her services aren't cheap. more](/adredir?ad_business_id=dQ-xCW1iNfriB14Uvs3a6g&campaign_id=3MbC9UfSTEorznVPKzEq5A&click_origin=read_more&placement=below_biz_review&placement_slot=1&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fcandise-yang-acupuncture-oakland%3Fhrid%3DVz1GWy2NZh4X-4ubVaxZKw&request_id=ea05050644d30e6a&signature=d0438c27f25cca38bfcfa121d1a9c1c0b4b8ae3f649fcd0c55a9a799c74cf494&slot=1) in Naturopathic/holistic, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Acupuncture "}
