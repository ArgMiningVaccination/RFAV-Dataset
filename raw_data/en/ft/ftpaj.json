COLUMNS NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2018 275INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS COLUMN Saving the Lost Generation of Syria Yassar Kanawati, MD The war in Syria has reached intoler - able levels of human suffering and despair . Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed, hundreds of thousands have been trapped in besieged areas, and tens of thousands have been tortured . UNICEF estimates that some 8 .4 million Syrian children, more than 80% of the Syrian child population, have now been affected by the conflict in Syria . The numbers of wounded survivors, many with amputations, severe burns, or paralysis, cannot yet be assessed; at least 13 million Syrians have been force - fully displaced within Syria and into its neighboring countries . Gross violations of international law, such as chemical attacks on civilians, targeting of health - care facilities and healthcare personnel, widespread breach of medical neutrality, and blocking access of whole com - munities to food, water, medicine, and healthcare have been used as methods of war . The global health community cannot stand by . It is our responsibility to save the lost generation in Syria, the survivors of multiple and severe traumas and losses . This article sheds light on best practices for trauma recovery, including psychologi - cal treatments to Syrian refugees carried on by Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) . Many studies have examined the effects of exposure to war, conflict, and ter - rorism on young children . They have all revealed a wide array of conse - quences including post-traumatic stress symptoms, psychosomatic symptoms, depression, anxiety, disturbed play, and behavioral, emotional and sleep Approximately one percent of the world's population is currently uprooted, with 22 .5 million refugees seeking safety in another country and 65 .6 million people forcibly displaced worldwide . 1 A refugee is a person who lives outside his/her country of nationality and unable to return due to persecution of race, religion, national - ity, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion . Over half of the world's displaced population are children . The stresses to which most refugees are exposed can be thought of in different stages of their lives - (1) from their home country of origin, then (2) during the migration flight to safety, and (3) to the resettlement period in a host country . In their home countries, many youth have been forced to flee their homes due to exposure to war or armed conflict, and have therefore witnessed violence, torture, traumatic loss of loved ones, and separation from friends and school . Parental distress is common, along with general feelings of insecurity . Migration can also pose dangers with separation from family, unstable sources of food or housing, and potential for trafficking or sexual violence . The post-migration phase of resettlement can often be referred as a period of \"secondary trauma,\" as youth struggle to adapt to a new culture, language, peer group, as well as accul - turative stress and generational stress with their parents or caregivers . With globalization and the recent wars in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as the conflicts in central America's north - ern triangle (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras), we have more refugees and unaccompanied minors landing in our backyards . The role of the child and adolescent psychiatrist becomes more prominent, as many will be asked to help the increasing number of war-affected youth locally and globally . This article from the International Relations Committee will focus on the plight of refugees, their mental health needs and strengths, and how child and adolescent psychiatrists can play a role locally and abroad . Suzan Song, MD, MPH, PhD , International Relations Column Coordinator; Director, Division of Child/Adolescent & Family Psychiatry; Associate Professor, George Washington University Medical Center continued on page 277 COLUMNS276 AACAP NEWSPYSCHOTHERAPY COLUMN Beverly Stoute, MD: Winner of Norbert and Charlotte Rieger Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Award Cecil R. Webster, Jr., MD AACAP's Psychotherapy Committee is pleased to announce Beverly Stoute, MD, as the recipient of AACAP's 2018 Norbert and Charlotte Rieger Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Award for her paper, \"Racial Socialization and Thwarted Mentalization: Reflections of a Psychoanalyst from the Lived Experience of James Baldwin's America .\" Weaving together psychoanalytic perspectives on development and racial identity, early reflections of James Baldwin on race in America, and per - sonal narratives of the lived racialized experiences of her family, Dr . Stoute provides a deeply compelling clinical paper about her daily psychodynamic treatment of a 13-year-old Black boy, Preston, on the inpatient psychiatry unit of her hospital . Many of us would recognize Preston with his enumerable early abandon - ments, disruptive behaviors at his school, and fraught interactions with the intensive inpatient hospital staff tasked with his care . Although this treatment was \"not a classical analysis,\" Dr . Stoute carefully outlines a psychoanalytically informed approach to understanding Preston's trauma, behavior, and evolv - ing identity as a young Black boy . In addition, she utilizes relevant social research about the poor ability of educa - tors and police to mentalize Black boys and the \"cool pose\" that Black boys adopt defensively .This treatment went beyond the typical confines of the psychotherapy office . As Unit chief at the time, she spurred the hospital staff to resolutely work toward naming and reworking their initial views of Preston as a \"dangerous and out of control Black youth to that of a needy, traumatized boy afraid to trust .\" This shares striking similarity to the letter titled \"My Dungeon Shook,\" by early 20th-century, African-American writer James Baldwin who wrote it to his nephew . In this work, Baldwin recog - nizes his nephew's budding sense of identity and need for familial love and contrasts with a nation loathe to recog - nize his humanity . Dr . Stoute sketches moving observations of her own place as a Black woman, mother, and healer in Preston's shifting transferences as he masters powerful, destructive, and rewarding feelings . Her writing provides a potent example of how clinicians must acknowledge the lived experience of race in ourselves and others in treatment . Otherwise, potentially intractable conflicts and their behavioral manifestations may remain . \"Where would he have been if he had not gotten a treatment that had grounded him as a human being?\" she cautions . Conversation about race in America is difficult, she explains, even as we are confronted with increasingly sharpened discussions about race in America . When discussing the place of race and its exploration in training and psycho - therapy, Dr . Stoute remarks that \"analysts have had a hard time talking about race in treatments with patients . . . [These] conversations are inherently anxious . Most people aren't trained to bring up race as a factor .\" Dr . Stoute muses that as people, psychiatrists are embed - ded in the culture in which they exist and, as such, are bound by the very racial attitudes that inhibit one's curi - osity about others . \"While the field is changing, we have a long way to go to educate people .\" When asked what was behind writing and submitting this paper, Dr . Stoute begins with offering her value of the lived experiences of children and of the psychoanalytic process . \"I want to show that at least in some small way, and with some work that I did, that analytic think - ing is relevant; that African-Americans can be looked at in that way; and that maybe if we're lucky and I present this paper, more African-Americans will want to be child analysts . If I can show you as a Black psychoanalyst that analysis is relevant to us too, then more of us would want to be in this field and then we will have a universal theory of the mind; then we will have a field that represents the universality of the human mind, not just a few . What it means to me is that people actually want to hear that now in 2018 . That's why I took a chance [with this award submission] .\" Dr . Stoute grew up in New York before attending Harvard College, where she graduated magna cum laude in Biology . She later moved to New Haven for medical school at Yale University, followed by a residency in general Beverly Stoute, MDCOLUMNS NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2018 277Saving the Lost Generation of Syria continued from page 275psychiatry and fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center .

She is an Adjunct Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Emory University School of Medicine and a training and super - vising analyst at the Emory University Psychoanalytic Institute .The Norbert and Charlotte Rieger Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Award was established in 2001 to recognize the best published or unpublished paper by an AACAP member that utilizes psycho - dynamic frameworks and principles to illustrate and elucidate the inner world of children and healing .

These mental health and physical risks following exposure to war and conflict are also seen among displaced populations and among refugees . War can have devastat - ing effects on parents, survival needs, and harm to fundamental systems that nurture and protect child development . The greatest effects on children occur when parents are killed, harmed, terri - fied, or unable to function, and when the children experience violent harm to themselves or loved ones, threats of such violence, or engage in harming others . I have found that the best practices for trauma recovery include: (1) having a deep understanding of the local culture and practices (religion, family structure), (2) rebuilding social networks (friends, school, neighbors, play, sport) that pro - mote support, healing, reconstruction, self-worth, and trust, (3) re-establishing a sense of normalcy, including daily routine of family, community, and life (school, meals, sport), and (4) continuing education and school, where schooling represents a state of normalcy, a chance to be with friends and enjoy their sup - port and encouragement, where they can develop new coping and survival knowledge that builds a child's person - ality, talents, and physical and mental abilities to their fullest potential . SAMS has established programs to provide treatment and care to the Syrian communities in Jordan, Lebanon, and inside Syria . Each program consists of social workers, psychotherapists, and psychiatrists . Services provided are: Social Support: To facilitate resilience, children need to be provided with a stable environment and a loving and nurturing community . SAMS outreach workers make visits to Syrian families to: (1) provide some families with food, especially in the besieged areas to pre - vent sexual exploitation of the children as price for their food, (2) assess the family members for PTSD/depression, (3) evaluate the need for any medical assistance and refer them to medical professionals in the community, (4) assist the children in pursuing education (we rent schools to provide the children with basic education needs), and (5) assist with vocational training for the widows . Our motto is \"Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day . Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime\" (Chinese Proverb) . Therapy/Treatment: (1) individual sup - portive and cognitive behavioral therapy, (2) family therapy (supportive, psycho - educational) (for the parents whose children with symptoms of depression, PTSD, behavioral troubles, bedwetting, and refusal to go to school), (3) group therapy (cognitive, behavioral, support - ive) (for mothers and teenagers survivors of multiple losses and traumas), (4) play/art therapy for young children, and (5) medications . It is extremely difficult to provide medications inside Syria due to the border's closure, especially in South Syria, close to Jordan .

Paul Weigle, MD You have probably heard many patients tell you about this year's smash hit video game, Fortnite . Fortnite is generally played in a 'Battle Royale' online multiplayer arena mode from the first person perspective . A hundred players fight to the death until only one player is left alive, echoing The Hunger Games . After parachuting onto a small island, players must scramble to find military weapons and mine for resources to build structures to defend themselves against their opponents, while the gaming area slowly shrinks, pushing players into closer proximity with their opponents . The game is rated T for teens, meaning its violent content may make it inappropriate for youth aged 12 and under . The game has been a stunning success, and boasts 45 million players, an incredible number far greater than the entire population of Canada . What makes it so popular? Fortnite does not introduce any revolutionary game concepts, but it blends together the most engaging elements of popular games such as Minecraft, Call of Duty, and Player Unknown Battlegrounds into a game that is uniquely accessible to new players . Fortnite is free to play on all modern gaming consoles, computers, tablets, and smartphones . It is easy to learn and to start playing, and quickly becomes habit-forming . The action is fast and furious, and the game allows players to have nearly limitless choices regarding how to play the game, inspiring creative strategies . Fortnite is an intensively competitive game played against other gamers, which encourages users to vie for rewards and status . The game can also be played cooperatively in groups of two or four, providing limited socialization . Communities form around play; child and adolescent enthusiasts often talk about it in school and coordinate to play with their friends online . Fortnite features elusive treasure chests with randomized contents, giving the game an element of gambling . Like many video-games, Fortnite is very challenging, but play - ers who give the game their full focus and devote a significant time to play are rewarded with greater success and com - munity status . The amount of dedication and luck required to win is consider - able, so when players do so, they feel intense gratification . For those children and teens who play Fortnite in moderation, it can be a fun and harmless pastime . However, for the many who play excessively, Fortnite can quickly become an unhealthy or even toxic habit . The same elements that make Fortnite engaging can also turn it into an obsession, particularly for school-aged players . Excessive play displaces vitally important everyday behaviors such as school-work, chores, socializing in person, family time, adequate sleep and physical activity, which often leads to significant problems in everyday life . Heavy gaming has also been linked to a junk food diet, a lack of exercise, and increased risk of obesity, as well as pain in the cervical or lumbar spine related to poor posture during play, or \"gamer slouch,\" and occasionally even repeti - tive stress injuries such as \"Nintendo thumb .\" Regularly, players will respond by limiting gameplay when it interferes with their daily functioning, or have such limits imposed by attentive parents, but many players are unaware of the problems their gaming causes, refuse to cut down, or may be unable to do so . These players are prone to develop an addictive habit consistent with Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) . IGD is a provisional diagnosis in the DSM 5 in which excessive play domi - nates the player's time, and players become preoccupied with gameplay, stop engaging in other hobbies, are unable to control their habit, lie to mini - mize how much they play, and become dysphoric when unable to play, often causing relationship problems . Those NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2018 279 COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLYmost susceptible to IGD are boys with ADHD or autism, and those whose par - ents do not supervise or limit their play . Youth with internet gaming disorder are at high risk to develop subsequent depression, social anxiety, and school failure . Gaming Disorder, an analogous condition, will be diagnosable in the ICD -11 when it is implemented later this year . Since Fortnite and games like it can have addictive qualities, child psychiatrists should advise parents to be proactive in monitoring their children's video-game play to ensure that kids have adequate time for other activities such as academ - ics, exercise, socializing, and sleep . This typically involves supervising the amount of time kids are playing video games and The same elements that make Fortnite engaging can also turn it into an obsession, particularly for school-aged players. Excessive play displaces vitally important everyday behaviors such as school-work, chores, socializing in person, family time, adequate sleep and physical activity, which often leads to significant problems in everyday life. limiting total combined screen time to a reasonable amount, depending on the age and characteristics of the child (e .g . two hours on a school day and more on a weekend day) . It may be helpful for parents to encourage other activities, and give kids reminders of when it is time to stop play . Parents should check to ensure that their kids maintain proper posture and take regular physical activ - ity breaks . Youth frequently engage in electronic media activities at night when their parents think they are sleeping, and in these cases it may be necessary for parents to prevent this by taking the game controllers into their own bedrooms or locking them up at night . Parents who feel unable to adequately or safely enforce limits on their children's gaming may turn to child psychiatrists for advice on how to do so . Several studies have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational inter - viewing therapies for treatment of substance abuse can be adapted to effectively treat IGD .It is worth repeating that Fortnite and other games do not have to be a divisive issue in the home, and can be a chance for parents and children to spend enjoy - able time together . Playing video-games with kids gives parents a better idea of what the games are all about and a chance to talk about proper online behavior as well as media choices and habits . It can be illuminating and enjoy - able for child psychiatrists to sample these games as well, as long as we do not get hooked into compulsive play ourselves! m Dr. Weigle is associate medical director at Natchaug Hospital of Hartford Healthcare and teaches at UConn School of Medicine and Quinnipiac Medical School.

Larry Nassar for the sexual abuse of young athletes at Michigan State University and the allegations of sexual abuse against team doctor Richard Strauss by over 100 student athletes at Ohio State University are just two examples from the media that put a spot - light on the widespread abuse of young people in sports . Inevitably, people are left wondering, \"Why didn't anyone speak up sooner?\" Much research points to the power of the culture of silence that perpetuates abuse in both the work - place and in the training area . Increased awareness can be effective in breaking the silence, by encouraging good people not to \"look the other way .\" In 2016, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) issued an extension to the 2007 consensus statement on harassment and abuse in sport, advo - cating that \"all athletes have a right to engage in 'safe sport', defined as an athletic environment that is respectful, equitable and free from all forms of non-accidental violence to athletes .\" 1 Yet, research within the last decade demon - strates the prevalence of sexual abuse in sports between 2-48% of all athletes .2 \"Non-accidental violence\" is defined as psychological abuse, physical abuse, and neglect . Although all athletes are at risk, it appears that \"elite, disabled, child and lesbian/gay/bisexual/transsexual (LGBT) athletes are at highest risk .\" 1 The statement also notes that cultures of \"secrecy\" and \"deference\" often facili - tate abuse . 1 The IOC identifies psychological abuse as \"the gateway to non-accidental violence,\" noting that abuse most often occurs within the context of a \"power differential\" and that \"it is impossible to conceive of any form of harassment or abuse that does not have psychological underpinnings .\" 1 Perpetrators of abuse can range from the team physician to coaches, teammates, and even parents . The \"bystander effect\" occurs when observers fail to recognize or stop the abuse, thereby leading to an acceptance of psychologically abusive coaching techniques and resulting in more severe sequelae for victims . 1,2 \"Intense selection rivalries among peer athletes,\" especially at the level of elite sport, can also foster a culture of silence . 1 Marks et al . point out that the unique nature of the coach-athlete relation - ship may increase the potential for sexual abuse . The \"grooming process\" of athletes involves \"building trust, gradually pushing back the boundar - ies of acceptable behavior and slowly violating more and more personal space through verbal familiarity, emotional blackmailing and physical touching .\" 2 In addition, psychologically abusive tactics such as \"belittling, humiliating, shout - ing, scapegoating, rejecting, isolating and threatening behaviours as well as being ignored, or denied attention and support\" contribute to power imbalance and discourage open discourse . 1 Several risk factors have been identified which can be categorized as pertain - ing to the athlete, coach, and sport . It is important to note that there is no evidence that the amount of clothing, touching, or type of sport are risk fac - tors for sexual abuse . 1,2 Being a younger woman, having low self-esteem, a poor and distant relationship with parents as well as a strong talent in the sport, and a dedication to the coach are athletic risk variables . Older male coaches with good reputations who are trusted by parents also have increased opportuni - ties for sexual abuse . Locations where isolation may occur such as trips away from home, being alone in the coach's room or car, and group events that involve alcohol can also contribute to increased risk . 2 Disclosure of the abuse is both the most important and most difficult part of the Beverly J. Bryant, MD, and Cesar Cardenas, Jr., MD \"Society's punishments are small compared to the wounds we inflict on our souls when we look the other way.\" -Dr. Martin Luther King \"As child psychiatrists, we can be instrumental in helping to initiate evidence-based training programs that can protect young people.\" NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2018 281 COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLY process and can be mitigated by fear . Parent et al . state that victims who face disbelief or a lack of support on the part of family and friends experience more negative general consequences than do victims who receive a positive response and support from significant people around them . 3 Research has shown long-term negative consequences of childhood sexual abuse resulting in both poorer mental and physical health . Victims who experience sexual abuse are increased risk for depression, self-harm, posttraumatic stress disorder, and even suicide . 1,4 Mountjoy et al . state that the impact of such experiences extends to the family, friends, colleagues, and peers in home, work, and leisure venues, persisting long after the athlete has left his or her sport role . 1 The IOC notes that \"cultural change can be effectively addressed via advocacy and campaigning\" with \"dissemination of evidence-based education and train - ing programmes\" directed at all levels of the organization including sports executives, coaches, agents, fitness personnel, families and peers, clinicians, and healthcare providers . 1 Bystander education programs have been found to be effective in changing attitudes and beliefs about sexual and partner violence on college campuses . 5 The IOC has instituted safeguards by initiating a clear structure for participants to report any incidents of harassment or abuse . An IOC welfare officer was pres - ent in the Olympic village at the games in Rio as well as in Lillehammer, who ensured that reported incidents were dealt with in a confidential procedure that was linked to local law enforcement agencies . 6 At the national level, the National Collegiate Athletic Association has the Sport Science Institute that works closely with the Committee on Competitive Safeguards and Media Aspects of Sports . On their website, they provide resources for sexual assault and interpersonal violence . 7 Through the United States Department of Justice, notalone.gov provides various resources to protect students from sexual assault at all grade levels including colleges and universities . The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a private, nonprofit organization, has its website, safeto - compete.org , with various resources for parents and advocates . 8 The responsibility falls on adults at every level from administrators, sports executives to families and clinicians . Bystanders can play a crucial role in changing the expected norms for training environments . As child psychiatrists, we can be instrumental in helping to initiate evidence-based training programs that can protect young people . We must sup - port the stakeholders in this process in never \"looking the other way .\" m References 1 . Mountjoy M, Brackenridge C, Arrington M, et al .

Holloway, MD Wash your hands before you eat . Brush your teeth twice a day . Wear sunscreen . We are used to hearing from healthcare organi - zations about ways to prevent physical illness, but what about preventing mental illness? We focus on treatment and early intervention in psychiatry, but our numbers are few and the need is high . Perhaps we could accomplish more by preventing mental illness . We know that childhood trauma can increase the risk of mental illness, perhaps even for more than one generation, 1 and that frequent moves in childhood increase the risk of psychosis and other psychopathology . 2 We know that teaching coping skills to all students and helping them practice those skills improves both school conflict and academic performance . What if we found ways to improve family stability and decrease both trauma and frequent moves in childhood? What if we could expand family services to focus more on prevention and health promotion? What if we joined with educators and other health organizations to advocate for changes that prevent mental illness and improve health and educational outcomes? When we review the literature, we can find evidence of many ways to prevent mental illness by changing the daily lives of children considered most at risk . 3 We should look at efforts AACAP members and communities have made so far and build on them . There are schools in the San Francisco Bay Area that have implemented twice daily quiet times in which students can either choose to remain silent or meditate for 15 minutes . They found that over a three-year period, suspensions and fighting decreased, and academic performance increased . 4 That is a remarkable return on invest - ment for something that costs so little to implement . We could easily advocate that local school districts replicate and assess this model on their own . But let's say there was a cost associated with this proposal . How do we suc - cessfully advocate for that investment? We must illustrate to the school district the dark and extremely expensive cost of mental illness on society, including decreased productivity and educational outcomes, increased incarceration, and morbidity and mortality . If we can prevent some mental illness, particularly in children, it creates a healthier and higher-functioning population, not \"just\" happier people . Fortunately, we do not need to advocate alone . Some investments that improve children's mental health could also benefit physical health and fitness, and academic performance . What if we could demonstrate that a certain diet would benefit all these areas? Could we give our kids better food that would help them grow to have healthier hearts, mus - cles, teeth, bones, and brains? If so, we would be foolish to miss that investment opportunity . We know that yoga can benefit mental and physical health . In fact, yoga can be used to practice thera - peutic techniques like diaphragmatic breathing, which is shown to reduce pain, anxiety, and help with focus . It is an intervention that could benefit all students and can be utilized in physical education classes or other classes . Let's start pilot programs, replicate existing programs, and study their outcomes . Let's join our colleagues and other agen - cies that are using Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) studies to improve life - time health and educational outcomes . Let's keep learning from our research, sharing our knowledge, and advocating for prevention of mental illness .As child and adolescent psychiatrists, we have vast knowledge of mental health, general health, and child development . Together, we can use our collective knowledge to create a healthier society . We must engage educators to show them the potential academic benefit of reducing mental illness . We must engage other medical societies to show how our efforts would also improve their patient outcomes . We have to show the caring and empathetic members of our society the best paths to move forward and show skeptics that healthier individuals lead to healthier and higher-functioning populations . This effort need not be divisive or partisan, as it will truly benefit everyone . Who's in? m References 1 . Schickedanz A, Halfon N, Sastry N, et al .

NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2018 283 COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLYHEALTHCARE ACCESS AND ECONOMICS COMMITTEE Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Roles in Integrated Healthcare Systems Mark Borer, MD, and Barry Sarvet, MD Enhancement in practice includes increasing access to child psy - chiatry for children and families in need . This important function of AACAP's \"Transformation in Practice Cluster\" of committees includes promot - ing efficient delivery of services by child and adolescent psychiatrists through collaborative and integrated care . The Healthcare Access and Economics Committee (HCAE) is committed not only to supporting our members in pro - moting access to (and being reimbursed for) traditional child mental health services but to enhancing our practices to serve with our fellow medical and mental health partners in integrated care systems and practices . To this end, HCAE works with insurers to promote payment for integrated care services and collaborates with other committees in our cluster on all facets of integrated care, including advocacy, cod - ing, health information and technology, and measurement-based care . Our com - mittee also works to enhance the role of child and adolescent psychiatrists in integrated care settings through our work with the Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative (PCPCC) and our outreach to leadership in the fields of pediatrics, psychology, and advanced practice nursing, each of which are actively engaged in training in and development of integrated care systems and practice arrangements . Our goal remains active engagement for best utilization of our services and promoting our unique role in integrated care service delivery .Working in this area, we note that our members, components, and committees are still in the process of considering and developing our roles in integrated healthcare systems and practices, as we assess if it is time to draft a policy statement that would represent AACAP's diverse membership . Our committee has decided to convey this subject to our members through AACAP News for comment and input in helping us plan further . Whether or not you are currently practicing integrated care, preparing to practice integrated care for a portion of your practice, or whether you seek to continue a practice in traditional service delivery, your views are welcome . Some suggested questions for comment are as follows: 1) Should AACAP overtly promote a leadership role in integrated health - care systems, or rather speak of our unique clinical role in integrated healthcare systems, letting our leadership roles be nuanced, implicit, and evolving? 2) Should our statements on integrated healthcare systems be a statement of who we are and a commitment of what we will offer to integrated care, or rather an aspiration or goal for which our field and members should strive? On behalf of AACAP, our committee will continue working to support a wide range of services and approaches to delivery of child mental health services, which values who we are, how we wish to deliver care to our patients, and which allows us to continue to trans - form and enhance our practices as we choose . Further explication of our role in healthcare systems shows one way forward in increasing access to care for our patients . Statement of purpose: To identify roles of child and adolescent psychiatrists in transformation of practice and on the integrated care team. Child and ado - lescent psychiatrists are ideally suited to inform and facilitate the transition of our health care system from traditional and managed models of care to collaborative and integrative care delivery . Partnership with mental health and medical profes - sionals promotes access to the highest quality, value-based and evidence-based care . This ensures that children and adolescents receive high quality care, with special attention to youth with severe and complex psychiatric and medical issues . How child and adolescent psychiatrists support and enhance integrated care teams: Child and adolescent psychia - trists provide expertise and intensive training in medicine and the biopsycho - social model, knowledge of brain/body interactions, training in psychophar - macology, proficiency in individual and family psychotherapies, work with community agencies, and experience in consultation-liaison training with multiple medical and mental health dis - ciplines . Services to the integrated care team include integrated treatment team planning, case review of complex and severe patients, education on specialized topics of care, and collaboration with other consultants to integrated treatment teams in medical settings, schools, and community systems of care . Child and adolescent psychiatrists share leader - ship with primary care in integrated care settings and team with professionals in a number of models and practices . continued on page 284284 AACAP NEWS COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLYEngagement and training with men - tal health and medical professionals: Evidence-based models, such as the Washington Collaborative Care Model, show the clinical effectiveness of psy - chiatric consultation to integrated care teams . Child and adolescent psychiatrists build and enhance programs dedicated to collaborative team education of train - ees and practitioners . We collaborate in research on efficacy, safety, and value of psychotropic medications and clinical interventions . We pursue opportunities which engage us with partnering behav - ioral health and medical professionals, such as advanced practice nurses, psy - chologists, social workers, counselors, pharmacists, and primary care profes - sionals . In integrated care settings, child and adolescent psychiatrists participate in consultative, collaborative, and super - visory roles in care planning and service delivery . We continue to co-define and promote ideal collaborations with our partners on integrated care teams and in community systems of care, bring - ing much needed child and adolescent psychiatry expertise to each team with which we serve . Clinical, administrative, and payer partnerships: Child and adolescent psy - chiatrists promote access to care through advocacy in multiple settings, including participation with clinical, administra - tive, and payer partners in shaping healthcare delivery systems .

Fritz, MD AACAP's Call for Nominations is open and runs through February 1, 2019 . During this time period, AACAP members may nominate themselves or another member to run for offices on the Executive Committee and Council . In the interest of greater transparency and maximum fairness to all involved, I'd like to clarify how the Nominating Committee functions . As chair of the Nominating Committee, I want to respond to several questions about the process that we heard at the Annual Meeting in Seattle . 1. Who makes up the Nominating Committee, and how do they get there? The Nominating Committee consists of the Immediate Past President (chair) and four members who have been elected by the membership in the general election; they serve staggered two-year terms . Every October, the Council creates a large list of potential candidates to run for the Nominating Committee and each Council member ranks their top six choices . The four individuals with the highest scores, who agree to run, are placed on the May election ballot, and the two who receive the most votes are elected for a two-year term . The current members of the Nominating Committee are Gregory K. Fritz, MD (chair), Cheryl Al-Mateen, MD , William Arroyo, MD , John Dunne, MD , and Sandra Fritsch, MD .2. How does the Nominating Committee come up with a slate of candidates? The job of the Nominating Committee in even years is to select four candidates to run for two Councilor-at-Large positions . In odd years, in addition to four can - didates for the two Councilor-at-Large positions, the Nominating Committee is responsible for selecting two candi - dates to run for each of the offices of President-Elect, Secretary, and Treasurer . After the Call for Nominations closes on February 1, the Nominating Committee reviews the nomination letters that have been received . The Nominating Committee then meets in-person to finalize the slate in late February or early March . The Chair confirms the individu - als' willingness to run, and the Executive Office gets the candidates' materials for the election booklet . The election runs throughout the month of May . The Nominating Committee strives to create a diverse slate for each election . It takes race, ethnicity, and geographic region into account . 3. How does a person get considered for an office by the Nominating Committee? To consider an individual for candidacy for a particular office, the Nominating Committee must receive, by February 1, a nomination letter and CV; verbal suggestions or expressions of inter - est are not sufficient . Any member of AACAP can write such a letter; self- nomination letters are also appropriate, as are letters from a member of the Nominating Committee . (Nominating Committee members are not eligible to run for office themselves until two years after their term ends) . However, after February 1, no new names will be accepted for consideration from either AACAP members or from within the Nominating Committee .4. Does a person need to be a Distinguished Fellow to be run for office? A member must be a Distinguished Fellow to run for President-Elect, Secretary, and Treasurer . A member does not need to be a Distinguished Fellow to run for Councilor-at-Large . 5. Can AACAP staff nominate people or participate in the process? No . Executive Director Heidi Fordi has clarified that neither she nor any other staff member will make sugges - tions, be present during the Nominating Committee's meetings, or discuss their preferences for specific individuals . The Nominating Committee may request administrative assistance (materi - als, disclosures, details about AACAP activities, etc .) from staff in the Executive Office, but deliberations are to be absolutely confidential . 6. Is there a prescribed series of steps to become an AACAP Officer? The President-Elect becomes President after the two-year term . Other than President-Elect, there is no prescribed or de facto office that is required or leads to a higher office . Experience, demonstrated leadership, and commit - ment to AACAP are important factors that the Nominating Committee consid - ers, but no AACAP office (other than President) is entitled to nor expected by any individual . AACAP is proud of the level playing field and total lack of campaigning associ - ated with our elections . Our biggest concern is the relatively small percent - age of members that vote in each year's election (between 23-26%) . If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions about the election process, please con - tact me at Gregory_fritz@brown.edu . m Dr. Fritz is the Past President of AACAP.

NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2018 287288 AACAP NEWS COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLYSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY Advocacy: Residents in Action In April of this year, I had the privilege of participating in the Advocacy Day of California Psychiatric Association (CPA) as one of the Resident-Fellow Member representatives from the Southern California Psychiatric Society . Advocacy Day was a great opportunity for residents and fellows to gain expo - sure to mental health policy issues and communicate directly with state legisla - tors, alongside experienced advocates . Prior to participating in Advocacy Day this year, I had little knowledge about the process of legislative reform . By the end of the day, I had seen first - hand the impact that psychiatrists can have on policy decisions affecting mental healthcare . We spent the morning becoming familiar with CPA-sponsored bills and current mental health-related legislative issues . We learned about AB 2143 (Caballero), a bill that amends statutes for existing state programs to provide loan forgiveness incentives for licensed psychotherapists to gain dual licensure as physician assis - tants or psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners . This is a strategy devel - oped by the CPA, which would expand the workforce of mental health providers who are able to prescribe psychotropic medications, thereby increasing access to mental healthcare . A companion bill, for which CPA is the sponsor, to expand access to mental health care is AB 2018 (Maienshein), which amends current statute for education loan forgiveness incentives if residents in psychiatry select a train - ing program that strongly emphasizes community mental health experience . These residents would be immediately eligible for these incentives as opposed to becoming eligible after completion of residency . Greater recruitment of physi - cians to the field of psychiatry would help address the shortage of psychiatrists that exists in both California and across the country . AB 1971 (Santiago, Chen, and Friedman) is a controversial bill that proposes to reform the existing Lanterman-Petris- Short (LPS) law, governing involuntary care in California . Current LPS law targets people with severe mental illness, developmental disabilities, and people with \"chronic alcoholism\" and allows involuntary commitment of patients if they are assessed to be a danger to self, danger to others, or gravely disabled as a result of a mental health disorder . This bill would expand the definition of grave disability to include being unable to provide for his or her medical treatment as a result of a mental health disorder . This bill has raised the ire of patients' rights groups, including civil libertarians, among others, who oppose involuntary care . AB 2328 (Nazarian) is a bill that would establish statewide standards for a continuum of care of substance use treatment for youth . The bill identi - fies two funding sources, namely, Medicaid (or Medi-Cal in California) and the recently approved referen - dum, Proposition 64 (or Adults Use of Marijuana Act) . A continuum of care is an entitlement program under Medicaid while Proposition 64 generates revenue to support prevention and treatment of substance use in youth . Lastly, we learned about another CPA-sponsored state budget proposal, Primary Care Psychiatry, which would allocate training scholarships to pri - mary care physicians to enhance their knowledge base and psychiatric skills . UC Davis and UC Irvine have developed such a program . After additional training and discus - sion of the above legislative bills and proposals, we were teamed up with experienced advocates . William Arroyo, MD, led a team of three residents and one fellow to meet with staff of Senator Robert Hertzberg and Assemblyman Adrin Nazarian at the state capitol build - ing . The residents learned about the role that psychiatrists, including resi - dents, can assume in advocacy to help establish positive changes within the mental healthcare system . Participating in Advocacy Day of the California Psychiatric Association was a valuable learning experience for young psychia - trists in regard to the basics of advocacy and the shaping of mental health policy . Residents reported that it was an honor to participate in helping to advocate for legislation that will impact many patients throughout California and increase access to mental healthcare . Dr. Arroyo is a senior advocacy leader. He may be reached at wmarroyo@ pacbell.net . Dr. Chang is a third year resident.

Koss, MD In 2011, Martin Drell, MD , then AACAP President, established Back to Project Future (BPF) as his Presidential Initiative . The BPF Steering Committee was tasked with developing a focused plan to guide AACAP leader - ship and staff into the coming decade . The project brought together a diverse group of AACAP members to develop a consensus of priorities . The discovery process included extensive outreach to members from all AACAP components, including representatives from AACAP Committees, the Assembly, and leader - ship, as well as input from our member - ship who were invited to participate in two member forums at AACAP Annual Meetings . Furthermore, other stakehold - ers, including the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training (AADPRT), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) were asked for their input . Through research and deliberation, the Steering Committee ultimately proposed a series of goals, recommendations, and action steps pertaining to the areas of Service/Clinical Practice, Training and Workforce, and Research . The final report, Plan for the Coming Decade (https://www.aacap.org/App_Themes/ AACAP/docs/member_resources/back_to_project_future/BPF_Plan_for_the_Coming_Decade_2014.pdf ), was reviewed and approved by Council in 2013 with the intent that BPF would serve as a \"roadmap .\" In 2015, a BPF Implementation Task Force proposed AACAP priorities for the subsequent two years, which the Council refined slightly prior to their adoption . Now, more than midway through this 10-year journey, I find myself reflect - ing on the relevance of the initial report within the context of an ever changing healthcare system, the extent to which we've made progress in addressing BPF priorities, and the impact of BPF on our organization . Our specialty continues to face many of the same challenges the BPF Steering Committee identified . We continue to have a child and adolescent psychiatrist workforce shortage that directly impacts the ability of families and children to access quality mental health care . This year, we again saw too many child and adolescent psychiatry fellowship slots go unfilled . Likely, the causes are multifac - torial, but one must consider the impact of staggering educational debt, extended time required for fellowship training, inadequate reimbursement for men - tal health services and treatment, and threats to physician scope of practice . At the same time that we face a work - force shortage, the number of children and youth seeking mental health care is increasing . Although stigma continues, there have been advances, including a growing public awareness about mental illness and the importance of early inter - vention and treatment . In addition, the Affordable Care Act's mental health parity provision and expansion of coverage increased the number of insured Americans . The cur - rent administration is threatening these advances . Fiscal and political tensions continue to challenge our health care systems . A population health perspec - tive has led to an interest in healthcare innovation, including integrated, collaborative care models, and tele - psychiatry . Transforming health care in this way will require adjusting medical education and training so child and adolescent psychiatrists are prepared to work within these newer models . The BPF final report continues to serve as a resource document rich in detail that addresses these concerns and many oth - ers . Clearly BPF remains just as relevant today as it was at the start of the decade . BPF moved beyond just analyzing these challenges and opportunities . It presented a \"roadmap\" that outlined potential solutions and actions so AACAP could simultaneously promote the mental health of children, youth, and families while supporting the professional needs of child and ado - lescent psychiatrists . After all, we are a professional member organization . The Steering Committee and Council recognized that to be functional, this comprehensive report would need to be distilled into a set of specific and timely priorities . Selecting those requires reviewing current challenges and opportunities on a regular basis and assessing AACAP resources . Since 2013, each incoming Council and Executive Committee has repeated this process, with the BPF report serving as a resource document . The new set of priorities approved by each Council has served to guide the actions of AACAP Council, committees, components, and staff to ensure effective and efficient collabora - tion . This process of prioritization is one legacy of BPF . A systematic review of 2018-2019 priori - ties reveals key areas of productivity . To highlight a few: \"Addressing the Workforce Shortage\" remains a priority for AACAP in 2018-2019 . BPF provides a series of recommendations and actions to inform and guide specific strategies . Some are immediately relevant in 2018 . The Department of Government Affairs continues to organize our advocacy efforts and directly lobby for new loan forgiveness programs for child and adolescent psychiatrists . \"The BPF final report continues to serve as a resource document rich in detail that addresses these concerns and many others. Clearly BPF remains just as relevant today as it was at the start of the decade.\" NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2018 291 FEATURESThe Research, Grants, and Workforce Department has recently updated AACAP's Workforce Maps to repre - sent the critical shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists across the United States . The Advocacy Committee, created in 2015, continues to collaborate with the Government Affairs team to develop resources that define the role of child and adolescent psychiatrists and the impact of workforce shortages on children's mental health . These materi - als are being used to inform and engage lawmakers in meaningful discussions, asking for their support for loan for - giveness programs to address our workforce shortage . AACAP members who attended the 2018 Legislative Conference asked lawmakers to co- sponsor legislation to ensure that child and adolescent psychiatrists are eligible for the National Health Service Corp Program . As a result of these combined efforts, AACAP secured an additional nine U .S . Representatives as co-sponsors for this much needed bill . AACAP's Assembly also passed, and Council approved, a motion to address the workforce shortage . In part, this motion asks that AACAP develop proposals for alternative training pathways recruiting directly out of medical school, focusing specifically on the child and adolescent population, and resulting in a specialty certification in child and adolescent psychiatry with a single specialty board exam . Other accomplishments that are driven by current priorities include: develop - ing the Learning Management System (LMS) for AACAP members to support additional training opportunities; pro - moting evidence-based models, such as telepsychiatry, to improve access to care; strengthening collaboration with the AAP to promote integrated, collaborative care; and pursuing funding for additional K-12 grants to increase the opportuni - ties for child and adolescent psychiatry researchers . While a complete list of accomplishments is beyond the scope of this article, I refer members to AACAP's website for a list of current priorities as well as a means for keeping on top of what AACAP is doing in real time . As a member of the BPF Steering Committee, the BPF Implementation Task Force, and now Chair of the Assembly, I have seen the positive impact that BPF has had on our orga - nization . As a result of developing and reviewing this comprehensive plan, members of the Steering Committee, Implementation Task Force, and Council recognized the critical importance of establishing priorities . Much work remains to be done, but if we are to be effective, we must continue to establish priorities and be laser-focused in our actions . We must identify areas where we, as child and adolescent psychia - trists, hold specific areas of expertise, areas where our voices are necessary to call attention to the needs of chil - dren and youth, and areas where a timely response is required . Extending ourselves beyond the scope of our resources runs the risk of \"stretching ourselves too thin\" and being unsuccess - ful in our pursuits . As a \"road map,\" BPF was not meant to be prescriptive, but rather aspirational . The BPF Plan for the Coming Decade serves as a call to action to all AACAP members . In the face of overwhelm - ing challenges to deliver quality mental health care to children and adoles - cents, we must remain steadfast in our advocacy efforts . We must galvanize our grassroots, organize our actions, and use our resources effectively . As child and adolescent psychiatrists, we are uniquely positioned to serve as physician thought leaders informing the development of healthcare systems and policies that support the role of child and adolescent psychiatrists as physician team leaders in multidisciplinary heath care teams, as well as promote improved access to quality mental health care for children, adolescents, and families . Collectively, we can make a difference! m Dr. Koss is a Clinical Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and also maintains a private practice in Sparta, NJ.

Gray, MD While policies regarding can - nabis differ state by state, the last decade has seen a notable shift toward liberalization of American state laws . As of this writing, 29 states have authorized some form of medicalization, and nine states have legalized recreational use among indi - viduals age 21 and over . These policy changes reflect a number of intersecting factors, ranging from social justice to revenue generation to evolving per - spectives on the risk/benefit profile of cannabis . Humans have used cannabis for thou - sands of years; it remains among the most used psychoactive substances in the world . Its characteristic psychoac - tive effect, or \"high,\" is produced by delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), one of several dozen cannabinoids and one of hundreds of overall chemical compounds the cannabis plant con - tains that are ingested during cannabis use . Another cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD), is also present in many strains of cannabis but does not produce a \"high .\" It has been the subject of increasing interest as a potential therapeutic agent . Many strains of recreationally used can - nabis have been developed that have substantially increased concentrations of THC and decreased concentrations of CBD . Even higher levels of THC may be found in \"concentrates\" known as \"dabs\" or \"wax .\" While a higher ratio of THC to CBD can produce a more pronounced \"high,\" it is also associated with increased risk for cannabis-related adverse effects . Other strains, often sold in cannabis dispensaries, purport - edly have high concentrations of CBD for therapeutic purposes, but may also contain THC . Amid increased understanding of the endocannabinoid system and substantial interest in the therapeutic potential of cannabinoid compounds and endocan - nabinoid system modulators, the topic of \"medical marijuana\" has gained traction . Of note, most randomized controlled trials of cannabinoids as therapeutics involved oral administration of reliably-dosed pharmaceutical-grade specific cannabinoids, rather than smoked or vaporized cannabis . Extremely few stud - ies have had children and adolescents as participants . 1 The FDA has approved oral THC to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and to stimulate appetite in HIV/ AIDS in adults . A THC+CBD oromucosal spray is under FDA review for the treat - ment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis in adults . 2 A CBD oral solution has recently demonstrated positive randomized controlled trial findings as an adjunctive treatment for schizophrenia in adults and for Lenox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome-associated seizures in both children and adults . 3,4 Yet, to date, no randomized controlled trial findings indicate a role for any cannabi - noid treatment in child and adolescent psychiatric practice . Changes in cannabis' legal status and advances in developing cannabinoid therapeutics must be considered against the backdrop of known risks associated with cannabis use, particularly during adolescence . As with a number of other addictive compounds, adolescents, amid a critical stage of brain development, are more prone to developing cannabis use disorder than adults . One in six adoles - cent cannabis users, compared to one in eleven adult cannabis users, develops cannabis use disorder . 5 Additionally, adolescent cannabis use may acutely impair cognition, judgment, and psy - chomotor coordination .6 Chronically, particularly when used heavily and frequently, it is associated with persistent cognitive deficits and reduced educa - tional attainment, as well as increased incidence and worsened clinical course of psychotic, mood, anxiety, and sub - stance use disorders . 7,8 These factors have implications for child and adolescent psychiatry . Patients and families may perceive cannabis as benign or even therapeutic, and may under-appreciate cannabis-associated risks for children and adolescents . The emergence of cannabinoid therapeutics may be conflated and generalized into a perception that cannabis, in any form and used by any population, may have more benefits than risks . Many families may even ask about potential psychiatric recommendation for cannabinoid thera - peutics for various conditions in children and adolescents . As with many complex and evolving topics, the most prudent approach is one that avoids polarization and false dichot - omies . Open, nonjudgmental dialogue encourages engagement and allows the clinician to present a reasoned perspec - tive grounded in evidence . Cannabis and cannabinoids are neither all good nor all bad, but on balance, the present state of evidence indicates significant risk and unclear benefit with cannabis use during adolescence . As clinicians and researchers, we can be enthused about breakthroughs in cannabinoid therapeu - tics while also being concerned about the NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2018 293 FEATURESadverse effects of cannabis use during adolescence, particularly when initiated at an early age and progressing to heavy and frequent use . As evidence-focused practitioners, we prescribe and recom - mend treatments based on high-quality randomized controlled trial findings . We also recognize high-quality translational, neurodevelopmental, and epidemiologi - cal research indicating that adolescent cannabis use may be associated with significant adverse outcomes . It is critical that we navigate this topic with balance and reason, modeling a scientifically principled approach to decision-making for patients and families . m References 1 .

A Psychiatrist/Pastor Hears the Cry Born During El Salvador's Civil War Carol Kessler, MD In the wake of zero tolerance immi - gration policies, scenes abound of wailing children and parents . These scenes awaken images that I encoun - tered while volunteering as a physician during El Salvador's civil war of the 1980s . As a child of post-World War II German immigrants, I could not be com - plicit with my U .S . government's \"Cold War\" military response to Salvadorans' plea for their rights . Instead, I responded to the Salvadoran church's call for physi - cians less likely to be targets of dollar- backed bullets at a time when priests and health workers were persecuted for helping the poor . From 1980-1992, the United States spent millions of dollars training and funding a Salvadoran military that led to the murder, displacement, torture, and disappearance of countless civilians in the name of \"democracy .\" Among the disappeared were thousands of children separated from families flee - ing the slaughter of \"scorched earth\" policies, snatched by soldiers obeying orders, brought to orphanages staffed by well-intentioned caregivers, adopted as \"orphans\" to create new families internally or abroad . A search was born at that time; mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers crying, \"Where are our chil - dren?\" and children crying, \"Where is my mommy?\" It was not until the post-war era that searching ones found the space to speak of their reality to a United Nations Truth Commission that documented the disappearance of an estimated 3,000 children . Their names are engraved on San Salvador's Wall of Remembrance and in the hearts of family members that never stop searching . To grieve would be to abandon hope . The sole Jesuit to survive the dollar-backed murder of his Salvadoran university colleagues, Father Jon Cortina, joined the search - a dan - gerous act at a time when perpetrators of disappearance were granted amnesty . He created an organization I have been privileged to volunteer for - Pro-busqueda /For-the Search of Disappeared Children . Their tireless staff listened to the cries of mothers and now-grown children separated by military might, documented their stories, cared for their mental health, reunited families with the help of DNA testing, and demanded justice in courts to this day . In the 1990s, with skills learned from Argentinian colleagues who had pro - vided care to mothers and grandmothers of the disappeared, I joined the efforts of Pro-busqueda . Argentinian mental health professionals found traditional interventions to lead to emotionless re-telling of traumatic experiences . They collaborated with actors and artists to develop means of sparking collective creativity among small groups of survi - vors . In El Salvador, I facilitated groups of Pro-busqueda staff and clients with this process . Survivors emerged from silent terror to draw, dramatize, and play together . One group drew a swastika- donned fist smashing a glass to pieces, separating a family onto separate shards . \"In one moment, a child is separated from its mother and thrust into the arms of a soldier,\" a group member declared . I see this image today at the U .S .-Mexico border . In an instant the mother/child bond is ruptured . The mother is crimi - nalized as U .S . Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents follow orders to deliver her children to \"caregiving\" institutions in the name of national security . The cry \"Never Again\" goes unheeded as mothers and children once again cannot be consoled . The cry and search for justice was born in the 1980s, when poor Salvadorans began to seek basic rights they had been denied . In a Cold War era, the response was U .S .-backed military might that led thousands to flee . As they crossed rivers, they met the strafing of helicopter fire or became confined to camps in Honduras . Those who fled to San Salvador touched the soul of martyred Archbishop Romero who became the \"voice of the voiceless\" until he was silenced by dollar-backed bullets . Whereas some found asylum in Canada, Europe, and Australia, of the thousands who crossed the Rio Grande, only 2% were granted refugee status . I will never forget the day I accompanied NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2018 301 OPINIONSa thirteen-year-old Salvadoran boy and his lawyer to immigration court in New York City . We requested asylum at a time when boys were systematically taken from rural buses and converted into child soldiers . The judge responded, \"Do you want all Salvadoran boys to come to this country?\" He had likely been instructed not to \"open the flood - gates\" and not to grant the promise of asylum from a U .S .-backed military . Instead, undocumented adolescents in Los Angeles without a \"legal\" future, confronted by endemic gang violence, defended themselves by creating the gang, Mara Salvatrucha/MS 13 . In 1992, when fragile peace accords were signed, U .S . policy opened prison doors, deporting gang members to El Salvador . A newly formed civilian police force was no match for the MS 13, who now reigns supreme . As a result, the Northern Triangle of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala is the homicide capital of the world . Gangs extort money from women selling tortillas from their home . They murder a man who cannot pay \"rent\" as his son and grandson stand by . They abduct children on their way to school . They torture a boy of a mother who does not know an ex-gang member's whereabouts . I hear their stories as a volunteer with Physicians for Human Rights' Asylum Network that pairs those few asylum seekers with legal represen - tation with mental health professionals who document their invisible traumatic wounds - wounds inflicted by gangs that resurrect the horror of the death squads of the 1980s . Today at the U .S . border, the policy of snatching children from \"terrorist\" par - ents is resurrected . I call Pro-Busqueda 's San Salvador office to lament, \"It's happening again .\" We continue the search for a place and time when family unity is respected and, in the words of Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, \"No Human Being is Illegal!\" As a physician, I have vowed to do no harm . As a pastor, I resurrect the call of the prophets and of Archbishop Romero to hear the cry of God's people for peace with justice . As a U .S . citizen, I call out for a time when my government will take responsibility, make reparations, stop the repression, and respect the human rights of all . m Dr. Kessler is an ordained pastor in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

While much attention has appropriately been devoted to high prescribing rates, foster youth are also at risk for unidentified and untreated behavioral health concerns. 2,3,4 Determining the appropriateness of prescribing patterns entails more than comparing utilization rates of foster youth with non-foster youth. Some degree of higher prescribing may be appropriate given the increased mental health needs of foster youth. Recommendations The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) Advocates for the judicious use of psychiatric medication, as part of a comprehensive treatment plan, for foster youth diagnosed with a psychiatric illness. Caution should be exercised to ensure that medications are not being used in place of effective psychosocial interventions to support foster youth in addressing their emotional and behavioral problems. Recommends consulting with a child and adolescent psychiatrist when foster youth psychiatric prescription concerns arise. Supports more research into how best to treat the behavioral conditions most common to foster youth, training on those interventions, and advocacy to better address the complex behavioral health needs of foster youth. Practical and Concrete Implications of the Policy Child and adolescent psychiatrists should support child welfare agencies' responsibility to develop evidence-based mental health resources for foster youth. Specificially, where possible, they should ensure that foster care youth are receiving appropriate behavioral health services in general including psychotropic medication where indicated. Child and adolescent psychiatrists may also serve as consultants to child welfare agencies when concerns arise over the appropriate use of psychiatric medications. References: 1.

For more information or to review AACAP's Policy Statements visit www.aacap.org .312 AACAP NEWSFOR YOUR INFORMATION Procedures for Developing AACAP Policy Statements 1. An individual AACAP member or body interested in creating a policy statement submits to the Executive Committee a \"letter of intent\" to create a policy prior to developing a draft policy statement. (This allows Executive Committee input of the desirability,appropriateness, etc. of the policy - without constituting any form of approval prior to the substantial work of creating a final draft policy statement.) 2. A final draft policy statement is submitted to the Policy Statement Advisory Group(PSAG) (to ensure that the language, tone, format, etc. conform to AACAP policy standards). 3. The author responds to the suggestions made by the PSAG and resubmits the edited draft until PSAG approval is achieved. 4. The Executive Committee receives the PSAG-approved policy statement and decides whether or not to forward it to Council. Feedback on this decision is given to the author,and resolution of problematic issues is undertaken. 5. The Executive Committee-approved policy is emailed to Council members, who have a two-week discussion period to convey concerns and ask questions followed by a one-week voting period to approve or disapprove the policy. (A simple majority determines the outcome). 6. A policy draft that is disapproved by Council vote may be re-written and resubmitted to the PSAG, with an explanation of what was changed; The process begins again with steps 2-5. 7. Upon Council approval, the new policy is printed in AACAP News, distributed/publicized as recommended, and placed on the AACAP website. 8. The expectation is for policy statements to be reviewed as needed, but no longer than 5 years, with the decision to renew, update, or sunset. Updated policy statements will be sent to the PSAG, Executive Committee, and Council for approval. 9. Committees are encouraged to collaborate with and get feedback from other relevant committees when drafting or updating a policy statement.POLICY STATEMENTS AACAP Policy Statement Requirements Policies should: 1) Help shape and articulate AACAP's position on important policy issues 2) Be clear, concise, and as brief as possible (no more than 500 words, excluding references) 3) Cite current and credible references (5 or less) 4) Be updated at least every 5 years Format for Policy Statements: 1) Background: A summary of the information that provides the rationale for the position taken, including: a. The issue that warrants a policy statement by AACAP; the significance of the issue; b. Scientific or clinical evidence that leads to the stated position citing several current references (seminal science or reviews) 2) Recommendation(s): A clear, crisp, unambiguous, jargon-free statement of AACAP's policy or position on the issue. 3) Practical and concrete implications of the policy as they impact practice, legislation,or daily life. 4) AACAP Boilerplate: The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry promotes the healthy develop - ment of children, adolescents, and families through advocacy, education, and research.

Company: Helen oral, once-daily treatment option for ADHD patients 6 years and older The first and only stimulant dosed in the evening1 Demonstrated ADHD symptom improvements in the early morning and throughout the day1 The difference is night and day Indication and Important Safety Information INDICATION JORNAY PM is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in patients 6 years and older. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNING: ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE CNS stimulants, including JORNAY PM, other methylphenidate-containing products, and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy. CONTRAINDICATIONS Known hypersensitivity to methylphenidate or other components of JORNAY PM. Hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients treated with methylphenidate products. Concurrent treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), or use of an MAOI within the preceding 14 days because of the risk of hypertensive crisis. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious Cardiovascular Reactions: Sudden death, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults treated with CNS stimulants at recommended doses. Sudden death has been reported in pediatric patients with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious heart problems taking CNS stimulants at recommended doses for ADHD. Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, and other serious cardiac problems. Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases: CNS stimulants may cause an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Monitor all patients for hypertension and tachycardia. Psychiatric Adverse Reactions: CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychiatric disorder and may induce a manic or mixed episode in patients with bipolar disorder. In patients with no prior history of psychotic illness or mania, CNS stimulants, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms. Priapism: Prolonged and painful erections, sometimes requiring intervention, have been reported with methylphenidate products in both pediatric and adult patients. Priapism has also appeared during a period of drug withdrawal. Immediate medical attention should be sought if signs or symptoms of prolonged penile erections or priapism are observed. Peripheral CNS stimulants used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants. Long-Term Suppression of Growth: CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. Monitor height and weight at appropriate intervals in pediatric patients. ADVERSE REACTIONS Based on accumulated data from other methylphenidate products, the most common ( 5% and twice the rate of placebo) adverse reactions for pediatric patients and adults are: appetite decreased, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, weight decreased, anxiety, dizziness, irritability, affect lability, tachycardia, and blood pressure increased. Additional adverse reactions ( 5% and twice the rate of placebo) in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years treated with JORNAY PM: headache, psychomotor hyperactivity, and mood swings. PREGNANCY AND LACTATION CNS stimulant medications, such as JORNAY PM, can cause vasoconstriction and thereby decrease placental perfusion. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JORNAY PM and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JORNAY PM or from the underlying maternal condition. Monitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as agitation, insomnia, anorexia, and reduced weight gain. Please see additional safety information in the Brief Summary of Prescribing Information for JORNAY PM on adjacent pages. Reference: 1.

Priapism Prolonged, painful erections, sometimes requiring surgery, have been reported with methylphenidate in both pediatric patients and adults. Priapism was not reported with drug initiation but developed after time on the drug, often after an increase in dose. Priapism has also appeared during a period of drug withdrawal (drug holidays or during discontinuation). Patients who develop abnormally sustained or frequent, painful erections should seek imme diate JORNAY PM, used to ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenome non. Signs and sy mptoms are intermittent and mild; however, peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenome non, were observed in post-the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheum atology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients. Long-term Suppression of Growth CNS s timula nts have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth in pedi atric patients. Careful follow-up of weight and heig ht in patients ages 7 to 10 years who were randomi zed to either methylphenid ate or placebo over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenid ate- treated and pla cebo-t reated patients over 36 mo nths (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medic ated child ren (i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temp orary slowing in growth (on average, 2 cm les s growth in heig ht and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without ev idence of growth reboun d durin g this p eriod.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSPregnancy Risk Summary Published studies and postmarketing reports on in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of methylphenidate to pmethylphenidate use during pregnancy are insucient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes. No teratogenic eects were observed regnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 2 and 9 times the maximum r basis, respectively. However, spina bida was observed in rabbits at a dose 31 times theecommended human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m 2 MRHD given to adolescents. A decrease in pup body weight was observed in a pre- and post-natal development study with oral administration of methylphenidate to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses 3.5 times the MRHD given to adolescents. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions CNS stimulant medications, such as JORNAY PM, can cause vasoconstriction and thereby decrease placental perfusion. No fetal and/or neonatal adverse reactions have been reported with the use of therapeutic doses of methylphenidate during pregnancy; however, premature delivery and low birth weight infants have been reported in amphetamine-dependent mothers. Data Human Data A limited number of pregnancies have been reported in published observational studies and postmarke ting r epor ts desc ribing methylphenidate use during egnancy . Due to the small number cannot denitely establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during methylphenidat e-exposed pr egnancies with know n outc omes, these data Animal Data In studies conduct ed in ra ts and r abbits, methylphenidate w as administere d orally at doses of up eects (increased incidence of fetal spina bida) were observed in rabbits at the highestto 75 and 20 0 mg/kg/day, re spectively, durin p eriod dose, which is ximately 31 times the MRHD of 1 00 mg/day given to ad olescents on a mg/m2 6 no evidence of specic teratogenic activity in rats, although increased incidences of0 mg/kg/day (basis. The no eect level for embryo-fetal development in rabbits was 9 times the MRHD given to ad olescents on a mg/m2 basis). There was fetal skeletal varia tions were seen at the highest dose level (6 times the MRHD given to ad olescents on a mg/m2 for embryo-f etal development in rats was 25 mg/kg/da y (2 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg/m2 basis).

Pediatric Use established in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years in two adequate and well-controlled clinical studies in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years, pharmacokinetic data in adults, and safety methylphenidate in pediatric patients has not been established. Long-Term Suppression of Growth Growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, including JORNAY PM. Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. Juven ile Animal Toxicity Data Ra ts treat ed with methylphenidate early in the postnatal period thr ough sexual matura tion d emonstrated were observed are at least 2 .5 times the MRHD of 1 00 mg/day given to c hildren on a mg/m 2 basis. In a study conducted in young rats, methylphenidate was administered basis, which was also maternally toxic. The no eect level ve mothers, reports that methylphenidate is present in human milk, which resulted in infant ranging between 1.1 and 2.7. There are no reports of adverse eects on the breastfed infantand no eects on milk production. However, long-term neurodevelopmental eects oninfants from CNS stimulant exposure are unknown. The developmental and health benets The safety and eectiveness of JORNAY PM in pediatric patients less than 6 years have not been established. The safety and eectiveness of JORNAY PM have been information from other methylphenidate-containing products. The long-term ecacy of a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity in adulthood. A decit in acquisition of a specic learning task was observed in females only. The doses at which these ndingsorally at doses of up to 1 00 mg/kg/day for 9 weeks, starting early in the postnatal period (postnatal Day 7 ) and continuing thr ough s exual maturity (postnatal week 10). When these animals were tested as adults (postnatal weeks 13-14), decreased spontan eous locomotor activity was observed in males females prev iously treated with 50 mg/kg/day (appro ximately 2 .5 times the MRHD of 1 00 mg/day given to c hildren on a mg/m 2 basis), and a decit in the acquisition of a specic learning task was seen in females exposed to the highest dose (5 times the MRHD of 1 00 mg/day given to c hildren on a mg/m2 basis). The no eect level for juvenile neurobehavioral development in rats was 5 mg/kg/day (0.25 times the MRHD of 1 00 mg/day given to c hildren on a mg/m2 basis). The clinical signicance of the long-term behavioral eects observed in rats is unknown. Geriatric Use JORNAY PM has not been studied in patients older than 65 years of age. DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance JORNAY PM contains methylphenidate, a Schedule II controlled substance. Abuse CNS s timu lants, including JORNAY PM, o ther methylphenidate-containing products , and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse . Abuse is characterized by impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. Sign s and symptoms of CNS s timulant abuse include increased heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and/o r sweating, dilated pupil s, hyperactivity, restlessness, insomnia, decreased a ppetite, loss of coordination, tremors, flushed skin, vomiting, and/o r abd ominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hos tility, aggression, and suicidal or homicidal idea tion have also been observed. Abusers of CNS s timulants may chew, snort, inject, or use o ther un approved routes o f administra tion, which can resul t in overdose and death. To reduce the abuse of CNS s timulants including JORNA Y PM, assess the risk o f abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, kee p careful prescrip tion records, educate pa tients and their fa milies about abuse and on proper stora ge and disposal of CNS s timulants, monitor for signs o f abuse while on therapy, and re-evaluat e the need for JORNAY PM use. Dependence Tolerance Tolerance (a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug results in a reduction of the drug's desired and/or undesired eects over time) can occur during chronic therapy with CNS stimulants including JORNAY PM. Dependence Physical dependence (a state of adaptation manifested by a withdrawal syndrome produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, or administration of an antagonist) can occur in patients treated with CNS stimulants, including JORNAY PM. Withdrawal symptoms after abrupt cessation of appetite; and psychomotor retardation or agitation. OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms Signs and symptoms of acute methylphenidate overdose, resulting principally from overstimulation of the CNS and from excessive sympathomimetic eects, may include the following: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, restlessness, anxiety, agitation, tremors, hyperreflexia, muscle twitching, convulsions (may be followed by coma), euphoria, confusion, hallucinations, del irium, sweating, flushing , headache, hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, Consult with Certied Poison Control Center (1-800- 222-12 22) for up-to-date guidance and advice on the management of overdo sage with methylp henidate. Pro vide supportive care, including close medi cal supervision and monit oring. Trea tment should consist of those general measur es employed in the management of overd osage with any drug. C onsider the pos sibility o f mul tiple drug overd osages. Ensure an adequate airway, oxy gena tion, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs.
