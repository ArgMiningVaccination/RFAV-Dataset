Due to this reason, homeopathy is not available on the NHS or on prescription. Homeopathic remedies are used to try and treat many illnesses and conditions such as: - Colds and flu - Depression - High blood pressure - Insomnia - Skin conditions The principle of homeopathy is to treat the symptoms and the patient rather than the illness, which means that patients with the same illness may be treated with different remedies. It is usual for people to experience some side effects such as flu-like symptoms, a rash, or a temporary increase in symptoms. This is thought to be a sign that the body is trying to re-balance itself. How can I find a Homeopath?
