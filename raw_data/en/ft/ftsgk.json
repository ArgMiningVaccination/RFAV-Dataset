Spirituality is about understanding that we play a significant role in the universe. It involves exploring specific universal themes such as love, compassion, altruism, life after death, wisdom and truth. These are explored in the knowledge that some people, such as saints or enlightened individuals, have achieved and manifested to higher levels of development than most people. Cultivating a healthy spirituality and having a sense of meaning and connectedness is essential for our health and well-being. The spiritual practice of recognizing the interconnectedness of all living things can also help us to buffer the pain that comes with traumatic experiences. Rebirthing Breathwork Rebirthing Breathwork is a safe and natural breathing method based on simplicity. It is designed to connect you to your subconscious mind, where you house your deepest thoughts, beliefs and desires. The exercise begins with lying down, relaxing and just breathing. It uses an easy to follow breathing technique called 'conscious connected circular breathing' that is guided by a trained Breathwork facilitator. During the session, a safe space is created to dive deep within yourself. Here you can unlock your energetic potential and activate your life force energy, making you feel vibrant, peaceful and alive. Ayahuasca Ayahuasca is an Amazonian plant medicine that has been used for hundreds, possibly thousands, of years. It is used by the indigenous ayahuasca shamans across the upper Amazonian region that spreads across Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil. Ayahuasca has exploded in popularity over the last few years and is now slowly making its way into the mainstream media. One of the key reasons for this is the human desire to fill the empty voids caused by modern life. Many of us seek solace in artificial self-image, with compulsions and behaviours that try to conquer the gap through love, attention, value, power and meaning. However, once we remove these false substitutes, space opens up for who we are and for the true self\u2014that is for love, belonging, and relief. The word 'ayahuasca' translates to 'vine of death' or 'vine of souls'. This powerful tea induces intense hallucinations and allows for introspection. The entire ayahuasca experience lasts for approximately 8 hours, with the strongest effects lasting 1-3 hours. Holotropic breathing Holotropic breathing is a powerful approach to self-exploration and personal empowerment that relies on our innate inner wisdom and its capacity to move us towards positive transformation and wholeness. The holotropic breathing method is very simple, combining accelerated breathing with evocative music in a special set and setting. With eyes closed, lying down on a mat, each person uses their breath along with the music in the room to enter a non-ordinary state of consciousness. This state activates the natural inner healing process of the individual's psyche, bringing the seeker a particular set of internal experiences. Sound Healing Sound has been used as a healing or calming tool for thousands of years. The use of sound as a form of healing dates back to prehistoric times when shaman chanted and drummed to heal people. The basis of sound healing is the understanding that all states of matter, right down to our cells, thoughts, and emotions, vibrate at different frequencies. Factors such as stress, sickness or depression cause cells and organs within our body to vibrate at suboptimal frequencies. Since sounds come at different frequencies and we too emit our own waves, sound healing works by matching frequencies of different sounds to those that are necessary and conducive to healing and relaxation. Below are the most popular sound therapies that are used today: - Tibetan Bowls - Gong Bath - Om Chanting - Deep Sleep & "}
