I say this prayer every now and then: Lord Jesus, 2 thousand yts ago , when u walk on earth, u make the blind see, the lame walk, the deaf hear. U make me perfect, with a pair of perfect eyes, ears, hands and legs and a perfect body, put in my mother's womb. Such a precious gift u have given me. Oh Lord, when i meet you in heaven, i want to show u how perfect u have make me. Heal all of us and make us whole again. We will give a testimony to proof that u are real u are the healer, the all mighty. I pray this in the name of Jesus, thank u Lord. Amen. [@vane2010](https://vestibular.org/participant/vane2010/) Thank you so much. Sorry I just saw your message as I was feeling so hopeless. Among all, My biggest problem is insomnia... The medicine you described is kind of against insomnia. But thank you so much!!! [@medee]my dr cannot explain what causes the symptoms. Dr refer me to psycharistic...so sad dr just do believe me.i am 2.5 mths into it. That's shocking your doctor has dismissed your concerns. Are you suffering from pins and needles? If so tell your doctor that GBS is now listed as a side effect of covid vaccines and say you suspect that you have a mild variant of it and want it investigated. Lots of people seem to be showing some symptoms of GBS myself included, the good thing is that while it takes time it does go away. I have the same sensation like you. A lot of my initial symptoms went away and now I have had internal vibration for few months now. It's been almost 6 months since it got my first shot and I am so getting tired of this. Now I can't do a lot of stuff because I am not fully vaccinated. So unfair and doctors don't know what happened to me or maybe they know but they can't speak up because here they really want everybody to get vaccinated. I had a feeling that my doctor knew more about my side effects than he was letting on. Looking back, the fact that he didn't send me for any tests to rule out MS and other nasties and advised me to ride it out makes me think that he's seen or heard of this happening after the vaccines despite him saying that I was the only person who had come to him with a complaint. I think they are afraid to speak out incase they are struck off like those that dared mention a casual link to autism with certain kids jabs got struck and lost their license to practice medicine. (I'm not anti Vax by the way). [@rosie01]hi oz, do u have pins and needles sensation in yr eyes ? And blur vision? And tingling in yr head and also the pressing pressure in yr head? I have all these besides buring pain and numbness all over my body. I've experienced pain and pins and needles in and around my eyes alongside vision issues since my Pfizer vaccine. I don't think it's GBS as it says that happens on both sides simultaneously, mine's only on one side - but I agree it's some kind of nerve inflammation/irritation.. I'm hoping it gets better soon or at least goes into remission for a few days! If it helps anyone, using a TENS machine can distract you from it for a while.. I'm seeing Neuro again tomorrow so will update then.. no sleep again so exhausted from it all Hi, have you visited the Neurologist again? What did they say? What were your symptoms? Hi, The neurologist doesn't think there is any neurological explanation for the buzzing and is taking me off Gabapentin , all tests have come back clear and he was adamant it wasn't GBS as my symptoms alleviate intermittently and with GBS it's pretty constant. I'm now seeing a mental health crisis team who are visiting me at home tomorrow as I attempted suicide yesterday, currently on diazepam but it STILL doesnt stop the buzzing!! Standing up and walking appears to help a bit and any distraction from it helps. I don't know if it's anxiety or a weird nerve irritation from the vax.. more research is badly needed.. The nurse in A&E hadn't heard of many side effects from Pfizer either? Hi [@montydes](https://vestibular.org/participant/montydes/) How are you feeling today? Please know you are not alone we are all going through similar stuff with you. Next time you start to feel down or alone just come on here and vent it all out you are in good company on this forum and we can all sympathize with each other as we know that what we are suffering from is REAL even if the medical community refuse to acknowledge that this is a vaccine related injury. If you start feeling suicidal please please call someone. Are you in the UK? You can call Samaritan's free in the UK. If you are in the USA there must be a similar charity in place? Thinking of you. I did see a neurologist who said it is a form of GBS, but I still haven't received treatment. For me, the worst is the insomnia. I really have been trying to avoid sleep meds. I tried a couple of Zzzquil recently which gave me a few hours, but messed up my heart rate. My heart rate has been elevated since the shot. Zzzquil made it go even higher. I'm 12 weeks out. Nerve issues do seem better at times, but then will flare up, such as burning sensation in arms, needle sensations in arms and legs, random muscle twitches which is from nerve damage or nerves healing. Hopefully this will pass in the weeks to come. I hope you are well. Same here. Been told I have a mild form of GBS. Luckily it does get better but downside is it takes ages. I'm 14 weeks out from first Pfizer and it is getting slowly better but with flare-ups along the way. I don't think it's GBS as it says that happens on both sides simultaneously, mine's only on one side - but I agree it's some kind of nerve inflammation/irritation.. I'm hoping it gets better soon or at least goes into remission for a few days! If it helps anyone, using a TENS machine can distract you from it for a while..

Hi [@KitKat](https://vestibular.org/participant/kitkat/) aww thanks for the concern, really appreciated, I don't have any friends to call upon so this really means a lot to me I've been feeling much better since Saturday - 2 solid days with absolutely no buzzing so I'm back in my \"green phase\" from the red phase which went on for 7-8 days.. I take comfort in knowing this is cyclical and to look forward to the good days which will happen. Positivity is definitely needed! Unfortunately once I'm in the \"red phase\" I tend to panic and this is what I need to change, my panic response - hoping the shrink can alter my meds to give me that much needed boost as my adrenal glands are totally exhausted! I still think there is a physical neurological element to this. When I simply touch my knee I get electricity sensations down my leg to my foot! I don't think anxiety is that advanced but who knows?! I'm hoping the green phase continues, will keep you all posted.. Thanks again and take care all Steve [@medee]my dr cannot explain what causes the symptoms.

Lots of people seem to be showing some symptoms of GBS myself included, the good thing is that while it takes time it does go away. Hi, I had been to a Neuro 2 days ago. While he did say it does not seem a major issue, he did say it seems like some chemical reaction in the brain that has caused all of this. So the brain is sending wrong signals to the body which makes sense. Though the tablets did not help me at all. I feel its better to let my body heal itself on its own. He said if it was something serious, it would have never been on and off. It would have been continuous. Since it isn't it isn't a cause of concern and seems like it is the healing process. I am currently taking only vitamin D supplement and intaking anti inflammatory food and lots of water. I don't know what else to do as the meds are making my condition all the more worse. I don't think it's GBS as it says that happens on both sides simultaneously, mine's only on one side - but I agree it's some kind of nerve inflammation/irritation.. I'm hoping it gets better soon or at least goes into remission for a few days! If it helps anyone, using a TENS machine can distract you from it for a while..

What have they suggested or told you to do? Could you please share maybe it'll help all of us too. Take care! [@medee]I really do think that staying calm, positive and distracting yourself from these feelings and also the thoughts about them really helps. I had a few bad days where it all seemed to flare up but I was overthinking everything and panicking that Im going to have some serious health issues etc as a result . Then I spoke to my Dr who was quite reassuring. She said all vaccines can cause nerve flare ups but these covid ones are a lot stronger and generate a stronger immune response. She also said nerve pain generally always goes away with time, some people may just take longer than others. It's now just a case of either trying out different meds that will ease the symptoms, or just riding it out till our bodies naturally settle everything down. Since I had the talk with my Dr my symptoms are still there but i notice them a lot less and I'm focusing on other stuff. Some days I don't notice them much at all and I can see certain body parts which used to have nerve pain have now gotten better. So I definitely believe we should all try to minimise our anxiety about this as much as we can. I didnt have ear pain but I did experience some tinnitus type symptoms a few times but they were very mild and passed quickly. My neuro prescribed me gabapentin as well and I took it for a few days but felt spaced out and not myself so I stopped it. I think the best bet is to just keep believing that your body is healing and this will all go away soon! Did you have a weird feeing in your head as well and ny sort of muscle weakness too? I see that you've mentioned about your Dr and then Neuro. Just wanted to know if the nerve flare-up was said by the General Practitioner or the Neuro. If this is coming from the Neuro then it sounds like some relieving information. Also did your Neuro do any tests on you? Pls do use the QUOTE option while responding. You take care! Hi Dee, I didn't have any head pain, but I did have twitches in muscles (even on my lip a few times) but mainly in limbs and fingers and toes. My Dr and neuro both said its nerve flare up. At my last neuro appt she said that she has seen many patients with this and they have all resolved. She said if it was anything sinister it would have shown up on the nerve test she did on me and the physical exam. And also it's getting better not worse. She definitely doesn't think it's something like GBS. I'm now 4 weeks post second vax. My symptoms have decreased almost to the point of being gone. Some days I feel a minor twinge or muscle twitch but it's nowhere near as bad as it was a few weeks ago. I've just been staying positive, not thinking about it hardly at all, taking vitamins, exercising etc. I don't plan to go back to my neuro and I don't see anything else coming out of it but she was quite reassuring about everything and that it's nothing to worry about. She also said to stay away from reading things online and self diagnosing as it causes a lot of stress and anxiety which I agree with! Have your symptoms improved? I don't know anymore if I am feeling better or worse. It started with muscle twitching on the 4th day post vax and then got pin and needles. Visited a dox who asked me to start Vitamin B12 and ran through some blood tests. Nothing came up except Vitamin D deficiency. I was prescribed Vitamin D tablets and sincd I was already taking B12 tablets a few days before the blood test, the reports did not show a deficiency on that. A few days later, I started getting nerve pain at random places and the doctor prescribed Gabapin NT which I took for a day but the sude effects were bad - more muscle twiching and hypnic jerks. Post which I started taking half of it and not the whole tablet. The nerve pain started getting a bit better. 3 days later when to the ENT as I also had Tinnitus. He asked me to stop Gabapin and started his treatment for the ears. I was all fine during this time. The nerve issues were too less. All I was concentrating was on my Tinnitus. All of a sudden my chest pain increased and it was unbearable. This was just a few days ago. I did have chest pain post vax but it was very slight. I also felt this is coz I have been anxious for too long so my body is acting up. But it wasn't the case. Slowly all my symptoms came back. This time it was more severe than when it had begun. I feel weak in my legs. I feel somewhat electric sesnation in my head which earlier subsided a week post vax. I feel like something is crawling in my body - this I did not suffer from earlier. I don't know anything anymore. I agree that reading all of this makes you anxious but how wpuld we get answers since the doctors haven't been supportive. 9th October I got the jab, 14th October my symptoms showed up. Within a week or 10 days or so I felt better. I was confident this is just vitamin deficiency and I was cming back on track. I left this forum so as to feel better. I did everything of it. But all of it started coming back at me even worse by the end of October and now I'm feeling hopeless. I am going to see a Neurologist but I hope he is as helpful and assuring as yours was. Hope we all come out of it soon. I am scared. Very very scared! Your timeline sounds similar to mine. If this can help: I got the jab on August 29, mild symptoms started around September 5, around Sept 24 they were gone. On Sept 25 they came back full force plus new ones altogether so strong I thought It was the end. I was in bed for two weeks freaking out. Blood tests didn't show anything wrong. Starting from October 6 they started going away. They never came back as strong as they were. I have mild relapses and days where I am 100% already. Hope it will stay like this and that the last mild symptoms will go away soon. I am assuming you're referring to my last comment on this thread. So since Oct 6th, it hasn't been so bad? Symptoms relapse but not so bad a before sounds good. Did you see any doctor or neurologist? Did any other test apart from the blood test? I have some odd burning feeling in my thighs. From so long it was a left one and now its the right one too. Did you have anything of that sort too? I hope it goes away as yours have subsided. May I know what were your exact symptoms? And were you on any medication and did you see a Neurologist? I am about to see a Neurologist. Do reply, will help me on the muscle issue. Do use the QUOTE option when you reply. Hi Dee, Yes I do confirm that since Oct 6th my symptoms are very mild and I have days where I don't have symptoms at all. Also, if I'm doing something else like working or talking with someone, even on days with mild symptoms, I don't notice them. I am a. a point where I notice my mild symptoms cause I am alert and I kind of check if they are there. I saw my GP, she ran some general test for my heart and blood tests. All good. She didn't believe it was the vaccine. I then spoke with other two doctors, my former GP that retired this June, he told me he saw many people with the weirdest side effects. They all resolved. I spoke with another doctor, homeopath and surgeon, he told me that there's plenty of people with our symptoms and they will resolve. He mentioned a friend of his experienced numbness in his hands for 1 month and a half+ other symptoms. It resolved. I was not on any meds before. I am super healthy, no previous conditions. Yes I had burning sensations in my arms, face and legs for a couple of days during the worst two weeks..it went away and never came back. Someone posted an article about nerves healing saying that the burning feeling is part of nerve healing. I don't know if my nerves were damaged cause I am really almost symptoms free and it was a very fast process. I had ALL the possible symptoms: pins and needles, tingling, crawling under my skin, all these randomly everywhere in my body. Burning sensation, zaps in my arms, shooting pains and numbness in legs, numbness is my arms and half of my face, brain fog, feeling like sparkling water behind my eyes and in my head. Eye floaters, a huge depression I can't even describe with words, it was something chemical for sure, nothing I experienced before. Crazy nightmares. Insomnia. Buzzing and vibration in my head and randomly in my body. I cried so much that then I got fullness in ears and tinnitus. It ALL went away. I still have random tingles and pins and needles in my feet and hands very very mild. When they come they last a couple of hours and so far they come twice a week for a few hours. I worked on reducing my anxiety and fear with breathing, walking every day (this is helping so much!!!!), natural supplements. I'm living normally, hoping that the last mild symptoms will go away with time. I trust my body will fully heal. I will update you all again next month. I hope my experience will help. Good luck to everyone!!! J [@medee]I really do think that staying calm, positive and distracting yourself from these feelings and also the thoughts about them really helps.

Good luck to everyone!!! J Thanks a lot! This was really helpful. I had been to a Neuro a day prior and he did say it seems like a chemical reaction in the brain that has caused it to send odd signals to the body. He wasn't really sure of what about the vax but when I asked him again and again, that's when he siad about the chemical reaction. He did give me 2 tablets amd both fucked me up last night. One was for nerve pain/anti depressant and I had a very very high heart beat last night and lot of sweating. I still have a bad one today. But last night was so bad it woke me up from my sleep. I have decided to let my body heal on its own and will try to keep myself as calm as I can. I wantes to ask you something, pls replt to this, whe you went for walks and came back gome and sat down, did you thigh nerves start dancing? Like those disxo lights flickering continously for some time? I did go for a walk twice this week and my nerves (back side of the legs from the thigh to to base) started to have some flickering which was for sometime. May I know how long did it take to get back to normal? How many months post your jab? Do you the Quote option when you respond. Thanks once again, this was helpful! Gave me a lot of hope. No he doesn't. He referred me to another Neurologist but I won't get to see him until next year. "}
