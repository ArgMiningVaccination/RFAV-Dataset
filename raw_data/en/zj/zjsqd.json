Hazardous waste regulations were difficult to apply to the healthcare industry. EPA and Delaware had previously allowed unwanted pharmaceuticals to be sent for reverse distribution with the presumption the pharmaceuticals would be used, reused, or reclaimed and the reverse distributor was not acting as a waste management service. 2Background EPA determined that in almost all cases, hazardous waste pharmaceuticals were being disposed by the reverse distributor (i.e., there was no use or reuse). As such, the hazardous waste pharmaceuticals were a waste at the individual healthcare facility because there was no legitimate expectation they would be used or reused by the reverse distributor. Because of this, EPA and state inspectors identified numerous potential violations at healthcare facilities. Key take -away: Healthcare facilities have always been subject to hazardous waste regulation. This rule is simply tailoring regulations to the healthcare industry. 3Acronyms RCRA -Resource Conservation and Recovery Act EPA -Environmental Protection Agency DEA -Drug Enforcement Administration FDA -Food and Drug Administration LQG -Large Quantity Generator SQG Generator VSQG -Very Small Quantity Generator or -Over -the-Counter NRT -Nicotine Replacement Therapy POTW -Publicly Owned Treatment Works (wastewater treatment plant) 4Goals of the Final Rule Provide regulations that are tailored to the healthcare industry Eliminate intentional sewering of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals Eliminate dual regulation of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals by EPA/DEA/FDA and associated state agencies Clarify how RCRA applies to reverse logistics and reverse distribution Re-evaluate the regulation of over -the-counter nicotine replacement therapies (OTC NRTs) 5Who is Subject to the Rule? Healthcare facilities that generate hazardous waste pharmaceuticals Facilities that generate waste OTC NRTs carrying the P075 waste code Reverse Distributors 6Who is Not Subject to the Rule? Households (EPA and DNREC continue to recommend household hazardous waste pharmaceuticals are taken to a collection event for disposal) Farmers, ranchers, and fisheries that may administer pharmaceuticals to their animals RCRA -permitted treatment, storage, and/or disposal facilities (TSDFs) Non-healthcare facilities that generate or otherwise manage hazardous waste pharmaceuticals 7Amendment of the P075 Nicotine Listing \u00a7261.33 FDA-approved over -the-counter nicotine replacement therapies (OTC NRT) are no longer included in the P075 listing Patches, gums, and lozenges no longer meet the criteria for acute hazardous waste FDA-approved OTC nicotine patches, gums, and lozenges can be discarded as non -hazardous solid P075 8Amendment of the P075 Nicotine Listing \u00a7261.33 Nicotine continues to be a listed, acute hazardous waste (P075) Other unused formulations of nicotine are still considered P075 when discarded oE-liquids/e -juices pesticides used in research and manufacturing = P075 9Reverse Distribution vs. Reverse Logistics EPA addressed the final part of its Retail Strategy in the Pharmaceutical Rule Preamble language specifically provides guidance on reverse logistics oDifferentiates reverse distribution and reverse logistics oGuidance on reverse logistics applies to all retail goods, not just pharmaceuticals 10Reverse Distribution vs. Reverse Logistics Reverse Distribution Reverse Logistics Prescription pharmaceuticals Non-prescription pharmaceuticals e.g., over -the-counter pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements All other unsold retail items No redistribution occurs Redistribution occurs via: Donation Liquidation (secondary market) Items are solid waste at the healthcare facility Items are not a solid waste IF there is a reasonable expectation of legitimate use/reuse or reclamation Addressed in Part 266, Subpart P Newly codified in Part 266, Subpart P , but affirms EPA's existing policy 11Hazardous Waste Pharmaceutical Rule EPA concluded that prescription pharmaceuticals sent to reverse distributors to determine manufacturer credit are solid wastes at the healthcare facility (i.e., there is no expectation of legitimate reuse or reclamation) As such, EPA created a new set of regulations to address the management of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals New regulatory provisions are found in DRGHW Part 266, Subpart P 12Definitions: Healthcare Facility Means any person that is lawfully authorized to: (1) Provide preventative, diagnostic, therapeutic, rehabilitative, maintenance or palliative care, and counseling, service, assessment or procedure with respect to the physical or mental condition, or functional status, of a human or animal or that affects the structure or function of the human or animal body;

This rule provides clarifications for what is considered to be an empty container (and thus not regulated as hazardous waste). 75Residues of Hazardous Waste Pharmaceuticals in Empty Containers \u00a7266.507 The following containers are considered empty and not regulated as hazardous waste: oA stock bottle, dispensing bottle, vial, or ampule (not to exceed 1 liter or 10,000 pills) provided the pharmaceuticals have been removed from the container using commonly employed practices to remove materials oA unit -dose container (e.g., a unit -dose cup, wrapper, blister pack, or delivery device) provided the pharmaceuticals have been removed from the container using commonly employed practices to remove materials 76Residues of Hazardous Waste Pharmaceuticals in Empty Containers \u00a7266.507 The following containers are considered empty and not regulated as hazardous waste (continued): oA syringe provided the contents have been removed by fully depressing the plunger of the syringe oAn intravenous (IV) bag provided the contents have been fully administered to a patient If a syringe or IV bag is not empty, the syringe or IV bag (with its remaining contents) must be placed in a container that is managed and disposed of as non -creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals 77Residues of Hazardous Waste Pharmaceuticals in Empty Containers \u00a7266.507 Hazardous waste pharmaceuticals remaining in any other type of unused, partially administered, or fully administered container must be managed as non -creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals, unless the container held non -acute hazardous waste pharmaceuticals and is empty (defined in \u00a7261.7(b)(1) or (2)) oThis includes, but is not limited to residues in: Inhalers Aerosol cans Nebulizers Tubes of ointments, gels, or Electronic nicotine delivery systems (e.g., e -cigarette or vaping pen) 78Residues of Hazardous Waste Pharmaceuticals Non-acute HW Pharms Acute HW Pharms* Stock/Dispensing Bottles (1 liter or 10,000 pills) and Unit - Dose ContainersRemove contents Remove contents Syringes Fully depress plunger Fully depress plunger IV BagsFully administer contents or \u00a7261.7(b)(1)Fully administer contents Other Containers\u00a7261.7(b)(1) or (2) \"RCRA empty\"Can not be RCRA empty (manage as non -creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical) * No triple rinsing of containers with acute hazardous waste pharmaceuticals 79Controlled Substances \u00a7266.506 Controlled substances are those drugs regulated by the DEA. Their purchase, storage, and use are strictly monitored. They are divided into five schedules based on potential for abuse: oSchedule I includes drugs that have no accepted medical use, such as heroin oSchedule II drugs are used medically, but have the highest potential for abuse (e.g., morphine) oSchedule III through V are drugs with decreasing abuse potential (e.g., cough suppressants and sedatives) Hazardous waste pharmaceuticals that are also controlled substances are only regulated by the DEA (provided conditions of exemption are met) 80Controlled Substances \u00a7266.506 There are only 8 hazardous waste pharmaceuticals that are also controlled used oParegoric -no longer commonly used oOpium tincture -no longer commonly used 81Controlled Substances \u00a7266.506 Conditional exemption applies to: oHazardous waste pharmaceuticals that are on a controlled substance list in 21 CFR Part 1308 (list is on previous slide) oHousehold hazardous waste pharmaceuticals that are collected in a take-back event or program, including those that are collected by an authorized collector registered with the DEA that commingles household hazardous waste pharmaceuticals with controlled substances from an ultimate user Note: authorized collector and ultimate user are defined by DEA 82Controlled Substances \u00a7266.506 Conditions for exemption: oComply with the sewering prohibition oCollect, store, transport, and dispose of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals in compliance with all applicable DEA regulations for controlled substances oDestroy the hazardous waste pharmaceuticals in a method that the DEA has publicly deemed in writing to meet the non -retrievable standard or in an acceptable combustion unit 83Controlled Substances \u00a7266.506 Acceptable units for the combustion of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals oPermitted large municipal waste combustor oPermitted small municipal waste combustor oPermitted hospital, medical, and infectious waste combustor oPermitted commercial and industrial solid waste incinerator oPermitted hazardous waste combustor 84Controlled Substances \u00a7266.506 Pharmaceutical wastage oControlled substances that have been dispensed to a patient, but have not been fully administered are not subject to DEA's non - retrievable standard and thus can be sewered ; however, hazardous waste pharmaceuticals that are also controlled substances are still subject to the sewering ban under EPA's rules. oTherefore, the 8 medications listed earlier cannot be besewered under any circumstances 85Controlled Substances \u00a7266.506 8 hazardous waste pharmaceuticals that are also controlled substances and thus cannot be sewered under used oParegoric -no longer commonly used oOpium tincture -no longer commonly used 86Controlled Substances \u00a7266.506 Sequestration devices alone cannot be used to manage hazardous waste pharmaceuticals that are also controlled substances -does not meet the exclusion in \u00a7266.506, as DEA has not publicly deemed in writing that the technology meets its non -retrievable standard If sequestration devices are used, the device must be combusted afterward to meet the exclusion. Note: it appears that sequestration devices may be used for pharmaceutical \"wastage,\" as the non -retrievable standard is not applicable to pharmaceutical \"wastage.\" Check with DEA/Office of Controlled Substances for more information. 87FAQs EPA has a wide -ranging set of frequently asked questions on their webpage: Can a healthcare facility operating under Subpart P send potentially - creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals to a reverse distributor in a state that has not yet adopted Subpart P? Yes. The healthcare facility is required to comply with Subpart P . While the reverse distributor is not required to comply with Subpart P , as a practical matter, it would need to comply with portions of Subpart P to ensure the healthcare facility can maintain compliance, including providing delivery confirmation to the healthcare facility. However, this burden is expected to be minimal, as this can be achieved by the reverse distributor signing for a shipment delivered by common carrier. 89FAQs Can a healthcare facility consolidate hazardous waste pharmaceuticals at a healthcare facility owned by the same entity in another state? Yes. There is no limitation on where the receiving healthcare facility must be located. 90FAQs Are intermediate care facilities (ICF) considered healthcare facilities? No, intermediate care facilities (described in 42 CFR 440.150(a)) are not considered healthcare facilities subject to Subpart P . EPA has determined ICFs have more in common with group homes or assisted living facilities than long -term care facilities with skilled nursing. 91FAQs Do e -cigarettes qualify for the nicotine P075 hazardous waste listing amendment? No, all forms of nicotine -containing e -cigarettes, e -liquids, electronic nicotine delivery systems, etc. are still considered hazardous waste with the waste code P075 when discarded. However, they can potentially be managed as pharmaceuticals under Subpart P . 92FAQs E-liquids pre -packaged for retail sale are considered hazardous waste pharmaceuticals. How are other e -liquids, such as house blends, regulated? According to the FDA, any entity that makes, modifies, mixes, manufactures, fabricates, assembles, processes, labels, repacks, relabels, or imports any tobacco product is a tobacco product manufacturer.
