Article in English | MEDLINE | ID: covidwho-1838946 ABSTRACTThe current COVID-19 pandemic brought about by the [SARS-CoV-2], a novel \u00df [coronavirus]is creating intense [health]havoc globally. [Researchers]suspect the situation to stay for long in the [community], considering this [virus]'s [pathogenesis], high rate [transmission]and tendency to provoke uncontrolled [immune response]activation. Immune mechanisms are highly individualistic. We put forward a hypothetical model of prakruti (Ayurvedic body phenotyping [character]) based personalized prophylactic- [therapeutic] [strategies]aiming at a better [immunomodulation]and quicker resolution of host immune mechanisms. We propose this model in symptomatic, mild to moderate, COVID-19 diagnosed cases and in cases quarantined for high to low [risk]primary contact with a positive case. We also suggest a [community]level personalized Ayurvedic prophylactic- [therapeutic]strategy based [procedures]) like [therapeutic]purgation (virechana) and medicated [enema](basti) are suggested in this hypothetical protocol with justification on evidence-based links between [immune responses]and prakruti along with per Ayurvedic [sciences]) and The [paper]also appraises the importance of pitta dosha/ama dosha in the manifestation of [inflammation]driven destructive phase of [immune responses]along with its stage-wise intervention. This hypothetical model intends to open up discussions on significance of prakruti assessment as a predictive marker to screen people [who]are at [risk]of succumbing into deteriorating states if infected with COVID-19. It also intends to discuss the predictive [personalized medicine] [measures]based on prakruti in yielding individual host immune [homeostasis]which may positively reduce the chances of untoward events of an aggravated immune responsiveness and subsequent [inflammation]driven [tissue]destruction - the candidate causes for COVID-19 related casualties. Testing this model may give insight towards emphasizing personalized host immune coping mechanisms that may prove crucial in any infectious [outbreaks]in near [future]too.
