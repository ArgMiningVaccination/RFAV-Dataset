Average Annual Temperature: Days Above 95\u00b0F: Air Precipitation Events: +15% Bloomington Climate Action Plan ii Executive Summary The City of Bloomington has a long -standing commitment to sustainability. City programs and community efforts focused on energy conservation, waste reduction, solar development, and the growth of the local food market have established Bloomington as a regional sustainability leader. Building on decades of environmental progress, the 2018 Sustainability Action Plan (SAP) represented the first formal sustainability planning effort for the City of Bloom- ington. The SAP serves as the City 's strategic guide to preserve natural resources, maintain Bloomington 's culture, build a diverse and thriving economy, and ensure a healthy and equitable standard of living for all residents. Bloomington 's Sustainability Action Plan established clear goals and priority actions to lower the environmental im- pact of City operations, reduce community greenhouse gas emissions, improve ecosystem health, support the local food economy, and reduce energy, water, and waste generation. The actions identified by the SAP are helping Bloomington mitigate emissions and prepare for the impacts of climate change, while enriching quality of life for residents. In recognition of the City 's efforts to improve environmental performance in city operations, the Indiana Department Environmental Management awarded the Greening the Government Award to the City of Bloomington in 2019. For more on Sustainability Action Plan and to learn about implementation progress please visit: https:// bloomington.in.gov/sustainability One fundamental objective of the Sustainability Action Plan is to prepare Bloomington for the impacts of climate change and minimize greenhouse gas emissions. The City of Bloomington demonstrated its commitment to meeting greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals set by the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement as a signatory to both the Mayors National Climate Action Agenda and the \"We Are Still In \" letter. Building on the City 's initial 2006 commitment to the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, the City of Bloomington has continued to demonstrate its leadership on climate by joining the Global Covenant of Mayors in 2019. To mobilize climate action, the City of Bloomington has also developed emissions profiles for the community and local government operations to help build a roadmap towards emissions reduction. This Climate Action Plan contin- ues Bloomington 's efforts towards climate action by establishing a detailed comprehensive plan of specific goals, strategies, and actions that will be necessary to reduce community greenhouse gas emissions and build climate resil- ience. Our Challenge Combustion of fossil fuels is warming earth 's atmosphere and changing our climate, disrupting the delicate balance of our ecosystems. Climate change is already affecting Bloomington by straining city infrastructure, adversely affecting human health, and causing disruptions to the local economy. It is important to address these climate im- pacts now, as climate change will become much more severe in the coming decades, contributing to additional strain on vulnerable populations, social systems, and overall community resilience. Our Opportunity Local action by cities is key to addressing climate change because many emissions are produced and can be reducing at a community level with immediate positive impacts on community quality of life. Climate change represents an opportunity for Bloomington to take this action and lower its carbon footprint through more efficient infrastructure and sustainable development. Transformation of Indiana 's energy infrastructure will be essential to meet climate goals due to the current utilization of carbon intensive fuel sources for electricity generation. This transition towards renewable and low carbon fuel sources represents a chance for Bloomington to reduce the community 's carbon footprint. Directing the community 's energy investments towards renewable sources will create a more diversified and resilient energy system, while also fostering local job creation. The promise of innovation, technological, and social change that climate action can bring represents the possibility of improved environmental, economic, and equity outcomes across the community. Our Climate Action Vision Bloomington 's vision is to be climate resilient, leading in the social and economic transitions necessary to reduce citywide greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement, while protecting Bloomington 's natural ecosystems, most vulnerable populations, and economic vitality against the increasing impacts of climate change. Cumulative Potential Cost Savings of Plan Measures Through 2030: Implementing many of the measures in this plan, such as reduction of energy consumption can save money for the community. (see Appendix for more) $461,435,000 Bloomington Climate Action Plan Executive Summary GHG Emission Reduction Goal in Global Context To validate the appropriateness of the City 's Climate Action Plan emissions reduction goal, the recommendations of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were considered. The IPCC is the United Nation Environment Pro- gramme (UNEP) body that assesses the science related to climate change and provides support to countries globally in climate action policy making. The scientific consensus of the most recent IPCC recommendations is that it is nec- essary to reduce global GHG emissions at a pace that will limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. The Paris Agreement affirms this recommendation by aiming to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C above pre -industrial levels, considered to be the threshold for dangerous climate impacts. The UNEP Emissions Gap Report published in November 2019 asserts that by 2030, global emissions will need to be 25% lower than 2018 emissions levels to put the world on the least -cost pathway to limiting global warming to be- low 2\u00b0C, the level required to meet Paris Agreement goals. To limit global warming further to 1.5\u00b0C, the same report finds emissions would need to be 55% lower than 2018 emissions levels by 2030. By 2050, IPCC guidance indicates it will be necessary to achieve 80% to 100% emission reductions (carbon neutral) by 2050 to remain within the 1.5\u00b0C - 2\u00b0C global warming range. These global recommendations were accounted for in the formulation of appropriate carbon reduction goals for Bloomington. Our Carbon Reduction Goal The Bloomington Climate Action Plan (CAP) seeks to re -affirm the City of Bloomington 's commitment to meeting the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. To accomplish this carbon reduction target, the CAP goal must align with the IPCC suggested carbon emission reduction goals of a 25% -55% reduction in emissions by 2030 and an 80% or greater reduction in emissions by 2050 . To reduce community -wide GHG emissions in line with the Paris Climate Agreement with intermediate reduction goals based on the latest IPCC scientific recommendations as follows: To reduce Bloomington community greenhouse gas emissions 25% below 2018 emissions levels by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 . Bloomington 's Carbon Reduction Pathway 2030 25% below 2018 2050 Carbon Neutral 2018 1,290,493 Metric Tons CO2e 2008 1,532,117 Metric Tons CO2e Anticipated GHG emissions levels if we do not act.

This means that the implementation phase of this plan should be characterized by intermittent measurement of progress and plan adjustments. Plan adjustments may include increasing implementation speed for scope areas which illustrate suc- cess, modifying goals for strategies which may fall short of desired outcomes, and identifying additional opportuni- ties for action. As a \"living plan, \" the 2030 emission reduction goal should be seen as a guiding constant to achieving emissions re- ductions. However, recognition should be given that the initial implementation actions may not yet fully achieve plan goals. Intermittent plan progress measurements and adjustments will be necessary to identify additional ac- tions that may be necessary to reach the CAP goal, as well as any adjustments to implementation targets that may be needed to meet the greenhouse gas reduction goal by 2030.

Section 01 Introduction Click here to return to TOC 1 Introduction The City of Bloomington addresses sustainability through careful attention to environmental, economic, and social equity issues. Sustainability and livability are guiding principles and are considered to be foundational to quality, long -lasting economic and community development. In 2019, as part of Bloomington 's commitment to the Global Covenant of Mayors, the City of Bloomington be- gan developing a Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment and Climate Action Plan. To assess local risks, haz- ards and vulnerabilities to climate change, the Climate Vulnerability Assessment evaluated Bloomington 's fore- casted exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to changing climate conditions and serves as a crucial refer- ence document to prioritize climate action and mitigation actions. The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was presented to the Bloomington City Council in 2020 to detail how climate change is affecting Bloomington now, identify current and future climate vulnerabilities, and forecast how climate vulnerabilities will change in com- ing decades. This Climate Action Plan has built on past emissions inventories, planning efforts, and climate as- sessments to develop science based targets to implement climate mitigation and adaptation commitments. Support of Bloomington Plans This Climate Action Plan leverages, supports, and expands on the City 's other recent planning efforts. The strategies and actions included in this report relate closely to the foundational work already completed by the City, including the 2018 Sustaina- bility Action Plan, as well as the 2018 Bloomington Comprehensive Plan. Climate Action as a Journey The Climate Action Plan represents a robust vision of the future with a comprehensive scope of action befitting the magnitude of the collective climate challenge ahead. This Climate Action Plan establishes a long -term cli- mate resilience vision and mitigation goal for the community through 2050. The plan itself, its strategies, and detailed actions, are intended as a 10 year plan. It is anticipated that this plan would be updated by 2030 to outline the next phase of action towards achieving the long -term community -wide goals. The Bloomington Climate Action Plan should be seen as a living document. Action progress and effectiveness should be reviewed at regular intervals through the plan 's implementation and adjustments should be made to expand or modify the scope of individual actions and to augment the plan with new actions as appropriate to respond to ever -changing market and community conditions. Bloomington Climate Action Plan 2 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 3 Introduction The process The Climate Action Plan was developed in consultation with a 27 person planning team of community mem- bers, economic development representatives, Monroe County and City of Bloomington staff. The planning team was organized into sub -teams aligned with each of the sectors included in this plan (see Plan Framework). The plan 's strategic framework, goals, strategies, and actions were developed and refined through a number of planning workshops held between June and October 2020. Community Survey The City of Bloomington issued a community survey about climate change to collect input from members of the com- munity. The online survey was an important early step in climate action planning process in identifying issues of concern to the community, as well as areas of support for climate action. The survey was instrumental in identifying initial sustainability and climate adaptation needs, oppor- tunities, priorities, and issues for the City of Bloomington at the start of the planning process. The community re- sponses collected by survey informed the development of the strategies and detailed actions included in this plan. The community climate survey was designed as an online questionnaire survey with self -selected engagement. The survey was made available online on a dedicated webpage and was available from March 2020 through June 2020 and was completed by 472 community members repre- senting a broad demographic of the community . Community Engagement At the beginning of 2020, the City of Bloomington began the climate action planning process. To engage com- munity members, an engagement plan was developed with consultant assistance to ensure that the recom- mendations of the plan had received feedback from a range of constituents and community members. Initially, the engagement plan included community gatherings to discuss the development of the Climate Action Plan. Due to emergent realities of COVID -19 and community stay -at-home orders, the engagement was con- ducted entirely through virtual sessions. These virtual sessions were hosted by community groups and leaders who were interested in providing their perspective on Bloomington 's climate goals. The co -hosts of these virtu- al sessions included staff and constituents of the Banneker Community Center, Bloomington Housing Authority, Bloomington Community and Family Resource Department, and Indiana University students. Three virtual sessions were held in June -August 2020 to inform the development of the climate planning strate- gies. The feedback provided was utilized to develop of the draft Climate Action Plan. After the draft was re- leased for public feedback, three more listening sessions were held from October 2020 - January 2021, in addi- tion to presentations to the Bloomington Commission on Sustainability, the Bloomington Environmental Com- mission, the Bloomington City Council Climate Action Committee, and written comments received by City of Bloomington staff, planning team members, and the public. Input received from public engagement has been considered and integrated into the final Climate Action Plan . Survey Respondent Ages How Concerned Are You About Climate Change? Introduction Why Create a Climate Action Plan The creation and dedicated implementation of a Climate Action Plan (CAP) is an organized way for a city to con- tribute to solving the global climate crisis while helping its resident and business communities create improved resilience to the current and future impacts and risks of climate change. Climate action can also create invest- ment in innovation, jobs and actions that save households and businesses money. What is a Climate Action Plan (CAP) The development and dedicated implementation of a Climate Action Plan (CAP) provides a dedicated roadmap for a city to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build resilience to climate impacts. Implementation of CAP strategies helps contribute to solving the global climate crisis and improves resilience to climate change risks and impacts. By taking specific steps to reduce emissions and build resilience, climate action can also foster investments in innovation and job growth, while saving households and businesses money. What is Climate Change Mitigation? Climate change mitigation addresses the root causes of climate change by taking action to reduce or prevent greenhouse gas (GHG) emission generation. Mitigation can include utilizing new technologies such as renewa- ble energy, improving the energy efficiency of existing technologies, or changing management practices or con- sumer behavior. What is Climate Change Adaptation? Some climate change impacts are now inevitable due to the current atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Adaptation actions seek to lower the risks posed by these impacts by anticipating and responding effec- tively to the threats that climate change poses. Both mitigation and adaptation actions are necessary to per- form, because even if global emissions are dramatically decreased, society will need to adapt to the climate impacts already set in motion. The Role of Cities in Climate Action Cities play an important role in addressing climate change because urban areas representing the majority of the population generate the majority of the emissions accelerating climate change. Even though each individu- al city 's impact on global greenhouse emissions is relatively small, the role of leadership to motivate change in each community can be extremely significant. According to a survey by the US Conference of Mayors, more than half of member cities (53%) had committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, a necessary first step to addressing climate change. Bloomington Climate Action Plan 4 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 5 Introduction Using This Plan This Climate Action Plan includes an implementation frame- work designed to achieve community -wide goals for green- house gas reduction and climate adaptation and resilience. The plan is structured around the eight community -wide sec- tors that are central to achieving greenhouse gas reduction and climate resilience. Each of these sectors has a dedicated chapter that includes background information on that sector, as well as the current status of Bloomington 's efforts. In the beginning of each chap- ter, equity considerations are identified that should be ad- dressed during implementation. Every sector has over -arching strategies that were identified as necessary to accomplish 2030 climate goals, as well as detailed actions for implementation. Actions in each sector are focused on climate mitigation, climate adaptation, or both mitigation and adaptation (see Climate Action Plan Framework). Strategies: specific statements of intent that expand on the sustainability vision and GHG reduction goals to guide deci- sions about future public policy, community investment, and actions. Actions: detailed activities that should be completed to carry out the vision and strategies identified in the plan. Co-Benefits Climate action strategies may offer additional benefits to Bloomington residents and businesses beyond emissions re- duction. These co -benefits are highlighted by icons in each sec- tion. Each icon is labelled with the respective co -benefit type .

Strategies in this sec- tor focus on water conservation, wastewater reduction and benefi- cial use of wastewater emissions, flood mitigation, and stormwater infiltration. Climate Action Benefits Introduction Introduction Bloomington 's Vulnerability to Climate Risks: Climate change is a global phenomenon that creates local impacts. It presents one of the most profound chal- lenges of our time. A broad international consensus exists among atmospheric scientists that the Earth 's cli- mate system is being destabilized due to elevated levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. Two changes to Indiana 's climate are occurring already: shorter winters with fewer cold extremes, and more heavy and extreme precipitation events. Increases in the global surface temperature and changes in precipita- tion levels and patterns are expected to continue and intensify for decades. In turn, these changes in climate have subsequent impacts on the economy and health of local communities. The following highlights the vulnerabilities to climate risks facing Bloomington, excerpted from the 2020 Bloomington Climate Vulnerability Assessment: Bloomington Climate Action Plan 8 Increased temperatures and changes to precipitation will stress trees, greenspace, and agriculture. Conditions may be more favorable for disease, pests, and invasive species. Trees and crop spe- cies which formerly thrived in the area 's climate may be less suited for future climate conditions. Trees, Greenspace, and Agriculture (High) Heavier rains coupled with higher risk of surface drought conditions may significantly increase de- mand on stormwater man- agement. The city 's storm- water infrastructure may not be capable of handling the amount of runoff during more frequent heavy down pours, requiring resources to make needed upgrades. Stormwater Management (High) Increases to heavy rain events and flooding/flash flooding risk may negatively impact water quality in the city's lakes, streams, and rivers. Increased pollutants and contamination poten- tial, combined with in- creased annual water tem- peratures could increase risk to algal and bacterial growth, harming habitats and limiting recreation. Surface Water Quality (Low) Warmer temperatures will increase demand for air conditioning and weatheri- zation needs. Energy costs may be difficult for vulnera- ble populations to meet. Heavier rains coupled with higher risk of surface drought conditions may cause more local flooding, particularly \"flash flooding \" which could cause damage to housing and reduce mo- bility for portions of the community. Housing (High) Warmer temperatures and more extreme heat may lead to higher risk of heat -related illness. Heat Stress (High) Longer growing seasons and higher temperatures may increase vector - borne diseases like West Nile Virus and Lyme disease. Vector -Borne Disease (Medium) Increased heat may result in more days of poor air quality and exposure to allergens, impacting respiratory illnesses. Air Quality (High) Exposure to increased climate impacts and dis- asters may lead to in- creased anxiety and other mental health ramifications. Mental Health (Medium) Bloomington Climate Action Plan 9 Estimated Social Cost of Carbon \"Social Cost of Carbon \" is an effort to properly account for the damages caused by greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting climate change impacts. By including the social cost of carbon in planning efforts, agencies and business can properly evaluate policies and decisions that affect greenhouse gas emissions. The \"Social Cost of Carbon \" is measure of the share of climate change economic harm and impacts from emitting one ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. For Bloomington it can be calculated as follows: Introduction Estimated Economic Risk of Climate Change to Bloomington by 2100 Incidents of severe weather in the United States, such as significant flooding in the Midwest, are tangible exam- ples of the types of projected climate trends that will have significant economic impacts. Future economic and social impacts of climate change include impacts to agriculture, energy costs, labor impacts, death rates, and crime impacts among others. \"Estimating Economic Damage from Climate Change in the United States, \" a study from the University of California Berkeley, was a comprehensive effort at quantifying the economic impacts for every county within the United States. The study collected national data documenting the responses in six economic sectors to short -term weather fluc- tuations. These data sets were integrated with probabilistic distributions from a set of global climate models and used to estimate future costs during the remainder of this century across a range of scenarios. In terms of overall effects on gross domestic product, the authors predicted negative impacts in the southern United States and positive impacts in some parts of the Pacific Northwest and New England. The sectors assessed, and the findings for annual economic impact as a percentage of GDP for Monroe County and the City of Bloomington are: Cumulative Economic Savings Potential of Implementing the Climate Action Plan Through 2030 Transportation Savings Potential: Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Savings Potential: Waste Reduction Savings: + $101,936,000 + $146,533,000 = $79,175,000 $461,435,000* Cumulative Community - Wide Savings Potential: * Value does not include economic potential of job creation and new business potential represented in the Climate Action Plan actions.

Greenhouse gases (GHG) absorb radiation and trap heat in the Earth 's atmosphere. These gases are the basis of the greenhouse effect, a process that warms the Earth 's surface. The more GHGs there are, the more heat that is trapped in our atmosphere and the more climate change accelerates. The most common greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), and nitrous oxide (N 2O). GHG emissions reduction pathways are different high impact ways to approach driving down emissions. The pathways towards high impact GHG emissions reduction include: Greenhouse Gas Sectors Where do citywide GHGs come from? Energy Emissions are pro- duced from the com- bustion of natural gas, coal, and other fossil fuels primarily for heating, cooling, and electricity generation. Transportation Emissions come from the combustion of fossil fuels for ground transportation and air travel. Solid Waste Emissions in the inventory estimate the decomposi- tion of biodegradable waste (e.g., food and yard waste) in the landfill. Water + Wastewater Emissions from energy uses are calculated for treatment and distribu- tion of water and the collection and treatment of wastewater. Bloomington Climate Action Plan 11 Introduction Higher Impact GHG Emissions Reduction Pathways GHG emissions reduction pathways are themes which represent higher impact greenhouse gas reduction po- tentials. The pathways towards high impact GHG emissions reduction include: Reduction A focus on reducing consumption of fossil fuels is an important strategy across all sectors. This in- cludes reducing the direct combustion of fossil fuels, as well as reducing of the consumption of ser- vices, products, and materials that require fossil fuel energy in their creation, use, or disposal. Fuel Switching Converting energy sources from fossil fuel based to low and no -carbon renewable energy sources is paramount to the reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions. A major focus in this pathway is the decarbonization of the electric grid by generating electricity from renew- able energy sources rather than fossil fuel sources. This pathway also includes the creation of on -site renewable energy sources and equipment conversion from fossil fuel combustion based to renewable fuel and electricity based power . These pathways weave across citywide GHG emissions sectors and can be found throughout this Cli- mate Action Plan. Below are how these pathways are applied in the major GHG emissions sectors in Bloomington : Transportation and Land Use Reduction : Reductions in this sector focus on decreasing vehicle use to reduce the total amount of transportation related fuel use. Actions to achieve vehicle fuel use re- duction include the use of more fuel efficient vehicles, increasing shared and public transit options and use, increasing walking/biking mobility, and decreasing demand for transportation through increased land use density and approaches like increased work - from -home employment options . Fuel Switching : In this sector, fuel switching includes a focus on converting vehicle stock from traditional internal combustion engines to electric vehicles, plug -in hybrid vehicles, or vehicles using low -carbon renewable fuels such as hydrogen or biodiesel derived from non -fossil fuel sources . Energy and Built Environment Reduction : Reductions in this sector focus on decreasing electricity, natural gas, and heating fuel consumption by improving energy efficiency. Actions to improve energy efficiency include conducting energy audits and upgrades for homes and businesses, establishing energy benchmarking programs to help owners and renters better under- stand potential energy efficiency improvements, and promoting high performance building construction design and technology . Fuel Switching : In this sector, fuel switching focuses on increasing on -site renewable energy installations, supporting actions by electric utilities to procure electricity from renewable energy sources, electrifying heating and cooking systems, and switching natural gas consumption to renewable natural gas . Introduction Citywide GHG Emission History 2008 -2018 Bloomington emitted nearly 1.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MT CO2e) in 2018. Energy use in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings was the largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emis- sions in Bloomington in 2018, accounting for 68% of emissions. The majority of Bloomington 's 2018 GHG emis- sions are associated with electricity use \u2014a value that has fallen in recent years as the electricity supply has decarbonized and efficiency has improved. Natural gas is the other source of significant energy use in buildings. The next largest source of 2018 GHG emissions was transportation at 15% of the total, which is primarily from the fuel use of personal and commercial vehicles. Indiana University 's combined heat and power (CHP) plant also emitted 7% of GHG emissions in 2018, while Solid waste accounted for 6% of GHG emissions. The electrici- ty use to supply and treat water, along with the nitrous oxide production associated with wastewater treat- ment resulted in 1% of emissions. Electricity lost as it is transmitted and distributed from power plants to end use accounted for 2% of 2018 emissions and methane fugitive emissions associated with natural gas consump- tion accounted for 0.3% of emissions. In 2020, the City of Bloomington standardized reporting of Bloomington 's historical emissions to utilize current emissions reporting protocols. More up to date data was integrated, resulting in minor adjustments to 2018 emissions values. For more information about Bloomington emissions values - see 2018 GHG Inventory . Bloomington Climate Action Plan 12 (Source: City of Bloomington 2018 GHG Inventory as Updated in 2020 ) Citywide GHG Emission 2018 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 13 Introduction This historical look at Bloomington 's GHG emissions from 2008 -2018 shows that emissions associated with en- ergy use can vary from year -to-year, often due to weather variability, but overall energy emissions declined over that decade. Electricity use fell a modest 2% across all sectors, but the sources of electricity became 24% less carbon intensive over that period. Natural gas use grew 8%, however, partially offsetting building emis- sions savings. This chart shows the general trends behind the Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Government, Unknown, Fugitive, and T&D Losses. Bloomington 's transportation emissions grew from 2008 -2018 as vehicle miles traveled grew 8% over that decade. Vehicle fuel economy in the U.S. improved slightly over that period, but not enough to offset the increased travel in Bloomington, so transportation emissions grew 4%. However, considering population growth, transportation emissions fell 7% per capita. The emissions associated with solid waste treatment grew 17% -- an equivalent to a 5% increase per capita when accounting for population growth. The emissions from water and wastewater fell 31% as those systems used less electricity and the electricity utilized became less carbon intensive. In total, Bloomington 's GHG emis- sions fell 16% from 2008 to 2018 a change overwhelmingly driven by the reduced carbon intensity of Blooming- ton's electricity sources . In total, Bloomington 's GHG emissions fell 16% from 2008 to 2018 a change overwhelmingly driven by the re- duced emissions of Bloomington 's electricity sources.

This reduction, however, is not enough to meet the scientific consensus of what is needed in order to cap global warming to 1.5\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C above pre - industrial levels as established by the Paris Agreement. The light gray dashed line in the chart above indicates the IPCC recommended maxi- mum GHG emissions in order to limit global warming to 2\u00b0C while the blue dashed line indicates the maximum emissions needed to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. See the next section for additional infor- mation on IPCC recommendations . BAU Legend 2020 IPCC Goal Recommendations to cap IPCC Goal Recommendations to cap global warming at 1.5\u00b0C. Introduction Citywide GHG Emissions Forecast A GHG emissions forecast supports GHG reduction planning efforts by anticipating what emissions may be like if action is not taken. Emissions are typically forecasted under a business -as-usual (BAU) scenario. The Intergov- ernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines a \"business -as-usual \" baseline case as the level of emissions that would result if future development trends follow those of the past and no changes in policies take place. The City of Bloomington GHG forecasts included here were based on population and employment growth esti- mates determined by 10 and 20 year historic growth rates. In addition to these data, the BAU draws from infor- mation from the US Environmental Protection Agency, US Department of Transportation, and US Energy Infor- mation Agency. The full assumptions used for the Business -as-Usual GHG Emissions Forecast model are out- lined in detail in the appendix of this plan. The BAU projections illustrate a reduction of 9% in city -wide emissions from 2018 levels by 2030 and a 43% reduction by 2050. These reductions are a result of a number of factors (please see appendix). The largest pro- jected change in Bloomington's future emissions is the decarbonization of the electricity grid; Duke Energy has pledged net zero emissions by 2050. The forecast also accounts for hotter summers and warmer winters in Bloomington that will change energy demand and transportation trends of vehicle efficiency and electrifica- tion. Consequently, the total electricity consumption is projected to increase through 2030 and beyond even while overall electrical emissions decrease . Citywide GHG Emissions Forecast Bloomington Climate Action Plan 15 Introduction Our Carbon Reduction Goal This plan has established GHG emissions reductions goals which re -affirm the City 's commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement. To do so, the plan must align itself within the IPCC suggested carbon emission reduction goals of 25% to 55% reduction by 2030 and 80% or greater reductions by 2050. The plan 's city -wide emission reduction goals based on this latest IPCC scientific recommendations is as follows : To reduce Bloomington community greenhouse gas emissions 25% below 2018 emissions levels by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 . This community -wide goal is reflected in goals established for individual sectors which seek to both support the City's Climate Action Plan in creating a climate resilient community and to reduce city -wide GHG emissions in line with the above goal. Sector goals related to GHG emissions reductions are designed to balance reduction across all sectors and achieve the overall emissions goals set forth for the community. The goals seek to strike a balance between achievability while also reaching for improvement beyond business -as-usual . Estimated Citywide GHG Reductions Included in This Plan Through successful implementation of this climate action plan, annual GHG emissions are projected to be 321,856 metric tons below 2018 citywide levels. The potential cumulative GHG emissions reductions over the 10 year implementation period are estimated at over 1,162,719 metric tons - an elimination of over 22.8 billion cubic feet of manmade greenhouse gas atmosphere resulting from this climate action plan. The total projected GHG emissions reductions estimated for the initial implementation actions of this plan are projected to be sufficient to achieve a total reduction in annual emissions of 25% below 2018 baseline emis- sions by 2030. As outlined on the previous page, the implementation phase of the plan should be characterized by intermittent measurement of progress and plan adjustments based on results in order to achieve the ulti- mate 2030 reduction goals . Citywide GHG Emission Reductions Wedge Diagram The diagram below shows the estimated emission reductions from the Business -as-Usual projections, by emis- sion sector, of the Climate Action Plan actions and targets .

Where and how we live, our mobility options to and from the places in our community we visit daily, and the related global impact of those decisions are all influenced by how our community is designed. The transportation sys- tems we have access to and choose to use \u2014including private and public vehicles, trains, and planes - can have significant impacts on the environment. In Bloomington, the transportation sector accounts for 15.4% of citywide greenhouse gas emissions (2018 GHG Inventory). As shown in the commuter transportation pie chart to the right, the majority (63) of Bloomington residents drive to work alone. The remaining walk (13%), carpool (9%), use public transit (6%), telework (5%), or bicycle (3%). Of the Bloomington workforce, the average com- mute -to-work time is 16.1 minutes compared to the State of Indiana average of 23 minutes while only 1.08% have \"super commutes \" in excess of 90 minutes compared to 1.82% for the State of Indi- ana. 91.1% of Bloomington households (26,626 households) live within \u00bd mile of transit routes and 24.1% (7,031 households) live near rush -hour high frequency transit routes. Continuing to improve the equity and sustainability of Bloomington 's land use and transportation systems re- quires a focus on developing systems and networks that allow for greater choice in where residents live and work, as well as how they commute. Implementation of Complete Streets and a connected system of transit, bike and pedestrian infrastructure along with emphasis on neighborhood design that supports density and walkability. These strategies are lower cost solutions that will save households money while helping Bloom- ington reach its goal to reduce city -wide GHG emissions by 25% below 2018 levels by 2030. Climate Change Considerations Commuter Transportation in Bloomington Climate Impacts This sector impacts climate change through the com- bustion of fossil fuels (gasoline, diesel, propane) for on-road cars and trucks and off -road vehicles and equipment. Climate Hazards Hazards to transportation and land use include in- creased damage to roads and transportation infra- structure due to increased freeze and thaw cycles, flooding, and extreme weather and temperatures. Bloomington Climate Action Plan 18 Transportation and Land Use Equity Considerations Increased opportunities for public transit and active transportation can help address health disparities for many at -risk populations. Affordable and reliable options for mobility for people with special transportation needs can significantly im- prove transportation equity. Populations with special transportation needs include older adults, youth, per- sons with disabilities, and persons with reduced incomes. Some neighborhoods in Bloomington have fewer housing and transportation options than others. This can limit people 's choices in where they live and how they get to work or other activities. Households that rely on public transit service or who rent their home will be limited in where they can find housing that meets both needs. Sector Goals Sector goals are established to both support the City's Climate Action Plan in creating a climate re- silient community and to reduce city -wide GHG emissions 25% below 2018 levels by 2030. Sector goals related to GHG emissions reductions are designed to balance reduction across all sec- tors and achieve the overall emissions goals set forth for the community. The goals seek to strike a balance between achievability while also reach- ing for improvement beyond business -as-usual. As indicated in the introduction, the Climate Action Plan is intended to be a 10 year plan to be updated at the completion of that time. Consequently, the goals and strategies outlined in this section are intended to be achieved by 2030 unless otherwise noted. Implementation of actions are anticipated to be initiated over 3 phases: phase 1 within 1 -3 years, phase 2 within 2 -5 years, and phase 3 within 4 -8 years of CAP approval.

Goal TL 2 Support and encourage electric vehicle (EV) adop- tion, achieve 30% of vehicles sold and 15% of VMT community -wide by 2030. Bloomington Climate Action Plan 20 Goal TL 1 Decrease on -road vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by 8% of 2018 values. Strategy TL 1 -A: Reduce single occupancy automobile use by 8% of 2018 val- ues. How We'll Measure Progress: Reported \"drive alone \" commuter transporta- tion data (US Census), Annual VMT data reported (INDOT) The local transportation system is planned, funded, built, and maintained by a combination of local, state, and federal organizations, including the Bloomington -Monroe County Metropolitan Planning Organization (BMCMPO). The BMCMPO is a partnership of local governments and trans- portation service providers to execute federally funded transportation pri- orities outlined in the 2045 Metropolitan Transportation Plan . MPO mem- bers include the City of Bloomington, Monroe County, the Town of Elletts- ville, Indiana University, and the Bloomington Public Transportation Corpo- ration (Bloomington Transit), and Area 10 Agency on Aging. Additionally transportation projects are also funded, planned, and executed by City of Bloomington. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Transportation and Land Use Reduced Costs Reduced Traffic Congestion Reduced GHG Emissions Improved Air Quality TL1-A- 1 Update the City's Transportation Plan and Metropolitan Transportation Plan to incorpo- rate reductions in carbon emissions and vehicle miles traveled, improved bicycle, pedes- trian and transit service standards, and a policy requiring project evaluation to include criteria on climate, equity, economic benefit, health, safety, and cost effectiveness. 1 TL1-A- 2 Establish a City of Bloomington employee Parking Cash Out benefit program to promote alternative commute options. Invite other public agencies and private sector employees to establish similar benefit programs. (https://www.bestworkplaces.org/pdf/ ParkingCashout_07.pdf https://www.boston.gov/transportation/parking -cash -out ) 1 TL1-A- 3 Conduct a road pricing strategy study to explore options appropriate for the City of Bloomington that accurately capture the cost of driving and auto -centric infrastructure on city roads. Include a study on parking fees, demand -based fees, fee discounts for car- pools and EV's and fuel efficiency charge options. Study should include national and in- ternational case studies and identify pilot projects for implementation. 2 TL1-A- 4 Identify locations and partners to facilitate parking buyback programs for municipal and other employers in the city. (https://www.bestworkplaces.org/pdf/ ParkingCashout_07.pdf https://www.boston.gov/transportation/parking -cash -out ) 2 TL1-A- 5 Determine appropriate locations for car -free pedestrian zones in high -density areas. Es- tablish implementation based on Kirkwood pilot project observations and recommenda- tions. Evaluate feasibility of limiting vehicles on certain days of the week and imple- menting congestion parking pricing, where appropriate . 2 TL1-A- 6 Identify locations and partners to facilitate bike/walk commute, carpooling, EV ride share, and telecommuting options for municipal and other employers in the city. 3 Actions Implementation Phase Transportation and Land Use Bloomington Climate Action Plan 21 Strategy TL 1 -B: Increase bicycle/pedestrian commuting from 17% to 18% by creating infrastructure to better encourage alternatives to vehicles. How We'll Measure Progress: Reported bike/walk commuter transportation data \u2014US Census, Annual VMT data reported The 237 miles of roadway within City limits is maintained by the City of Bloomington Public Works Street Division, with additional miles maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation, Indiana University and the Monroe County Highway Department. For multimodal transportation, the the City of Bloomington Parks and Recreation Department manages over 15 miles of recreational and multi -use paths. The City Trails and Trees bond passed by City Council in 2018 is adding over seven miles of new trails to the transportation system, including the 7 line, RCA/ Powerline and a hiking loop at Griffy Lake. Additionally, several multi -use trails were constructed in 2020 in accordance with the BMCMPO 's Complete Streets Policy which states that newly constructed roadways must be able to accommodate all types of roadway users. This strategy 's goals for increased bicycle and walk- ing utilization takes into account the city 's current participation rates in commuters walking and biking is significantly higher than the national aver- age of 3%. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Reduced Costs Reduced GHG Emissions Improved Air Quality Actions Implementation Phase Improved Public Health TL1-B- 1 Increase funding adequate to maintain and improve the existing transportation system and to invest in transportation capital projects and programs that reduce carbon emis- sions and improve equity. 1 TL1-B- 2 Implement the Multimodal Projects recommendations included in the 2019 City of Bloomington Transportation Plan and BMCMPO 's Transportation Improvement Pro- gram. 1 TL1-B- 3 Enhance bike and pedestrian travel options through creating protected bike lanes on key travel corridors and improved pedestrian efficiency through mobile route mapping. Conduct a study to identify and prioritize routes and establish an implementation plan and schedule. 2 TL1-B- 4 Promote usage of the Sustainability Development Incentive: density bonuses or expe- dited review for development projects that have mixed -used zoning (residential, retail and office uses). 2 TL1-B- 5 Provide additional earmarked funding and/or prioritization to projects with clear safety and VMT reduction goals. Accelerate 2019 City of Bloomington Transportation Plan, priority bicycle network (5 -7 year), pedestrian network, balancing work load, and fund- ing. 2 TL1-B- 6 Encourage development of projects within mixed use districts that promote a combina- tion of neighborhood -scale residential, commercial, and institutional uses with pedes- trian -oriented design and multi -modal transportation options. Developments should maximize equity considerations and minimize community wide VMT by creating a more walkable, bikeable, and transit friendly community . 2 TL1-B- 7 Conduct a Pavement Conversion study to identify underutilized paved areas and identi- fy incentivization and implementation plan to convert identified areas to sustainable green space, and/or pedestrian and biking paths and support space. 3 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 22 Transportation and Land Use Strategy TL 1 -C: Increase transit utilization by 10% over 2018 passenger miles by 2030 through infrastructure and frequency investments. How We'll Measure Progress: Reported public transit commuter data \u2014US Census, Annual VMT data reported Bloomington Transit is the main local transit service in the City and operates 14 routes with a fleet of 49 buses (Transportation Plan, 2019). The Bloom- ington Transit Route Optimization Study indicated that increasing frequen- cy, adding weekend service, and expanding service to the west side, to em- ployment centers, housing complexes, and to Ivy Tech are top priorities for transit users. While existing services adequately meet rider 's needs, some riders expressed dissatisfaction with service provision, especially that the transit schedules did not align with or satisfy travel needs. Given the cur- rent street network, improvements to bicycle, pedestrian, bus, and other supported modes of non -automobile travel along the major N -S and E -W corridors through the center of Bloomington were identified in the Trans- portation Plan as high -priority for investment. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Reduced Costs Reduced Traffic Congestion Enhanced Transit System Reduced GHG Emissions Actions Implementation Phase TL1-C- 1 Implement recommendations of the Bloomington Route Optimization Study. 1 TL1-C- 2 Collaborate with Bloomington Transit and/or other providers to establish a Guaranteed Ride Home program. Guaranteed Ride Home is a free reimbursement program for reg- istered commuters. Its purpose is to minimize the chance of being \"stuck at work \" due to limited transit schedules, like express routes that only travel in one direction at cer- tain times during the day. 1 TL1-C- 3 Identify and implement micro -transit options as appropriate to improve access to and accessibility of transit system for portions of the community not yet well served, partic- ularly serving vulnerable populations. 1 TL1-C- 4 Collaborate with Bloomington businesses to promote and expand on the Guaranteed Ride Home program, and expand participation in the Employer Sponsored Pass pro- gram for workplaces to purchase bus passes for employees, students, etc. 2 TL1-C- 5 Improve efficiency, convenience, and reliability of bus service and infrastructure (dedicated lanes). Increase bus frequency, establish dedicated bus routes, and create high -frequency rapid transit in corridors to improve \"time equity / parity\" of the route transit time with what it would be to drive a car. Prioritization to be given on routes serving the city 's many employment centers and areas with higher shares of vulnerable populations. 2 TL1-C- 6 Prioritize transit -oriented development, as defined by the Bloomington Unified Devel- opment Ordinance, along existing and planned transit stops and along primary transit corridors . 3 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 23 Transportation and Land Use Strategy TL 1 -D: Increase shared mobility (carpooling) utilization by 3% of work commute trips. How We'll Measure Progress: Reported public transit commuter data \u2014US Census, Annual VMT data reported Shared mobility can broadly be as transportation services and resources that are shared among users, either concurrently or one after another. This broader definition includes micro mobility (bike sharing, scooter sharing); automobile -based modes (carsharing, rides on demand, and micro transit); and commute -based modes or ridesharing (carpooling and vanpooling). According to the US Census, workers commuting via carpooling has re- mained consistently near the 9% level since 2013. Increased carpooling for individuals requiring similar commute routes directly reduces annual VMT and GHG emissions. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Improved Social Connectivity Improved Quality of Life Reduced Costs Reduced GHG Emissions TL1-D- 1 Outline clear policies for electric bikes, skateboards and scooters on city bike lanes, paths and trails. Establish a communication campaign to effectively reach users. 1 TL1-D- 2 Establish a subsidy / incentive for EV car sharing services with the goal of increasing car share coverage, particularly among vulnerable populations and those without current vehicle access. Qualifying programs must use plug in EV's or other law and no -carbon vehicle alternatives only. 1 TL1-D- 3 Establish a communication campaign to effectively reach users to promote electric bi- cycle , skateboard, and scooter policies and promote use. 2 TL1-D- 4 Establish a minimum of 2 EV car sharing locations in the City by 2023. 2 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 24 Transportation and Land Use Actions Implementation Phase TL1-E- 1 Encourage development of accessory dwelling units (\"ADU\") to create additional legal ADUs compatible with residential neighborhoods. This will add additional housing op- tions for the City 's workforce, seniors, families with changing needs, and others for whom ADUs present an affordable housing option . 1 TL1-E- 2 Reevaluate minimum parking requirements in the Unified Development Ordinance as listed in Table 04 -9: Minimum Vehicle Parking Requirements. Require parking for all modes of travel in project design, as appropriate . 1 TL1-E- 3 Continue assessment and review of Unified Development Ordinance for identification of zoning modifications to encourage appropriate increased density, increased commu- nity \"walkability,\" and decreased reliance on automobile use. 1 TL1-E- 4 Conduct a Development Study to identify and prioritize available sites for redevelop- ment and in -fill development to advance City's walkability, bikeability, and transit utili- zation. Study should include a review of under utilized surface parking infrastructure capable of being redeveloped. 2 TL1-E- 5 Issue competitive redevelopment Request for Proposals based on findings and recom- mendations of Development Study to encouraging high quality mixed use redevelop- ment on redevelopment, infill properties and existing surface parking lots within down- town district. RFP's should focus on equity, affordability, livability, and compliance/ support of Climate Action Plan goals. 2 TL1-E- 6 Implement form -based code along transportation corridors with goal of improved pe- destrian experience (frequent access points, greenspace). 2 TL1-E- 7 Establish an ordinance to require developers and landlords to \"unbundle \" parking from rent structures. Policy should focus on maintaining transit and transportation equity. Resource: 8 Improve the city 's average Walkscore from 43 to 60 by 2030. Collaborate with WalkScore for data analysis and identification of high -impact actions to increase score. (https://www.walkscore.com/professional/research.php ) 3 Strategy TL 1 -E: Encourage density and increase housing options and afforda- bility with the goal of increasing gross density by 3% of 2018 values. How We'll Measure Progress: Reported population per square mile of devel- oped land Residential density in the City of Bloomington ranges from 700 people per square mile to over 19,300, with an average of approximately 3,600 people per square mile. When well -planned, increased density means shorter commutes, better \"walkability\" between home and a range of destinations, reinforced public transit corridor utilization, increased housing near jobs and community resources, and overall increased quality of life for residents. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Reduced GHG Emissions Reduced Traffic Congestion Bloomington Climate Action Plan 25 Transportation and Land Use Actions Implementation Phase Strategy TL 1 -F: Build Complete Streets; goal 10% increase in Complete Street coverage by 2030. How We'll Measure Progress: Reported Complete Street status Complete Streets are streets designed and operated to enable safe use and support mobility for all users of all ages and abilities and all modes of travel including pedestrians, bicyclists, scooter riders, public transportation riders, and drivers of other motorized vehicles. Complete Street strategies address a wide range of elements, such as sidewalks, bicycle lanes, bus lanes, public transportation stops, crossing opportunities, median islands, accessible pedestrian signals, curb extensions, modified vehicle travel lanes, streetscape, and landscape treatments. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Improved Social Connectivity Improved Quality of Life Reduced Costs Reduced GHG Emissions TL1-F- 1 Review, modify, and adopt a revised BMCMPO Complete Streets Policy to add criteria and review procedures for City funded projects. Include in the review and modification an assessment of national best practices in support of achieving the goals of the Cli- mate Action Plan. Resource: 2018 MPO Complete Streets Policy 1 TL1-F- 2 Conduct a Sidewalk and Bike Path Quality Assessment and Master Plan to identify needs to accelerate bike paths, building sidewalks, crosswalks, and other walking infra- structure, particularly in high -need areas and areas serving vulnerable populations. Create an implementation plan establishing annual increases in the total miles of side- walks, on -road bicycle lanes and multi -use paths. Resources: 2020 City Council Side- walk Reports, 2018 City Sidewalk, Curbs, and Accessible Curb Ramps Condition Report 1 TL1-F- 3 Establish a method for projecting the lifecycle carbon emissions of land use and trans- portation investments associated with the City's Transportation Plan and Transporta- tion Improvement Program including consideration of embodied energy, operations and maintenance (see City of Eau Claire WI Land Use Carbon Calculator). 2 TL1-F- 4 Adopt project review criteria for City transportation projects that align with and com- plement the MPO Complete Streets policy and prioritize low carbon modes of trans- portation, including, but not limited to pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transit infra- structure. 2 TL1-F- 5 Align City's Transportation Plan and Transportation Improvement Program regional mode share targets with carbon reduction targets and encourage the development of mode share goals specific to the varying community needs and transit infrastructure around the region. 2 TL1-F- 6 Explore establishing a tiered bike infrastructure improvement approach which include adding trees and green stormwater infrastructure whenever possible/ prioritized. 3 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 26 Transportation and Land Use Actions Implementation Phase Strategy TL 1 -G: Increase pedestrian access and safety. How We'll Measure Progress: Reported walking and biking commuter data, reported pedestrian and bike accidents Walking is a basic and common mode of transport in all societies around the world. Virtually every trip begins and ends with walking. Beyond the environmental and GHG emission reduction benefits, increased walking has well established health benefits such as increasing physical activity that may lead to reduced cardiovascular and obesity -related diseases. According to the World Health Organization \"Pedestrian safety measures improve walk- ing environments and contribute to urban renewal, local economic growth, social cohesion, improved air quality and reduction in the harmful effects of traffic noise.\" Co-Benefits of Strategy: Safer Streets Improved Mobility TL1-G- 1 Implement improvement recommendations of the 2019 Transit Stop Safety and Acces- sibility Assessment. 1 TL1-G- 2 Create and implement a 5 year transportation funding plan that matches the MPO Metropolitan Transportation Plan and 2019 Transportation Plan. 1 TL1-G- 3 Establish an implementation plan for the redesign of roads to be safer for people in- cluding road width reductions on all four -lane city streets as well as on multi -lane on - way streets, installing curb extensions, and refuge medians. 2 TL1-G- 4 Develop a Safe Routes To Schools Implementation Plan (SRTS) for all schools within the City. Plan implementation should focus on infrastructure and policy changes as well as education and encouragement. 2 TL1-G- 5 Prioritize transportation funding for Vision Zero engineering improvement projects paired with VMT reduction strategies to create safe streets for people walking, biking and riding transit. 2 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 27 Transportation and Land Use Actions Implementation Phase Strategy TL 1 -H: Reduce commercial/industrial vehicle use by 8% of 2018 val- ues How We'll Measure Progress: Reported commercial and industrial VMT Commercial and Industrial vehicle use makes up an estimated 10% of city - wide VMT according to the City of Bloomington 2018 Greenhouse Gas In- ventory. Utilization of low -carbon goods movement alternatives and fleet utilization optimization can support the reduction of commercial vehicle miles traveled and increase commercial/industrial profitability. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Improved Air Quality Reduced GHG Emissions TL1-H- 1 Establish an Electric Vehicle Suitability and Fleet Optimization Study utilizing fleet moni- toring technology to assess fleets for alternative fuel suitability as well as identify fleet optimization management options for reduced VMT. (https://www.geotab.com/fleet - management -solutions/evsa/ ) Include City's fleet in program efforts. Goal: Achieve 6 fleet assessments annually. 1 TL1-H- 2 Collaborate with the Bloomington Chamber of Commerce, Downtown Bloomington, community businesses, and Indiana University to conduct a study identifying the ad- vantages/disadvantages, and lessons learned by businesses in the community related to use of video/remote meetings in lieu of business travel for meetings and events. Based on findings of the study, establish, distribute, and promote a \"best practices\" guide outlining the opportunities for operational savings and reduced vehicle use and encouraging effective, long -term increased remote meeting technologies. Establish a freight committee as part of an existing MPO committee as noted in the Metropolitan Transportation Plan. 2 TL1-H- 3 Collaborate with partners including Indiana Railroad, Monroe County, and Bloomington Chamber of Commerce, and Indiana University to assess railroad infrastructure and Bloomington business community transportation needs, identify rail freight system and service improvements to increase utilization and encourage rail system owners to make improvements. 2 TL1-H- 4 Establish a freight committee as part of an existing MPO committee as noted in the Metropolitan Transportation Plan. 2 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 28 Transportation and Land Use Actions Implementation Phase Strategy TL 1 -I: Reduce citywide off -road and lawn equipment annual emis- sions to below 35,000 metric tons . (equipment includes gas and diesel powered construction equipment, recreational equipment, and lawn equipment) How We'll Measure Progress: City electric off -road equipment adoption rate, policy adoption status Emissions from off -road equipment like construction and lawn equipment comprise a significant portion of fossil fuel consumption in Bloomington. Reduction of fossil fuel off -road equipment use is associated with improved emissions as well as improved air quality, particularly for the users of the equipment. https://www.edmunds.com/car -reviews/features/emissions - test-car-vs-truck -vs-leaf-blower.html Co-Benefits of Strategy: TL1-I- 1 Introduce a policy to replace City off -road and lawn equipment with electric and low - carbon fuel alternative options at the time of replacement with traditional internal com- bustion engine (ICE) as optional requiring proof of need. Establish emissions standards, testing and biofuel preference for any combustion vehicles remaining in the equipment fleet. Encourage County, School District, and Indiana University to develop and imple- ment their own policies. 1 TL1-I- 2 Develop an incentive program to convert fuel -burning lawn equipment such as gas - powered lawn mowers and blowers to electric. Coordinate with Duke Energy for sup- port and identification of additional rebate programs to promote electric yard equip- ment. 2 TL1-I- 3 Establish a gas powered lawn equipment phase -out ordinance transitioning to lawn equipment powered by electricity or alternative clean fuels and decreased noise pollu- tion levels. 2 TL1-I- 4 Develop an incentive program to convert fuel -burning lawn equipment such as gas - powered lawn mowers and blowers to electric. Coordinate with Duke Energy for sup- port and identification of additional rebate programs to promote electric yard equip- ment. 2 Improved Air Quality Reduced GHG Emissions Bloomington Climate Action Plan 29 Transportation and Land Use Goal TL 2 Support and encourage electric vehicle adoption, achieve 30% of vehicles sold and 15% of VMT community -wide by 2030. Strategy TL 2 -A: Transition City fleet to electric vehicle and alternative fuels (hybrid/ hybrid electric, plug in hybrid electric). How We'll Measure Progress: Reported number of electric vehicles within fleet Adoption of electric and other alternative no -fossil -fuel vehicles is a core requirement of reducing GHG emissions associated with City operations. Beyond reduced emissions, electrification of municipal fleets have a num- ber of benefits, including improved air quality, decreased fuel costs, de- creased maintenance requirements, and even improved driver safety. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Reduced Costs Actions Implementation Phase Reduced Pollution TL2-A- 1 Introduce a policy to replace City fleet vehicles and buses with electric and hybrid op- tions at the time of replacement, and require emissions standards, testing and biofuel preference for any combustion vehicles remaining in the fleet. 1 TL2-A- 2 Conduct a municipal fleet inventory and EV Implementation plan. Effort to identify op- portunities for electrifying, right -sizing, and improving overall efficiency of vehicles to meet CAP Goals. Include implementation recommendations to incorporate EV's through right -timing purchases with a planned vehicle -replacement schedule. 2 Reduced GHG Emissions Improved Air Quality Actions Implementation Phase Strategy TL 2 -B: Support and encourage electric vehicle and alternative fuel (hybrid/ hybrid electric, plug in hybrid electric) vehicle adop- tion citywide. How We'll Measure Progress: Registered EV vehicles citywide Electric vehicles (EVs) are a critical component of meeting Bloomington's long -range emission reduction goals, in fact, meeting those goals will not be possible without a transition to alternative fuel vehicles. While no green- house gas emissions directly come from the \"tailpipes \" of EV, short -term transition to EVs in Bloomington will have limited overall emissions de- crease due to the relatively high emissions factor associated with Blooming- ton area electrical generation which is still significantly produced from fossil fuels. However, the GHG reduction benefits of EVs will continue to rapidly increase in the Bloomington area as electric grid goals are achieved. Addi- tionally, other co -benefits of EV transition such as lowered vehicle opera- tion costs and improved local air quality will be leveraged even in early tran- sitions. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Bloomington Climate Action Plan 30 Transportation and Land Use TL2-B- 1 Coordinate with Monroe County and State of Indiana to establish an annual auto regis- tration reporting process to monitor the adoption rate of electric vehicles in the City. 1 TL2-B- 2 Create an Electric Vehicle (EV) Action Plan to guide access to chargers on City property and citywide, explore alternative technologies like smart cable technology and street- light/EV charger integration, address barriers to charging for garage -free homes and rental properties, increase use of EVs in car sharing programs, assess options to lower EV and EV charger implementation costs, and recommend EV charging station require- ment amendments to the Unified Development Ordinance to support EV plan. Coordi- nate with ERI or Purdue to establish tracking of EV registration within the community. 1 TL2-B- 3 Support electric car charging station infrastructure in new commercial and multifamily housing during the initial construction phase by providing information on appropriate conduit and electrical panel considerations as a part of permit application process. Collaborate with electric utility to develop and provide information on utility, local, State, and Federal incentives supporting EV infrastructure. 1 TL2-B- 4 Incentivize the purchase of electric vehicles through rebates on vehicles and/or resi- dential chargers. Work with utility company on this program.

Changes in business -as-usual impacts are anticipated to reduce an additional 21,437 metric tons for a total community wide transportation sector reduction of 25% over 2018 levels. This is equivalent to eliminating 970 mil- lion cubic feet of man -made greenhouse gas atmosphere annually by 2030. Sector Emissions Reduction below 2018 Achieved by 2030 The total change to sector emissions in- clude CAP Plan reductions as well as BAU emission changes as follows: Individual Strategy Annual Emission Reductions by 2030 Below are the CAP Plan reductions by strategy for this sector: 14% CAP Reductions 11% BAU Reductions Remaining is 25% Below 2018 * Transportation and Land Use Reduction totals under Planned Sector Emission Reductions Through 2030 exclude emissions and sa vings from offroad transportation. Offroad transportation emissions were modeled at 50,202 MTCO2e in the 2018 inventory, but furthe r study is needed to verify these emissions for Bloomington. The offroad transportation climate strategy aims to reduce these t o 35,000 MTCOe2 or less by 2030. Transportation and Land Use Estimated Cumulative Economic Savings Implementing many of the measures in this plan, such as reduction of single -occupancy auto use, can save money for the community. The estimated community savings of the goals for this section include: Bloomington Climate Action Plan 32 Goal TL1 Decrease VMT by 8%: $81,512,30 $958 per capita to 15% of VMT $20,424,533 household = Estimated Cumulative Savings Potential* $101,936,832 $1,198 per capita * Savings for Goal TL1 are based on multiplying the estimated vehicle miles saved by AAA calculated auto use cost per mile and 2020 Bloomington Transit pass costs. Savings for Goal TL2 are calculated based on multiply- ing the estimated vehicle miles switching from gas/diesel fuel vehicle by the sum of the AAA calculated gas/ diesel auto use cost per mile subtracting the EPA estimated EV auto use cost per mile.

Transportation and Land Use Section 03 Energy and Built Environment Click here to return to TOC 35 Climate Impacts Climate This sector impacts climate change through the com- bustion of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, heating oil, propane) to generate electricity and heat/cool our buildings. Hazards to Energy and Built Environment include damage to buildings and energy grid infrastructure from extreme weather and flooding, increased pow- er outages, and increased energy demand and cost expenditure due to rising temperatures and weather variability. Energy and Built Environment Why Energy and Built Environment Is Important Building construction and operations can have extensive direct and indirect impacts on the environment, socie- ty, and economy. Buildings use significant resources (energy, water, raw materials, etc.), generate waste (occupant, construction, and demolition), emit potentially harmful atmospheric emissions, fundamentally change the function of land, and the ability of that land to absorb and manage water. Building energy use is a major contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Building Energy sector in- cludes all residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. Greenhouse gas emissions from this sector come from direct emissions - from fossil fuels burned on-site for heating or cooking needs - as well as indirect emis- sions - from fossil fuels burned off-site in order to supply that building with electricity. Building design plays a large role in determining the future efficiency and comfort of facilities. Increasing energy efficiency can help reduce GHG emissions and result in significant cost savings for both homes and businesses. The Bloomington community can also achieve environmental, social, and economic benefits through enhancements to the built environment. The Energy and Built Environment (including IU Power Plant) is 77% of citywide GHG emissions for the City of Bloomington. Within this sector, the share of residential consumption is 38%, commercial and government buildings is 44%, and industrial share is 18%. The current fuel mix used to generate electricity by the electricity utility serving the community, Duke Energy, is heavily coal based with over 61% derived from coal, 37% from natural gas, and less than 1% combined for hydro, wind, and solar. According to Duke Energy 's 2018 Integrated Resource Plan, the projected energy mix of their portfolio is anticipated to decrease reliance on coal, with a significant increase in natural gas and some increase in solar and wind through 2037. This planned shift in energy portfolio will help contribute to Bloom- ington 's GHG reduction goals, however, will not be enough to meet the reductions needed. Advancing significant GHG emission reductions in the Energy and Built Environment sector will require a focus on reduced coal and fossil fuel use in the generation of electricity and building heating systems. The success of Duke Energy in reducing the use of fossil fuel use for the generation of grid electricity, increased implementa- tion of distributed (on -site) renewable energy citywide, and improved energy efficiency will be key in Bloom- ington reaching its goal to reduce city -wide GHG emissions 25% below 2018 levels by 2030. Climate Change Considerations Bloomington Climate Action Plan 36 Energy and Built Environment Equity Considerations Families that live in properties that are not energy efficient are also those that can least afford high -cost utili- ty bills. These households may lack the ability to pay for energy efficiency improvements or access renewable energy options. Renters of both single family homes as well as multi -family housing usually do not have the ability to imple- ment energy efficiency measures to the buildings they live in to gain the benefits of energy efficiency. Energy efficiency retrofits are typically in the hands of the landlord while the costs associated with the resulting en- ergy use are usually paid by the occupant. Families with fewer resources must dedicate a disproportionately larger share of their income towards ener- gy costs, which exacerbates other vulnerabilities including exposure to heatwaves and other climate vulnera- bilities. These same families are sometimes forced to forego basic access to service altogether - an estimated 70 households in Bloomington go without heating fuel of any type (US Census heating fuel utilization data). Sector Goals Sector goals are established to both support the City's Climate Action Plan in creating a climate re- silient community and to reduce city -wide GHG emissions 25% below 2018 levels by 2030. Sector goals related to GHG emissions reductions are designed to balance reduction across all sec- tors and achieve the overall emissions goals set forth for the community. The goals seek to strike a balance between achievability while also reach- ing for improvement beyond business -as-usual. As indicated in the introduction, the Climate Action Plan is intended to be a 10 year plan to be updated at the completion of that time. Consequently, the goals and strategies outlined in this section are intended to be achieved by 2030 unless otherwise noted. Implementation of actions are anticipated to be initiated over 3 phases: phase 1 within 1 -3 years, phase 2 within 2 -5 years, and phase 3 within 4 -8 years of CAP approval. Bloomington Climate Action Plan 37 Goal EB 1 Increase distributed renewable energy to 250,000 MWH of total generation annually by 2030. Goal EB 2 Increase energy efficiency citywide 16% for electricity and 12% for natural gas of 2018 values. Goal EB 3 Support decarbonization of the local electricity grid. Goal EB 4 Promote \"fuel switching\" to reduce on -site fossil fuel use in the building sector by 3% of 2018 values.

Bloomington Climate Action Plan 38 Energy and Built Environment Goal EB 1 Increase distributed renewable energy to 250,000 MWH of total generation annually by 2030. Strategy EB 1 -A: Increase solar on City facilities 20% by 2030. How We'll Measure Progress: Total on -site renewable energy installed, re- newable energy credits (REC) purchased The City of Bloomington is a leader in on -site solar installations in the region with solar installed on 32 of the City's facilities and sites. City solar arrays generated 3 GWH of electricity in 2019, or approximately 70% of City build- ing electricity consumption in 2018 (excluding water and wastewater pro- cessing). Identifying additional solar installation potential, including ground mounted arrays, \"carport\" arrays, and remaining cost effective rooftop ar- ray locations can increase the City's renewable energy portfolio. An in- crease of 20% on -site solar generation would result in 80% carbon -free City facility electric consumption. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Reduced Costs Improved Energy Resilience Jobs / Economic Development Reduced GHG Emissions EB1-A- 1 Conduct a detailed \"Renewable Energy Master Plan\" for all primary city facilities which have not yet already achieved renewable energy meeting 100% annual energy de- mand. Plan to incorporate strategies to address electricity storage, energy resilience, emergency operations, explore virtual net metering with Duke Energy, and provide an implementation plan to achieve on -site renewable energy goal and outline options to achieve 100% renewable energy for all city facilities (on -site and off site options). 1 EB1-A- 2 Establish a policy which requires all new construction and significant renovation pro- jects for City facilities to be constructed to meet \"Solar Ready\" requirements and to include a solar feasibility assessment and project option for inclusion of on -site solar, include \"Return on Investment\" assessment, and incorporate solar where return is favorable. See City's Solar Reay Guidelines: https://palebluedot.llc/bloomington -solar - ready -guide 1 EB1-A- 3 Study City facilities and potential partner entities to identify low -carbon district heating and cooling systems and Solar+Storage microgrid project options and select, by 2024, a project to implement as a pilot project. 2 Strategy EB 1 -B: Support and accelerate installation of on -site solar PV to 250,000 MWH of total generation citywide annually by 2030. How We'll Measure Progress: Total citywide on -site renewable energy in- stalled As of 2019, over 538 solar PV's have been installed in Monroe County for a total of 6.04 megawatts (MW) in nameplate generating capacity, the major- ity of which are within the City of Bloomington. Based on Monroe County permit data 2020 , Residential arrays are 44%, government facility arrays are 39%, commercial, non -profit, and industrial arrays total 11.6%, and utility solar installations are 5.4% of the total existing installed capacity. Fewer than 1.5% of households and 1.75% of commercial/industrial establish- ments have on -site solar installed indicating significant opportunity for in- creasing on -site solar installations citywide. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Reduced Costs Improved Energy Resilience Jobs / Economic Development Reduced GHG Emissions Energy and Built Environment Bloomington Climate Action Plan 39 Actions Implementation Phase EB1-B- 1 Identify the \"Solar Top 50\" commercial/industrial properties within the city and pro- duce detailed solar feasibility assessments for each site.

Completing SolSmart designation can help municipalities simplify and making approval processes more efficient which, in turn, reduces costs for solar developers, installers, and City operations. In addition, policies which protect the ability of one property to continue to receive sunlight across property lines without obstruction from another 's property are critical to ensure long -term viability of solar resources for property owners. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Reduced GHG Emissions Reduced Costs Improved Energy Resilience Improved Community Equity EB1-C- 1 Streamline and offer expedited permitting for renewable energy installations. 1 EB1-C- 2 Complete the SolSmart process to streamline permitting for renewable energy installa- tions and assist in reducing solar project \"soft costs\" related to City solar processes.

Strategy EB 2 -A: Increase total City owned building electrical energy efficiency 16% for electricity and 12% for natural gas of 2018 values. How We'll Measure Progress: Annual City operated facility electricity and natural gas consumption reported The City of Bloomington is a leader in on -site solar installations in the region with solar installed on 32 of the City's facilities and sites. City solar arrays generated 3 GWH of electricity in 2019, or approximately 70% of City build- ing electricity consumption in 2018 (excluding water and wastewater pro- cessing).

Provide training to all existing city employees and provide on -going training to all new city hires. https://sftool.gov/learn/about/426/ plug -loads 2 Strategy EB 2 -B: Support and accelerate energy efficiency citywide. How We'll Measure Progress: Annual citywide electricity and natural gas con- sumption reported Compared to State of Indiana averages, electric consumption in Blooming- ton is 142% of the residential average (per household) and 87% of the com- mercial and industrial average (per job) while natural gas consumption is 76% of the residential average and 8% of the commercial and industrial average. According to the US Energy Information Administration, homes built after 2000 used 15% - 40% less energy than homes built before 1990. Nearly 60% of all homes in Bloomington were built prior to 1990. The devi- ation from State averages, combined with a large share of older homes in the community, indicate that significant energy savings are likely possible in all sectors, making energy efficiency an important strategy for reducing building and energy emissions. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase EB2-B- 1 Adopt, implement, and promote a Commercial Building Energy Benchmarking and Dis- closure ordinance for all public buildings and all commercial buildings 30,000 square feet and larger. 2 Work with utilities to incentivize and promote replacement of inefficient building heating and cooling equipment before end -of-life, and facilitate the bulk purchasing of efficient equipment.

How We'll Measure Progress: Reported certified net zero homes Net zero buildings are buildings with high energy efficiency that produce as much on -site renewable energy as they consume in a year. Net zero build- ings tend to be high performance buildings that provide a higher level of occupant comfort and building health. According to a 2019 study by the Rocky Mountain Institute, net zero homes in the Indiana region average a return on investment of 12 years or less - after which they deliver \"free\" energy to their owners. As a part of this Climate Action Plan, a Net Zero Energy Guide and Solar Ready guide have been developed to assist Bloom- ington homeowners and commercial building owners in exploring and achieving a Net Zero building.

Strategy EB 3 -A: Support Duke Energy's grid emissions goal of 50% below 2005 levels by 2030. How We'll Measure Progress: Reported annual electric grid GHG Emissions Factors The electric utility serving Bloomington, Duke Energy, has established a goal of reducing the GHG emissions associated with their electricity 50% by 2030 and to achieve net zero by 2050. Implementation of this goal by Duke Ener- gy is critical in achieving the overall GHG emission reduction goals repre- sented in this Climate Action Plan - should Duke Energy not accomplish this grid emission goal it could mean additional GHG emissions of 520,000 met- ric tons or Reduced GHG Emissions Improved Air Quality EB3-A- 1 Collaborate with Duke Energy for the development of a pilot/demonstration communi- ty solar program achieving a total of 7,000 MWH in subscribed annual community solar energy by 2030. Identify underutilized sites such as landfill, brownfield, superfund sites, or detention pond sites (for floating solar) and identify most advantageous site to develop and install pilot solar garden. Collaboratively develop and issue an RFP for community solar developers to advance community solar options and subscriptions within City. RFP shall focus on projects that benefit all residents, particularly communi- ties of color and low -income populations. Include community solar option benefiting small businesses. (Goal: 500 households and 200 businesses subscribed to community solar by 2030) (example projects at superfund sites: https://www.epa.gov/superfund - redevelopment -initiative/alternative -energy -superfund -sites) 1 EB3-A- 2 Collaborate with Duke Energy to develop a pilot / demonstration solar lease program for photovoltaic on buildings connected via net metering open to Duke and third party vendors. 2 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 45 Energy and Built Environment Strategy EB 3 -B: Advocate for stronger State policy. How We'll Measure Progress: Status of State energy efficiency and renewable energy policies Surrounding states have shown that policies such as the allowance of Prop- erty Assisted Clean Energy (PACE) programs, and improved solar policies such as allowance of Power Purchase Agreements, Solar Lease agreements, virtual net metering, aggregated net metering, and community solar laws can help \"level the playing field\" for improved energy efficiency and renew- able energy. Collaborations with other communities and non-profit groups to help educate and guide State leaders towards making improved policy decisions can play a critical role in meeting Bloomington's goals. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Jobs / Economic Development Improved Quality of Life Reduced GHG Emissions Improved Community Equity Actions Implementation Phase EB3-B- 1 Collaborate with other communities, industry, and state agencies to support the State establishing the enabling legislation for Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C -PACE) and Residential Property Assisted Clean Energy (R -PACE) financing. 1 EB3-B- 2 Collaborate with other communities, industry, and state agencies to support the State in establishing policies and laws to expand the market for renewable energy, make it easier for large multi -family, commercial, and industrial customers to benefit from re- newable energy (e.g. feed -in tariff, Power Purchase Agreements, Solar Lease agree- ments, roof space rental, community solar, virtual net metering, aggregated net meter- ing, etc.) Include information on current State of Indiana related regulations and cost and payback information. 1 EB3-B- 3 Collaborate with other communities, industry, and state agencies to support the State advancing increased energy efficiency building code requirements, establishing mini- mum energy performance requirements, net zero considerations and/or the establish- ment legislation enabling cities to establish \"stretch codes\" within their jurisdiction. 3 Actions Implementation Phase Reduced GHG Emissions Improved Air Quality EB4-A- 1 Conduct an \"Electrification Assessment and Action Plan\" to outline actions and priori- ties for electrification of all City facilities to move towards zero on -site fossil fuel com- bustion. Work with regional energy partnerships to implement Plan for all City facili- ties. Include new and existing buildings, explore strategies to address electricity stor- age, and create a case study to highlight and share challenges, solutions, and lessons learned to share with the broader community. 1 EB4-A- 2 Explore the establishment of polices or ordinances supporting all electric buildings, such as an all electric requirement for buildings receiving PUD or Conditional Use Per- mit approvals, an all electric reach code such as Menlo Park, or a natural gas ban such as Berkeley. 3 EB4-A- 3 Deploy an incentive program for electrification. Work with Duke Energy or other re- gional partnerships to create financial incentives to electrify new and existing buildings. For example, rebates for panel upgrades, electric appliances, electric water heaters, Air Source Heat Pumps, and Ground Source Heat Pumps can encourage the transition to electric energy use in homes and businesses. Goal: Goal 3% residential market conver- sion (90 households annually) and 3% commercial/industrial market conversion (an estimated 15 commercial businesses, 3 industrial businesses annually) by 2030. Collab- orate with program partners to quantify potential cost savings of electrification and provide ROI information to potential program participants. 3 Energy and Built Environment Bloomington Climate Action Plan 46 Goal EB 4 Promote \"fuel switching\" to reduce on -site fossil fuel use in the building sector by 3% of 2018 values. Strategy EB 4 -A: Support and accelerate electrification of on -site fossil fuel combustion systems citywide by 2% of 2018 consumption lev- els (natural gas, propane, fuel oil, etc). How We'll Measure Progress: Reported Natural Gas consumption citywide, US Census data on homes using electric fuel for heating. The reduction and elimination of on -site fossil fuel combustion community - wide is a critical long -term pathway towards GHG emission reductions. As the Bloomington area electric grid becomes cleaner (see goal EB3), the ben- efits of electrification will become more and more meaningful. According to US Census data, over 50% of Bloomington homes use electric heat, while technologies like conduction cook tops illustrate the effectiveness and im- proved safety of electricity in lieu of natural gas. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Energy and Built Environment Bloomington Climate Action Plan 47 Strategy EB 4 -B: Support and accelerate low/no carbon alternatives to on -site fossil fuel combustion by 1% of 2018 consumption levels (natural gas, propane, fuel oil, etc). How We'll Measure Progress: Status of State energy efficiency and renewable energy policies Renewable Natural Gas, RNG, is natural gas derived from organic waste material found in daily life such as food waste, garden and lawn clippings, and animal and plant -based material. RNG is considered a carbon -neutral fuel because it comes from organic sources that once absorbed carbon di- oxide from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. RNG has even greater benefits when it 's produced from organic waste that would otherwise de- cay and create methane emissions. In addition, RNG utilization provides a beneficial pathway for waste streams. Although combustion of biofuels and RNG does emit CO2 they are considered low or no -carbon fuels. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon that has been locked up in the ground for mil- lions of years, while burning biomass emits carbon that is part of the bio- genic carbon cycle. In other words, fossil fuel use increases the total amount of carbon in the biosphere -atmosphere system while bioenergy systems operates within this system; biomass combustion simply returns to the atmosphere the carbon that was absorbed as the plants grew.

Strategy EB 5 -A: Promote Equity in Energy and Resource Costs and Ownership. How We'll Measure Progress: Reported Natural Gas consumption citywide, US Census data on homes using electric fuel for heating Low income communities are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, the most likely to struggle with housing cost burdens, and the most likely to struggle with energy insecurity - low-income families are adversely impacted by rising utility costs with the poorest families spending between 7.2% and 10% of their incomes on electricity, while the average household pays less than half of that amount, or only 3.5% of their income on electricity. Low income households are also nearly 3 times more likely to rent rather than own their home (https://www.zillow.com/research/ homeownership -by-income -9419/ ), meaning they have much less control over the energy efficiency of their home. In recent studies, American Council for an Energy -Efficient Economy (ACEEE) found that 97 percent of the excess energy burdens within renter households could be eliminated by bringing their homes up to median effi- ciency standards while a 2015 study by the U.S. Department of Energy found that the value of energy upgrades is 2.2 times their cost. The less energy efficient a building is, the higher that value to cost ratio becomes. Supporting pathways to create equity in energy alleviates energy burdens for those that need relief the most as well as expands the market for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments.

Planned Energy and Built Environment GHG Emission Reductions Planned Sector Emission Reductions Through 2030 The strategies and actions included in this section of the Climate Action Plan are pro- jected to reduce the city 's annual GHG emissions by 171,373 metric tons (MT) by 2030 - a 17% reduction over 2018 levels. Changes in business -as-usual impacts are anticipated to reduce an additional 131,458 metric tons for a total communi- ty wide building and energy sector reduc- tion of 29% over 2018 levels. This is equivalent to eliminating 5.87 bil- lion cubic feet of man -made greenhouse gas atmosphere annually by 2030.

Hazards to the waste management system include damage to infrastructure from extreme weather and flooding . Opportunities As indicated in the Waste Diversion Potential dia- gram above, a significant portion of Blooming- ton's waste stream has the potential for being put to beneficial use while avoiding GHG emissions. Waste Management Why Waste Management Is Important In Bloomington, solid waste contributed 6.3% of citywide greenhouse gas emissions in 2018. Municipal solid waste sector has great potential to avoid emissions thanks to waste reduction and waste recovery. Landfills are the third largest anthropogenic (man -made) source of methane, accounting for approximately 11% of the esti- mated total global methane emissions. Habitat destruction, global warming, and resource depletion are some of the effects of our materials consump- tion. Recycling - converting discarded materials into new materials or putting them to beneficial use - is an im- portant approach in mitigating these impacts and reducing the pollution caused by wasting. Recycling reduces the need for raw materials so that natural resources, and the environments in which they exist, can be pre- served. Recycling creates manufacturing jobs, extends the value of materials, and conserves natural resources while reducing the need for landfill space. Food discards and residuals that decompose in landfills release methane, a greenhouse gas that is at least 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide. This makes food waste a significant contributor to solid waste green- house gas emissions. On the other end of the food supply chain, food production accounts for 26% of global emissions. In the United States, approximately 30% of the food produced is wasted - meaning nearly 8% of US emissions come from the production and distribution of discarded food. There are four distinct collectors of mixed waste in Bloomington and Monroe County: Monroe County Solid Waste Management District (MCSWMD) drop -off centers, City residential collection, haulers contracted by In- diana University (IU), and other private collection. These waste management providers manage the waste sys- tem by collecting waste generated by businesses, industry, multi -family residences, and households. City of Bloomington Sanitation Department collects waste and recycling from single family homes, all other customers must drop off at the District or contract with a private hauler. According to the MCSWMD 2018 Mixed Waste Processing Feasibility Study, waste collection by hauler breaks down as 4% collected by the City, 6% associated with IU, 2% by the District, and 88% by private haulers. The report indicates that total county -wide mixed waste is over 118,000 tons and the City 's 2018 GHG inventory reports the Bloomington city -wide mixed waste total as 88,196 tons. Climate Change Considerations Bloomington Climate Action Plan 54 Waste Management Bloomington 2018 Solid Waste Characteristics The 2018 MCSWMD study included mixed waste characteristics studies by hauler type. For purposes of projecting the uncaptured potential within the Bloomington waste stream, we have chosen to use the waste characteristics for private haulers from that report as they comprise 88% of the waste stream and consequently the majority of the potential. Based on that data, shown on the chart below, 38.4% of Bloomington waste (city -wide private haulers) is compostable organics, 31.7% are recyclable materials, and 9% are potentially recoverable/reusable. Taken together, this indicates the waste stream has up to 79.1% which can be diverted to beneficial use. As stated in the study \"Private haulers are by far the largest untapped source of recyclable materials in the County. \" Mixed Solid Waste Composition Profile (Monroe County Private Hauler) Waste Diversion Potential The waste diversion potential indicated in the 2018 MCSWMD study is illustrated to the right. Of the total mixed solid waste being landfilled today, there is a potential of up to 38.4% organics which could be diverted or beneficially used, 31.7% potentially recycla- ble material, and 9% potentially recoverable material. Successfully diverting these re- sources would reduce solid waste being land- filled by up to 79.1%. Bloomington Climate Action Plan 55 9% Recoverable 31.7% Recyclable 38.4% Compostable 79.1% Diversion Potential Source: MCSWMD 2018 Mixed Waste Processing Feasibility Study Waste Management Equity Considerations Accessibility to recycling and composting programs may not be equally and readily available to all communi- ty residents and may also be impacted by other participation -related barriers, including awareness of pro- grams, user fees, accessibility based on housing type, and language barriers. Populations that are situated very close to the landfill or composting facility may experience nuisance issues like bad odors and potential health issues unless mitigation actions are implemented. Sector Goals Sector goals are established to both support the City's Climate Action Plan in creating a climate resilient community and to reduce city -wide GHG emissions 25% below 2018 levels by 2030. Sector goals related to GHG emissions reductions are designed to balance reduction across all sec- tors and achieve the overall emissions goals set forth for the community. The goals seek to strike a balance between achievability while also reach- ing for improvement beyond business -as-usual. As indicated in the introduction, the Climate Ac- tion Plan is intended to be a 10 year plan to be updated at the completion of that time. Consequently, the goals and strategies out- lined in this section are intended to be achieved by 2030 unless otherwise noted. Implementation of actions are anticipated to be initiated over 3 phases: phase 1 within 1 -3 years, phase 2 within 2 -5 years, and phase 3 within 4 -8 years of CAP approval.

Goal WM 2 Educate, motivate, and empower the public to achieve waste reduction and diversion. Waste Management Bloomington Climate Action Plan 57 Goal WM 1 Increase landfill solid waste diversion by 30% of 2018 val- ues (26,500 tons of waste reduction). Strategy WM 1 -A: Increase organics diversion by 40% of 2018 values (from 33,900 tons - 38.4% of community mixed waste based on pri- vate hauler data - to 20,300). How We'll Measure Progress: Reported organics processed at landfill, Waste mix reported by characteristics study All landscape organics collected at IU are composted at the IU nursery while food organics collected at IU and City of Bloomington Parks and Recreation are hauled to Green Earth by JB Disposal Services. Yard waste generated by City Parks and Recreation, as well as organics collected from private resi- dences and commercial customers is hauled by the private composting company, Earthkeepers, to Fable Farms. Compost drop off services are offered District owned facilities for those with an Earthkeepers subscription. According to the 2018 Mixed Waste Processing Feasibility Study, most com- postable waste is not being diverted from the landfill with the current sys- tem. Significant generators of food waste from non -residential sources in Bloomington include restaurants, grocery stores, food manufacturers, nurs- ing homes, schools, and hospitals. Restaurants and grocery stores alone account for 93 percent of food waste from non -residential sources and rep- resents a significant opportunity for improvement.

How We'll Measure Progress: Reported recyclable material processed at landfill, waste mix reported by characteristics study The District manages five drop off recycling centers throughout the County for use by its residents, as well as a pay as you throw and hazardous waste recycling program. Private haulers, such as Republic, also provide recycling services and collect comingled recyclables from for delivery to a material recovery facility in Indianapolis to be sorted, baled, shredded or granulated for purchase from brokers or end -user purchasers. If materials are not loose, clean, dry, or appropriately sorted, that decreases the feasibility of the items being recycled. Recyclable containers (plastic, metal, and glass) and recyclable paper items make up 31.7% of communitywide waste stream indicating a significant opportunity for increased diversion of mate- rials being landfilled and an opportunity for increased beneficial use. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Reduced GHG Emissions Actions Implementation Phase WM1 -B- 1 Ensure that recycling in schools, City buildings, public housing, and public spaces is fully implemented. Conduct a study to determine which facilities do not currently have re- cycling or could have recycling diversion significantly improved. Coordinate with those facilities to improve recycling participation. 1 WM1 -B- 2 Conduct outreach to determine what assistance may be needed to increase recycling, organics collection, and composting. 1 WM1 -B- 3 Incorporate criteria regarding recycled content and extended producer responsibility into procurement guidelines for City purchasing. 3 Jobs / Economic Development Bloomington Climate Action Plan 59 Waste Management Strategy WM 1 -C: Increase diversion of potential recoverables by 33% of 2018 values (from 8,000 tons - 9% of community mixed waste based on private hauler data - to 5,280). How We'll Measure Progress: Reported potential recoverable material pro- cessed at landfill, Waste mix reported by char- acteristics study Potentially recoverable materials are materials that have the potential to be recovered or recycled, but are not currently collected for recycling at the District 's collection centers or in the City 's single stream recycling program. Some of these materials, such as textiles/leather and construction and dem- olition debris, would require source separation and/or additional processing to recover, rather than recovery through mixed waste processing. Outreach and partnering with waste sources (businesses, households, etc.) to support the identification of recoverable materials and explore re -use and recycling pathways represent an opportunity to increase diversion of these materials.

How We'll Measure Progress: Status of Zero Waste policy, PAYT trash rate establishment, Universal Waste Ordinance, and other policies supporting significant waste di- version According to a 2011 study (\"Policy versus Practice in Municipal Solid Waste Diversion \" Canadian Journal of Urban Research), municipalities typically do not pursue policies supporting aggressive landfill diversion and increased beneficial use of waste streams until their landfill capacities reach crisis levels. Establishing visionary policies and operational refinements to ad- vance meaningful landfill diversion and beneficial use of waste streams, therefore, represents a significant environmental opportunity for Blooming- ton, as well as an opportunity to avoid long -term landfill capacity crisis and to model for other communities the benefit of visionary policy establish- ment in lieu of waste management by crisis management more frequently experienced by other communities. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Improved Quality of Life Improved Community Equity WM1 -D- 1 Establish a Zero Waste policy for City operations that outlines increasing incremental annual waste reduction goals charting a path to Zero Waste.

Example policy: https://bouldercolorado.gov/zero -waste/universal - zero -waste -ordinance 2 WM1 -D- 4 Increase recycling surcharge on landfill fees to develop more recycling programs. 2 WM1 -D- 5 Conduct an optimization study to increase the efficiency of City solid waste collections and transfer routes and implement findings. 3 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 61 Waste Management Strategy WM 1 -E: Expanded recycling and organics options for multi -family resi- dents. How We'll Measure Progress: Reported potential recoverable material pro- cessed at landfill, Waste mix reported by char- acteristics study According to the US Census, 49% of Bloomington 's residents live in multi- family buildings with 3 or more units. This very significant portion of the city's population represents an under -tapped waste diversion resource. If all multi -family households were able to participate in a recycling program, it would significantly reduce the city 's waste stream. Apartment recycling can also have real, tangible benefits for landlords, property managers and the tenant community including: reduced costs for trash pick -up, potential for additional revenue through sale of recoverable material, provide an amenity for residents and help landlords attract tenants. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Jobs / Economic Development Improved Quality of Life Improved Community Equity WM1 -E- 1 Based on results of outreach action WM1 -B-2, identify financial and other barriers to recycling and composting in multi -family buildings (e.g., different priorities between property management company and tenants, lack of knowledge of costs). 1 WM1 -E- 2 Based on results of outreach action WM1 -B-2, and action WM1 -E-1, explore creation of additional collection drop off sites. 1 WM1 -E- 3 Make a brochure that can be used by landlords to give info to their residents to assure developers and apartment owners help residents know about park locations, bike/ walk/transit info, sustainability goals and resources, trash and recycling opportunities, renewable energy options, incentives, etc. Brochure can be distributed as a part of the Rental Licensing program in addition to other avenues. Brochure should link to the most up -to-date information maintained on the https://bloomington.in.gov/ website 1 WM1 -E- 4 Developing a fiscal impact statement of expanding the organics and recycling program ordinance. Impact statement should compare implementation options such as offering multi -family residents opt -in pick up services, or an incremental implementation starting with smaller apartment complexes and gradually expanding to larger complex- es. 2 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 62 Waste Management Goal WM 2 Educate, motivate, and empower the public to achieve waste reduction and diversion. Strategy WM 2 -A: Create, implement, and promote public awareness and edu- cation campaigns. How We'll Measure Progress: Status of communication, marketing, and edu- cation campaigns Landfill alternatives have many benefits including GHG emissions reductions, utilization of beneficial materials, and potential for eco- nomic development. If community residents and businesses do not properly utilize these diversion programs or limit their consumption of disposable goods, the programs developed will make far less of an impact than they are capable of. A focus on a robust, clear, and con- sistent message to support education, awareness, and utilization of resources available can support achieving better success. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Reduced Costs Actions Implementation Phase Improved Quality of Life WM2 -A- 1 Create a comprehensive communication campaign to provide standardized in- formation and communications on waste reduction, recycling, and organics collection options to reach the residential sector.

N/A Planned Waste Management GHG Emission Reductions Planned Sector Emission Reductions Through 2030 The strategies and actions included in this section of the Climate Action Plan are pro- jected to reduce the city 's annual GHG emissions by 11,000 metric tons (MT) by 2030 - a 13% reduction over 2018 levels. Changes in business -as-usual impacts, however, are anticipated to increase emissions in this sector by 5,800 metric tons based on projected population in- creases. If population projections hold true, the resulting total community wide waste management sector reduction will be 6% over 2018 levels. This is equivalent to eliminating 99 million cubic feet of man -made greenhouse gas atmosphere annually by 2030. Sector Emissions Reduction below 2018 Achieved by 2030 The total change to sector emissions in- clude CAP Plan reductions as well as BAU emission changes as follows: Individual Strategy Annual Emission Reductions by 2030 Below are the CAP Plan reductions by strategy for this sector: 13% CAP Reductions +7% BAU Increase Remaining is 6% Below 2018 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 64 Waste Management Estimated Cumulative Economic Savings Implementing many of the measures in this plan, such as reduction of food waste, material waste, and overall consump- tion, can save money for the community. The estimated community savings of the goals for this section include: $77,608,211 $2,511 per household + Commercial/Industrial Waste Reduction Savings: $1,567,500 $33 per job = Estimated Cumulative Savings Potential $79,175,711 $930 per capita Organics/Food Waste Diversion Savings: *Savings for organics/food waste diversion are based on multiplying the estimated pounds of food waste re- duced by an estimated value per pound based on \"A Roadmap to Reduce US Food Waste \" by ReFED. Savings for commercial waste reduction are calculated based on multiplying the estimated number of participating or- ganizations by the average savings per company reported by the MN WasteWise program (a similar initiative). See Appendix for Cumulative Potential Cost Savings Assumptions and data sources. Bloomington Climate Action Plan 65 What You Can Do How much of your waste can you divert to recycling? Challenge yourself and your household to increase your recycling. Make sure to rinse and dry your recyclables; dirty materials contaminate the process and have to be landfilled . Carry groceries and other purchases in reusable bags. Give up single -use plastics by switching to sturdy, reusable items like metal/hard plastic water bottles, cut- lery, & to -go containers. Give unused clothes and household items (in good condition) to a local nonprofit, neighbor or friend. Shop local second -hand and vintage stores. Create a composting bin and routine. Attend Bloomington's \"Fix It Fair. \" Bring an item to be fixed or buy at least one repaired item. Challenge yourself and your household to eliminate your food waste. Minimize your food waste by first eating what you already have in your fridge. Meal planning and making grocery lists can also reduce your food waste. https://www.epa.gov/recycle/reducing -wasted -food -home Never throw hazardous household waste, like batteries and paint, in the trash. Take these to the Monroe County Solid Waste District recycling center. https://bloomington.in.gov/utilities/pretreatment/ residential/household -hazardous -waste Waste Management Section 05 Water and Wastewater Click here to return to TOC 67 Climate Water and Wastewater Why Water and Wastewater is Important Water is at the core of climate change and sustainable development. Quality water is vitally important for socio -economic development, maintaining healthy ecosystems, and for human survival. Water is central to the pro- duction and preservation of a wide range of services benefiting people. How we process water is also i ntegrally linked to how emissions intensive that water treatment is. Water related energy use totals 13% of US electrici- ty consumption and has a carbon footprint of at least 290 million metric tons. Meanwhile, wastewater treat- ment is responsible for 3% of global GHG emissions. Water is also at the heart of adaptation to climate change. In our the Midwest, climate change will increase the likelihood of drought combined with additional heavy rain events, flooding, and flash flooding . On average across the Wabash River Basin, precipitation is projected to be 3% higher in the 2020s under a high -emissions scenario compared to the 1971 -2000 average (FutureWater Indiana ). Climate change will also/result in in- creased stress on our water systems, increase water pollution potential, and place more risk on maintaining safe water resources. Water is an irreplaceable, critically important resource fundamental to the well -being of our communities. Water can only be considered renewable with high quality best water management practices in place. According to the \"Hoosiers ' Health in a Changing Climate: A Report from the Indiana Climate Change Impacts Assessment \": the increased frequency and severity of precipitation, as well as the timing in the spring and winter, considerably increase the risk of flooding, especially in low -lying areas throughout the state. These flood events may be responsible for fatal and non -fatal injuries and waterborne disease. Heavy storms can cause storm drains and sewage pipes to overflow and residential stormwater manage- ment systems (e.g., sump pumps) to fail. Contact with stormwater/wastewater has been correlated with increased rates of gastrointestinal illnesses. Dampness in homes, schools and other buildings caused by flooding can increase mold growth and lead to higher rates of asthma and allergies. According to FloodFactor, 7% of all properties are at risk for flooding. This is approximately 1,500 properties out of 21,330 assessed. B y 2050 the number will increase to 1,543 properties due to climate change impacts. (https://floodfactor.com/city/bloomington -indiana/1805860_fsid ) The City of Bloomington Utilities Department (CBU) provides water to all Bloomington residents and businesses and sells water wholesale to nine rural water cooperatives. CBU provides over 2.8 billion gallons of water to 25,299 water customers directly plus most of the remainder of Monroe County through wholesale customers and also serves 22,574 sewer customers and provide stormwater management services for the entire city of Bloomington. In 2018, the water and wastewater sector contributed 1.14% of citywide GHG emissions with water distribution responsible for 5,847 metric tons and wastewater treatment accounting for 8,904 metric tons. Climate Change Considerations Climate Hazards This sector impacts climate change through fossil fuel use to generate the electricity required to pro- cess and distribute water. Hazards to the water and wastewater system include damage to infrastructure from extreme weather and flooding . Citywide hazards include increased flooding and flash flooding potential. Bloomington Climate Action Plan 68 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 69 Water and Wastewater Equity Considerations Low-income neighborhoods frequently suffer more damage from flooding, according to studies by the Na- tional Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine ( Framing the Challenge of Urban Flooding in the United States , 2019). The frequency and magnitude of heavy rain events is expected to increase as a result of a changing climate, making the future flooding impacts for at -risk neighborhoods potentially more acute. Disadvantaged communities within cities often have denser populations, more impervious surfaces, and less open/green spaces. These areas can also be prone to flooding and sewer overflows. Stormwater man- agement through the creation of open, green spaces serve to revitalize and promote health within these disadvantaged communities. Sector Goals Sector goals are established to both support the City's Climate Action Plan in creating a climate resilient community and to reduce city -wide GHG emissions 25% below 2018 levels by 2030. Sector goals related to GHG emissions reductions are designed to balance reduction across all sec- tors and achieve the overall emissions goals set forth for the community. The goals seek to strike a balance between achievability while also reach- ing for improvement beyond business -as-usual. As indicated in the introduction, the Climate Ac- tion Plan is intended to be a 10 year plan to be updated at the completion of that time. Conse- quently, the goals and strategies outlined in this section are intended to be achieved by 2030 un- less otherwise noted. Implementation of actions are anticipated to be initiated over 3 phases: phase 1 within 1 -3 years, phase 2 within 2 -5 years, and phase 3 within 4 -8 years of CAP approval. Water and Wastewater Targets Supporting Sector Goals - - Potable Water Consumption Water + Wastewater Process Energy 92 Gallons/day per capita 88 Gallons/day per capita 282 kWh/year per capita 250 kWh/year per capita . 2030 Targets Today Goal W 1 Decrease potable water consumption by 3% of 2018 values. Goal W 2 Maintain source and drinking water quality through climate related challenges. Goal W 3 Reduce energy use associated with treating and transporting water and wastewater by 10% of 2018 values. Goal W 4 Mitigate flood hazards and impacts. Bloomington Climate Action Plan 70 Water and Wastewater Goal W 1 Decrease potable water consumption by 3% of 2018 values. Strategy W 1 -A: Promote increased water conservation citywide. How We'll Measure Progress: Reported citywide water consumption Average per residential capita daily water consumption within the city was 96.2 gallons in 2016. The population of Bloomington and the surrounding area is anticipated to increase while water supplies are finite meaning wee have an obligation to use our limited resources responsibly. Prudent water use practices will help ensure that future generations have access to clean and abundant water sources, despite growing populations and the lack of new supplies. Reducing per capita water consumption by 3% will conserve over 38 million gallons annually in the residential sector alone. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Reduced Costs Actions Implementation Phase Improved Community Resilience W1-A- 1 Facilitate reduction of water use by top 20 customers through an opt -in program. Offer free technical resources to large institutions and businesses to identify specific oppor- tunities for employees or customers to conserve water and incorporate water efficien- cy into internal operations. 1 W1-A- 2 Accelerate the installation of low -flow water fixtures in residential homes and expand the program to commercial businesses. Goal: achieve 100 households and 10 business- es upgraded annually. 1 W1-A- 3 Develop a technical assistance and incentive program to encourage water conservation behavior and upgrades, such as use of drip irrigation and low -flow toilets. 2 W1-A- 4 Implement a policy to require installation of rainwater collection systems and Water- Sense water efficient fixtures and appliances at all City facility projects and all projects receiving $50,000 or more in City tax abatement, financing or funding. Provide infor- mation and technical assistance to projects as needed. 2 W1-A- 5 Expand water conservation programs that focus on outdoor irrigation, which may also support better identification of water -related carbon sequestering opportunities such as using soil amendments, native grasses and proper tree watering. 3 W1-A- 6 Expand water conservation outreach and incentive programs for residents and busi- nesses. 3 Water and Wastewater Bloomington Climate Action Plan 71 Strategy W 1 -B: Maintain and update city plans and standards in support wa- ter conservation goals. How We'll Measure Progress: Reported citywide water consumption Reducing water consumption within City of Bloomington facilities supports citywide water conservation goals, provides opportunities to exhibit water conservation techniques, and will create operational cost savings for the City. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Improved Community Resilience Protected / Enhanced Ecosystems Actions Implementation Phase W1-B- 1 Evaluate the potential to update the City's Green Building Ordinance to include installa- tion of rainwater collection systems at City facilities for graywater uses, and investigate opportunities for graywater reuse at existing and new City facilities and properties. Implement graywater systems identified capable of reducing energy/water demand in other areas (i.e. watering urban tree canopy to reduce heat island effect and air condi- tioning needs). 1 W1-B- 2 Continue to plant more native and drought -resistant vegetation. 2 W1-B- 3 Encourage developers to utilize the Sustainable Development Incentive and provide low impact development stormwater management by installing permanent infiltration or collection features (e.g., swale, culvert outfall, rainwater cistern) that can retain 100 percent of the runoff . 2 Goal W 2 Maintain source and drinking water quality through climate related challenges. Strategy W 2 -A: Improve water quality protections and awareness. How We'll Measure Progress: Water quality as reported through annual drinking water quality reports Bloomington has a surface water source for drinking water, Lake Monroe. The Monroe Water Treatment Plant filters and cleans the water for public distribution. The MWTP is operated by the City of Bloomington Utilities Department. The Water Treatment Plant is a conventional settling/filtration facility and has several stages of disinfection before the water is sent out into the distribution system. According to the 2020 Annual Drinking Water Quality report, Bloomington water is within required levels of all 12 water contaminate measures, 5 of which are at or below \"ideal\" levels. https:// cutt.ly/zggXnII Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Improved Community Resilience Improved Quality of Life W2-A- 1 Strengthen riparian/stream/wetland protection in local ordinances and regulations where feasible. 1 W2-A- 2 Develop educational materials covering the link between water resources and climate change. 2 W2-A- 3 Increase stream buffer requirements to provide additional flood water storage and minimize property damage due to erosion and flooding. 3 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 72 Water and Wastewater Goal W 3 Reduce energy use associated with treating and trans- porting water and wastewater by 10% of 2018 values. Strategy W 3 -A: Reduce energy use associated with treating and transporting water and wastewater by 10% of 2018 values. How We'll Measure Progress: Reported energy consumption by City water and wastewater systems According to the 2018 GHG Inventory, processing and distributing water within the city of Bloomington consumed 10,984,760 kWh annually. Meanwhile, wastewater collection and treatment consumed 13,450,909 kWh. Reducing energy use associated with water and wastewater treat- ment by 10% will save over 2.4 million kWh annually. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Improved Energy Resilience Reduced GHG Emissions W3-A- 1 Promote measures that reduce the energy needed to heat, treat and transport water, including continued evaluation of new hydroelectric and photovoltaic opportunities. 1 W3-A- 2 Identify and support opportunities for residents and businesses - particularly those with significant hot water loads such as laundromats and hospitals - to electrify water heaters or install solar thermal technology. 2 Strategy W 3 -B: Capture and use of wastewater energy potential. How We'll Measure Progress: Status of study As recommended by the City of Bloomington Waste To Energy Taskforce, the City should further investigate the potential of an anaerobic digestion wastewater -to-energy installation at the Dillman Road Wastewater Treat- ment Plant. As outlined in the Taskforce's findings, an anaerobic digestion site could produce approximately 325 kW of electricity, which is about 36% of the plant 's average electrical consumption. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Reduced GHG Emissions Reduced Costs W3-B- 1 Research into biogas opportunities at the City's wastewater treatment plant and ex- plore opportunities for renewable natural gas development capacity. 1 W3-B- 2 Following completion of study for retaining City wastewater treatment plant produced Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) and kWh for City heating and electrical needs implement recommendations of study. 2 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 73 Water and Wastewater Goal W 4 Mitigate flood hazards and impacts. Strategy W 4 -A: Update design standards and plans for flood mitigation. How We'll Measure Progress: Status of flood mitigation standard plan integration According to \"Hoosiers ' Health in a Changing Climate: A Report from the Indiana Climate Change Impacts Assessment, \" Indiana will see an annual precipitation increase of 6 -8% by 2050 with an increase in the likelihood of heavy downpours. Meanwhile, changes in precipitation patterns are pro- jected to increase Indiana's drought potential severity index by 5% - mean- ing heavier rainfalls will likely be falling on harder ground more susceptible to increased water runoff and flash flooding. Maintaining community plans and design standards based on projected climate impacts will be key in min- imizing flood hazard threats. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Improved Community Resilience W4-A- 1 Review and update public infrastructure design standards and the City's Stormwater Management Plan to meet climate change projections for Bloomington. 1 W4-A- 2 Perform a flood risk assessment using historical data and future precipitation forecasts to identify areas and critical infrastructure vulnerable to flooding. 1 W4-A- 3 Continue to restore and maintain creeks to accommodate increased rain events. Re- view standards and ensure they include projected precipitation levels due to climate change. Creek restoration can reduce the likelihood and magnitude of flooding and support healthy habitat. 2 W4-A- 4 Determine stormwater volume requirements meeting anticipated future storm levels and identify stormwater management systems and infrastructure not capable of meeting projected needs. Prioritize upgrades required and implement. Integrate up- grades into already scheduled maintenance programs and budgets. 2 W4-A- 5 Expand inclusion of green infrastructure in City's Stormwater Management Plan. Iden- tify specific types of green infrastructure to implement including: parking lots, alleys, parks, vacant lots, parkways, and grading near sidewalks. In addition, identify property owned by other public entities that have a high potential for improved ecological man- agement to improve stormwater management functions. 2 W4-A- 6 Modify water utility bills to provide education to residents on what actions they can take to reduce their risk to extreme precipitation events and flash flooding. Develop an information HUB with tools and resources. (e.g. https://www.cnt.org/tools/my - rainready -home -assessment -tool) 2 W4-A- 7 Build more permeable parking lots and driveways and use more recycled materials with concrete. 3 Water and Wastewater Bloomington Climate Action Plan 74 Strategy W 4 -B: Increase green infrastructure capacities citywide. How We'll Measure Progress: Reported number, coverage, and capacity of green infrastructure installations Green infrastructure strategies can build soil quality and improve the per- meability (or absorbency) of the soil. The more permeable the surface, the less stormwater runoff there will be, reducing flood risks. Porous natural landscapes, such as meadows and forests, can soak up as much as 90 per- cent of the rain or snowmelt. By reducing stormwater runoff and protecting floodplains, green infrastructure can help manage both localized and river- ine floods. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Improved Community Resilience Protected / Enhanced Ecosystems W4-B- 1 Promote native landscaping to help restore and conserve natural habitats and avoid turf grass. 1 W4-B- 2 Encourage use of rain gardens at public agency sites as well as commercial and residen- tial sites. 1 W4-B- 3 Add stormwater absorption features, such as bioswales, rain gardens, and pervious pavement systems to City -owned space. 1 W4-B- 4 Prioritize restoration types and areas to increase and improve stream and wetland pro- tection and restoration; develop funding strategy. 2 W4-B- 5 Leverage resources to support neighborhood green infrastructure grants and ongoing maintenance. 2 W4-B- 6 Incentivize and prioritize the development of \"green infrastructure \" such as parks, wet- lands, riparian and wildlife corridors, natural drainage -ways, and low -impact develop- ment. Research green infrastructure implementation and long -term viability in local environment. 2 W4-B- 7 Increase the number of public and private use of raingarden and other infiltration pro- jects. 3 What You Can Do Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth. If you have dishwasher, use it. Research shows we use more water washing dishes by hand than running a full or nearly full dishwasher. If you have a lawn and garden irrigation system, or use hoses and sprinklers, water thoroughly less often, and do so in the early morning or evening. Alternatively, install a Smart Irriga- tion Meter to Prevent watering grass that doesn 't need it. Collect rainwater and use it for indoor and outdoor plants. Install \u2014 or have a licensed plumber install water -saving aerators on showerheads and faucets throughout your home. Install or have a licensed plumber install \u2014 a water -saving low-flow toilet. Reduce or eliminate use of fertilizers and pesticides on lawns to protect surface water quality and ecosystem health. Convert lawn areas to native, drought resistant landscaping that does not require watering.

N/A Planned Water and Wastewater GHG Emission Reductions Planned Sector Emission Reductions Through 2030 The strategies and actions included in this section of the Climate Action Plan are pro- jected to reduce the city 's annual GHG emissions by 1,100 metric tons (MT) by 2030 - a 7% reduction over 2018 levels. Changes in business -as-usual impacts are anticipated to reduce an additional 350 metric tons for a total community wide water and wastewater sector reduction of 10% over 2018 levels . This is equivalent to eliminating 3.2 mil- lion cubic feet of man -made greenhouse gas atmosphere annually by 2030. Sector Emissions Reduction below 2018 Achieved by 2030 The total change to sector emissions in- clude CAP Plan reductions as well as BAU emission changes as follows: Individual Strategy Annual Emission Reductions by 2030 Below are the CAP Plan reductions by strategy for this sector: 7% CAP Reductions 3% BAU Reductions Remaining is 10% Below 2018 Section 06 Local Food and Agriculture Click here to return to TOC 77 Local Food and Agriculture Why Local Food and Agriculture Are Important Climate change directly impacts the food system. For people experiencing nutrition insecurity, climate change is a threat multiplier which exacerbates existing food access and affordability issues. Extreme weather events, extreme temperature variations, changes in precipitation, changing soil temperatures and other climate im- pacts will affect crop yields. Climate impacts can also introduce interruptions in the current food processing and distribution system. Disruptions that occur in the food system are likely to cause food availability or pricing fluctuations A significant number of individuals in Bloomington are experiencing food insecurity. The Bloomington Food Policy Council identified the following neighborhoods as at risk for food insecurity Crestmont, Reverend Butler, Walnut Woods, Maple Heights, and Broadview. Food insecurity continues to grow in the face of economic chal- lenges with thousands of meals served every week from direct service providers in 2020 . On the map to the left, highlighted sections represent low -income census tracts at least 500 people or 33 % of residents are more than 1 mile (green sections) or 1/2 mile (orange) from the nearest supermarket (defined as a store containing all the major food departments necessary to provide full nutrition to a household) . Indiana is one of the most powerful agricultural states in the nation, ranked #10 in total production. However, more than 90% of the food consumed and processed in Indiana is imported from other states. Studies con- ducted by the Indiana State Department of Agriculture (ISDA) and the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) over the past eight years have outlined several reasons for this: a lack of agricultural diversity and midscale farms producing specialty crops in Indiana weak farm to buyer network connections lack of local or state policies that support purchasing of local food with public money few processing centers for value added food businesses Though there are now multiple farmer 's markets serving the Bloomington area, there are limited retail and in- stitutional purchasing outlets as part of the local food system. Strengthening the local food market can address the challenges that climate change poses to the broader food system, while simultaneously supporting small businesses and the local economy. Studies have indicated that nearly 32 jobs are created for every $1 million in revenue generated by producers involved in a local food mar- ket, compared to only 10.5 jobs for those involved in wholesale channels exclusively. Healthy local food sys- tems can also play a critical role in addressing food access vulnerability and food insecurity within neighbor- hoods of higher vulnerability. A robust local food system establishes additional supply chains and resilience to distribution disruptions, increasing overall community resilience. Climate Change Considerations Climate Hazards Hazards to the local food and agriculture sys- tem include reduced crop quality and yield, vul- nerability to pests and soil moisture as well as fluctuation in availability, food price volatility and change . Opportunities Increased capacity of local food and agriculture systems and improved farm -to-table approach- es can reduce community food insecurity while creating local jobs and improved community resilience. 78 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 79 Local Food and Agriculture Equity Considerations People in low -income neighborhoods may have limited access to full -service supermarkets or grocery stores - areas known as a \"food deserts. \" Over 14% of Monroe County households are food insecure - over 30% of those with incomes above assistance program thresholds. Studies have also shown that communities with fewer resources often have more outlets that promote un- healthy foods and little access to affordable nutritious food, a condition known as a \"nutrition desert. \" (Graphic source: Feeding America) Sector Goals Sector goals are established to both support the City's Climate Action Plan in creating a climate resilient community and to reduce city -wide GHG emissions 25% below 2018 levels by 2030. Sector goals related to GHG emissions reductions are designed to balance reduction across all sec- tors and achieve the overall emissions goals set forth for the community. The goals seek to strike a balance between achievability while also reach- ing for improvement beyond business -as-usual.

Goal FA 1 Increase food and nutrition security citywide. Goal FA 2 Increase local agricultural resilience to climate shocks. Goal FA 3 Increase and stabilize local food market. Local Food and Agriculture Bloomington Climate Action Plan 80 Goal FA 1 Increase food and nutrition security citywide. Strategy FA 1 -A: Address financial food insecurity. How We'll Measure Progress: Food insecurity reported in City and County 75% of food insecure individuals in Monroe County are low income. The majority of these individuals (88%) are \"very low income \" (below 135% of poverty level), indicating a clear relationship between financial insecurity and nutrition insecurity in the community. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Improved Community Equity Improved Community Resilience FA1-A- 1 Explore potential of collaborating with low cost produce providers to establish local food markets serving low income, vulnerable, and food insecure communities while addressing retail and commercial food waste. 1 FA1-A- 2 Continue to provide enrollment assistance for participation in the Supplemental Nutri- tion Assistance Program (SNAP), the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Wom- en, Infants and Children (WIC) Program and other food assistance programs, as well as supporting local initiatives addressing financial food insecurity. 2 FA1-A- 3 Work regionally to support and facilitate food donation programs. Food donation pro- grams reduce the amount of healthy, safe food that goes to waste and redirects it to those in need. 2 Strategy FA 1 -B: Improve food access. How We'll Measure Progress: Food insecurity reported in City and County Individuals living with food insecurity are particularly vulnerable to impacts and risks of climate change. As indicated in the USDA Food Map, many sec- tions of Bloomington have significant portions of the population who are economically stressed as well as having limited access to transportation and living 1/2 mile or further from a grocery store. Increasing food access will decrease food insecurity improve community resilience and adaptative ca- pacity to climate impacts. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Improved Community Equity Improved Community Resilience FA1-B- 1 Conduct a detailed Food Security Assessment to determine food insecurity conditions within the City, areas with limited access to full service grocery stores and markets (particularly within areas of higher vulnerable populations), identify areas within the City for improvement, and establish detailed strategies to increase food security within City. 1 FA1-B- 2 Support senior programs that involve both food and community such as volunteering or donating to local charities. 1 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 81 Local Food and Agriculture Actions Implementation Phase FA1-B- 3 Collaborate with convenience stores and food pantries to incentivize the purchase and distribution of affordable, fresh foods. 1 FA1-B- 3 Develop an emergency food plan that includes a food needs assessment, scenarios for provisioning necessary food supplies during a range of anticipated emergencies, and a distribution and public communication plan that takes into account those most at risk for food insecurity. Work with local retailers, producers, and warehouses to implement food provisioning scenarios. 2 FA1-B- 4 Improve the availability of culturally appropriate food accessible to the City's popula- tions of color, religiously diverse, and limited English speakers. Explore opportunities to expand local development of these goods through engagement with local food produc- ers and promote information on locations and price ranges of uncommon culturally important produce and food products. 2 Goal FA 2 Increase local agricultural resilience to climate shocks. Strategy FA 2 -A: Provide information and promote climate responsive agricul- ture practices. How We'll Measure Progress: Reported percentage of local food growers adopting climate adaptive strategies According to research completed for \"Estimating economic damage from climate change in the United States, \" a 2017 study completed by Solomon Hsiang and others from the University of California at Berkeley, agricultural yields are projected to decline with the increase of Global Mean Surface Temperature in addition to impacts related to precipitation changes. Alt- hough increased CO2 levels are anticipated to offset a portion of these yield loses, the impact for much of the United States will be a net negative. By 2100 the projected impact to the Monroe County economy is -35.6%. See the Bloomington Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Improved Community Resilience Protected / Enhanced Ecosystems FA2-A- 1 Collaborate with the Monroe County School Corporation, Monroe County, Indiana Uni- versity, Monroe County Farmer's Association, Indiana Grown, and local organic farmers associations to encourage adoption of strategies to increase soil health and increased carbon sequestration for Croplands and Grazing Lands.

How We'll Measure Progress: Status of City plan and program development Addressing agricultural resilience through community level planning pro- vides opportunities to improve overall community resilience to climate change impacts and to guide long -term local food infrastructure to support communities in greatest need. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Improved Community Resilience Reduced Costs FA2-B- 1 Collaborate with Monroe County to develop a comprehensive farmland conservation plan that prioritizes food production while taking into consideration other Bloomington greenspace and climate adaptation priorities. The plan could also include specific maps or areas prioritized for farmland conservation or identify those areas most at risk from development or climate change impacts. Program should focus on exploring increased local food -to-table, local food utilization, and local development of cultural food prod- ucts in support of Bloomington area underserved communities. 1 FA2-B- 2 Work with Bloomington Water Utility and community partners to determine the feasi- bility of offering rebates or other incentives to farmers for irrigation water manage- ment equipment, water storage, reclaimed water, and conservation tillage equipment that saves potable water. 2 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 83 Local Food and Agriculture Goal FA 3 Increase and stabilize local food market. Strategy FA 3 -A: Increase local food supply. How We'll Measure Progress: Status of Food Coordinator staff position; Sta- tus of urban agriculture ordinances Strengthening local food sources can address both climate change relation- ships with food and also supports small business local economy. As outlined in the study The Food System as an Economic Driver: Strategies and Applica- tions for Michigan, nearly 32 jobs may be created for every $1 million in revenue generated by produce farms involved in a local food market, com- pared to only 10.5 jobs for those involved in wholesale channels exclusively. Healthy local food systems can also play a critical role in addressing food access vulnerability and food insecurity within neighborhoods of higher vulnerability. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Improved Community Resilience Protected / Enhanced Ecosystems FA3-A- 1 Fund a Local Food Coordinator position with an annual budget for activities and initia- tives to focus on a values -based supply chain for buyers in the City. Working with City officials, this coordinating professional will define the climate values (i.e., local, soil health, animal welfare, fair wages, nutritionally dense, etc.) and define the foodshed or geographic area of food production that the City can influence through policy. 1 FA3-A- 2 Revise zoning ordinances to remove barriers to urban agriculture: yard and rooftop food production, edible landscaping and foraging. Examine and pursue other policy levers to increase food production within the City. Utilize available and appropriate Parks and Recreation lands for urban farming and food production. 1 FA3-A- 3 Assess, develop, and adopt financial incentives through CDFI and CDBG programs to recruit and support the startup of small and mid -sized food processors in the City. 1 FA3-A- 4 Collaborate with Monroe and other nearby County (non -City of Bloomington) officials, residents, and communities to bolster (1) the region 's food supply, (2) aggregation and processing abilities, and (3) distribution capacity for both urban and rural residents alike. Work through existing partnerships or develop a new collaborative that brings key stakeholders from the Indiana Uplands as well as Jackson, Bartholomew, Johnson, Morgan, and Putnam counties into conversation for broader regional planning on a resilient food system for the future. 2 FA3-A- 5 Support existing school and community gardens and provide opportunities to expand community growing spaces with a focus on youth, immigrant, and low -income resi- dents. 2 FA3-A- 6 Support efforts to identify and increase utilization of shared food system assets such as shared food storage space, community commercial kitchens, group purchasing of growing equipment such as backyard greenhouses or hoop houses, and public -private partnerships. 2 FA3-A- 7 Equitably promote educational opportunities for residents to gain skills in organic gar- dening, fruit production, food preservation and cooking and affordable, healthy eating. 2 FA3-A- 8 Develop entrepreneurial program for middle and high school parents to grow food and sell in marketplace. 3 Local Food and Agriculture Bloomington Climate Action Plan 84 Strategy FA 3 -B: Strengthen demand for local foods. How We'll Measure Progress: Status of Local Food Procurement policies Increased demand for locally produced food ensures the economic resili- ence of local producers, leverages the local job creation potential of local food systems, and supports improved nutrition for consumers while im- proving community resilience. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Improved Quality of Life Improved Community Equity FA3-B- 1 Pass city policy to procure locally grown and organic foods for events and other orga- nized food catering at city -managed facilities.

Efforts to focus on in- creased community equity and food security among at -risk populations. 3 Local Food and Agriculture Bloomington Climate Action Plan 85 What You Can Do Rent a plot at your local community gardens and grow your own. Eat a plant -rich diet. Animal products are extremely GHG -intensive to produce compared to plants. Eating less meat and dairy will reduce emissions associated with food consumption . Eating regionally - grown food that is suitable for the Indiana climate will also make a difference through reduced trans- portation -related emissions. A great place to start is with \"Meatless Mondays \" or one meat -free meal a day. https://ourworldindata.org/food -choice -vs-eating -local Buy food directly from a local grower on an ongoing basis. Plant fruit or nut bearing trees or shrubs that are well suited for our hardiness zone on your property. Support restaurants and grocery stores that use and sell locally -grown food. Buy food that is in season, minimizing the distance food must travel. Support your local farmers markets. Buy ethically grown and harvested food, like fair -trade coffee and chocolate. Section 07 Health and Safety Click here to return to TOC 87 Climate Hazards Climate stressors include increases in the fre- quency and intensity of poor air quality days, extreme high temperature events, heavy rain- falls, extended pollen seasons, changed distri- bution of disease carrying pests . Opportunities Strategies which improve community connect- edness, mobility, community resilience through healthy lifestyles frequently coincide with cli- mate mitigation measures such as improved pedestrian safety and low income home weath- erization. Health and Safety Why Health and Safety Are Important There is a strong relationship between human health and environmental health. From the air we breathe to the water we drink, life here on Earth depends on the environment around us. This link between the environ- ment and human health is a critical consideration of the impacts of climate change. As outlined in the City 's Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment, changes in climate, such as higher average temperatures and in- creased storm frequency and intensity, can intensify public health stressors. These climate change impacts en- danger public health and safety by affecting the air we breathe, the weather we experience, our food and wa- ter sources, and our interactions with the built and natural environments. As the climate continues to change, the risks to human health continue to grow. The health of our environment affects our public health, and agencies should promote it as such. There is a di- rect relationship between climate action and community health because the health of our environment affects public health. Vulnerable Populations Climate change impacts the health of all community members, however, people within our communities are differently exposed to hazards and some are disproportionately affected by the risks of climate change. Accord- ing to the National Climate Assessment, greater health risks related to climate impacts can be experienced by some in our communities including: children, older adults, low -income individuals, and some people of color. Some in these groups are disproportionately affected by extreme heat and weather events, and many have increased health and social vulnerability which decreases their access to resources that can help them avoid the risks of climate change . According to the National Climate Assessment (https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/14/ ): Additional populations with increased health and social vulnerability typically have less access to information, resources, institutions, and other factors to prepare for and avoid the health risks of climate change. Some of these communities include poor people in high -income re- gions, minority groups, women, pregnant women, those experiencing discrimination, children under five, persons with physical and mental illness, persons with physical and cognitive disa- bilities, the homeless, those living alone, Indigenous people, people displaced because of weather and climate, the socially isolated, poorly planned communities, the disenfranchised, those with less access to healthcare, the uninsured and underinsured, those living in inade- quate housing, and those with limited financial resources to rebound from disasters. Climate Change Considerations 88 Health and Safety Equity Considerations Some populations, including aging adults, children, persons with disabilities, economically stressed, non - English speakers, homeless persons, and workers employed in climate exposed jobs are particularly vulner- able to extreme weather, natural disasters, and the health, supply chain, and economic impacts of climate change. Many of these individuals also have limited access to the information, services, and resources needed to ensure resilience in the face of these impacts. Areas within the city with increased flood risk, air quality impacts, compromised tree canopy coverage, and older housing stock with insufficient air conditioning are vulnerable environments within our cities with heightened exposure to climate change risks and compromised capacity to adapt. Vulnerable populations are disproportionately represented within the vulnerable environments of our cities and frequently lack resources to improve the adaptive capacity of their surroundings. Sector Goals Sector goals are established to both support the City's Climate Action Plan in creating a climate resilient community and to reduce city -wide GHG emissions 25% below 2018 levels by 2030. Sector goals related to GHG emissions reductions are designed to balance reduction across all sec- tors and achieve the overall emissions goals set forth for the community. The goals seek to strike a balance between achievability while also reach- ing for improvement beyond business -as-usual. As indicated in the introduction, the Climate Ac- tion Plan is intended to be a 10 year plan to be updated at the completion of that time. Consequently, the goals and strategies out- lined in this section are intended to be achieved by 2030 unless otherwise noted. Implementation of actions are anticipated to be initiated over 3 phases: phase 1 within 1 -3 years, phase 2 within 2 -5 years, and phase 3 within 4 -8 years of CAP approval. Bloomington Climate Action Plan 89 Goal HS 1 Educate, engage, and empower the public for cli- mate health and safety. Goal HS 2 Prepare Bloomington for climate risks and impacts. Goal HS 3 Respond to climate risks and impacts. Bloomington Climate Action Plan 90 Health and Safety Climate Risk Sensitivity A \"Climate Risk\" is when the effects of climate change have the potential for negative consequences and out- comes for human health, systems, or communities. The most common way of evaluating the level of risk asso- ciated with climate impacts is to consider how sensitive a community is to an impact and how likely that impact is to occur. An approach for anticipating the sensitivity of a community to potential climate change impacts is to quantify and map the potentially vulnerable populations within the community. Vulnerable Population Climate Impact Sensitivity The Bloomington Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment report quantified the potentially vulnerable popu- lations within Bloomington and identified the risks each population may have heightened sensitivities to (i.e. outdoor workers having a higher sensitivity to extreme heat and weather events). This enables an estimation of the total instances of potential vulnerability to each climate risk. It should be noted that it is possible for indi- viduals to be members of more than one vulnerable population. For example, an individual may be both an adult over age 65 as well as an individual living below 200% of poverty level. Consequently, the \"total instances of vulnerability \" for each climate risk does not necessarily represent the numbers of vulnerable individuals. The number, however, does provide a representation of the proportion of total climate vulnerabilities within the population and enables an indication of comparative population sensitivity to each climate risk. People of Color As indicated above, the highest number of potential vulnerable population instances in the community are low income individuals and families, people of color, individuals with disabilities, and seniors. The climate risks which the community may be particularly sensitive to are extreme heat and weather, air quality, flooding, power/infrastructure failure, and food insecurity. See the Bloomington Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment for more information. $727,000 Annually Source: NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information Health and Safety Climate Impacts Already Felt Climate change impacts are already being felt within the community. Over 75% of the 472 individuals responding to the City of Blooming- ton's 2020 Climate Action Plan Community Input Survey reported being personally impacted by the effects of climate change. The most noted personal impacts observed were: Increased air conditioning use, Increased contact with ticks and mosquitos, Longer allergy season, Tree loss due to storm, flooding or drought Flooding/flood damage. Bloomington Climate Risk The chart below reviews the expected climate impacts, likelihood of occurrence, impact level (Vulnerable Pop- ulation Climate Impact Sensitivity), potential timeframe of impact, and resulting overall potential risk level for climate risks to the population. Each of these impacts are already experienced. The timeframes represent estimations of when the likelihood of occurrence and/or the overall level of impact may be significantly in- creased. The timeframes should be understood to be approximate and include \"short -term \" (current to 20 years), \"medium -term \" (mid -century) and \"long -term \" (late century). Prioritizing Climate Health and Safety Risks Based on the above review the City 's adaptive efforts may be most effective by prioritizing strategies which address the climate risks of Air Quality, Extreme Heat, Flooding, Power/Infrastructure Failure, Energy Costs, Food Insecurity, and Property Crime. Particular attention should be paid to strategies which are most effective. for those in Economic Stress, People of Color, Individuals with Disabilities, and Seniors over 65. See the Bloom- ington Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment for more information Bloomington Climate Action Plan 91 Noticed signs of climate change Personally impacted by effects of climate change Bloomington Climate Action Plan 92 Health and Safety Goal HS 1 Educate, engage, and empower the public for climate health and safety. Strategy HS 1 -A: Improve training to address risks exacerbated by climate change. How We'll Measure Progress: Status of integration of climate change impact projections into training Hazard and risk identification supporting public safety, emergency manage- ment, and social services professional training has largely been based on historical occurrence. However, research indicates that climate change is affecting future patterns of natural hazards. These changes must be antici- pated and integrated into how disaster mitigation, preparedness strategies, and training is developed. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Improved Community Resilience Improved Public Health HS1-A- 1 Ensure public safety staff are properly trained to recognize and respond to physical and behavioral signs of heat -related illness. 1 HS1-A- 2 Strengthen emergency management capacity to prepare for and respond to the im- pacts of climate change. The City should prioritize capacity improvements such as training and equipment to address risks exacerbated by climate change - see the City of Bloomington Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 2020. Emergency manage- ment should be equipped to address the possibility of multiple emergencies at the same time, such as the combination of extreme heat and power outage. 1 HS1-A- 3 Provide guidance through resource material to social service providers so they are aware of best practices in treating client needs during an extreme heat event. 2 HS1-A- 4 Give city and county elected officials and staff tools (e.g. webinar trainings on emer- gency preparedness, facilitation guides, and other materials in multiple languages) to have dialogues about emergency preparedness within neighborhoods and to create local resilience strategies such as an Adopt -A-Neighbor campaign or hosting an OEM CERT -like training session in their community. 3 Strategy HS 1 -B: Establish and expand public health communication cam- paigns. How We'll Measure Progress: Status of communication campaign develop- ment and implementation Successfully addressing climate change as a public health threat requires prevention strategies which can help influence people's behavior to help prevent and reduce the burden of climate change on human and other pop- ulations. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Improved Social Connectivity Improved Community Equity HS1-B- 1 Develop a climate change public health communication campaign to reach those with- out access to internet or technology, limited English speakers, and individuals in hard to reach vulnerable populations. 1 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 93 Health and Safety Actions Implementation Phase HS1-B- 2 Increase public education and outreach about the basics of climate change and how it will affect the community. Consider inclusion of explanation of exponential rates of change if global tipping points are met. 1 HS1-B- 3 Expand visibility of the City Air Quality Index including particulate matter and pollen counts so that the public is aware of bad air quality days. Include strategies for coping with poor air quality days 2 HS1-B- 4 Collaborate with County Health, school district, Indiana University, and local hospitals to establish a public communications campaign to build awareness of vector borne disease risks, avoidance, and actions. Campaign should be focused particularly on those most vulnerable to exposure. 3 Goal HS 2 Prepare Bloomington for climate risks and impacts. Strategy HS 2 -A: Strengthen community response capacity and support net- works. How We'll Measure Progress: Status of community network coverage for vul- nerable populations; Implementation of moni- toring program The Vulnerable Population Risk Sensitivity Chart (see Bloomington Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment) illustrates the instances of vulnerability to each of these projected climate impacts by census tract. Significant por- tions of the population have a likely elevated sensitivity to the anticipated extreme heat and weather, flooding, and air quality impacts projected. Vulnerability to climate impacts can be lessoned through the improved so- cial connectivity and support that can be provided through strengthened community networks focused on vulnerable community members. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Improved Social Connectivity Improved Community Equity HS2-A- 1 Enhance community networks and connections for those who require special atten- tion, such as the elderly, homebound, disabled, isolated, or those likely to be in need of financial assistance during or after extreme weather events (heat, cold and heavy pre- cipitation). 1 HS2-A- 2 Strengthen emergency management capacity to prepare for and respond to the im- pacts of climate change. The City should prioritize capacity improvements such as training and equipment to address risks exacerbated by climate change. Emergency management should be equipped to address the possibility of multiple emergencies at the same time. 2 HS2-A- 3 Explore potential of developing an indoor air quality monitoring program. Program could include deploying a series of air quality monitoring stations at appropriately lo- cated public facilities, schools, senior living homes, group homes, and public housing facilities. 3 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 94 Health and Safety Strategy HS 2 -B: Improve equity of climate adaptation measures. How We'll Measure Progress: Status of integration of climate change vulnera- bility into community plans, programs, and decisions Integration of climate change impacts and a recognition of the populations and neighborhoods most vulnerable to them into community plans, project approval processes, and program development is a critical requirement to effectively reducing climate change impacts for the portions of the commu- nity most likely to be affected. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Improved Community Resilience Improved Community Equity HS2-B- 1 Utilize current science, best practices and updated maps of flooding and flash flooding potential, micro heat island vulnerability, and populations most vulnerable to flooding and heat impacts to help inform decisions and priorities about projects, project approv- als, and programs that help to cool the urban environment. 1 HS2-B- 2 Ensure equitable implementation of grid resilience actions by partnering with high -risk neighborhoods and non -governmental organizations to develop resilience hubs \u2014 community facilities that offer power and other services during times of need. Establish criteria to screen and select locations for community microgrids to support grid and community resilience. 2 HS2-B- 3 Seek to reduce vulnerability to mold and other flood related impacts by providing mold awareness and mitigation assistance for residents within flood and flash flood prone sectors and for vulnerable populations and within multi -family housing. Assistance may include establishing mold inspections for rental properties and/or residences in flood or flash flood prone areas of the city. 2 HS2-B- 4 Collaborate with County to establish/expand support of climate and extreme weather safe working conditions, extreme heat and heat stress education and general worker safety for individuals and jobs vulnerable to high heat. 3 Goal HS 3 Respond to climate risks and impacts. Strategy HS 3 -A: Assist the city's heat, flooding, and storm vulnerable popula- tion in preparing for and mitigating climate change impacts. How We'll Measure Progress: Shade tree, flood assistance, and weatheriza- tion assistance data By 2050, Monroe County can expect: 50 days of over 95 degrees (historical: 2 days) an average hottest day of the year of 107 degrees (historical: 97 degrees), an average coldest day of the year of 1 degree (historical: -5 de- grees), an increase in spring rainfall of 16 percent above historical averages. The Vulnerable Population Risk Sensitivity Chart (see Bloomington Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment) illustrates the instances of vulnerability to each of these projected climate impacts by census tract.

Bloomington Climate Action Plan 97 Section 08 Greenspace and Ecosystem Health Click here to return to TOC 99 Greenspace and Ecosystem Health Why Greenspace and Ecosystem Health Are Important Human activities coupled with natural variations in the carbon cycle, have resulted in a significant increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) and other \"greenhouse gases \" in the atmosphere, thus causing measurable global warming. Controlling atmospheric CO 2 requires deliberate action that combines reducing emissions and increasing storage, while planning for adaptation to the changes that result. Part of this Climate Action Plan addresses ways that greenspace protection and enhancement is one of Bloomington 's most im- portant avenues for lowering our environmental footprint. Greenspace, plays a central role in supporting community health, improving air, soil, and water quality, reduc- ing energy use in buildings, and supporting climate -change mitigation. An urban greenspace includes any per- meable vegetated surface, public or private, set apart for recreational, aesthetic, or ecosystem services in an otherwise urban environment. It is space set aside for providing life -essential benefits people and other living things obtain from properly -functioning ecosystems. The key benefits and services greenspaces provide in- clude: Carbon sequestration: Within a greenspace carbon sequestration is sometimes referred to as biological or terrestrial sequestration. Plants convert carbon dioxide into biomass (leaves, stems, etc.) through photo- synthesis and with a greater amount of greenspace, the more CO 2 will be removed from the atmosphere . Stormwater infiltration and flood mitigation: Greenspace helps protect from flash flooding by absorbing water through roots and slowing down rainwater run off. Native plants have deep roots that can also miti- gate erosion and can filter the water through phytofiltration. Reduce the urban heart island effect: The more vegetated greenspace in Bloomington, the better the cool- ing effects. High levels of impervious surfaces (a surface that does not allow water to infiltrate such as pavement and buildings) results in an increased urban heat island effect, which elevates the temperature of the near -surface air, buildings, and pavement higher than the surrounding areas. Ideally, a greenspace would contain the vertical architecture, or levels of a natural forest (canopy, understory, and shrub, herba- ceous, and ground layers). Bloomington 's Urban Tree Canopy Assessment Summary Report suggests the community needs and has space for additional canopy cover . Purify and humidify the air: Plants purify the air when the plants absorb light, carbon dioxide, and water to manufacture sugar. That chemical process, known as photosynthesis, creates fresh oxygen, which in turn purifies for humans and other animals . Support pollinators: Animal species that pollinate plants, termed pollinators, carry pollen, either acci- dentally or intentionally, from the male part of a flower to the female part of the same or another flower. This pollen transfer must occur for the plant to be fertilized and produce seeds, fruits, or young plants. These pollinators are needed to pollinate 90% of flowering plants and one third of our food crops and they also contribute to the intricate web that supports the biological diversity in natural ecosystems. Enhance soil biology: Soil is a vital living ecosystem teaming with microorganisms (bacteria, protozoa, fun- gi) and macroorganisms (worms, beetles, bees) that work symbiotically to break down carbon -rich organic matter and release nutrient -rich waste into the soil (carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen). In fact, it is estimated that soil is home to about one third of all Earth 's living organisms! Additionally, just as importantly, soil can absorb and hold rainwater and filter potential pollutants, and the biomass (organic matter) within the soil can sequester CO 2. Bloomington Climate Action Plan 100 Greenspace and Ecosystem Health Human health -In addition to the countless ecosystem services greenspace provides, it is also good for humans. Actions as ordinary as going outside, looking out a window, or simply looking at one tree can increase our mood and reduce stress. In fact, recently, our understanding of the human value of greenspace has been ex- panded to include mental and physical health benefits, such that some doctors have even started prescribing parks as a remedy to patients ' health issues. Bloomington 's Tree Canopy The City 's average existing Tree Canopy coverage of 38% is above the national average, however, there are likely portions of the City which could benefit from increased tree canopy. According to the 2019 Bloomington Urban Tree Canopy Assessment Report The City of Bloomington 's existing tree canopy is 38%; the possible tree canopy is 27%; and the pre- ferred plantable area (possible tree canopy area that takes into consideration the current or future planned land use) is 22%, making the maximum tree canopy attainable under current development con- ditions at 62% (Figure 10). Reaching the projected tree canopy potential of 62% will require the City of Bloomington to preserve all existing tree canopy while expanding the urban forest in designated pre- ferred plantable areas. Climate Change Considerations Bloomington Climate Action Plan 101 Climate Hazards Projected climate change impacts may cause forests and urban trees to experience increased mortality and reduced productivity, more prev- alent invasive species and disease all resulting in forest and tree loss, reduction in crop yield. Loss of greenspace, in turn, reduces carbon capture potential of green infrastructure. Opportunities Many strategies within the Greenspace sector can advance community resilience and quality of life. Increased tree canopy, decreased imper- vious surfaces, and increased utilization of na- tive grasses and plantings can reduce heat is- land experiences, energy consumption, storm- water runoff, and flood impacts. Figure 10. Projected tree canopy potential within the City of Bloomington, IN (2018) Source: 2019 Bloomington Urban Tree Canopy Assess- ment Report Greenspace and Ecosystem Health Equity Considerations Lower income neighborhoods and neighborhoods with higher proportions of people of color regularly have lower tree canopy coverage, and the environmental, economic, and quality of life benefits trees support than more afflu- ent neighborhoods. \"Heat islands \" and \"micro heat islands \" are built up areas that are hotter than other nearby areas. This is caused by lack of adequate greenspace and healthy tree canopy coverage combined with too many hard surfaces like roads, parking lots, and hard building surfaces. Frequently neighborhoods with higher vulnerable populations have the highest heat island impacts. The map to the right from the Trust for Public Land 's ParkScore tool shows current and recommended park space throughout Bloomington represented by the red circles (numbers representing priority). The green portions of the map illustrate existing parks with public access while areas with very high need for parks are shown in dark orange and areas with high or moderate need for parks are shown in tan. Pink sections of the map indicate are- as with calculated heat island or mi- cro heat island impacts (darker colors represent higher heat island impacts). The numbered red circles indicate locations ideal for new parks which would serve populations without public park access within a 10 minute walk that are also in an area with higher urban heat island impacts. Sector Goals Sector goals are established to both support the City 's Climate Action Plan in creating a climate resilient community and to reduce city -wide GHG emissions 25% below 2018 levels by 2030. Sector goals related to GHG emissions reductions are designed to balance reduction across all sectors and achieve the overall emissions goals set forth for the community. The goals seek to strike a balance between achievability while also reaching for improvement beyond business -as- usual. As indicated in the introduction, the Climate Action Plan is intended to be a 10 year plan to be updated at the completion of that time. Consequently, the goals and strategies outlined in this section are intended to be achieved by 2030 unless otherwise noted. Implementation of actions are anticipated to be initiated over 3 phases: phase 1 within 1 -3 years, phase 2 within 2 -5 years, and phase 3 within 4 -8 years of CAP approval.

Strategy G 4 -A: Reduce impervious surfaces. How We'll Measure Progress: Status of policy development and implementation Reduction of impervious surfaces, particularly in sections of the community with high existing impervious surface ground cover share, can significantly reduce stormwater runoff and micro heat island impacts. Consistently im- plementing green streets, green streets, or living streets, or complete street policies will advance replacement of impervious surface with greenspace and pervious surfaces. (Note, \"green street \" is a stormwater management approach that incorporates vegetation, soil, and engineered systems to slow, filter, and cleanse stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces; \"complete street \" is a design approach that requires streets to be designed to support safe, convenient and comfortable travel and access for users of all ages and abilities regardless of their mode of transportation; \"living street \" combines the concepts of complete streets and green streets while putting additional focus on quality of life aspects for City residents ) Co-Benefits of Strategy: Actions Implementation Phase Improved Community Resilience Improved Quality of Life Safer Streets G4-A- 1 Create a \"Living Streets\" policy (Living Streets combines the concepts of complete streets and green streets, and also puts additional focus on quality of life aspects for City residents) to guide current and future street construction, reconstruction, and maintenance projects within the City. 1 G4-A- 2 Use green infrastructure such as bioswales, permeable pavement, other pervious sur- faces to reduce flood risk and minimize sediment entry into creeks from trails and roads. 2 Improved Community Equity Strategy G 4 -B: Increase water uptake capacity of greenspace. How We'll Measure Progress: Status of policy development and implementation; greenspace and tree coverage Increasing soil capacities for water uptake, particularly in sections of the city with high flood and flash flood risks, increases the capacity for stormwater management in place and reduces the risks or severity of flooding impacts. Use of best practices like biochar soil amendments and soil profile rebuild- ing at building and road construction sites can improve the capacity of greenspace. Co-Benefits of Strategy: Protected / Enhanced Ecosystems Improved Community Resilience Actions Implementation Phase Improved Quality of Life Improved Community Equity Greenspace and Ecosystem Health Bloomington Climate Action Plan 108 G4-B- 1 Implement a policy requiring a biochar (a carbon -rich product resulting from the pyroly- sis of organic residues) soil amendment for all City building and earth working construc- tion sites. Encourage biochar soil amendment use for private sector construction and earth working construction sites. Biochar improves soil carbon sequestration and builds carbon content of topsoil, and improves water retention and permeability characteris- tics. 1 G4-B- 2 Implement a policy to require soil profile rebuilding at new tree installations at all City building project sites or compacted soil conditions to reduce erosion and runoff con- taminated with fertilizers, increase soil carbon stores and support long -term soil build- ing.

Make your backyard a Certified Wildlife Habitat with the National Wildlife Federation. www.nwf.org/ garden -for-wildlife/certify Remove pavement and increase permeable surfaces. De -pave areas wherever possible to encourage stormwater infiltration onsite. Install bioswales/rain gardens or rainwater diversion systems to reduce impact on the stormwater sys- tem. Install a Green Roof (living roof) to reduce your energy consumption. Decrease heat island impacts, and reduce stormwater runoff. Bloomington Climate Action Plan 109 Section 09 Climate Economy Click here to return to TOC 111 Climate Hazards In many sectors, climate change will impact water and energy consumption and costs. Extreme weather and increasing variability in temperatures and precipitation may stress transportation sys- tems and fleets. Increasing extreme weather haz- ards may threaten supply material and product supply chains. Opportunities Climate mitigation strategies like transformation of Bloomington 's energy system, improvements to the energy efficiency of the city 's building stock, enhancement of transportation alterna- tives, and the implementation of goals like tree canopy increases and reduction to impervious surfaces represent opportunities for the devel- opment of new businesses and job creation. Climate Economy Why Climate Economy Is Important Climate change impacts are increasingly affecting the economy. Left unabated, the impacts of man -made cli- mate change through the end of this century will cost the United States billions of dollars. According to a 2019 EPA study, the discrepancy in climate change related economic impact society faces under a \"business -as- usual \" scenario and meeting the reduction goal established in the Paris Agreement may account for as much as $224 billion difference in climate related economic impact annually by 2090. According to a 2019 World Bank report on carbon pricing trends, a carbon price range of $40 -$80 per ton is necessary by 2020 to reach the goals set by the 2015 Paris Agreement, while other studies have placed the full cost of carbon at $200 -$400 per ton. The calculations outlined in Section 1 of this plan estimate a conservative localized cost for carbon at over $116 per ton. The economy is also directly affected by actions taken to combat climate change, as well. Many that are ad- verse to taking action on climate cite damage to the economy as a reason for inaction. Evidence continues to build that action can be taken on climate that strengthens economic growth, while also reducing emissions. That has occurred in Bloomington. While the city 's GDP has increased 59%, Bloomington has experienced com- munity GHG emissions decrease by 18%. Between 2018 and 2028, there are projected to be 8,936 new jobs annually in Monroe County, 8,455 projected to be replacement openings (Job Postings by County, IN Department of Workforce Development). Though high- er-wage sectors of life sciences, technology and healthcare have potential as growing sectors, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 89% of the jobs in the Bloomington metropolitan area are in the following areas of employment: manufacturing; trade, transportation, and utilities; professional and business services; education and health services; leisure and hospitality; and government. \"Climate Economy \" refers to an economy that is both resilient to the projected impacts of climate change, as well as supportive of reducing community -wide emissions in line with the goals of the Climate Action Plan. Many of the climate actions included in this plan can reduce Bloomington 's contributions to global emissions, deal with the risks posed by climate change, while achieving economic growth and opportunity. Transformative change is needed now in how we build our cities, produce and use energy, transport people and goods, and manage our landscapes. The changes that climate change will require also represent opportunities to improve quality of life, improve health outcomes, and provide opportunities for workforce development, new job crea- tion, and economic development. Climate Change Considerations Bloomington Climate Action Plan 112 Climate Economy Equity Considerations Low income individuals in our communities are especially prone to the impacts of climate change and bear a greatly disproportionate share of the costs \u2014including vulnerability to job instability that can be brought about by extreme weather events and other climate change impacts. Income inequality is rising in the US, with September 2019 levels being the highest in 50 years. High ine- quality leads to lower life spans, increased instances of mental health issues, and increased obesity rates among other social impacts. Because the impacts and the costs of climate change are disproportionately felt by vulnerable populations and low -income individuals, climate change impacts will exacerbate income inequality in our communities. Sector Goals Sector goals are established to both support the City's Climate Action Plan in creating a climate resilient community and to reduce city -wide GHG emissions 25% below 2018 levels by 2030. Sector goals related to GHG emissions reductions are designed to balance reduction across all sec- tors and achieve the overall emissions goals set forth for the community. The goals seek to strike a balance between achievability while also reach- ing for improvement beyond business -as-usual. As indicated in the introduction, the Climate Ac- tion Plan is intended to be a 10 year plan to be updated at the completion of that time. Consequently, the goals and strategies out- lined in this section are intended to be achieved by 2030 unless otherwise noted. Implementation of actions are anticipated to be initiated over 3 phases: phase 1 within 1 -3 years, phase 2 within 2 -5 years, and phase 3 within 4 -8 years of CAP approval.

Section 10 Climate Action Implementation Click here to return to TOC 121 Climate Action Implementation The first few years after plan adoption are critical to its success. Establishing roles, both internal and external, and identifying funding will help establish the implementation phase of the plan and ensure the community is on track to achieve its goals. This plan includes robust goals for significant GHG emission reductions and ad- dressing climate resilience. This vision require commitment and integration of the CAP into City operations, functions, and services. Implementation is For Everyone Implementation actions are detailed items that should be completed in order to carry out the vision and strate- gies identified in the plan. Some actions will need to be led by City Council, city departments, and/or the busi- ness community; and there are some things that households and individuals can do to make an impact. While many actions will require City Council to amend a policy there will be opportunities for businesses, organiza- tions, households, and individuals to support the City Council policy changes and provide input on and feed- back on those policies. Ultimately, achieving the visionary energy efficiency, renewable energy, alternative transportation, and climate resilience goals outlined in this plan will require engagement and a sense of re- sponsibility not only by the City of Bloomington leadership and government, but by the community itself as well. It is critical for all to remain engaged and active, advancing and advocating for actions you feel are im- portant. General Implementation Recommendations The following are foundational recommendations to support the long -range implementation of the CAP: Building Internal Capacity Continuing to build internal capacity will be important to help establish the CAP as a priority integral to internal operations as well as fostering connections to community partners, businesses, and individuals through out- reach, education, special projects, and service delivery. 1. Establish clear guidance and direction for the participation in and support of the CAP implementation ac- tions by all City of Bloomington departments. 2. Fund and support Sustainability staffing required to: Facilitate discussion among large users to reduce emissions through business and industrial strategies. Participate in technical resource programs as they are available through County, State, Federal, and non-profit provider partners. Support City of Bloomington department managers and staff as they implement CAP actions within their service area or area of expertise. Convene an internal City climate working group that meets regularly and provides updates on progress and success, identifies additional support or resources needed to advance actions of the CAP, and col- laboratively discusses strategies for more complex challenges. Ensure the establishment and maintenance of a City of Bloomington Climate Action webpage sup- porting CAP resources for the community. Coordinate and organize volunteer groups and events. Engage city boards and commissions (e.g., Environmental Commission, Tree Commission, Commission on Sustainability, Park Department 's Environmental Resources Advisory Council, Planning Commission, City Council Climate Action & Resilience Committee, etc.) to ensure the CAP is integrated into their work plans. 3. Review Climate Action Plan implementation progress and impacts on a regular basis (1 -2 year cycle). Review should include development of an updated community wide GHG inventory. Strategies and actions should be reviewed for implementation progress and for continued appropriateness. Based on the review, adjust, add, and remove detailed CAP actions as appropriate. Bloomington Climate Action Plan 122 Bloomington Climate Action Plan 123 Climate Action Implementation External Support City staff and elected officials will not be able to implement this plan without robust support from community members and coordination with jurisdictional, institutional, and organizational partners. 1. Establish the Commission on Sustainability as the main citizen -body to support the implementation of the CAP: Form subcommittees that focus on particular areas of the CAP. Coordinate with City staff in all relevant departments to receive updates on City projects and progress. 2. Establish a designated Council representative participant in the City 's internal climate working group in support of CAP implementation. 3. Establish a coordinated communication and education campaign supporting the educational and informa- tional actions included in each of the CAP sections. The campaign should also look to help community members: Understand why change at the individual, community, city, and business level needs to occur, How to make those changes correctly, and What the benefit/incentive to them might be, for example, articulating that switching to solar energy and or an electric bus fleet might help reduce bills 2. Establish jurisdictional partnerships that advance CAP strategies to advance and accelerate action. This can include government entities like Monroe County, the State of Indiana, conservation districts, utilities like Duke Energy and Vectren; institutions like Indiana University; Bloomington businesses, and community groups. Funding Funding the implementation of the CAP will require reallocation/reconsideration of existing City funds, raising new City funds, and identifying outside resources and funding opportunities. Some funds will need to be dedi- cated toward long -term support like staffing, while other funding will be on a project -by-project basis. 1. Maintain a budget and identify funding sources for staff dedicated to the implementation of the CAP. 2. Identify a budget necessary to support projects on an annual basis as per the detailed actions outlined in the Climate Economy section of the plan and climate actions. 3. Utilize no -cost technical assistance offerings as available.

Bloomington GHG Inventories 2008 & 2018 GHG Emissions (MTCO 2e) Year Source 2008 2018 Electricity 1,045,212 Natural 100,082 33,334 Total 1,532,117 1,290,493 Business as Usual to 2050 Business as Usual (BAU) GHG emissions are modeled by applying demographic and other trend data to the emissions inventory to develop projected emissions levels that could occur in 2025, 2030 and 2050 without additional climate action in Bloomington. These years were chosen because they are the years of Bloomington's emissions reduction target s. The BAU shows that the city's community wide emissions footprint could fall to 677,164 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO 2e) by 2050 (Figure 1 & Table 2). This would be less than half of Bloomington's 2008 emissions. These changes come from a national move away from fossil fuels in the electricity grid, increased automobile and appliance efficiencies, and changes energy demand. These trends are due to technology improvements, corporate climate commitmen ts, federal regulations, climate shifts, and other systemic changes. The projected emissions decrease will be important in supporting Bloomington's climate commitments, but Bloomington will not meet its stated goals without taking further action to reduce emissions. The BAU projection is meant to be a guide for action planning by showing the gen eral direction of emissions by sector. There is significant uncertainty in the BAU. Furthermore, the BAU is not a replacement for regular emissions tracking and program evaluation. As Bloomington implements 1 Bloomington ClearPath Account. Data accessed August 2020. 2 climate action it should inventory emissions and make sure climate strategies are achieving intended savings. Figure 1. Bloomington Business as Usual GHG Projection (MT CO2e) Electricity Carbon Intensity the Biggest Change By far, the largest source of change in emissions in the BAU comes from the decarbonization of the electricity grid that serves Bloomington. As carbonintensive sources of power, like coal, have been decommissioned the average GHG emissions associated with a kilowatthour (kWh) of ele ctricity used in Bloomington has fallen in recent years. This is expected to continue if the major electricity supplier for the area, Duke Energy, meets its goals of cutting GHG emissions 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 and to \"net zero\" emissions by 2050.2 This projected change in the electricity supply also impacts Bloomington's Water & Wastewater emissions, which include emissions associated with electricity to operate the water and wastewater systems. Waste Emissions Largest Projected BAU Increase The largest increase in GHG emissions in the BAU is from solid waste. Bloomington is projected to have significan t population growth through 2050, so if waste generation and management practices are not changed the emissions from solid waste will grow too. 2 https://www.duke energy.com/_/media/pdfs/our YearBloomington Business as Usual Emissions Transportation Waste Water & Wastewater Other Other Industrial Energy Natural Gas Electricity3 Table 2. Bloomington BAU GHG Emissions (MTCO 2e) Year Change Change Share of 56% 100% Data and Assumptions The assumptions for each projection by emissions source are described below. Population Bloomington is projected to see a 52% population growth between 2008 and 2050 to over 118,000 residents in the BAU scenario. This will impact the level of activity throughout the city. The BAU uses Bloomington's 2018 popul ation of 86,522 and applies a 1% annual increase to that value. This is in line with recent growth and the average growth in Monroe County from STATS Indiana from 20002050.3 Electricity The Bloomington GHG Inventory uses the grid average emissions factor from the US EPA's eGRID database for the RFC West subregion. As mentioned, the BAU incorporates Duke Energy's 50% reduction below 2005 by 2030 and net zero by 2050 climate goals. Net zero typically means that there are still some fossil fuel emissions in th e system that are being offset some other way. The BAU assumes 10% of GHG emissions per kWh remaining in 2050 based on Duke Energy's plan to maintain 6% natural gas and 30% other energy sources.4 3 http://www.stats.indiana.edu/pop_proj/ An alternative method for projecting Bloomington's population would be a proportional value of the county projection. STATS Indiana projects a population of 180,159 residents for Monroe County in 2050, which if weighted proportionally to 2018 would mean 106,000 Bloomington residents in 2050. The BAU uses the higher number of 118,000 for the sake of capturing the full potential climate im pact of population growth. 4 https://www.axios.com/duke energycarbonfree18a6b5b7 28294fe5a445e940edf26b76.html 4 Table 3. Electricity Carbon Intensity Year 2005 2008 2018 2025 2030 2050 50% 90% As climate change increases high heat days in Bloomington the demand for air conditioning is expected to increase electricity use. This is measured in \"cooling degree days\", which are projected to rise 42% by 2050.5 The BAU applies this change to 20% of the electricity activity to approximate the share of electricity use that may be for space cooling. The electricity BAU projection incorporates the projected population growth for Bloomington. Combining these factors, the electricity demand in Bloomington is projected to increase from 1.5 million kWh in 2018 to 1.9 million kWh in 2030 and 2.4 millio n kWh in 2050, but emissions associated with this activity decline as the electricity grid becomes less carbon intensive. Natural Gas Climate change is anticipated to reduce the need for space heating in Bloomington. \"Heating degree days\" are projected to de cline 14% by 2050. The BAU applies this change to 75% of the natural gas use to approximate the share of natural gas used for heating.6 The natural gas BAU estimate incorporates the projected population growth for Bloomington and total usage grows to 25 million therms by 2050. The carbonintensity of natural gas stays constant through the BAU projection. Other Industrial Energy In the Bloomington GHG inventory \"Other Industrial Energy\" is energy used at the IU Central Heating Plant . As described in the 2018 GHG Inventory, emissions at this facility have decreased with fuel switching from coal to natural gas in recent years. The 2018 emission level is projected to stay flat through 2050 under BAU. 5 See weighted mean of RCP 8.5 projections https://crt climate explorer.nemac.org/local climate charts/?county=Monroe%2BCounty&city=Bloomington%2C%20IN&fips=18105&lat=39.165325&lon= 86.52638569999999&zoom=7&nav=local climatecharts&id=cdd_65f 6 See weighted https://crt climate explorer.nemac.org/local climate charts/?county=Monroe%2BCounty&city=Bloomington%2C%20IN&fips=18105&lat=39.165325&lon= 86.52638569999999&zoom=7&nav=local climatecharts&id=cdd_65f 5 Transportation Transportation emissions in the Bloomington GHG Inventory are comprised of gasoline and diesel use by onroad vehicle travel, transit vehicle fuel use, aviation emissions at the Monroe County Airport, and off road activities, such as construction equipment. Emissions from nontransit gasoline and diesel vehicles were 70% of Bloomingto n's transportation emissions in 2018. Onroad vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in Bloomington were 293 million miles in 2018 and the BAU scenario applies the average annual population increase to this going forward, resulting in 415 million miles in 2050. Vehicle efficiency has been improving nationwide, and the Energy Information Agency's An nual Energy Outlook (EIA AEO) projects that trend will continue. The BAU projection uses a weighted average fuel economy for gasoline passenger vehicles and diesel heavy trucks to estimate that fossil fuel vehicles on the road in 2050 will average 31.5 miles per gallon (mpg).7 The carbonintensity of gasoline and diesel fuel stay constant through the BAU projection. In addition, national projections expect an increased uptake of electric vehicles in coming years. The Edison Electric Institute has estimated that electric vehicle will be 7% of all vehicles on the road in the country by 2030.8 Sales of electric vehicles in Indiana have been lower than national averages todate, so the BAU projection assumes a lower share of EVs in Bloomington\u20142% of vehicle miles traveled by 2025, 3.5% by 2030, and 9% by 2050.9 The efficiency of electric vehicles is held constant at 30 kWh per 100 miles.10 The emissions associated with other transportation sources are held constant at 2018 levels. Taken together these trends result in a decrease in transportation related emissions even as VMT grows in the city. 7 https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/appa.pdf 8 of EVs will improve over coming years but will also be counterweighted by the introduction of additional larger vehicle types. 6 Table 4. Transportation Emissions Projections Year 2008 2018 2025 MPG 19.1 19.5 23.5 26.2 31.5 Gallons of Fuel (Gasoline & Diesel) 14,237,620 15,040,733 7% Waste Emissions associated with solid waste disposal and treatment are scaled based on population growth projections. Water and Wastewater In 2018, 88% of the emissions associated with water and wastewater are due to electricity use in the system. As discussed in the electricity section above, the decarbonization of the electricity grid is projected to eliminate many of these emissions. The BAU li nks future water and wastewater electricity use and wastewater N2O emissions to population growth in Bloomington. The net result is a 63% reduction in emissions from these sources to 5,408 MTCO 2e in 2050. Other Emissions The fugitive emissions associated with natural gas and the transmission and distribution emissions associated with electricity were 3.26% and 3.87% respectively in 2018. The BAU projection applies these same shares to natural gas and electricity going forward. Secon A2 Glossary of Terms Click here to return to TOC Climate and Sustainability Glossary of Terms 1 A Activity Data Data on the magnitude of a human activity resulting in emissions or removals taking place during a given period of time. Data on energy use, metal production, land areas, management systems, lime and fertilizer use and waste arisings are examples of activity data. ( IPCC ) Aerosols A collection of airborne solid or liquid particles, with a typical size between 0.01 and 10 micrometer that reside in the atmosphere for at least several hours. Aerosols may be of either natural or anthropogenic origin. Aerosols may influence climate in several ways: directly through scattering and absorbing radiation, and indirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei or modifying the optical properties and lifetime of clouds. ( IPCC2 ) Afforestation Planting of new forests on lands that historically have not contained forests. ( IPCC2 ) Air Pollutant Any man-made and/or natural substance occurring in the atmosphere that may result in adverse effects to humans, animals, vegetation, and/or materials. ( CARB) Anthropogenic The term \"anthropogenic\", in the context of greenhouse gas inventories, refers to greenhouse gas emissions and removals that are a direct result of human activities or are the result of natural processes that have been affected by human activities. ( USEPA2 ) Atmosphere The gaseous envelope surrounding the Earth. The dry atmosphere consists almost entirely of nitrogen (78.1% volume mixing ratio) and oxygen (20.9% volume mixing ratio), together with a number of trace gases, such as argon (0.93% volume mixing ratio), helium and radiatively active greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (0.035% volume mixing ratio) and ozone. In addition, the atmosphere contains the greenhouse gas water vapor, whose amounts are highly variable but typically around 1% volume mixing ratio. The atmosphere also contains clouds and aerosols. ( IPCC2 ) B Baseline Emissions A baseline is a measurement, calculation, or time used as a basis for comparison. Baseline emissions are the level of emissions that would occur without policy intervention or without implementation of a project. Baseline estimates are needed to determine the effectiveness of emission reduction programs (also called mitigation strategies). Base Year The starting year for the inventory. Targets for reducing GHG emissions are often defined in relation to the base year. Biogenic Produced by the biological processes of living organisms. Note that we use the term \"biogenic\" to refer only to recently produced (that is non-fossil) material of biological origin. IPCC guidelines recommend that peat be treated as a fossil carbon because it takes a long time to replace harvested peat. Biogeochemical Cycle Movements through the Earth system of key chemical constituents essential to life, such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus. ( NASA )Climate and Sustainability Glossary of Terms 2 Biomass Either (1) the total mass of living organisms in a given area or of a given species usually expressed as dry weight; or (2) Organic matter consisting of or recently derived from living organisms (especially regarded as fuel) excluding peat. Includes products, by-products and waste derived from such material. (IPCC1) Biomass Waste Organic non-fossil material of biological origin that is a byproduct or a discarded product. \"Biomass waste\" includes municipal solid waste from biogenic sources, landfill gas, sludge waste, agricultural crop byproducts, straw, and other biomass solids, liquids, and gases; but excludes wood and wood-derived fuels (including black liquor), biofuels feedstock, biodiesel, and fuel ethanol. Note: EIA \"biomass waste\" data also include energy crops grown specifically for energy production, which would not normally constitute waste. ( EIA) Black Carbon Operationally defined aerosol species based on measurement of light absorption and chemical reactivity and/or thermal stability; consists of soot, charcoal and/or possible light absorbing refractory organic matter (Charlson and Heintzenberg, 1995, p. 401). ( IPCC2 ) C Carbon Cycle All parts (reservoirs) and fluxes of carbon. The cycle is usually thought of as four main reservoirs of carbon interconnected by pathways of exchange. The reservoirs are the atmosphere, terrestrial biosphere (usually includes freshwater systems), oceans, and sediments (includes fossil fuels). The annual movements of carbon, the carbon exchanges between reservoirs, occur because of various chemical, physical, geological, and biological processes. The ocean contains the largest pool of carbon near the surface of the Earth, but most of that pool is not involved with rapid exchange with the atmosphere. ( NASA ) Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) A naturally occurring gas, and also a by-product of burning fossil fuels and biomass, as well as land-use changes and other industrial processes. It is the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas that affects the Earth's radiative balance. It is the reference gas against which other greenhouse gases are measured and therefore has a Global Warming Potential of 1. ( IPCC2 )\\ Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (CO 2e) A metric used to compare emissions of various greenhouse gases. It is the mass of carbon dioxide that would produce the same estimated radiative forcing as a given mass of another greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide equivalents are computed by multiplying the mass of the gas emitted by its global warming potential. Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) An international organization that administers a platform for organizations and cities to publicly disclose their environmental impacts, such as climate risk. CDP is one of the approved disclosure platforms utilized by GCoM. Carbon Emissions The release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Primary human sources of the release of carbon dioxide occur from burning oil, coal, and gas for energy use. Carbon Equivalent (CE) A metric measure used to compare the emissions of the different greenhouse gases based upon their global warming potential. Carbon equivalents can be calculated from to carbon dioxide equivalents by multiplying the carbon dioxide equivalents by 12/44 (the ratio of the molecular weight of carbon to that of carbon dioxide). The use of carbon equivalent is declining in GHG inventories.Climate and Sustainability Glossary of Terms 3 Carbon Intensity The amount of carbon by weight emitted per unit of energy consumed. A common measure of carbon intensity is weight of carbon per British thermal unit (Btu) of energy. When there is only one fossil fuel under consideration, the carbon intensity and the emissions coefficient are identical. When there are several fuels, carbon intensity is based on their combined emissions coefficients weighted by their energy consumption levels. ( EIA) Carbon Neutrality For the purposes of the Plan, Carbon Neutrality refers to the point at which the organization / organization's net greenhouse gas emissions reach 0. This will likely be achieved through a combination of reducing emission sources and offsetting and sequestering any remaining emissions. Carbon Sinks A forest, ocean, or other natural environment viewed in terms of its ability to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Carbon Sequestration This refers to the capture of CO 2 from the atmosphere and its long term storage in oceans (oceanic carbon sequestration), in biomass and soils (terrestrial carbon sequestration) or in underground reservoirs (geologic carbon sequestration). Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) Greenhouse gases covered under the 1987 Montreal Protocol and used for refrigeration, air conditioning, packaging, insulation, solvents, or aerosol propellants. Because they are not destroyed in the lower atmosphere, CFCs drift into the upper atmosphere where, given suitable conditions, they break down ozone. These gases are being replaced by other compounds, including hydrochlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons, which are greenhouse gases covered under the Kyoto Protocol. ( IPCC3 ) Circular Economy An alternative to a traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose) in which an economy is a regenerative system where resource input and waste are minimized. This is achieved through long-lasting product design, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling. Circular economy strategies are often cited as systems level approaches to reducing waste generation through product and system design. Climate Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the \"average weather\" or more rigorously as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These relevant quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system. ( IPCC2 ) Climate Adaptation or Resilience The capacity of a natural environment to prevent, withstand, respond to, and recover from a disruption. The process of adjusting to new climate conditions in order to reduce risks to valued assets. Climate Change Climate change refers to a statistically significant variation in either the mean state of the climate or in its variability, persisting for an extended period (typically decades or longer). Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings, or to persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. ( IPCC2 )Climate and Sustainability Glossary of Terms 4 Climate Hazard An extreme climate event or condition that can harm human health, livelihoods, or natural resources. It can include abrupt changes to the climate system such as extreme precipitation, storms, droughts, and heat waves. Climate Risk The potential for consequences where something of value is at stake and where the outcome is uncertain, recognizing the diversity of values. Risk is often represented as probability of occurrence of hazardous events or trends multiplied by the impacts if these events or trends occur. Risk results from the interaction of vulnerability and hazard. (IPCC): Climate Vulnerability Is the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude and rate of climate change and variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its capacity to adapt. Vulnerability = potential impact (sensitivity x exposure) - adaptive capacity (IPCC): Climate Vulnerability Assessment A report used to identify and define the risks posed by climate change and inform adaptation measures needed to combat climate change. Reports can be about a wide range of fields including food security, poverty analysis, and extreme weather events. Cogeneration Cogeneration is an industrial structure, installation, plant, building, or self-generating facility that has sequential or simultaneous generation of multiple forms of useful energy (usually mechanical and thermal) in a single, integrated system. ( CARB ) Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Combined heat and power is the simultaneous production of both electricity and useful heat for application by the producer or to be sold to other users with the aim of better utilisation of the energy used. Public utilities may utilise part of the heat produced in power plants and sell it for public heating purposes. Industries as auto- producers may sell part of the excess electricity produced to other industries or to electric utilities. ( IPCC ) Community Solar Solar facilities shared by multiple community subscribers who receive credit on their electricity bills for their share of the power produced. Community solar allows members of a community to share the benefits of solar power on their property without installing it on their own property. Electricity generated by the community solar farm typically costs less than the price from utility companies. Consistency Consistency means that an inventory should be internally consistent in all its elements over a period of years. An inventory is consistent if the same methodologies are used for the base and all subsequent years and if consistent data sets are used to estimate emissions or removals from sources or sinks. ( IPCC ) Continuous Emission Monitor (CEM) A type of air emission monitoring system installed to operate continuously inside of a smokestack or other emission source. ( CARB ) Criteria Air Pollutant An air pollutant for which acceptable levels of exposure can be determined and for which an ambient air quality standard has been set. Examples include: ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and PM10 andClimate and Sustainability Glossary of Terms 5 PM2.5. The term \"criteria air pollutants\" derives from the requirement that the U.S. EPA must describe the characteristics and potential health and welfare effects of these pollutants. The U.S. EPA and CARB periodically review new scientific data and may propose revisions to the standards as a result. ( CARB ) D Deforestation Those practices or processes that result in the change of forested lands to non-forest uses. This is often cited as one of the major causes of the enhanced greenhouse effect for two reasons: 1) the burning or decomposition of the wood releases carbon dioxide; and 2) trees that once removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the process of photosynthesis are no longer present and contributing to carbon storage. ( UNFCC ) Distillate Fuel Oil A general classification for one of the petroleum fractions produced in conventional distillation operations. It includes diesel fuels and fuel oils. Products known as No. 1, No. 2, and No. 4 diesel fuel are used in on-highway diesel engines, such as those in trucks and automobiles, as well as off-highway engines, such as those in railroad locomotives and agricultural machinery. Products known as No. 1, No. 2, and No. 4 fuel oils are used primarily for space heating and electric power generation. ( EIA) E Emissions The release of a substance (usually a gas when referring to the subject of climate change) into the atmosphere. (USEPA1 ) Emission Factor A coefficient that quantifies the emissions or removals of a gas per unit activity. Emission factors are often based on a sample of measurement data, averaged to develop a representative rate of emission for a given activity level under a given set of operating conditions. ( IPCC ) Emission Inventory An estimate of the amount of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere from major mobile, stationary, area-wide, and natural source categories over a specific period of time such as a day or a year. ( CARB ) Emission Rate The weight of a pollutant emitted per unit of time (e.g., tons / year). ( CARB ) Environmental Justice The fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies Estimation Estimation is the assessment of the value of an unmeasurable quantity using available data and knowledge within stated computational formulas or mathematical models. F Fluorocarbons Carbon-fluorine compounds that often contain other elements such as hydrogen, chlorine, or bromine. Common fluorocarbons include chlorofluorocarbons ( UNFCC )Climate and Sustainability Glossary of Terms 6 Flux Either (1) Raw materials, such as limestone, dolomite, lime, and silica sand, which are used to reduce the heat or other energy requirements of thermal processing of minerals (such as the smelting of metals). Fluxes also may serve a dual function as a slagging agent. (2) The rate of flow of any liquid or gas, across a given area; the amount of this crossing a given area in a given time. (e.g., \"Flux of CO2 absorbed by forests\"). ( IPCC ) Fossil Fuel Geologic deposits of hydrocarbons from ancient biological origin, such as coal, petroleum and natural gas. Fuel Combustion Fuel combustion is the intentional oxidation of materials within an apparatus that is designed to provide heat or mechanical work to a process, or for use away from the apparatus. ( IPCC ) Fugitive Emissions Emissions that are not emitted through an intentional release through stack or vent. This can include leaks from industrial plant and pipelines. ( IPCC ) G Geologic Carbon Sequestration It is the process of injecting CO 2 from a source, such as coal-fired electric generating power plant, through a well into the deep subsurface. With proper site selection and management, geologic sequestration could play a major role in reducing emissions of CO 2. Research efforts to evaluate the technical aspects of CO 2 geologic sequestration are underway. ( USEPA4 ) Global Warming Global warming is an average increase in the temperature of the atmosphere near the Earth's surface and in the troposphere, which can contribute to changes in global climate patterns. Global warming can occur from a variety of causes, both natural and human induced. In common usage, \"global warming\" often refers to the warming that can occur as a result of increased emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities. Also see Climate Change (USEPA1 ) Global Warming Potential (GWP) An index, based upon radiative properties of well-mixed greenhouse gases, measuring the radiative forcing of a unit mass of a given well-mixed greenhouse gas in the present-day atmosphere integrated over a chosen time horizon, relative to that of carbon dioxide. The GWP represents the combined effect of the differing times these gases remain in the atmosphere and their relative effectiveness in absorbing outgoing thermal infrared radiation. The Kyoto Protocol is based on GWPs from pulse emissions over a 100-year time frame. ( IPCC2 ) GCOM Global Covenant of Mayors: GCoM is the largest global alliance for city climate leadership, built upon the commitment of over 10,000 cities and local governments. The alliance's mission is to mobilize and support climate and energy action in communities across the world. Greenhouse Effect Trapping and build-up of heat in the atmosphere (troposphere) near the earth's surface. Some of the heat flowing back toward space from the earth's surface is absorbed by water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, and several other gases in the atmosphere and then reradiated back toward the earth's surface. If the atmospheric concentrations of these greenhouse gases rise, the average temperature of the lower atmosphere will gradually increase. ( UNFCC )Climate and Sustainability Glossary of Terms 7 Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories: A robust, transparent and globally-accepted framework that cities and local governments can use to consistently identify, calculate and report on city greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse Gas Any gas that absorbs infrared radiation in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases include, but are not limited to, water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2O), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6). (UNFCC ) Green Infrastructure An approach to managing precipitation by reducing and treating stormwater at its source while delivering environmental, social, and economic benefits. Stormwater runoff can carry trash, bacteria, and other pollutants and is a major cause of water pollution in urban areas. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) The sum of gross value added, at purchasers' prices, by all resident and non-resident producers in the economy, plus any taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products in a country or a geographic region for a given period, normally one year. It is calculated without deducting for depreciation of fabricated assets or depletion and degradation of natural resources. ( IPCC3 ) H Halocarbons A collective term for the group of partially halogenated organic species, including the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), halons, methyl chloride, methyl bromide, etc. Many of the halocarbons have large Global Warming Potentials. The chlorine and bromine-containing halocarbons are also involved in the depletion of the ozone layer. ( IPCC2 ) Hydrocarbons Strictly defined as molecules containing only hydrogen and carbon. The term is often used more broadly to include any molecules in petroleum which also contains molecules with S, N, or O An unsaturated hydrocarbon is any hydrocarbon containing olefinic or aromatic structures. ( IPCC ) Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) Compounds containing only hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon atoms. They were introduced as alternatives to ozone depleting substances in serving many industrial, commercial, and personal needs. HFCs are emitted as by-products of industrial processes and are also used in manufacturing. They do not significantly deplete the stratospheric ozone layer, but they are powerful greenhouse gases with global warming potentials ranging from 140 (HFC-152a) to 11,700 (HFC-23). ( USEPA1 ) I ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability: A membership organization for local governments to pursue reductions in carbon pollution and improvements in advancing sustainable urban development. ICLEI's members and team of experts work together through peer exchange, partnerships and capacity building to create systemic change for urban sustainability. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change The IPCC was established jointly by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization in 1988. The purpose of the IPCC is to assess information in the scientific and technical literature related to all significant components of the issue of climate change. The IPCC draws upon hundreds of the world's expert scientists as authors and thousands as expert reviewers. Leading experts on climate change and environmental, social, and economic sciences from some 60 nations have helped the IPCC to prepare periodic assessments of the scientific underpinnings for understanding global climate change and its consequences. With itsClimate and Sustainability Glossary of Terms 8 capacity for reporting on climate change, its consequences, and the viability of adaptation and mitigation measures, the IPCC is also looked to as the official advisory body to the world's governments on the state of the science of the climate change issue. For example, the IPCC organized the development of internationally accepted methods for conducting national greenhouse gas emission inventories. ( USEPA1 ) K Kilowatt Hour (kWh): A measure of electrical energy equivalent to a power consumption of 1,000 watts for one hour. Kyoto Protocol The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, at the Third Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC. It contains legally binding commitments, in addition to those included in the UNFCCC. Countries included in Annex B of the Protocol (most Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries and countries with economies in transition) agreed to reduce their anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride) by at least 5% below 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 to 2012. The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005. ( IPCC2 ) L Land Use and Land Use Change Land use refers to the total of arrangements, activities and inputs undertaken in a certain land cover type (a set of human actions). The term land use is also used in the sense of the social and economic purposes for which land is managed (e.g., grazing, timber extraction and conservation). Land use change refers to a change in the use or management of land by humans, which may lead to a change in land cover. Land cover and land use change may have an impact on the surface albedo, evapotranspiration, sources and sinks of greenhouse gases, or other properties of the climate system and may thus have a radiative forcing and/or other impacts on climate, locally or globally. ( IPCC2 ) LULUCF Acronym for \"Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry\", a category of activities in GHG inventories. M Megawatt Hour (MWH): A measure of electrical energy equivalent to a power consumption of 1,000,000 watts for one hour. Methane (CH 4) A hydrocarbon that is a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential most recently estimated at 25 times that of carbon dioxide (CO 2). Methane is produced through anaerobic (without oxygen) decomposition of waste in landfills, flooded rice fields, animal digestion, decomposition of animal wastes, production and distribution of natural gas and petroleum, coal production, and incomplete fossil fuel combustion. The GWP is from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Metric Ton The tonne (t) or metric ton, sometimes referred to as a metric tonne, is an international unit of mass. A metric ton is equal to a Megagram (Mg), 1000 kilograms, 2204.6 pounds, or 1.1023 short tons. Million Metric Tons (MMT) Common measurement used in GHG inventories. It is equal to a Teragram (Tg).Climate and Sustainability Glossary of Terms 9 Mitigation : Actions taken to limit the magnitude or rate of long-term global warming and its related effects. Climate change mitigation generally involves reductions in human emissions of greenhouse gases. Mobile Sources Sources of air pollution such as automobiles, motorcycles, trucks, off-road vehicles, boats, and airplanes. ( CARB) Mode Share The percentage of travelers using a particular type of transportation. Modal share is an important component in developing sustainable transport within a city or region because it reveals the level of utilization of various transportation methods. The percentage reflects how well infrastructure, policies, investments, and land-use patterns support different types of travel. Model A model is a quantitatively-based abstraction of a real-world situation which may simplify or neglect certain features to better focus on its more important elements. ( IPCC ) Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Residential solid waste and some non-hazardous commercial, institutional, and industrial wastes. This material is generally sent to municipal landfills for disposal. ( USEPA1 ) N Natural Sources Non-manmade emission sources, including biological and geological sources, wildfires, and windblown dust. (CARB) Net-zero Emissions (NZE) Building A building or property that generates or offsets all energy consumed. If the City develops a NZE building code, this definition will have to be refined to provide additional guidance on calculating emissions and offsets to achieve net-zero emissions. Nitrogen Fixation Conversion of atmospheric nitrogen gas into forms useful to plants and other organisms by lightning, bacteria, and blue-green algae; it is part of the nitrogen cycle. ( UNFCC ) Nitrogen Oxides (NO x) Gases consisting of one molecule of nitrogen and varying numbers of oxygen molecules. Nitrogen oxides are produced in the emissions of vehicle exhausts and from power stations. In the atmosphere, nitrogen oxides can contribute to formation of photochemical ozone (smog), can impair visibility, and have health consequences; they are thus considered pollutants. ( NASA ) Nitrous Oxide (N 2O) A powerful greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of 298 times that of carbon dioxide (CO 2). Major sources of nitrous oxide include soil cultivation practices, especially the use of commercial and organic fertilizers, manure management, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production, and biomass burning. The GWP is from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). O Ozone (O 3) Ozone, the triatomic form of oxygen (O 3), is a gaseous atmospheric constituent. In the troposphere, it is created both naturally and by photochemical reactions involving gases resulting from human activities (smog).Climate and Sustainability Glossary of Terms 10 Tropospheric ozone acts as a greenhouse gas. In the stratosphere, it is created by the interaction between solar ultraviolet radiation and molecular oxygen (O 2). Stratospheric ozone plays a dominant role in the stratospheric radiative balance. Its concentration is highest in the ozone layer. ( IPCC2 ) Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) A compound that contributes to stratospheric ozone depletion. Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) include CFCs, HCFCs, halons, methyl bromide, carbon tetrachloride, and methyl chloroform. ODS are generally very stable in the troposphere and only degrade under intense ultraviolet light in the stratosphere. When they break down, they release chlorine or bromine atoms, which then deplete ozone. ( IPCC ) P Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) A group of human-made chemicals composed of carbon and fluorine only. These chemicals (predominantly CF 4 and C2F6) were introduced as alternatives, along with hydrofluorocarbons, to the ozone depleting substances. In addition, PFCs are emitted as by-products of industrial processes and are also used in manufacturing. PFCs do not harm the stratospheric ozone layer, but they are powerful greenhouse gases: CF 4 has a global warming potential (GWP) of 7,390 and C 2F6 has a GWP of 12,200. The GWP is from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Photosynthesis The process by which plants take carbon dioxide from the air (or bicarbonate in water) to build carbohydrates, releasing oxygen in the process. There are several pathways of photosynthesis with different responses to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. ( IPCC2 ) Point Sources Specific points of origin where pollutants are emitted into the atmosphere such as factory smokestacks. ( CARB) Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) A power purchase agreement (PPA), or electricity power agreement, is a contract between two parties; one party generates electricity (the seller) and the other party looks to purchase electricity (the buyer). Individual customers and organizations may enter into PPAs with individual developers or may join together to seek better prices as a group. PPAs can allow longer term commitments to renewable energy as well as a form of \"direct\" investing in new renewable energy generation. Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) A program created for financing energy efficiency and renewable improvements on private property. Private property can include residential, commercial or industrial properties. Improvements can include energy efficiency, renewable energy and water conservation upgrades to a building. Process Emissions Emissions from industrial processes involving chemical transformations other than combustion. ( IPCC ) R Radiative Forcing A change in the balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared (i.e., thermal) radiation. Without any radiative forcing, solar radiation coming to the Earth would continue to be approximately equal to the infrared radiation emitted from the Earth. The addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere traps an increased fraction of the infrared radiation, reradiating it back toward the surface of the Earth and thereby creates a warming influence. ( UNFCC )Climate and Sustainability Glossary of Terms 11 Reforestation Planting of forests on lands that have previously contained forests but that have been converted to some other use. ( IPCC2 ) Regeneration The act of renewing tree cover by establishing young trees, naturally or artificially - note regeneration usually maintains the same forest type and is done promptly after the previous stand or forest was removed. ( CSU) Renewable Energy Energy resources that are naturally replenishing such as solar, wind, hydro and geothermal energy. Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) A market-based instrument that represents the property rights to the environmental, social and other non-power attributes of renewable electricity generation. RECs are issued when one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity is generated and delivered to the electricity grid from a renewable energy resource. The single largest category of reductions in Evanston's emissions has been through the purchase of RECs. Residence Time Average time spent in a reservoir by an individual atom or molecule. Also, this term is used to define the age of a molecule when it leaves the reservoir. With respect to greenhouse gases, residence time usually refers to how long a particular molecule remains in the atmosphere. ( UNFCC ) Reservoir Either (1) a component or components of the climate system where a greenhouse gas or a precursor of a greenhouse gas is stored; or (2) Water bodies regulated for human activities (energy production, irrigation, navigation, recreation etc.) where substantial changes in water area due to water level regulation may occur. (IPCC ) Respiration The process whereby living organisms convert organic matter to carbon dioxide, releasing energy and consuming molecular oxygen. ( IPCC2 ) Retro-commissioning The systematic process to improve an existing building's performance ensuring the building controls are running efficiently and balancing the designed use and the actual use of the building. Ride-share The practice of sharing transportation in the form of carpooling or vanpooling. It is typically an arrangement made through a ride-matching service that connects drivers with riders. S Scope 1: Scope 1 includes emissions being released within the city limits resulting from combustion of fossil fuels and from waste decomposition in the landfill and wastewater treatment plant. Scope 2: Scope 2 includes emissions produced outside the city that are induced by consumption of electrical energy within the city limits. Scope 3: Scope 3 includes emissions of potential policy relevance to local government operations that can be measured andClimate and Sustainability Glossary of Terms 12 reported but do not qualify as Scope 1 or 2. This includes, but is not limited to, outsourced operations and employee commute. Short Ton Common measurement for a ton in the United States. A short ton is equal to 2,000 lbs or 0.907 metric tons. (USEPA1 ) Sink Any process, activity or mechanism that removes a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas or aerosol from the atmosphere. ( IPCC2 ) Social Cost of Carbon The social cost of carbon is a measure of the economic harm from climate change impacts, expressed as the dollar value of the total damages from emitting one ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Solar Radiation Electromagnetic radiation emitted by the Sun. It is also referred to as shortwave radiation. Solar radiation has a distinctive range of wavelengths (spectrum) determined by the temperature of the Sun, peaking in visible wavelengths. ( IPCC2 ) Source Any process, activity or mechanism that releases a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas or aerosol into the atmosphere. ( IPCC2 ) Stationary Sources Non-mobile sources such as power plants, refineries, and manufacturing facilities which emit air pollutants. ( CARB ) Sulfur Dioxide (SO 2) A compound composed of one sulfur and two oxygen molecules. Sulfur dioxide emitted into the atmosphere through natural and anthropogenic processes is changed in a complex series of chemical reactions in the atmosphere to sulfate aerosols. These aerosols are believed to result in negative radiative forcing (i.e., tending to cool the Earth's surface) and do result in acid deposition (e.g., acid rain). ( UNFCC ) Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF 6) A colorless gas soluble in alcohol and ether, slightly soluble in water. A very powerful greenhouse gas with a global warming potential most recently estimated at 22,800 times that of carbon dioxide (CO 2). SF 6 is used primarily in electrical transmission and distribution systems and as a dielectric in electronics. This GWP is from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). T Terrestrial Carbon Sequestration It is the process through which carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the atmosphere is absorbed by trees, plants and crops through photosynthesis, and stored as carbon in biomass (tree trunks, branches, foliage and roots) and soils. The term \"sinks\" is also used to refer to forests, croplands, and grazing lands, and their ability to sequester carbon. Agriculture and forestry activities can also release CO 2 to the atmosphere. Therefore, a carbon sink occurs when carbon sequestration is greater than carbon releases over some time period. ( USEPA3 ) Therm : A unit of measure for energy that is equivalent to 100,000 British Thermal units, or roughly the energy in 100 cubic feet of natural gas. Often used for measuring natural gas usage for billing purposes.Climate and Sustainability Glossary of Terms 13 Total Organic Gases (TOG) Gaseous organic compounds, including reactive organic gases and the relatively unreactive organic gases such as methane. ( CARB ) Transparency Transparency means that the assumptions and methodologies used for an inventory should be clearly explained to facilitate replication and assessment of the inventory by users of the reported information. The transparency of inventories is fundamental to the success of the process for the communication and consideration of information. (IPCC ) Trend The trend of a quantity measures its change over a time period, with a positive trend value indicating growth in the quantity, and a negative value indicating a decrease. It is defined as the ratio of the change in the quantity over the time period, divided by the initial value of the quantity, and is usually expressed either as a percentage or a fraction. ( IPCC ) U Urban Tree Canopy Describes the makeup and characteristics of trees within the urban environment. V VMT Vehicle Miles Traveled: A unit used to measure vehicle travel made by private vehicles, including passenger vehicles, truck, vans and motorcycles. Each mile traveled is counted as one vehicle mile regardless of the number of persons in the vehicle. W Water Vapor The most abundant greenhouse gas; it is the water present in the atmosphere in gaseous form. Water vapor is an important part of the natural greenhouse effect. While humans are not significantly increasing its concentration, it contributes to the enhanced greenhouse effect because the warming influence of greenhouse gases leads to a positive water vapor feedback. In addition to its role as a natural greenhouse gas, water vapor plays an important role in regulating the temperature of the planet because clouds form when excess water vapor in the atmosphere condenses to form ice and water droplets and precipitation. ( UNFCC ) Weather Atmospheric condition at any given time or place. It is measured in terms of such things as wind, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, cloudiness, and precipitation. In most places, weather can change from hour-to- hour, day-to-day, and season-to-season. Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the \"average weather\", or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system. A simple way of remembering the difference is that climate is what you expect (e.g. cold winters) and 'weather' is what you get (e.g. a blizzard). ( USEPA1 ) Z Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV) A vehicle that does not emit harmful emissions during operation. Harmful emissions can have a negative impact on human health and the environment. Electric (battery-powered) cars, electric trains, hydrogen- fueled vehicles, bicycles, and carriages are considered to produce zero emissions.Climate and Sustainability Glossary of Terms 14 Zero Waste A cyclical system in which products are designed for reuse, which creates no waste. A zero waste system eliminates the volume and toxicity of waste and materials and conserves current resources through reuse.Secon A3 Supporng Research Click here to return to TOC Supporng Research Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment At the beginning of the Climate Acon Planning eort, The paleBLUEdot team developed a Cli- mate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment for the City of Bloomington.
