So why would we have standard vaccine protocols? In your first consultation with Dr. Jason, you will discuss you and your best friend's lifestyle and values... he will ask if your cat goes outside, if your dog crosses the US border, if you go hiking in or out of the Okanagan, and so forth. Our goal is to protect your pet against serious diseases, while avoid vaccinations for the sake of vaccinations. When they are young, puppies and kittens need exposure to certain diseases, but we try to space out those vaccines as much as possible, and never administer them to a pet in less than optimum health. As they get older, we recommend testing your cats' and dogs' blood with titre tests, to find out what immunity they have developed. This enables you to know what they are or are not immune to, so you don't unnecessarily routinely vaccinate them. What is titre testing? Titre (pronounced tight-er) testing is a medical alternative to routine vaccinations. Testing titres means testing your pet's immunity level to see if they need a vaccine boost, instead of just boosting a vaccination without knowing if they need it or not. A titre test is a blood test performed in a laboratory that measures the immunity levels to individual diseases. Dr. Jason Rowan recommends that every adult dog and cat receives a titre test before deciding to administer vaccine boosters. This approach prevents over-vaccination and unnecessarily stimulating the dog or cat's immune system. A positive titre test means that the dog or cat has immunity to a disease, and they cannot get or spread the disease.
