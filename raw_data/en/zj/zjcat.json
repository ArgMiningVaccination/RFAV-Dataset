On this page you will find links to books I recommend, which you can purchase directly from Fishpond online bookstore in New Zealand and Australia, or from Amazon in North America. In my experience, once on these sites it pays to search for other copies of the same book, to help you find the best deal. [Douglas Morrison - How We Heal: Understanding the Mind-Body-Spirit Connection] | | Written by my good friend and Body Electronics icon, Dr Doug Morrison, this is essential reading for or [Udo Erasmus - Fats That Heal, Fats That Kill] | | Frankly, I prefer Dr Johanna Budwig's oil books for her heart, but if you want a ton of researched facts and the science behind fats and oils, here it is. Erasmus is a real authority. After recently attending his free lecture in Auckland I now know he's not just an authority but a true passionate pioneer who has put in the hard yards to get the facts about fats out into the public eye. When he started out in the 1980's he had looked for the area where he could have the greatest impact on health - healthy fats is it and underpins an incredible mass of health issues. or [Elson Haas - Staying Healthy with Nutrition: The Complete Guide to Diet and Nutritional Medicine - Twenty-First Century Edition] | | I love this book. It was perhaps the very first natural health book I ever bought and has served me faithfully ever since. Loaded with detail on practically every aspect of nutrition, I read it cover-to-cover. At 1000+ pages, you may just want to use it as a reference book. or [Gabriel Cousens - Conscious Eating] | | I read his first book, \"Spiritual Nutrition and the Rainbow Diet\" at a time when I knew nothing about health and yet I read it today with as much enjoyment and discovery. Conscious Eating is quite a tome in comparison but delightfully joins the spiritual and physical aspects of nutrition. or [Edward Howell - Enzyme Nutrition] | | Another, \"You can't go past this book\" title. Edward Howell is without question the foremost authority on enzymes and he opened my eyes on them as the physical essence of life. or Edward Howell - The Food Enzymes for Health & Longevity | | I've already told you what I think of Howell's knowledge on enzymes - he's a legend. This one makes a great co-reader to Enzyme Nutrition. Phyllis Balch - Prescription for Nutritional Healing, 4th Edition: A Practical A-To-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements | | I use this a lot as a catch-all reference. I can't say I agree with everything, especially from a Body Electronics perspective, but when you have someone with questions about this or that condition, you don't yet know what kind of approach they'll be receptive to and you need some thought-starters, this is practically indispensable. or Paul Pitchford - Healing with Whole Foods: Asian Traditions and Modern Nutrition | | I can't say I use this book in many practical ways due to its macrobiotic focus but I love it anyway. It's one of those books that always has an alternate insight. or [Weston Price - Nutrition and Physical Degeneration] | | This is one of those great tomes that almost seems too good to be true. Price travelled the world, studying native cultures, their lifestyles, history, diet, and...teeth. He discovered how the teeth are a barometer of health, amassing a vast body of compelling evidence. Of course there are always at least two ways of interpreting the data, but this is still an essential treatise on nutrition. or [Sally Fallon - Nourishing Traditions: The Cookbook That Challenges Politically Correct Nutrition and the Diet Dictocrats] | | Fallon is a world-renowned writer and public speaker. As a Weston Price Foundation director, much of her message supports Price's work. Do I agree with everything she has to say? Perhaps not, but if there was only one right answer out there, then there would only be one book too. or Ron Schmid, Sally Fallon - The Untold Story of Milk: Green Pastures, Contented Cows and Raw Dairy Products | | To be perfectly honest, I haven't read this one, but the topic of raw milk and the health of the cows that make it is so important I figured it was worth the risk. I'd love to hear from anyone who has read it. Sally Fallon is an expert in her field. William Campbell Douglass - The Milk Book - The Milk of Human Kindness Is Not Pasteurized | | Ok. So I haven't read every book here, but the topic is important and it could be what you're looking for. Ann Wigmore and Lee Pattinson - The Blending Book | | Well, no, I haven't read this one, but in my experience if it's Ann Wigmore then it's worth a read. Check out this quote: \"The foods you eat can either be the safest and most powerful form of medicine or the slowest form of poison.\" She's radical but she's got a point. Ann Wigmore - The Wheatgrass Book | | Ann Wigmore is a legend! She is truly passionate about wheatgrass - this is the lady who carries a stash of it in her handbag for all sorts of emergency situations when she is out and about. You may read books with more referenced facts, but you can't go past Wigmore for sheer enthusiasm, conviction and anecdotal brilliance. Li and Richard Smith - Wheatgrass: Superfood for a new Millennium | | Nope - haven't read it. We need more information about wheatgrass though - it is one of nature's absolute superfoods. You can see some other wheatgrass/barley grass books here. Steve Meyerowitz - Sprouts the Miracle Food: The Complete Guide to Sprouting | | You may be wondering if I read many books at all...Sprouting is a survival skill and produces some of the cheapest, best tasting, vital and nutritious foods you can get. Even the least green-fingered of us can sprout successfully. Barbara Simonsohn - Barley Grass Juice | | Barley grass is right up there with wheatgrass in my book. In many cases it is a more convenient food to use as it's more readily available in a dried powdered form. Think green. Bernard Jensen - Dr. Jensen's Juicing Therapy | | I read a lot of Jensen. He's one of the godfathers of modern natural health and wrote more books and inspired more natural health practitioners than you and I have had hot dinners. Not that I'm advocating hot dinners...in fact, after reading this book you may never want to eat cooked food again. Bernard Jensen - Dr. Jensen's Guide to Body Chemistry & Nutrition | | Am I that transparent? Jensen toured all over the world, including New Zealand, in the '60's and '70's and was practically a household name for his healthy cooking classes, of all things. Never rely on Jensen as your only source of information, but always find out what he has to say on a topic. Bernard Jensen - Foods That Heal: Unlocking the Remarkable Secrets of Eating Right for Health, Vitality and Longevity | | Another inspirational Jensen classic. If you've ever heard the quote on American Idol, \"You could sing the phone book and make it sound great,\" then Jensen could write the phone book. No, I'm not biassed, it's just his skill to draw you in. Rudolf Hauschka - Nutrition: A Holistic Approach | | You think you know about any topic? Don't believe it until you've read the anthroposophical version. Dr Rudolf Steiner, founder of anthroposophy, was an undoubted genius. Hauschka follows in the anthroposophical tradition and gives you ways of looking at the relationship of nutrition to life you would never have thought of. Kilmer S McCully - The Homocysteine Revolution | | This is another example of thinking you know how it all works until someone adds another piece to the puzzle, throwing your belief system upside down. Understanding homocysteine and its connection with methylation and gene expression is a must. Silly old genes. Joseph Mercola, Kendra Degan Pearsall - Sweet Deception: Why Splenda, Nutrasweet, and the FDA May Be Hazardous to Your Health | | Oh dear...it's controversial...but not every \"approved\" or \"safe\" product is good for you. I knew nutrasweet (aka aspartame) was a problem, but I had never heard of splenda or sucralose. \"It's naturally derived from sugar, you know, so it must be safe\"...read on. Sucralose makes aspartame look like health food. Lalitha Thomas - 10 Essential Foods: A Sensible, Good Humored Approach to Vitality, Health and Well Being | | No, I haven't got his one either...yet. But I devoured Lalitha Thomas's book \"10 Essential Herbs\". She's so good, she should be banned. She has a gifted and down to earth way of putting things and if her other book is anything to go by you'll be adding these 10 foods to your diet for sure. Herbert Shelton - Food and Feeding | | Another Kessinger reprint. Haven't read this one yet, but I'd bet it's a goody based on the other Shelton books I have. Shelton is a radical naturopath, who deals with what's properly called John Harvey Kellogg - New Dietetics: A Guide to Scientific Feeding in Health and Disease Part 2 | | Most people associate the name with cornflakes, but before the name was tarnished, Dr Kellogg was a great Nature Cure man. I read a lot of nutrition books pre-pharmaceuticals and pre-American Medical Association because these authors had no fear of expressing their opinions in the words and force they wanted to use. Some of their ideas may seem antiquated now, but here is a very honest grass roots approach to health. I'd love to know what happened to part 1 of this book - Kessinger must have it in the pipeline somewhere. Melvin E Page and H Leon Abrams - Your Body is Your Best Doctor!: Formerly, Health Versus Disease | || | I have one book by Melvin Page, \"Degeneration Regeneration.\" Page is quite a technical writer, being a biochemist and dentist but some of the things he has thought of measuring demonstrate just how easily our body's chemistry is swayed by our diet. Page realised that diet affected teeth because diet affects the whole body, the teeth therefore being a barometer of your overall health. Want to know how to balance your blood and save more than just your teeth? Read the book. Dr Sandra Cabot - The Liver Cleansing Diet | | I first read this not long after starting in Body Electronics and had the fortune of seeing Dr Cabot speak in person the same year. It speaks very simply and plainly and gives practical suggestions to achieve the outcome of a happy liver. By the way, if you don't have access to a specific herbal formula for you, her Livatone powdered product has worked well for many I have suggested it to (ideally, of course, in conjunction with the dietary changes she recommends). [Arnold Ehret - Mucusless Diet Healing System: \"Master Key\" to Superior Health] | | You can't really understand nutrition until you've studied and tried fasting. Ehret is unquestionably THE authority on fasting and may shock you with the revelation that food is not responsible for our health and vitality. This book so deserves its place on the \"must-read\" list. or Steve Meyerowitz - Wheatgrass Nature's Finest Medicine: The Complete Guide to Using Grasses to Revitalize Your Health | | Another wheatgrass book? I must think it's pretty important stuff. It sure is. Sproutman's Turn the Dial Sprout Chart: A Field Guide to Growing and Eating Sprouts | | This little wheel provides an at-a-glance fact-finder for your sprouting endeavours. Rudolph Ballentine - Diet & Nutrition: A Holistic Approach | | It's perhaps middle of the road stuff for nutrition, but I like Ballentine's style and he brings out some good points in this book that will make you think again, without letting science get in the way. [Johanna Budwig - Flax Oil as a True Aid Against Arthritis, Heart Infarction, Cancer and Other Diseases] | | Yay! I finally found it. This little book is an absolute gem. You may want to look at Udo Erasmus' Fat That Heal - Fats That Kill, if you want all the science, but in my opinion you can't go past Budwig's contribution. Having discovered a yellow pigment in the blood of all the cancer patients she studied, she spent years helping people using a mixture of flax oil and quark. Some of her stories are truly remarkable. or Johanna Budwig - The Oil Protein Diet | | This is Budwig's companion book, sharing many tasty flax oil recipes for your health. Many people have an idea that flax oil is unpalatable. Well I pour it on most of my meals because I like it, not just for its health benefits. There are heaps of tasty ways of using flax oil. Johanna Budwig - Cancer: The Problem and the Solution | | This is a much more recent offering from Budwig and to be honest, I didn't even realise it existed until I hunted down her two previous classics on Fishpond. [Peter D'Adamo - The Eat Right Diet: The Individualized Diet Solution to Staying Healthy, Living Longer and Achieving Your Ideal Weight] | | D'Adamo's essential contention is that human evolution has left those of us with particular blood types unable to deal with certain proteins in various foods. There is an enticing grain of truth in this, a better understanding of which you'd have to Peter D'Adamo - Eat Right for Your Type: The Individualized Diet Solution to Staying Healthy, Living Longer and Achieving Your Ideal Weight (CD) | | This is the audio book on CD of the update on the original book, the Eat Right Diet (the one that I actually read). Ed McCabe - Flood Your Body with Oxygen: Therapy for Our Polluted World | | I was hoping to find \"Oxygen Therapies\" by McCabe, but this one is probably close enough. Here is a man who has been persecuted for his beliefs to the n'th degree but is trying to bring out the truth anyway. or [Return to the main Essential Books pages](essential_books.html) to browse more recommended reading for natural health and Body Electronics.
