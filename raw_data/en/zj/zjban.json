This is due, in large part, to the success of hepatitis C being curable. Today the race is now on for the growing number of hepatitis B drugs in the pipeline to become the next cure. We all want a cure, but the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is complicated and even the definition of 'cure' is being debated. A 'clinical cure' can be defined as returning an individual with chronic HBV to the risk of serious liver disease to that of someone who has never been infected, or, at least, has had a 'resolved' infection. But achieving that goal would take many years of therapy, so it is not practical to use it for evaluating a drug's effectiveness. More realistic is a 'functional cure, ' which declares success as causing a sustained reduction in virus and other disease markers in the blood even after a drug is stopped. In addition to suppressing or eliminating viral DNA, more ambitious goals for a functional cure call for loss of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), appearance of HBV surface antibody (HBsAb), and silencing or eliminating cccDNA (covalently closed circular DNA), which is responsible for persistence of HBV infection even during prolonged antiviral therapy. Suppression of these blood markers will most likely relate to, if not equal, a clinical cure and since these can be measured within years, if not months, of therapy, determining a drug's efficacy is possible. Whether or not all virological markers need to be stably suppressed to achieve meaningful clinical goals is being debated. Although the approved oral antivirals do a good job of suppressing viral DNA levels, none of them reliably achieve the goal of 'functional cure. ' They are also limited in achieving 'clinical cure' as defined above. Thus, there is still a need to develop new drugs that attack different pathways of the HBV life cycle to achieve a cure. There are now more than 30 new HBV drugs in the pipeline that are different from the currently approved therapies (interferons and nucleos(t)ides). In general, the new drugs being developed to treat HBV can be divided into two general categories: direct acting that target the virus and indirect acting that target the human host.

Sofia, PhD, who received the 2016 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award for his role in the discovery of the cure for chronic hepatitis C. The Lasker Awards rank among the world's most celebrated scientific honors for biomedical research; in fact, 87 past Lasker awardees have gone on to receive the Nobel Prize. Dr. Sofia received the 2016 Lasker-DeBakey Award with Charles Rice, PhD, of Rockefeller University and Ralf Bartenschlager, PhD, of Heidelberg University, who were recognized for their work in developing systems essential to hepatitis C research. Dr. Sofia used these systems in developing his drug, sofosbuvir (Sovaldi\u00ae), while at Pharmasset, which was acquired by Gilead. His drug is now the backbone of Harvoni\u00ae, a 12 week course of treatment that cures almost 100% of HCV patients. Today, Dr. Sofia has turned his attention to the unmet need of hepatitis B through his work as co-founder and chief scientific officer of Arbutus Biopharma, a company focused on HBV drug discovery. He also serves as a resident adjunct professor of the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute of the Hepatitis B Foundation. \"Hepatitis B is difficult, but we and the Blumberg Institute have brought together some of the best scientists in the world to achieve this goal. We have put the hepatitis B virus in our cross hairs, and we won't let it get away, \" he said. The cure for hepatitis C is one of the greatest medical advances of our lifetime and Dr. Sofia is deserving of the 2016 Lasker Award. We now look forward to his encore for hepatitis B!

Block, Co-Founder and Executive Director Explaining the Hepatitis B Drug Pipeline With more than 30 new HBV drugs in the pipeline, there is great hope that a 'functional' cure, if not a 'clinical' or complete cure, will be achieved through one of these promising strategies. This article provides a brief overview of the new direct acting (target the virus life cycle) and indirect acting (target the human host functions) drugs being pursued for hepatitis B. Continued from page 1 The explosion in drug discovery around hepatitis B is truly exciting, yet challenging, with more than 30 new hepatitis B drugs in the pipeline. There is great expectation, and great optimism that highly effective new therapies will be available to manage chronic HBV infection over the next five years. One of the most serious challenges in the development of new therapies, however, is finding people for the clinical trials. The problem seems paradoxical. There are more than 240 million people chronically infected with HBV worldwide, of which 2 million live in the U.S. But identifying those eligible and willing to enter clinical trials is a significant obstacle. In the U.S., most patients do not know they are infected, and those who have been diagnosed are generally being treated already. Outside the U.S., the barriers are identifying patients and finding providers or medical centers that are able to conduct rigorous clinical trials. To ensure the success of future hepatitis B clinical trials, programs are needed to improve hepatitis B screening and care. For example, Hep B United, the national coalition we started in 2012 that is focused on building community coalitions to increase screening rates (p. 6), and our new Patient Storytelling Campaign that is working with groups to use personal stories to raise the visibility of hepatitis B in high-risk communities and, thereby, stimulate testing (p. 5). For the past 25 years, the Hepatitis B Foundation has found success in overcoming obstacles through partnerships. To paraphrase an African proverb, \"To go fast, go alone; to go further, go together. \" Working together will be the key to solving the current people challenge for moving promising hepatitis B drugs into human clinical trials ... and ultimately, a cure. ARC-520 for \"silencing\" RNA, which are nucleotide drugs that interfere and cause the destruction of the viral RNA. Without viral RNA (which comes from cccDNA) there is no production of viral proteins. Thus, no RNA and no protein means no virus. Tenofovir (TDF) Prodrugs are modified polymerase inhibitors (called 'NUCS') designed to get into the liver cells more easily and inhibit HBV. It is expected that TDF prodrugs will be used at lower doses with more suppression compared to current NUC drugs. Entry Inhibitors interfere with HBV getting into liver cells via attachment to a specific viral protein called 'preS1' and a specific liver cell protein. Myrcludex B is the first drug that looks like preS1 and interferes with HBV attachment to the liver cell. Capsid Inhibitors interfere with viral capsid formation, which is the protein shield that covers and protects the viral DNA. The capsid is made of pairs of HBV 'core' proteins or antigens, also called 'HBcAg,' which is needed to produce infectious virus. sAg Inhibitors interfere with the production of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), which is needed for the virus to enter and exit the liver cell. HBsAg is found in the blood of most infected people and is, therefore, thought to play a role in maintaining the state of chronic infection by suppressing the immune system. cccDNA inhibitors are considered the 'holy grail' for a cure, but remain very challenging. The chromosome of HBV persists in the nucleus of the infected liver cell as a small cccDNA molecule, which is the natural source of all HBV gene products. It lasts for a very long time, even after NUC drugs appear to be effective in suppressing the virus. CRISPR/cas and \"TALEN\" are genome editing systems, which due to their low cost and simplicity have become powerful new tools for discovery. For HBV, these systems can be used to attack and destroy the cccDNA. A problem with these systems is getting them into the infected viral cell nucleus because they are not 'small molecule' drugs. New Direct Acting Antivirals A greater understanding of the hepatitis B virus and proteins has enabled efforts to develop multiple direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), which are drugs targeted at specific steps within the HBV life cycle. New Indirect Acting Antivirals The hepatitis B virus uses the human body as its host to grow, so indirect acting antiviral drugs are being developed that target host functions. Therapeutic Vaccines use vaccine technology for treatment rather than prevention. These 'vaccines' are being used to stimulate immunity as a potential therapy since people living with HBV do not appear to have an effective immune response to the virus. TLR Agonists are targeting the 'toll-like receptors,' which are the 'sensors' that detect infectious agents and tell the cell to defend itself. A TLR 'agonist' is a drug that activates our innate immune system, which is our body's first line of defense against an infection. STING is an innovative approach that shows a small molecule 'Stimulator of Interferon Genes' can eliminate all detectable viral gene products. This has been done in tissue culture, which was confirmed by a small animal study. SMAC Mimetics are a new class of drugs designed to induce programmed cell death (or 'apoptosis'). Use of this mechanism means HBV infected liver cells might be able to be pushed into apoptosis more easily than uninfected cells. Ciclofillin Inhibitors are based on cyclophillins, a family of host cell proteins that help other proteins carry out their functions. They are also involved in the development of liver diseases such as HBV by helping the virus enter the liver cell. Inhibition of cyclophillins have been used to modify the immune system for therapeutic benefit and could be useful for HBV. Combination is the Key Most experts believe that a cure for HBV , functional or otherwise, will require at least two drugs. Perhaps a directing acting (DAA) will be taken with an indirect acting drug - the DAA will keep the virus suppressed while the immunomodulator 'educates' the immune system to recognize and take over suppression of the virus when the drugs are stopped. Most logically, elimination of all markers, silencing cccDNA and loss of HBsAg with appearance of HBsAb, will come the closest to being a 'cure. ' However, stable suppression of viral DNA after stopping a drug would be a big step forward, and if this is also accompanied by stable off-drug loss of HBsAg (and normalization of liver enzymes), the community would have lots to celebrate. Although the future cannot be known, short duration of use, effective drugs that achieve at least a functional cure, and taken alone or in combination, are the goal and we are within reach of making hepatitis B history!

Our information remains as comprehensive and useful as ever, but we now feature new sections for easier accessibility: Newly Diagnosed, About Our Research Institute, Language Translations, Our Programs, and much more. For those who depend on our regularly updated HBV Drug Watch, Clinical Trials and Physician Directory, these pages are still available and growing. Our website is a work in progress and we welcome feedback from our readers! Hepatitis delta is the deadliest form of viral hepatitis which occurs only in people already infected with hepatitis B. Y et, most people are unaware of the delta virus, let alone are being tested for it. Over the past 25 years, the HBF has helped reduce the burden of hepatitis B through its website, help lines and outreach programs. It is now time to also increase awareness about the need to test for hepatitis delta among hepatitis B patients since coinfection with this virus results in more serious and rapid liver damage. Our Hepatitis Delta Connect program will include a dedicated website, social media presence, webinars and other educational activities. Visit www.hepDconnect.org.Hepb.org Relaunches with a New Look! Hepatitis Delta Connect Program Addresses Unmet Need FOUNDATION at the FOREFRONT There are 15 million people worldwide living with HDV Hepatitis B co-infection with HDV results in more serious and rapid liver damage The hepatitis B vaccine can prevent HDV HBV is most common in parts of Mongolia, Pakistan, Russia, Central Asia, Turkey, Africa, China, and South America There is no approved treatment for HDV, but there are 5 new promising drugs in human clinical trials.

Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) FasT FacTs New Hepatitis B Foundation Storytelling Campaign The HBF recognizes that engaging community members in sharing their personal stories about hepatitis B is essential to reducing stigma, encouraging screening, and improving referral to care and services. The Hepatitis B Foundation Storytelling Campaign will use the real voices of everyday people living with or affected by HBV as a key component in our awareness and advocacy efforts. We will engage people to share their stories in short videos created during a digital storytelling workshop led by StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling, a nonprofit organization that founded the global digital storytelling movement). These participants will then be trained to share their stories and videos to increase HBV awareness, screening and care in their local communities and nationally. Our goal is to build a meaningful patient story bank that create a sustainable network of trained storytellers to put a compelling human face on the problem of hepatitis B and raise its visibility as an urgent public health priority.

I became so excited and wonder if I would ever meet such a breakthrough. It was on one fateful day in 2007, during my 2 nd year of education, when I decided to voluntarily donate blood to help save the lives of pregnant mothers who get complications during deliveries. Confidently, I walked into the blood bank to get my blood tested. Everything was OK until the lab technician called out my name and told me they cannot let me complete the process because my blood was 'incompatible.' He handed me a fact sheet on viral hepatitis. I felt so confused and didn't know what to do. I thought I would be referred to see a physician for counseling but no, nothing. Not knowing what to do, I decided to educate myself on the disease. So I went online, read through several articles and documents on hepatitis B and its management. I learnt about the need to avoid alcoholic beverages, smoking, and ensure I always eat a well-balanced diet to boost my immunity. I did this for close to two years. Finally, somewhere in 2009, I took another test which revealed that I was in the chronic stage of the infection. Even the health professionals at that facility couldn't explain what that really meant. I got totally confused and didn't know if I was going to die or not. I have been alive just by grace. I say this because, I do not show any sign or symptoms of the infection and this most times gives me hope. My last medical checkup was in 2010. I had my blood drawn and tested for liver function and HBV tests. The results were good. Life afterwards has been manageable. I live in a community and country where the level of awareness of hepatitis B is very low. The majority of the people are ignorant about the situation. I have lost some family members as a result of the disease. It was through my regular search for more information when I came across the Hepatitis Foundation of Ghana. I was so excited and impressed about their work and who they seek to represent. I read several of their works and felt they could help me transform the mindset of the people within my community and the nation as a whole. I was happy about the swift response with which they responded to my mail and followed up with a call. I no longer feel left alone. I now feel I have someone whom I could call upon for any information or seek clarification concerning my situation. Not only me, but for my community too. I know my story might not be so different from yours, or perhaps, yours might be worse than mine. I want to assure you that, there is always a way out! Seek information from the right source and be responsible for your life. This story was given to Theobald Owusu-Ansah, founder and president of Hepatitis Foundation of Ghana, who gave us permission to reprint it for our readers. Theobald started his foundation in 2007 after four of his family members died from hepatitis B. The Hepatitis Foundation of Ghana is a nonprofit patient advocacy organization that seeks to promote awareness, to educate the public about prevention and treatment options, and to provide care and support to the infected and affected people in Ghana. For more information, visit www.hepatitisghana.org.Hep B United, a national coalition established by the Hepatitis B Foundation and AAPCHO in 2012, hosted its 4th annual Hep B United National Summit in Washington, D.C., from July 27-29. This annual summit is the largest assembly of HBV leaders that gathers to discuss community-based screening, prevention and linkage to care strategies with the goal of eliminating hepatitis B. Key topics this year included building capacity and sustaining local hepatitis B coalitions, helping patients navigate complex insurance and health care systems, and launching the new Know Hepatitis B campaign materials developed by CDC and co-branded with Hep B United. To commemorate World Hepatitis Day on July 28, the HBF and AACPHO organized Hill Visits during the summit with more than 50 advocates visiting 25 Congressional offices to share their stories and concerns about the need for increased federal attention and funding to address the silent epidemic of hepatitis B (read more below about the HBF Advocacy Agenda). A highlight of the annual summit is the presentation of Hep B Champion Awards by HBF, AAPCHO and the CDC to recognize community leaders who successfully collaborate to address hepatitis B in their communities. This year's honorees included: Alex Shirreffs, MPH , Philadelphia Dept. of Health's Viral Hepatitis Prevention Coordinator; Mohammed Abdul-Kadir, MPH, MSIS, Coordinator of the Hepatitis B Coalition of Washington; Nadine Shiroma, a civil rights advocate from Seattle who has worked with HBF to eliminate HBV-related discrimination in the U.S., and; Moon Chen, PhD, Director of the Asian American Network for Cancer Awareness, Research and Training (AANCART) in Sacramento, CA. Hep B United now has more than 30 community coalition members across the country located in 26 cities, 15 states including Washington, DC, and a collective reach to almost 5 million high-risk individuals. The Hepatitis B Foundation is proud of the growth and expansion of this national coalition to help increase awareness about the urgency of making hepatitis B a national priority. The 4th Annual Hep B United National Summit was held July 27-29 in Washington, DC with more than 70 participants from the 30 member local coalitions across the country, federal partners, and national nonprofit organizations. It Takes a Coalition to Fight Hepatitis B Capitol News The Hepatitis B Foundation is leading the charge in a national advocacy campaign to Double the Federal Funding , within five years, for hepatitis B and liver cancer research. With the downgrading of hepatitis B, evidenced by declining funds at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the CDC, a loud, strong and visible advocacy campaign is urgently needed. Washington leaders are listening. We have their ear. This past June, HBF arranged for a Congressional letter, led by Senator Maize Hirono (D-HI), and Congressmen Mike Honda (D-CA) and Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA) and signed by 12 Senate and House of Representatives colleagues, which was sent to NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins requesting the NIH to: \"...prepare a professional judgment budget (PJB) that lists and discusses the research and accompanying resources needed to meet the Hepatitis B Foundation's goal of a cure for hepatitis B and to significantly reduce deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma from hepatitis B and other causes. \"Over the last five years, funding for HBV research at the NIH has declined by almost 16%. It is now only $49 million. The PJB document, requested from the NIH before the end of this calendar year, will serve as the roadmap for our advocacy in Washington to ensure that the federal government prioritizes funding to realize our goal. To further increase pressure on Congress, more than 50 community advocates were mobilized by the HBF on July 28, World Hepatitis Day, to make Hill Visits to 25 Congressional offices and advocate for increased funding to double NIH funding to $100 million for HBV to leverage new research opportunities to find a cure, as well as to improve HBV testing and treatment. Advocates stressed the need for the National Cancer Institute to pursue better treatments for liver cancer and that the CDC should double its funding for direct HBV interventions. There is a lot to be done, but the Hepatitis B Foundation's new campaign is mobilizing Congressional champions and community advocates to focus on a clear goal - double the federal funds for hepatitis B! We sincerely thank the RFS Family Foundation for making the lead donation to launch this advocacy campaign and the HBF Scientific and Medical Advisory Board members for their generous donations to support it. This article was written by Alyson Lewis, Legislative Director of Madison Associates, Washington, DC. Hepatitis B Advocacy Agenda Leading the Charge to Double the Money! NONPROFIT ORG u.s. post Age pAiD PERMIT NO 38 DOYLESTOwN, PA Twenty-five years ago when the Foundation was started, there was no public awareness about hepatitis B and no place for patients to seek support. Nonprofit organizations didn't want to touch hepatitis B because it was an 'undesirable infectious disease. ' Public health experts said the vaccine would wipe it out in a generation so there was no need for a cure. Drug companies weren't conducting research because they didn't see a market. And policy makers didn't pay attention because they weren't hearing any noise. Over the past 25 years, the remarkable scientific and medical advances that have been made prove hepatitis B is a problem that can be solved. There is a simple blood test, safe vaccine, good treatments, and a cure for hepatitis C. The race is now for a hepatitis B cure. The Hepatitis B Foundation is proud to be an active partner in advancing the science and medicine of hepatitis B to fulfill our missing of finding a cure and improving the lives of those affected worldwide. In 1991, the foundation was started to help one family. Today, we are reaching millions of families around the world through our comprehensive outreach, public health and patient advocacy initiatives. We are bringing hope through our dedicated research institute, the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute, which is one of the largest concentrations of nonprofit scientists working on hepatitis B and liver cancer. As we celebrate our Silver Jubilee , our hope for the next 25 years is simple. We hope that a universal vaccination program will protect everyone, young and old. We hope that a complete cure is found that will benefit everyone with hepatitis B. A world without hepatitis B would be the best gift of all. 8 Hepatitis B Foundation | B Informed | Fall 2016 hepb.org HEPATITIS B FOUNDATION 3805 Old and all back issues are available online at www.hepb.org/newslettersCalendar of Events 2016 Nov. 9 HBV Cure Workshop Virology Education Toronto, Canada virology-education.com Nov. 11-15 The Liver Disease Meeting American Assoc. for the Study of Liver Diseases Boston, MAaasld.org2017 Feb. 15-19 APASL 2017 Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver Shanghai, PR China apasl2017.org April 7 Crystal Ball Awards 2017 Hepatitis B Foundation Lansdale, PA hepb.org April 19-23 International Liver Congress 2017 European Association for the Study of the Liver Amsterdam, The Netherlands easl.eu May 6-9 Digestive Disease Week 2017 AASLD, AGA, ASGE, SSAT Chicago, IL ddw.org July 28 World Hepatitis Day World Hepatitis AllianceEvents around the world worldhepatitisday.org Sept. 3-7 International HBV Meeting Hepatitis B Foundation Washington, DC HBVmeeting.org Nov. 1-3 2nd World Hepatitis Summit World Hepatitis Alliance Sao Paulo, Brazil worldhepatitissummit.org Silver Jubilee HBF Celebrates SILVER JUBILEE25 For More Information About Hepatitis B Foundation Programs n HBV Info & Support List ...
