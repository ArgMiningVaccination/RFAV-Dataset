By Lisa Jo Rudy Updated on May 06, 2023 Medically reviewed by Anju Goel, MD, MPH Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents History Vaccines Using Fetal Tissue Vaccines and DNA Several common vaccines are made by growing viruses in fetal embryo cells. These cells originally came from tissue obtained from two fetuses that were legally aborted in the early 1960s. The same cells have continued to grow in a laboratory and are still used to make vaccines today. With the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson), vaccine development relied on cells from a fetus aborted in 1985. The topic is controversial because of where the original cells came from. This article will help you to learn more about vaccines and whether or not they contain aborted fetal tissue. You will also learn about alternatives to traditional vaccines. Verywell / Nusha Ashjaee History of Using Aborted Fetal Tissue in Vaccines Fetal cells were originally used because viruses tend to grow better in human cells than animal cells. Fetal cells do not divide as many times as other cell types, so they can be used for longer. In addition, because it's possible to keep these cells at very low temperatures, such as in liquid nitrogen, scientists are able to continue using the same fetal cell lines that were originally created decades ago. Vaccine manufacturers obtain human cell lines from FDA-certified cell banks. After processing, very little, if any, of that tissue remains in the vaccine. History of Vaccinations and Vaccines Which Vaccines Incorporate Aborted Fetal Tissues? Vaccines that are developed from the cell lines of aborted fetal tissue include: Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, the rubella called varicella vaccine Hepatitis A The Imovax\u00ae vaccine for rabies Janssen vaccine for COVID-19 (Johnson & Johnson product) In some cases, alternative vaccines may be available, as is the case with the mRNA-based Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines, or the RabAvert rabies vaccine cultivated from chicken fibroblasts. Your healthcare provider can help if you want to learn more about the alternatives or have specific concerns. Fetal Tissue and COVID-19 Vaccines Neither the Moderna nor Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines were produced using fetal cell lines.The Janssen vaccine, made by Johnson & Johnson, was developed while using fetal tissue from 1985, but no new abortion procedures were involved. Researchers were using at least two cell lines from human fetal tissue aborted years ago (in 1972 and 1985) while working on six possible COVID-19 vaccines. COVID-19 Vaccine Types Vaccines, Aborted Fetal Tissue and Your DNA One vaccine myth that emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic was the concern that the mRNA vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer products) could change your DNA once it entered the cells in your body. Yet there is no risk of that occurring with these vaccines.The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine does deliver DNA to your cells but it comes from the virus itself.Neither vaccines nor aborted fetal tissue used to develop them in the laboratory can alter your DNA. Further, there ultimately is no aborted fetal tissue in vaccines because of the purification and manufacturing process of the product. Fibroblasts and Vaccines Fibroblasts are cells that build the structure of human tissue throughout the body. They are often used in research. In 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an oral adenovirus vaccine made from human fetal embryo fibroblasts for use in military populations only. Summary Some common vaccines are created by growing the viruses in fetal embryo cells. These cells came from tissue obtained from two fetuses that were legally and electively aborted in past decades. The cells continue to grow in a laboratory and are still used to create some vaccines today, including the common MMR vaccine and the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. If you have concerns about any recommended vaccine, your healthcare provider can help you to learn more about what's inside the vaccine. They also provide information about alternative vaccines created from animal cells instead of human cells for people who have ethical or religious concerns.
