The re-election of Presi- dent George W. Bush was com- bined with Republican gains in both the House and the Senate. It is still too early to tell how will- ing lawmakers from either polit- ical party will be fo work in a bipartisan fashion, but with greater Republican control over both chambers, any legislation enacted is likely to resemble the relatively conservative House versions of such legislation con- sidered this year.

Eisenhower's People to People Ambassador Program, conduct- ed a counseling delegation to China in early October. The People to People Ambassador Program provides foreign edu- cational travel experiences for professionals. Through meet- ings, seminars and cultural activities, participants connect with people in similar profes- sions overseas. Thirteen members of ACA, the past chair of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy and three guests traveled to Beijing and Shanghai to meet with counselors and rep-resentatives of the China Asso- ciation for Mental Health and Beijing Association of Mental Health. The delegates had many lively professional exchanges with employees at hospital- based clinics, neighborhood mental health centers, and high school and university counsel- ing centers. The 11-day journey gave the Western counselors a new per- spective on Chinese culture as well as the country's mental health needs and treatment methods. One of the key -con- cerns raised by Chinese mental health professionals was the psychological effect of the social and economic changes that have occurred in China dur- ing the last 25 years. In addition to straining people's copingskills, many of these changes clash with traditional Chinese values. This was cited as one reason for China's increasingrates of depression and anxiety. ACA Associate Executive Director for Professional Affairs Continued on page 22 ACA supports language access in health care According to the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly 47 million peo- ple, or approximately 18 percent of the U.S. population, speak alanguage other than English at home. Based on estimates from the 2000 census, a minimum of 11 million people (4.2 percent of the U.S. population) speak Eng- lish either \"not well\" or \"not at all.\" If those who speak English less than \"very well\" are includ- ed, more than 21 million people (8.1 percent) in the United States have limited English proficiency. With the rise in the number of non-English speaking residents in the United States has come increased demand for English as a second language classes. But at this point, supply is notmeeting demand. Unfortunately, the same is true in regard to health care language services for those who have difficulty communicating in English. Continuing research has shown that those with limited English proficiency often have a difficult time accessing health care. Even those who do succeed in securing health care often receive fewer services or a lesser quality of care than patients who speak English. Health care providers nationwide have acknowledged that language dif- ficulties and inadequate fundingof language services are major barriers to the quality of care received by those with limited English proficiency. That is why the American Counseling Association has signed on to support the Lan- guage Access in Health Care Statement of Principles, devel- oped by a diverse group of inter- ested stakeholders and coordi- nated by the National Health Law Program.

The technology-assisted methods of delivery can include telecounseling (telephone), se- cure e-mail communication, videoconferencing or stand- alone software programs. The CCE, a corporate affiliate of the National Board for Certi- fied Counselors, recently intro- duced a new credential for dis- tance counseling. Distance Cre- dentialed Counselors will be nationally recognized as profes- sionals with training in best practices for distance counsel- ing. \"We've learned from eth- cal, moral, legal and profession- al perspectives that there is aright way and a wrong way to do distance counseling,\" said Randy Miller, chairman and CEO of ReadyMinds, a compa- ny in Lyndhurst, N.J., that pro- vides the DCC training pro- gram. Approximately 225 coun- selors have earned DCC status since the credential was intro- duced this year. Miller admitted that many professionals are wary of dis- tance counseling. \"More often than not, people are skeptical:' he said. \"But I think they get surprised.\" There are two main reasons for distance counseling's appeal, Miller said. First is the conve- nience and time savings, both for the counselor and the client. Using distance methods also al- lows counselors to reach under- served populations for whom face-to-face counseling proves difficult, including the physical- ly challenged or those living inremote areas. The second reason is the anonymity factor. \"We have found that some people share more (information about themselves) because they're not as nervous:' he said. \"There is less of a fear factor involved.\" Distance counseling has ap- plications to career, school, mental health and rehabilitation counseling specialities, among others, Miller said. He points out to skeptics that distance counseling isn't necessarily a replacement for face-to-face counseling, but rather an en- hancement that could allow them to reach more clients. \"If there is a way to touch people's lives,\" he said. \"why wouldn't you want to do it?\" For more information on DCC certification, contact CCE at 336.482.2856 or via e-mail at cce@cce-global.org.

CroweACA donates $1,573 to hurricane relief When multiple hunicanes ravaged Florida this summer, the American Red Cross asked ACA to help with the recruitment of volunteers for relief efforts. ACA sent an e-mail bulletin announc- ing a mobilization alert for licensed mental health professionals willing to help those affected by the natural disasters. Many ACA members were able to answer the call and go to Florida (see \"Counselors support hurricane victims.\" October 2004 Counsel- ing Today), but the association also ran a promotion allowing those who couldn't volunteer to contribute to the relief efforts. ACA made the decision to donate $1 to the American Red Cross for every book purchased from the association's publications cat- alog in October. The final tally for the month was $1,573. \"ACA was very pleased that we could take the extra step of helping those in need through our '$1 per book' donation project,\" said ACA Executive Director Richard Yep. \"This is just one more example of the way in which professional counselors help others.\" Play therapy project needs participants The National Play Therapy in Counseling Practices Project, a first of its kind joint research effort between the American Coun- seling Association and the Association for Play Therapy, invites counselors who conduct play therapy to participate in the first phase of this exciting research. Approximately 15 minutes of your time is all that is needed to complete the survey. As a thank you for participating, 10 randomly selected partici- pants will receive either Counseling as an Art: The Creative Arts in Counseling, 3rd edition by Samuel T. Gladding or Play Thera- py: The Art of the Relationship, 2nd edition by Garry L. Landreth. Counselors who conduct play therapy are encouraged to com- plete the brief survey at www.coe.unt.edu/ray/. Results of the study will be presented at the 2005 ACA Convention. For further information, please contact: Simone F. Lambert, Co-Chair, National Play Therapy m Counseling Practices Project at 703.591.9600 or e-mail sinonelanbert@nainstreetchi.con. Feedback sought for Code of Ethics The American Counseling Association Code of Ethics Revision Task Force asks all association members to review the 2005 Draft of the ACA Code of Ethics. All feedback should be provided online at invw.counseling.org/ethicsdraft by Dec. 31. An online version of the draft code is available at the website address. A draft also appeared in the November 2004 issue of Counseling Today. PCF gives to House Medicare leaders The Professional Counseling Fund, the national political action committee dedicated to advancing the counseling profession's federal policy interests, continues its efforts to raise the profile of counselors among lawmakers. PCF is in no way affiliated with the American Counseling Association, which as a 501(c)(3) organiza- tion is prohibited from engaging in political activity. Before the Nov. 2 elections, PCF made contributions to the cam- paign committees of House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Joe Barton (R-Texas) and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas (R-Calif.) The two committees share jurisdiction over the Medicare program, and Reps. Barton and Thomas are arguably the most influential House members on Medicare issues. Both were re-elected to the 109th Congress, and both will maintain their chairmanships. Gaining Medicare coverage for the services of state-licensed Professional Counselors is a top priority for PCE For more infor- mation regarding PCF, contact Treasurer Pat McGinn at 773.363.8313, or by e-mail at brncgnn@uchicago.edu. NE 120 C0) 0 U 0' I- (fJ 0) 0, 3 Letters - Article on self-injury can help heal clients Angela Kennedy's article on self-injury in the October 2004 Counseling Today has been of great assistance. I have several adolescent clients who, report- edly, self-mutilate. I have also met with parents who cannot understand why their children self-mutilate. This article im- peccably explains why harming th6 body eases the mind of- many clients. While it looks like an irrational action to outsiders, it'is a choice made out of des- peration to escape and/or cope with traumas. The article states that 'Some use razors, broken glass or their fingernails to break the skin. Others bang their heads, swal- low metal objects or burn them- selves just to know if they are alive.\" Harming their bodies eases their minds. As noted in the article, clients who self-mutilate or self-injure can be young, old, male, female or from different cultures. One of my clients is a 12-year-old African-American female from a well-to-do family. She liushes her lips to one side of her mouth and bites them until she bleeds and makes a sore. A memb6r of my church has a son who recently began to sel- mutilate. The parent wants des- peiately to understand why her son does this. In large part be- cause of this article, as well as information from my books, I have been able to help the par ents of my clients understand why their children self-mutilate, what to do about it and how to support their children by mak- ing them feel safe and loved. Kennedy did such an excellent job of explaining that this type of behavior is a coping mecha- nism. Self-mutilation, or self- injuring, is the deliberate, direct destruction or alteration of body tissue without designed suicidal intent. Self-injuring is not a con- dition but one of the symptoms of borderline personality disor- der. I told one of my. clients whose daughter was misdiag- nosed with a mental disorder byanother therapist that self-injur- ing is a symptom of borderline personality disorder. She re- fused to believe me, but I have the Counseling Today article and my DSM-IV handout to back up the diagnosis. I have told parents that some- thing traumatic may have hap- pened in the lives of their chil- dren to bring on, what I've found in many cases to be, extremely sudden changes in personality. I gave examples of possible events such as rape, incest, social difficulties, abaft- donment, etc. -things that have been very difficult for their children to process. These diffi- culties are manifested in coping mechanisms such as the one your article describes. As stated in the article, self- injury is on the rise. We have to prepare so we can help clients and their parents realize what self-injury or self-mutilation is and is not, what can be done to change the behavior and how to suppoit clients who harm their bodies. I cannot reiterate strongly enough that self-injury or self- mutilatidn is a feature of a men- tal disorder that is treatable in several ways. Clients don't have to be left wanting to feel some- thing. As the article says, \"These people dissociate and use self- injury to bring themselves back to reality, to ground them- selves.\" The article's examples of trig- gers of self-injurers (intimacy, sights, smells, memories of trau- ma, social rejections, interper- sonal inadequacy, etc.) helped one of my clients to recognize- her daughter's triggers. AJid ais I talked to otie of my clients about such behaviors, she was able to open p and tell me what brought about the behavioral changes and self-mutilation. I made certain at the initial as- sessment to ask her all the ques- tions that psychotherapists/men- tal health counselors are re- quired to ask. I found through appropriate questioning that she is not suicidal. She has no plan to kill herself. She is just tryingto feel something. What'a break- through! With this information, we are forming a bond of trust. I am showing this client uncondi- tional, positive regard. I can now begin to use tech- niques to challenge clients' irra- tional thoughts and assist them in forming rational thoughts and new copirig strategies. I plan to make copies of the Counseling - Today article and pass it on to clients who request literature on self-injury. Linda Small-Sadler - Denver lksmallsadler@qwest.net Productivity burden heavy for counseling profession I enjoyed the article on \"Coun- seling as a business proposition\" (Student Focus, November 2004). I found it a bit naive, but maybe the situation is different at Stetson University and in Florida than in my state of Ohio. Still, I would like someone to discuss in print the heavy burden of \"pro- ductivity\" demands on the coun- seling profession. Where I currently work, we are directed to schedule at least 30-32 clients per week with the idea that no-shows and late-can- cel appointments will leave us with at least 28-30 clients per week. Maybe I am nave, but this puts a major strain on the actual counseling relationship due to the hours we must work on any given day. Due to such productivity demands, com- bined with all the required paperwork and phone calls, a 13-hour day once or twice a week is not unusual in order to keep on top of client needs. I knew I probably wouldn't be compensated salary-wise for my degree, but at least I expected that the workload would not exceed what can be accom- plished in a 40-hour workweek..

In body, she is as weary as the cold, night air is dreary. But she ignores her fatigue and the dark as she listens to the beat of her heart which reassures her in the silence that she has made a difference. Counseling, like life, is full of \"isms.\" An \"ism\" has a numberof defimtions, and its implemen- tation varies in degree from neg- ative to positive. One definition of an \"ism\" is a distinct doctrine, system or theory. A complemen- tary definition is that an \"ism\" may be a practice, process or action. There are literally dozens of \"isms,\" so I wrn be able to mention only a few here. Negative isms' On one side of the ledger, racism -the belief that one group of people is superior to another and should be treated better -is an example of a harmful \"ism.\" Terrorism,which is the use of violence to intimidate or coerce others for political or ideological gain, falls into the destructive \"isms\" category, too. Indeed, many people live in fear of what may befall them as a result of the practices of others. Both racism and terrorism are among the worst \"isms\" we face in the world today. They have a long history and have plagued the world with barbaric beliefs and horrific acts for hundreds of years. Think of slavery and the events of 9/11 for example. Tragically, they have caused the death, destruction and ruin of many innocent lives. A second class of \"isms\" is somewhat milder in degree, at least on the surface, but no less destructive in the long run than those just cited. Two of these, sexism and ageism, stand out because of their prevalence in society. They are not seen as being as blatantly brutal as other categories of injurious \"isms.' Indeed, they usually aren't at first. However, to discriminate against an individual because ofsex, sexual orientation or age and to deny someone privileges and possibilities when there are no overt reasons for doing so is, in the words of Stiren Kierke- gaard, a \"sickness unto death.\" The beliefs and behaviors that accompany this second class of destructive \"isms\" hurt and slowly destroy the persons at which they are aimed. Society, as a whole, is weakened also. As counselors we need to stand up against demeaning and devastating \"isms.\" We all have a stake in each others' lives, for when one of us is hurt or brutal- ized for reasons beyond that person's control (such as being Asian, Jewish, female, gay or 70), all of us suffer. Our human- ity transcends our individual identities, and an act against one of us is an act against all of us. We are all connected. Unless we consciously fight against the \"isms of affliction,' we all will be infected with a callous and caustic spirit that will indeed kill us ethically, morally, emotional- ly and physically.Positive 'isms' Despite the deplorability of the \"isms\" I have just men- tioned, there are at least three positive \"isms\" that we need to talk more about. They are at the heart of counseling, and we must be ever mindful of them. The first is altruism, an un- selfish concern for the welfare of others. This kind of unselfish- ness is a core reason most of us become counselors. We want to help others find their identities, make sound decisions, over- come trying circumstances and live productive lives. The finan- cial rewards and public recogni- tion for such services are mod- est at best. Yet the payoff is an internal satisfaction at having made a difference in the lives of our fellow voyagers. Money and acknowledgment cannot com- pare to the satisfaction and plea- sure we derive from these kind acts of helping. A second productive \"ism\" that we too seldom celebrate is optimism, the tendency to expect the best and to dwell on Continued on page 71 THF prenv:re one biofeedback provid- One clear choice er delivers such a breadth of professional training programs and equipment.

At this conference, more than 120 people from nine different countries were represented. There were many education ses- sions, Learning Institutes, book displays and opportunities to exchange information. At one point, I even found myself tak- ing a short hike with profession- al counselors who came from the United States, the United Kingdom and Turkey. What I was struck by was the fact that we really do live in a global vil- lage. Many of the challenges facing professional counselors and counselor educators in the United States are similar to the 6obstacles that their peers in other nations are also grappling with each day. The fact that people would travel several hours to attend the EB-ACA conference is a testimonial to a number of things. First, that the confer- ence has developed a reputation for delivering quality programs at a reasonable cost and attracts some well-respected presenters in the field of professional counseling. In addition, the EB-ACA conference is a place where professional counselors and counselor educators have an opportunity to network and dis- cuss important issues facing the profession. Lastly, visiting with other attendees made me realize thatliving in the United States can sometimes result in faulty assumptions. For example, there is a perception by some that, given the wealth of the United States and its commit- ment to education and research, we know the best ways to pro- vide professional counseling services. Living in the United States can provide a false sense that there is no need to look beyond our physical borders when it comes to the explo- ration and discussion of coun- seling issues. Those who think that are wrong. Being at the EB-ACA meet- ing helped me to put things in perspective. While the United States does indeed have great wealth and upward of 275,000 professional counselors, indi- viduals living in other parts of the world are doing some amazing things relative to teaching, research and service. What is your outlook on pro- fessional counseling around the world? This question is rhetori- cal in that the very scope of thinking about counseling \"throughout the world\" is both overwhelming and complex. What I encourage you to do(regardless of where you live in the world) is to reach out in some way to experience how counseling services or the edu- cation of counselors occurs in a country other than your own. I believe this type of activity is helpful in seeing both the simi- larities and differences in the practice of professional coun- seling throughout the world. When we look at people from other places, other countries and other cultures, we first notice our differences. Howev- er, the longer we look, the more we begin to see our similarities. Finding these commonalities, and working toward how best to serve those who are in need of professional counselors, is something that the ACA com- munity should continue to pur- sue. We use the phrase \"interna- tional\" to describe those from other nations, but when we say \"global,\" we are then able to see ourselves as a community. Just four months from now, thousands of counselors will gather in Atlanta to attend the 53rd Annual ACA Convention. For those of you planning to attend the event, which will run from April 6-10 next year, Ihope you will take the opportu- nity to participate in some of the events that present counseling from a global perspective.

As I began to reflect on my experience as an international counseling student, I reviewed the literature and did some research on my own. There are many issues and challenges that confront all international stu- dents, but my personal experi- ence also highlights areas of concern somewhat unique to international students in a coun- seling training program. Scaling language barriers English proficiency is one of the major academic hurdles many international students en- counter and is a significant pre- dictor of their academic success. This was true for me even though I grew up in a multilin- gual society and received part ofmy education in English. I was considered above average on the Test of English as a Foreign Language when I came to grad- uate school in the United States. But I Was not prepared for the difficulties in decoding Ameri- can colloquialisms, adjusting to various accents (e.g., Midwest- ern and Southern), changing from British spelling to Ameri- can spelling (e.g., \"programme\" to \"program\") and speaking with less \"Malaysian\" accent so locals could understand me. It was critical for me to improve my verbal skills before prac- ticum because communication is crucial in counseling Ameri- can clients. I took an evening course in American English pronuncia- tion and debated the need for a second English course to remove my accent but decided against it. I wasn't ready to give up that much of who I am lin-guistically. All this extra work still left me with instafnces where clients were uncomfort- able with my accent. Upon answering the phone, for example, the inquirer polite- ly told me that he had nothing against me, but would like to speak with a therapist who spoke American English. Another time one of my col- leagues told me that the parent of the family she had referred for counseling was not sure if she could understand me, after the parent spoke to me briefly over the phone to set up an appointment. The colleague as- sured her of my ability to com- mumcate and of my experience with family counseling and encouraged them to give me a try. I was grateful that they took the risk. My colleague later reported that this parent, despite her initial doubts, said that my English wasn't a problem at all. Language-related experiences seem to be magnified for inter- national counseling students who come from non-English speaking countnes. One survey I conducted found that coun-selor educators thought interna- tional counseling students from non-Western countries have more English proficiency prob- lems than those from Western countries in both clinical set- tings and other clinical courses. An additional problem for those of us experiencing a lan- guage barrier is internalizing the struggle and wondering whether it indicates an inability to be an effective counselor. Resilience and courage have empowered us to cross geographic and cultural barriers in coming to the United States and pursuing our dreams to become professional coun- selors. These same characteris- tics can be used to proactively find ways to overcome the lan- guage hurdle. Skills and resilience are not necessarily enough for a good counseling relationship. We mist also remember to respect clients' choices and understand their discomfort about commu- nicating with someone from another culture who speaks dif- ferently. Such hurdles are some- times intentionally avoided, but they can also be embraced asgreat opportunities to expand the multicultural awareness and skills of international counsel- ing students -and clients as well. My encounters with American clients have taught me to quick- ly inform them of my nationali- ty and encourage them to let me know when my communication is not clear. I use the obvious differences between us to open a conversation on the importance of addressing cultural differ- ences in counseling. Overcoming missing background studies International counseling stu- dents often do not possess the thorough psychology back- ground that others have when enterifig a counseling program. Most reading materials deal almost etirely with Western- based psychological concepts, so I was embarrassed when I asked my theory professor, \"What is operant conditioning?\" The look of surprise on his face, and on the faces of my American Continued on page 16 I, Graduate Students T~ht~ B COUNSELING A Creative Force in the Fabric of Life ACA ANNUAL CONVENTION * APRIL 6-to * ATLANTA, GAFirst Year Professionals Seniors Now recruiting volunteers for The ACA 2005 Annual Convention in Atlanta, GA, April 6 -10, 2005 * Mingle with counseling legends * Network with peers from all over the world * Explore future career options and research collaborations * HAVE FUN AND SAVE MONEY ! 12 hours of volunteer service guarantees. first-time recruits reimbursement of one-half off their registration fee.

DUNCAN Female bullies and their prime targets Editor's note: This is the final article in a three-part series that defines bullying as a form of child abuse perpetrated by chil- dren against other children. See the October 2004 and November 2004 issues of Counseling Today to read the first two articles. \"Sugar and spice and all things nice\" are words from a childhood nursery rhyme that attempts to idealize society's vision of girls in terms of their femininity, personality and character. But ask any girl whohas been the target of the female bully and she will niost likely tell you: \"That couldn't be further from the truth!\" While girls are still the primary victims of familial abuse and violence, they are hlso fast becoming perpetrators of bully abuse.-And often the targets of their abuse are other girls. At times, female bullies can become just as physically abu- sive and violent as male bullies. They have been known to band together and physically assault both boys and girls. In a Canadi-an study, girls reported that they had taken another student's lunch money, beat up or threat- ,ened somebody with a weapon and engaged in stealing by using threats of physical violence at school. However, this stereotypi- ca pattern of male bully behav- ior does not always hold for the female bully. The male bully will often act alone, but while seek- ing the approval of peers who witness his abuse in school. The female bully often engages other peers to be a part of the abuse by taking an active role in maintain- ing an abusive cycle with anoth- er student. How female abuse differs Girls who abuse other children are more covert. They use indi-rects seemingly subtle, behind- the-back, manipulative tactics of abuse. They often engage in coercion, gossip, isolation tac- tics, backstabbing, verbal taunt- ing, threats-of aggression, char- acter assassination and exclu- sion. Their abusive behavior is often more difficult for adults to ascertain and identify than the typical male's behavior of physi- cal aggression, sexual harass- ment or threats of violence. The motivation for girl bullies is also less related to the gender stereotypes of bully abuse and more related to dominating social circles, maintaining popu- larity and appearance, control- ling a peer group and having their power accepted by those students whom. they call theirfriends. These are the reasons female bully abuse is often referred to as \"relational abuse.\" Pafterns of abuse Like their male counterparts, girl bullies can grow up to become adults who use or threaten abuse within their fam- ilies, in the workplace or in theii neighborhoods. Recent studies indicate that while women make up 86 perceht of those who are targets of workplace bully abuse, they also make up 58 per- cent of the perpetrators. Just like when they were in school, women engage in emotional and verbal abuse against other women within the workplace.

Optimism is a second pillar on which counseling is built as a practice and a profession. It enables us to envision and have a future. It keeps us going. A few years ago, one of my children was feeling critical and said: \"You know, Dad, the trouble with you is that you're too optinustic?' I took his remark as a compli- ment. Certainly, if we do not have positive expectations for our clients, we will most likely be of little service to them. In fact, we will be of little help to anyone, including ourselves. Optimism is like a street where realism, encouragement and possibility meet. Those who travel this road get better instead of bitter.The final dynamic, good \"ism\" I think we need to under- score in counseling is heroism. Think of the professional coun- selors who have made a differ- ence in your -life or in the lives of others: counselors such as Fannie Cooley from Tskegee, Ala., or Dick Hackney, from Syracuse, N.Y Most likely the professionals you envision have been heroic in the best sense of the word by putting aside per- sonal agendas and acting with courage to assist the individuals who sought their support. Be- cause of their ability and deter- mination to go forward in a quiet, unsung, but productive way, lives were changed and choices were made that enabled and empowered. There is no greater service than to stand inthe background and do such unnoticed, yet significant, first- rate deeds. Therefore we should, when- ever possible, publicly com- memorate the helpful and con- structive \"isms\" that make a significant difference in our world. Altruism, optimism and heroism are the bedrock values on which counseling is built. They are qualities that are embraced and cultivated by counselors who make a differ- ence. In addition, they are char- acteristics we must keep em- phasizing regardless of where we are in our careers. To dwell on the negative \"isms\" of our world, such as racism, terror- ism, sexism and ageism, is important up to a point, but it must be balanced with a looktoward and emphasis on the positive \"isms.\" To focus sim- ply on the negatives is to invite discouragement, burnout, frus- tration and even anger. The power of positive 'isms' Humanity may yet evolve, as Pierre Teilhard de Chardin hypothesized and Abraham Maslow wrote about, to the point where destructive \"isms\" are eliminated. If that happens, there will be convergence and the farthest reaches of human- kind may be realized. Regard- less, we should use the power we have now to promote helpful \"isms\" -altruism, optimism and heroism. Interestingly, if the more pro-social \"isms\" are enlarged, those that are detri-iental will lose power. As counselors we work with a vari- ety of clients, ranging from the anxious to the anorexic, the behaviorally depressed to the blatantly oppressed, the careless to the calloused, and the disor- dered to the disengaged. Employing productive \"isms\" in caring for those who seek our help may promote within them a vision of \"what is\" as well as \"what can be?' If that happens, then there is movement. And if there is movement, we may become like the woman in the opening poem as we reflect with modesty, but with some reassur- ance, on how we have made a difference in the lives of those we have encountered. 0 ' AT ARGOSY UNIVERSITY THE POWER OF THE MIND IS LIMITLESS.

One of the positive out- comes of studies with adoles- cent offenders is that early ther- apeutic intervention shows promise at preventing more de- structive patterns later in life. The immediate effects of emotional and verbal abuse by girls are not always apparent because, unlike physical abuse, there may not be recognizable injuries or immediate identifi- able repercussions of the bully's behavior. But emotional and Verbal abuse leaves injuries that can often last a lifetime, leaving permanent marks upon a girl's developing sense of self. Some girls report that social ostra- cism, ridicule, belittlement and constant criticism can hurt more -and for a longer time -than a simple slap to the face. Because girls are socialized to \"fit in\" and be \"popular,\" they often will put up with abuse by female bullies rather than report it or ask for help.Underlying causes of gils abusing other girls Over the years studies and climcal reports have examined how girls who are victims of abuse in childhood often see that abuse extend into their adult lives. More recent are attempts to understand what causes girls to develop into bullies (and adult perpetrators). While the answers are not yet definitive, the available information does point to some readily dis- cernible and emerging conclu- sions worthy of further study. These c6nclusions are not stereotypes of girls as backbit- ing and vicious. Rather they give thoughtful consideration to understanding this ever-growing problem and- developing inter- ventions that are solution-ori- ented on behalf of girls -both the bullies and the victims. Among the emerging factors that contribute to girls becoming perpetrators of bully abuse: The media. There is no deny- ing the impact the media have had and will continue to have upon this generation of children. Given the ever-increasing hours children spend in front of the tele- vision and the lack of supervisionwithin the home (often due to multiple reasons), children are inundated with potentially nega- tive images and see only a few positive role models among the media stars they idolize. Through videos, CDs and TV shows such as Sex in the City and Survivor, and from news coverage of scandals, wars, vio- lence and political campaigns, children are bombarded with narrow views of humanity, evi- dence of hypocrisy and in- stances of \"winning at any cost.\" One of the messages received is that character assassination of a peer is OK if it gets you what you want. Within the current media culture, girls (and boys)- have few role models who espouse the genuine and positive aspects of being a girl (or a boy). While not the only source of learning, the media do have an influence on how girls view themselves, each other, their relationships and their develop- ing values. Cultural changes and new expectations. When girls abuse other girls, one of the underly- ing factors is competition -for friends, for attention, for com- pliments or for control. Thiscompetition can be fierce as girls make the transition from grade school .to middle school and then from middle school to high school. Bully abuse by both boys and girls can increase during this period of dramatic and rapid change. This is a destabilizing time for kids. Not only are they moving into a new physical location, they are also moving into another stage of adolescent development and moving away from what has been familiar. They deal with these major life changes as best they can, often with little recog- nition that they could use some concerted help to make these changes occur more smoothly. Grade school, middle school and high school cultures are markedly different from one another, and with these cultural changes come new expectations often not readily known to kids beforehand. One of these unknown expectations is that friends are going to change. A girl, and her friends, might make new friends. These cultur- al changes and new expectations can trigger fierce competition in some girls, causing them to become more aggressive in theirbehavior toward friends and peers in an attempt to control what feels beyond their control. A lack of conflict-resolution skills. Contrary to the stereo- type that \"girls are the ones who understand relationships:' they do not naturally know how to resolve conflicts and differ- ences. Talking to their girl- friends about what they are feel- ing or thinking, how they are changing during this critical stage of development or what they may need from each other is not a natural process for most girls at this age. But girls need these skills to make a healthy passage from puberty through adolescence and into young adulthood. Overriding desire to fit in. Girls have a fear of expressing their individual uniqueness and personal preferences because of their overriding desire to fit in and be accepted by their friends. Adolescence is a time of explo- ration and emerging identity, but both the exploration and the emergence are thwarted when girls aren't supported or encour- aged to express their differ- Continued on page 21 Announcing the GuildScholar Program for 2006 O pen to all legally blind students entering their senior year of high school in autumn 2005.

FARRELL AND JA'NITTA MARBURY As a graduate student in the field of counseling, you may not realize it yet, but now is the time in life when all doors are open to you. This might be difficult to fathom, especially as you are busy trying to complete your degree or becoming acclimated to your new counseling posi- tion. Yet the doors are open, and membership in the American Counseling Association is proof of their existence. ACA mem- bership opens doors to network- ing and job opportunities, out- of-classroom knowledge acqui- sition and camaraderie with other counseling professionals. We, as members, provide these opportunities, these doors, to one another. Thus the continua- tion, enhancement and expan- sion of these opportunities rest with ACA members -both the new and renewed. With this in mind, the Gradu- ate Student and New Profession- aal Task Force was developed to assist with the recruitment and retention of ACNs graduate stu- dent and new professional mem- bers. Ja'Nitta Marbury (Kent State University) and Rebecca Farrell (Virginia Tech) are co- chairing the task force. Its other members are: * Samuel Wolfe, the Ohio State University * Michelle Amand, Bridgewa- ter State University M Jeff Hughes, Ohio University E Kim Snow, Northern Illinois University E Victoria Palmisano, State University of New York at Buffalo * Michael Rankins, University of Missouri-St. Louis * Durelle Freeman, Western New Mexico University * Pamela Paisley, Governing Council liaison * Jennifer Kukorlo, ACA staff liaison For the next year, the taskforce will eyplore and make rec- ommendations on how graduate students and new professionals can increase their involvement and recognition in ACA. In doing so, task force members need your assistance. We will be seeking your input as we exam- ine ways to address the needs of graduate students and new pro- fessionals. Your feedback is vital. We would also like your help disseminating information to colleagues so we can broaden our scope. During the September meet- ing of the Governing Council the task force presented motions addressing convention and hotel rates, extension of the new pro- fessional status and defining all but dissertation (ABD) status for doctoral candidates. The Governing Council asked the task force to refine these motions for further review. The task force will announce the results when final decisions on the motions are made. In examining the relevance ofthis task force and deciding what reasons they have for shar- ing information, graduate stu- dents and new professionals should keep in mind that ACA President Samuel T. Gladding strongly believes that we are the \"lifeblood\" of this organization. Task force members echo his belief. We don't necessarily have to wait for the future to become leaders. For us the time is now in the way we promote ACA in our programs and to faculty and colleagues, encour- age new membership and help to retain it, advocate, assurine leadership and mentoring roles, attend conventions and recog- nize the numerous benefits of being involved. Active partici- pation in ACA and the GSNP Task Force can assist you in finding your way and molding your future in the dynamic world of counseling. What does your student or new professional membership in ACA mean to you? Take some time to reflect on how you irr7would like to become more involved and what it will take. It's fine to ask, \"What can ACA do for me?\" But don't stop there. Also ask, \"What can I do for ACA?\" Decide now how you will continue to develop your professional identity, assume leadership and mentor- ing roles, and contribute to the growth of ACA and its \"lifeblood.\" E Rebepca L.

The FY 2004 deficit is more than $400 billion, and making permanent the recently enacted tax cuts bene- fiting primarily Americans who are more well-off will all but require that domestic spending be frozen or reduced. Bush and others are also consideriing insti- tuting a regressive flat tax or a sales tax. To win future battles for maintaining or increasing spending on specific domestic programs -such as the Ele- mentary and Secondary School Counseling Program -advo- cates first will need to win the larger tax policy war. IDEA reauthorization Reauthorization of the Indi- viduals with Disabilities Educa- tion Act occurred in the final hours of Congress' work before Thanksgiving. A review will appear in the January 2005 issue of Counseling Today; informa- tion is available now at www.counseling. org/public. With IDEA done, Congress willnext reauthorize the Perkins Vocational and Technical Edu- cation Act and the Higher Edu- cation Act, and may revisit aspects of the No Child Left Behind Act. Medicaid The Bush administration and Congress may push, to turn Medicaid into a block grant pro- gram or otherwise enable states to more easily cut beneficiaries and services. ACA will join other groups in working to pro- tect Medicaid's role as part of the social safety net. State leg- islatures will continue to make Medicaid decisions on coverage of specific providers or services. Medicare ACA is hopeful that Congress will take up legislation to make minor corrections to the Med- icare prescription drug law; we need a larger Medicare bill \"train\" to leave the station, allowing us to attach our coun- selor coverage provision. Our primary task remains winningover House members and lead- ers. We'll continue working with the American Mental Health Counselors Association to lobby Congress, and will need to complement this with a sustained grass-roots effort. Mental health parity This year's Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treat- ment Act (S. 486/H.R. 953) faced firm opposition from House leaders and received only lukewarm support among Sen- ate leaders. The only option for supporters of mental health parity may be to push a more watered-down version. None of the expected incoming chairs of the key House committees was a cosponsor of H.R. 953, and House leaders are unlikely to see the need to start supporting parity now. Welfare reauthorization Congress has until March 30, 2005, to either enact welfare reform or pass another tempo-rary extension of current wel- fare law. ACA is working with other advocates to push Con- gress toward the Senate's ver- sion of a welfare reauthorization bill, and away from the dracon- ian version passed very early in 2003 by the House.

The psychological teriis and concepts were less familiar to me because I came from an edu- cational system in which psy- chology'was'not taught in high school. That field of study was open only to college students in the schools of art and social sci- ences, Many international coun- seling students are even' less familiar with psychology and will need to do extra work and get support from others when learning about these issues. Finding professors who reach out to students Though this may not seem unusual to students in the Unit- ed States- the approachability of American professors -and the manner in which they treated me with respect and affirmation -was a big surprise. My edu- cation prior to coming t6 the United States was in a system with no obvious concern about the influence of teacher-student relationships on learning. -I was shocked when a profes- sor called to inform me. of my grades and wish me happy holi- 4 2301 Wes, 0a 800.777.4RWC 16day. I was embarrassed an; at the same time felt affirmed when another professor stopped and waited for me to tell me I had done'well on his exam the day before. No former teachers or professors in my home coun- try had ever taken such person- al interest. - The affirmation and mentor- ing I received as a graduate stu- dent was also invaluable in help- ing me adjust to the new learn- ing environment. It contributed to raising my academic perfor- mance to a level I had never pre- viously attained. International students in particular need this type of attention and they should seek cross-culturally sensitive professors for , such support. Developing cross-cultural competence Counseling requires that counselors coihceptualize the issues/situdtions of their clierits in the proper cultural context, but the major counseling theo- ries taught in American counsel- ing programs are based priman- ly on Western thinking and philosophies. I wasn't surprised to find in my reseakch that coun- -selor educators say non-Westeri international counseling stu- dents encounter more problems' with Western understanding of and approaches to treating men- tal health issues. Many Western concepts -for example, Freud's psychosexual stages, the idea of the gestalt, and the empty chair technique -are foreign to non-Westem cultures and training. . I remember learning an inter- vention modality for teen-age suicide in which the parents were required to tell the young person who attempted suicide that they loved him and didn't want to see him die. I wondered how this model could be applied to a Malaysian Chinese setting. Malaysian Chinese often re- serve the- Chinese equivalent of the word \"love\" for romantic love. Parents communicate their love for their children using words that imply treasure, fohd- ness and importance. There are many such concepts that must be inodified to become cultural- ly appropriate. International students need to develop an additional level of cross-cultural competence that can help them transfer andtrainspprt what they learn in the tnited States back to their own cultural milieus. The goal is not to export-' Western counseling ideologies and practices via international counseling stu- dents, but to promote global mental health ac6ess that attends to people's needs within their cultural context. Interiational counseling studdents'are the best channels to achieve this goal, and they must strive to blend the best of both cultures, Most counselor educators in my research expressed admira- tion for intematiopal counseliiig students and generallysaw these students as haviig strong work ethics. The faculty believed these students enriched 'their programs and they valued the experiefice of working with international students. Despite the many challenges international counseling stu- dents may encounter, our strengths and determination can help us to thrive afd succeed in training. We also enhance the learning experience of local stu- dents as well as the teaching experience of our professors with the strengths, unique expe-riences and diverse perspectives we bringto the table. International students require the courage to advocate for their needs and concerns. Self-advo- cacy can be difficult for some of us because it goes against our cultural belief that devalues self- promotion. But when. we advo- cate for-ourselves we also advo- cate for the needs of other inter- national students. Such advoca-, cy also expahds the scope of multiculturalism from -an \"American-centric\" focus to an increasingly important intema- tional and global perspective. I hope more research on the training needs of intemational counseling students will emerge in the near future and that it will come partly from the self-advo- cacy of international students. Such research will further the cause of the profession of coun- seling, especially when the pro- fession and the world are mov- ing so quickly toward interna- tionalization.E Kok-Mun N\\g is an assitent professor at the University of North Carolia-Charlotte. .

Spiritual survival Florida counselor hosts therapeutic retreats into the wilderness for women BY ANGELA KENNEDY SENIOR STAFF WRITER Thirteen years ago, Deborah Weir was perusing her counsel- ing degree, struggling to make ends meet and slipping further into debt like many other college students. She had recently pur- chased a car and thought it would be nice to get away and visit a friend for a few days, but she hit a proverbial bump in the road. Along a desolate strip of high- way in rural Florida, her engine blew. Stranded alone at night, she felt scared and powerless. For the next week, she argued with mechanics and tried to fig- ure out how to. get back home with what little money she had left. While waiting for her car to be repaired, she passed the time reading a survival book a friend had loaned her. \"The book was philosophical and spoke on how we as a culture had become very dependent on technology and we really didn't know how to survive,\" Weir said. \"At that time I was totally relating to the book. So, I thought to myself, 'OK, when I get out of this situ- ation I'm going to go to.thig sur- vival school (mentioned in the book) and I'm going to learnishow to take care of myself.\"' Six months later Weir attend- ed Tom Brown's Tracker School in Asbury, N.J. \"It was really a turning point in my life,\" Weir said. \"The instructors encour- aged us to go out and help others to reconnect with nature and the natural elements?' On the bus ride home she made a commitment to herself to incorporate the healing ele- ments of nature into her career as a counselor. Today Weir is a National Certified Counselor and a Licensed Mental Health Counselor in private practice in Tampa, Fla. She has played host to women-only wilderness and survival retreats for the last 11 years. \"I gained so much self- esteem and self-empowerment from that training that I contin- ued to train and put myself on a mission to teach other women flow to survive in nature, which I call Women in the Wilder- ness,' she said. Weir schedules a minimum of four seminars a year for women who are interested in becoming more adept at outdoor activities and nature-centered philosophy. In the beginning she passed out fliers about the weekend trips,but now attendees are recruited through her network of acquain- tances, former and current clients, and word-of-mouth. \"This is not an experience for someone who has a mental dis- order because it can be challeng- ing,\" she said. 'It's not a good idea for people with anxiety or panic disorders. I really try to screen those who come, either through an interview or ques-' tionnaire. It's more for women who need to just get away from their hectic or chaotic lives and just have a weekend out in nature. It's very relaxing and you feel this wonderful harinony and peace. It's for someone who is dealing with a problem like a bad relationship, grief or spiritu- al issues -just something that would be mce to step back from and look at from a distance!' Weir likes to limit the groups to approximately a dozen wom- en. She has found through expe- rience that including too many women can get chaotic, while groups that are too small pro- duce a less rewarding en- counter. Retreat locations vary, * and some are more rustic thai others. At first this can be a bit unnerving for many women because it's their first time sleeping away from home with- out the comforts of a hotel and minibar. Campers are encour- aged to purchase their own sup- plies and recreatiopal gear in hopes they will continue using it after their initial experience in the woods. Weir, however, does bring equipment to loan out. The retreats usually begin on a Friday evening and run until noon on Sunday. Activities, group sessions and classes are held on Saturday. Attendees learn wilderness survival skills such as determining which plants are edible, identifying animal trails and making an emergency shelter out of sticks and debris. They also are taught basic camping skills, including pitching a tent, building fires and cooking in an in-ground pit. Hiking, canoeing and other out- door activities make the time fly by for campers. Although Weir usually establishes an activities agenda, all phases are optional and campers have the freedomto atteid or take part in other recreational pursuits. Later in the afternoon on Satur- day, Weir begins to prepare the meal, but this isn't the typical campfire fare. \"We will do things like chicken and asparagus with hollandaise sauce,\" she said. \"It's usually something elegant that you wouldn't thnk you could cook in a hole in the ground. I don't want the women to think that this is really 'roughing it'- it's an elegant experience. I want them to have a great experience so they will'want to go back.\" The campers help Weir by hol- lowing out a pit and lining it with large stones that have been heat- ed by the fire and wild grasses. Food packets wrapped in foil are laid on the stones and then cov- ered. While the food is cooking, Weir encourages the participants to go off on their own to explore the grounds, journal or meditate. She often assigns campers a cre- ative activity using beads, clay or some natural element found around them. The women re- group at sunset and find their meal ready to eat. During the course of the weekend, Weir gathers the women together several times, to lead semi-structured group ther- apy sessions. She incorporates earth-based religions and Native American philosophies into her teachings, sessions and activities on the retreats. For example, Weir mighi give the campers a piece of paper and have them write down something they either want to get nd of or bring about in their lives. \"I will facil- itate a ritual around the campfire where we burn the paper and send out energy,\" she said. \"I try to teach them that every element in life is spiritual if we give attention to it. Every element of life is precious and every experi- *ence is significant.\" Weir never reveals to the group which participants are her cur- ,rent or former clients, but many of the women voluntarily share that information about them- selves. \"There are some ethical issues involved in this,\" Weir said. \"I won't refer a client'who I'm really in the middle of thera- py with. Usually the clients I encourage to come are either just coming in on maintenance, or they aren't in active therapy any- more. Some may just need a tran- sition into a group setting.\" Oth- erwise, she said, problems could arise because she reveals much more of her personal self to the women on the retreat. \"Some- times our relationships change,\" Weir said of clients who have joined her in the wilderness. \"I've lost clients because I think it just wouldn't be right to con- tinue our therapeutic relation- ship. I realize that might happen, so I take that into consideration when I refer people.\" Ultimately, Weir believes that providing this unique experience for women is more important than keeping a client long term. To avoid sticky situations though, she tries to take on more the persona of a spiritual guide than a therapist while on the wilderness retreats. \"I keep myself a little bit at a distance to some degree,\" she said. \"I go to bed early and let them stay up talking. I like the fact that when they start connecting, I can step back a bit. But I do have to play the role of a counselor because there is a lot of sharing going on once the women get comfortable with one another and the wilder- ness magic starts to take hold. It's a very powerful experience.\" Beth Lawson, 38, is a website designer and mother of a new- born. She started attending the camping trips more than eight years ago. \"When I got home from the first trip I tried to explain it to my boyfriend, but I just couldn't put into words all the things that happened and how wonderful it was for me,\" she said. \"At that point in my life I was pretty depressed, and that trip really changed my life. I made incredible friends the first time out?' Before going on the trip Law- son really didn't know what to expect. Even though she had some camping experience, she was nervous about going into the wilderness with strangers. \"I just thought I would receive a kind of. 'wilderness education,:\" she said, \"but I got more therapy and inner- self healing out of it than I ever expected. It was way more thanIt's so relaxing and healing. You are self-sufficient out there. You are sleeping out in the wilderness all by yourself. You have all,the other women with you, so you still have a bit of a comfort zone, but it really is empowering to say that you did it.\" Lawson credits Weir's coun- seling skills for the healing and life changes that take place at the retreats. \"She is so wonderful at leading the groups:' Lawson said. \"She canlead you to bring out things that you didn't know bothered you, or things that you never thought you would feel comfortable talking about. But you are never pressured to talk. Some women don't, and they feel just as healed at the end of the weekend as those who chat- ted on and on?' Joan George, a professor at the University of South Florida-St. Petersburg, went on her first WTW excursiom in 1996. She has lost track of the number of others she has since attended. \"It's a different encounter for each woman depending on what she comes out there looking for,\" George said. \"In general, I think it is that you can achieve a sense of peacefulness and oneness with nature: You need and deserve to have time for yourself.\" She continued, \"I think a lot of the women come there com- pletely harassed and harried by their work, school, kids, hus- bands -all these needs that people place on them. There comes a point when they need some alone time, or 'them' time. They need to look after their own fleeds and creativity and do what they want to do, whether it's reading a book in the sun or sit- ting in the shade and drinking a glass of lemonade. You go back feeling really rejuvenated and ',ready to face the world again?' George feels a certain amount of pride when she tells people about WITW. \"I describe it as Girl Scouts for grown-ups. It's made me more outgoing, and I've become more skilled at approach- ing and talking to new people.\" Tracey Robert, president of the Association for Spiritual, Ethical and Religious Values in Coun- seling, said that integrating phys- building fires and pitching tents. .ical activity, connection withDuring the closing ceremony, campers share a group hug and thank the nature spirits around them. nature and reflection can be very therapeutic. \"People can see change through their accom- plishments, even if it's a little '.thing like having the stamina to hike up a trail,' Robert said. \"That self-reliance builds self- esteem. 'At the end of the day they realize they have a lot of internal strength and resiliency.\" Robert noted that nature retreats also help women to focus on the tasks at hand and step away from the everyday issues causing them anxiety and stress. Robert said many therapeutic nature retreats have no specific end goal. \"My familiarity with similar programs is that they keep it away from being deeply therapeutic,\" Robert said. \"It's an opportunity to focus on oneself. Though the act of women com- bining -their wisdom can be very powerful, and that experience can be very therapeutic.\" Last summer, Ginny Kelly, a past president of the Internation- al Association of Addictions and Offender Counselors, went on an all-women camping expedition through Outward Bound. The program is designed for women who have experienced some sort of violence in their lives, be itchildhood sexual and/or physical abuse, sexual assault or an abu- sive adult relationship. Partici- pants are beyond the crisis phase of responding to their abuse and havq completed or are nearing the completion, of a traditional group or individual counseling program. Although the course reinforces the essential themes of counseling -women as sur- vivors rather than victims; that women have the. right to live healthy lives, free of violence - the program is not facilitated by a mental health professional. The seven-day journey in the Adiron- dack Mountains provides a time and place for the next stage of healing where the women can explore who they, are beyond being survivors. It focuses on increasing self-esteem and self- reliance, building supportive relationships with other women, enhancing body awareness and giving women a sense of their physical strength. \"It was a great experience, but it was really intense,\" Kelly said. \"We had no contact with the out- side world for a full week, and it rained most of the time. But it was very therapeutic. We were so interdependent on.one anoth-er. You were really forced to get to know these people. For me, I always loved the outdoors, but there were so many physically challenging things that we had to do. I think that when you strip away all the day-to-day things, there is something that is really healing about that. It is survival. You have to be who you are, and you don't have any of those nor- mal trappings that you can fall into.\" Similar to Weir's retreats, the women on the Outward Bound excursion connected through the experience. They comforted each other, and many felt for the first time that they were not alone. \"It was challenging, but I never had so much fun. I hadn't laughed that hard' in years,\" Kelly said. \"This kind of environment feeds into a bonding and a level of inti- macy that is truly healing. It changed me., There really was this empowering thing that hap- pened- You do things that you never imagined that you could be capable of doing. Being able to focus on nature and spirituality lets you get back to what is real- ly important in your life.\" '19 itUQJUIft 72 f ,L7 , )37, .- 7w 77 Keynote Panel on Saturday, April 9Convention Rates ADVANCE- By March 15 'K, -, --N---, ~ Where do successful authors get their ideas?

Reader Viewpoint Continued from page 12 ences, appreciate their unique- ness and examine interests that may not appeal to their friends. Carol Gilligan, an author who studies female moral develop- ment, says that \"1Vean behav- iors do, in fact, bud as adoles- cence dawns and girls learn to curb their words and recast themselves to please others. She knows she has to not be herself if she wants other people to value her and include her,\" Often girls are unable to express their true selves because of a dual sense of loss stemming from no longer being who they were in grade school and being unable to fully explore who they might be today or next year. As Gilligan states, \"They feel they can't say what they know, so they tend to become silent or outraged -quiet and mean.\" Asgirls get caught within this emo- tional and social spiral they can become more angry, frustrated, aggressive and violent. Family abuse: There is a sig- nificant group of girls who per- petrate bully abuse becaus 'of the abuse found within their families. This abuse is either directed toward them by their parents or siblings, or they wit- ness abuse and violence be- tween their parents or as a par- ent directs the abuse toward another child. While abuse affects a child's development in -multiple ways, one of the more pervasive out- comes is a lack of information about emotions and the healthy (nonviolent) expiession of anger. Another aspect of family abuse is that children do not learn about compassionate behaviortoward others. Abuse confuses many aspects of life, but it can particularly distort what a healthy relationship looks like and how to treat others with whom you have a relationship. Interventions for girls who commit bully abuse The intervention strategies out- lined in the previous article (see \"Reader Viewpoint,\" November 2004) are also recommended with girls who perpetrate bully abuse in schools. It is especially important to haVe a component that helps girls to identify changes m friendships that are a natural and healthy part of life. Girls also benefit from learning how to express anger in a healthy, direct and straightfor- ward manner rather than in ways that are aggressive or passive-aggressive. Consciousness-rais- ing, where the focus is on finding the common background, history and rights that all girls share in our society, is also effective. Our culture still has a difficult time accepting that girls do feel angry or that there are times when anger is a healthy and connected emotion to what is occurring in their lives. Finily, it is particularly mean- ingful to encourage girls to chal- lenge (instead of tolerate) the stereotypes, pressures and nar- row definition of what it means to be a girl at each stage of their development. Giving girls the message that they do not have to sacrifice themselves to have superficial friendships with other girls or relationships with boys will help them gain confi- dence and develop a strong iden-tity that will prepare them for the future once they leave school. Both boys and girls benefit when they leam that stereotypes arenarrow and seldom based on genuine information, and that change is a natural part of life that brings new opportunities, not just loss. Allowing, teaching and providing children a forum for expressing their feelings and asking questions is often what they need during the turbulent years of passage from childhood to adolescence and beyond.

It will be published soon on the People to People Ambassador Program website at w.ambassadorprograns.org/. Here are a few highlights: The China Association for Mental Health Liu Fayan, president of CAMH, met with the Western delegates to discuss the associa- tion's history and gave an overview of its multidisciplinary services, regulations and prac- tices. The delegation asked ques- tions relating to counselor prepa- ration, outcome research on counseling, substance abuse, spirituality, gay and 'lesbian issues, death and dying, and inte- grating traditional methods in counseling, to namne a few. Their Chinese counterparts' questions focused on managing the mental health stigma, counselor equity in reimbursement, licensure orcounselor regulations with gov- ernments and available types of community services. - Suicide, especially among col- lege students, Was one of the main concerns of Chinese coun- selors. The cultural idea of \"sav- ing face\" and the fear of bringing shame to one's family add to the myriad of student pressures. The counselors traded ideas on pre- ventative efforts and campaigns. The Beijing Normal University Psychological Counseling Center The Beijing NormalUniversity Psychological Counseling Cen- ter is open to both university stu- dents and to members of the community. The center also pro- vides practice work for students and faculty from the school's psychology department. Center Director Tianping Want, profes- sor Xin Tao and associate profes- sor Ou Yangling discussed Chi- nese counseling theories, ap-proaches and techniques with the delegates. They reported that the demand for services at the center - has increased at an amazing rate during the last few Years. Eating disorders are significant issues among Chinese students. Tian- ping said data collected from three local universities found that 40 percent of female students think they are \"too fat\" when in fact 24 percent of those students are below normal weight. Other topics discussed were Post-Traumatic Stress Disor- der, sexual abuse, grief coun- seling, and family and couples counseling. \"Cancer work was also men- tioned and included an exchange around relaxation therapy and music therapy in helping pa- tients undergoing chemothera- py,\" said Lois in Arlington, Va. \"In Cluna, these patients are usually/often hospitalized for the duration of the treatment.This allows the university to partner with the hospital to do some studies on mutually agree- able interventions such as those (previously mentioned). In such cases, observations can be con- trolled. This is not as easy in the U.S. because patients often do chemo as outpatients, which limits some of the empirical implications.\" The Shanghai Mental Health Center The Shanghai Mental Health Center is one of the largest in China, employing more than 800 professionals, including nurses and doctors. The center sees upward of 200 people a day, seven days a week for services. ACA delegates met with head psychologists and psychothera- pists to discuss Western psycho- logical theoretical perspectives and Chinese cultural variables. The Chinese professionals explained that they combine the Delegates: I Jason (guide) 2 Ron McLean 3 Dorothy Bach 4 Susan B. Lee 5 Linda Peterson 6 M.L.

In Shanghai and other Westernized cities in China, they are able to use more'West- em-style therapy. \"(One of the Chinese doctors) asked about the U.S. theoretical perspectives used in counseling and psychotherapy,\" said dele- gate Patricia A. Marvel. \"It was noted that cognitive behavioral therapy was the most popular perspectives n both the U.S. and U.K., but all agreed that the other theoretical perspectives were also useful, and that blending theories is what really happens in most counseling situations.\" A lively discussion ensued regarding \"cultural bound syn- drome,\" a term unfamiliar to the American delegation. The phe- nomenon was explained as an extreme panic state experienced mainly by patients in rural areas. The syndrome has been known to affect entire villages. Mem- bers of the U.S. delegation com- pared this to American Indian spirit beliefs and Haitian vo6doo beliefs. Kaplan described it as a belief that evil spirits are watch- ing over a person and causing problems in his or her life. \"It's almost like the evil eye in Eastern European cultures,\" he said. Hong Kou District Mental Health Center The staff at Hong Kou District Mental Health Center uses cre-ative alternative therapies such as drama, music and art with all of its patients. The center also utilizes Morita therapy, a Japan- ese approach that employs pro- longed periods of self-reflection in which the patient prioritizes problems. This is followed by directed writing and drowsing for two weeks before an eventu- al return to normal life tasks. 'It sort of mixes counseling with Buddhism,\" Kaplan said. \"A person will think and meditate on their problem for hours at a time, and they find that it works.\" Delegate reflections \"Counselors in China are attempting to learn and adapt a variety of techniques that fit with their cultural values,\" said Linda Peterson, a Licensed Profession- al Counselor with a private prac- tice in Wayne, Pa. \"Some exam- ples include using Taoist thought with cognitive behavioral thera- py, modifying Japanese Morita therapy and focusing on com- munity-based programs rather than individuals.\" Minnie Livingston, a coun- selor for Roosevelt Middle- Senior High School in Roo- sevelt, N.Y, said the trip reaf- firmed the need for mental health professionals to be aware of multicultural issues when dealing with clients of different ethnicities. \"I feel it is very important as professional coun- selors and ACA members because the more we learn about different cultures, the more wecan grow professionally,\" she said. \"It's also a way for us to exchange information and knowledge with our colleagues who we are traveling with (so we can) take that back to our own profession as well. If we continue to state that we want to be able to work with a multicul- tural group of people, then we must be willing to understand and learn about where they come from. So when these types of opportunities come our way we must act on them. \"Professionally, I realized that we are not so different from China. We have to be open- minded to all things because our way is not always the right way and surely it is not the only way. We have to be willing to accept people for who they are and not look down on them because of their beliefs and their cultural. styles.\" Janet R. Merkel, a therapist and adjunct professor in Colum- bia, Md., agreed with Livingston that multicultural awareness is an important aspect in counsel- ing. In fact, it was what motivat- ed her to take the trip. \"I was especially interested in experi- encing a non-Western culture,\" she said. \"In recent years I have had mote Asian students in my classes and have seen them struggle with how to translate knowledge about counseling theory and technique into their cultural realities. An important lesson from these meetings has been how the culture affects the work with clients. Of course, I knew this in theory, but to seethe cultural differences and real- ize that different types of thera- pies might work in one culture but not another was interesting. For example, the Chinese have imported Morita therapy from Japan. This modality seems to be based on an almost contem- plative mode of reflection ori problems. In the Eastern mental- ity this modality seems effective, but it would be very foreign to our Western mentality.\" It wasn't all work and no play for the delegates. The program also allowed for some free time, and the delegates. eagerly put on their tourist caps and took in the sites. The group visited the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, Shanghai Art Museum and several neigh- borhoods. They also enjoyed the Beijing Opera, the Shanghai Acrobat Show, tours of Cloison- n6, carpet-weaving and jewelry factories, and a diverse range of meals at local restaurants. \"The walk on the Great Wall felt like a sacred time of wonder about the culture that had pro- duced such a marvel;\" Merkel said. \"Getting tb talk to people in their own homes, observing how people live and hearing our guides share personal things about themselves were as won- derful as the professional meet- ings. Cross-cultural experiences and relationships -not only inform us about our differences, but also about our shared human values, wisdom and vision. I think it's an excellent way to discover the process of becom- ing culturally sensitive.\"lChina delegation participants tour a Buddhist temple during some free time on their trip.

ACA believed it was important to sup- port the language access in health care principles because individuals with lim- ited English proficiency are especially vulnerable, particularly in a field such as mental health where communication is so vital to recovery. \"The list of organi- zations supporting this document is quite impressive,\" said ACA Executive Director Richard Yep, \"and ACA being part of this demonstrates our continued objective to work with groups on issues of common concern.\" The principles are as follows: 1. Effective communication between health care providers and patients is essential to facilitating access to care, reducing health disparities and med- ical errors, and assuring a patient's ability to adhere to treatment plans. 2. Competent health care language ser- vices are essential elements of an effective public health and health care delivery system in a pluralistic society. 3. The responsibility to fund language services for LEP individuals in health care settings is a societal one that -cannot fairly be visited upon any one segment of the public health or health care community. 4. Federal, state and local governmentsand health care insurers should estab- lish and fund mechanisms through which appropriate language services are available where and when they are needed. 5. Because it is important for providing all patients the environment most conducive to positive health out- comes, linguistic diversity in the health care workforce should be encouraged, especially for individu- als in direct patient contact positions. 6. All members of the health care com- munity should continue to educate their staff and constituents about LEP issues and help them identify re- sources to improve access to quality care for LEP patients. 7. Access to English as a second lan- guage instruction is an additional mechanism for eliminating the lan- guage barriers that impede access to health care and should be made avail- able on a timely basis to meet the needs of LEP individuals, including LEP health care workers. 8. Quality 'improvement processes should assess the adequacy of language services provided when evaluating the care of LEP patients,particularly with respect to outcome disparities and medical errors. 9. Mechanisms should be developed to establish the competency of those providing language services, includ- ing interpreters, translators and bilin- gual staff/clinicians. 10. Continued efforts to improve primary language data collection are essential to enhance both services for, and research identifying the needs of, the LEP population.11.Language services in health care set- tings must be available as a matter of course, and all stakeholders - including government agencies that fund, administer or oversee health care programs -must be account- able for providing or facilitating the provision of those services. 0 For more information on the Language Access in Health Care Statement of Prin- ciples, visit www.counseling.org/public.

There was also plenty of time to socialize at the annual banquet (top). 26The European Branch of the American Counseling Associa- tion held its annual conference Oct. 28-31 in Sonthofen, Ger- many, at the foot of the Bavarian Mountains. The conference was a huge success, attracting 123 attendees from nine countries, as well as 33 presenters and 17 students. The conference fo- cused on two themes -\"Coun- seling: A Creative Force in the Fabric of Life\" and \"The Profes- sional Counselor: Integrating Practice and Science With Client Advocacy.\" ACA Executive Director Richard Yep not only delivered the keynote address at the annu- al banquet, but also provided EB-ACA conference attendees with a mini-session. His keynote address paid special attention to the ability of EB-ACA to ad- dress a wide array of challenges that its clients face, including living overseas, the return of military personnel to their fami- lies after serving in Iraq or Afghanistan, and Post-Traumat- ic Stress Disorder. The annual conference fea- tured 42 mini-sessions and three Learning. Institutes, giving attendees a multitude of oppor- tunities to learn about a variety of counseling services. The two- hour mini-sessions covered top- ics such as combat stress issues, services for clients coping withchronic pain, imagery and fanta- sy, mediation and parenting coordination, domestic vio- lence, ethics, filial therapy, health psychology, HIV ;oun- seling, cross-cultural counsel- ing, blended families, school counseling, sexuality counsel- ing, labeling, technology, teen pregnancy, the impostor phe- nomenon, mentoring in schools, the scripto-visual trauma geno- gram, trauma and substance abuse, and wellness in counsel- ing. The 15-hour, two-day Learn- ing Institutes also were a strong draw for attendees. The three Learning Institutes focused on trauma and substance abuse issues, biracial identity develop- ment and couples counseling. The EB-ACA also offered a bookstore and sponsored the University of Maryland, in con- junction with Bowie State Uni- versity, to offer a poster session highlighting the work of coun- seling graduate 'students with their practicum and internship sites. In addition, Tom Bruce displayed information about Castle Craig in Scotland, an in- house treatment facility for a variety of addictions, including substance abuse and eating dis- orders. The EB-ACA is also planning three Learning Institutes in 2005. The first will be held Feb. 26-27 in Speyer, Germany.Offered by Brian Dew and Kris Vargas, it will address \"Counsel- ing With Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered Clients?' Speyer also will play host to a second Learning Institute April 23-24. Mike Robinson, Sandra Robinson and Shannon Ray will discuss \"Promoting Best Prac- tices in Character Education: Alliance to Action.\" Be sure to attend this Learning Institute if you want to update skills related to school counseling. Finally, on Sept. 17-18, Valerie Schwiebert and Judy Revere will offer a Learning Institute in Heidelberg, Germany, on \"Midlife: An Opportunity for Development of Self and Spirituality Through Re-Evaluation, Transformation, Integration and Empowerment.\" It will feature, information on using innovative expressive arts therapies and traditional andalternative theoretical interven- tions. Check out the EB-ACA website at www.online-infos. de/eb-acahinain.htm for more information. Don't forget about the 46th annual fall EB-ACA conference, to be held Nov. 3-6, 2005, in Mannheim, Germany. The theme will be \"The Professional Coun- selor: Promoting Wellness Throughout the Life Span.\" The Steigenberg Mannheimer Hof Hotel is within walking distance of the art museum and the main pedestrian shopping zone. It is five minutes from the main train stations, which have direct con- nections to/from Frankfurt Inter- national Airport. More informa- tion at the hotel's website: www.mannheimsteigen bergerde.

Ca 28 ACA Foundation Message -BY CLEMMIE SOLOMON Supporting the profession through our many gifts In this season of reflection and appreciation, what special thanksgivings come to your mind? A supportive family, good health, the beauty outside your window? As for me, and I sus- pect for most in the counseling profession, I give thanks also for the opportunity to make a differ- ence in the lives of others. Whether we teach upcoming professionals, counsel in schools, run a private practice or use our skills in administration, we are about working with others to effect positive change. And I give thanks for that special gift. This year the American Coun- seling Association Foundationhas elected to support those working to effect change in our nation's elementary schools through our \"Growing Happy and Confident Kids\" special ini- tiative. Using the love and pro- motion of reading among ele- mentary school children, the GHCK initiative uses outstand- ing works of children's litera- ture as the launching point for individual and group interac- tions that will help children become more aware, expressive and confident -qualities the ACA Foundation believes will add to their potential to succeed in school and society. I encourage you to read moreabout the GHCK project at www.counseling.org/foundation. You will find the application for participation at the website. While any interested elementary school counselor who meets the criteria outlined on the website may apply, the ACA Foundation will give preference to profes- sional counselors who are mem- bers of ACA and whose elemen- tary schools serve populations disadvantaged in some measur- able way. Applications will be accepted through Dec. 31, and participants for 2005 will be an- nounced in January. In addition to advancing the well-being of our nation's young people through the GHCK project, the ACA Foun- dation continues to support the gifts of counselors by investing in the next generation of coun- selors through scholarships, support and encouragement; ad- dressing the effects of terror, trauma and other concerns through publications and con- ferences; and encouraging out- standing counselors with covet- ed awards such as the Gilbert and Kathleen Wrenn Award fora Humanitarian and Caring Per- son and the Brooks Distin- guished Mentor Award. As always, the ability of the ACA Foundation to accomplish its ambitious and important goals is dependent on another sense of the word \"gift\" I give thanks for the generous support you have provided in the past- gifts to help the Foundation offer 30 scholarships to the ACA Convention to deserving graduate students, gifts to ensure the financial stability of the Wrenn and Brooks awards, gifts to permit the publishing of essential tools such as Empow- ering Young Black Males -III: A Systematic Modular Training Program for Black Male Chil- dren & Adolescents and the sec- ond edition of Terrorism, Trau- ma and Tragedies: A Coun- selor's Guide to Preparing and Responding. But we can do more, and your gifts -this time in a financial sense -are essential to the suc- cess of the ACA Foundation. Graduate students await our encouragement, cutting-edge materials await publication,awards await underwriting and (perhaps most exciting to me this year) deserving elementary school children await participa- tion in the Growing Happy and Confident Kids special initiative. Please, be generous as you consider your year-end philan- thropy. You may give online securely at www.counseling.org/ foundation, mail your gift to the ACA Foundation at 5999 Stevenson Ave., Alexandria, VA 22304 or call with your gift information at 800.347.6647 ext. 350. I encourage you to select the way of giving that is right for you and give a gift of financial support during this season of reflection and appreciation. It will be a gift that you can share with pride and confidence, just like the gift you share with your students and clients every day of the year. U Clenimie Solomon is chair of the ACA Foundation and vice president for student affairs at the University of the District of qolumbia. 29Distance Counseling Credential and Training Bringing Counseling Practice into the 21t Century Distance Counseling is now recognized as a valuable tool for use in the field of counseling.

Illegal (for most of us), and unethical (practicing outside an area of competence). Finding Your Way -eoBI Y son Grad school: A beginning or another dead end? One of the happiest days of my life was when I receiv& the let- ter stating that I had been accept- ed into a graduate program in counseling. I was 47 years old, and my husband was divorcing me. Not only was my esteem suf- fering, but fear of the future was disturbing my daily life. I have two children, and at the time, they were 10 and 8 years old. The letter in hand seemed like a reprieve from a nondescript life, one defined by days of working at a Safeway or a car dealership. I had been married for almost 18 years when the security of my life shattered. I applied for grad- uate school just prior to my hus- band leaving home. I thought a new career might jump-start a stale marriage. I figured that even if our relationship did not sur- vive, counseling would be a good career choice. I certainly was a consumer of counseling services at that time. The variety of job options available to counselors seemed endless. I spent three years in graduate school. My divorce was final during the second year. My kids trailed along when I had night classes, and I often stayed up until early morning hours to fin- ish papers. This career choice ofmine was too important to let a matter of \"not enough time\" ruin my dreams. I no longer felt the slow, cold fear of panic down my spine when I thought of years to come, when maybe the support payments would no longer be arriving in the mail. I was invest- ing in a career. It never occurred to me that I wouldn't get a job. I now had in hand a master's degree from a fine college. I was motivated more than ever to start earning a living, building a career. I de- served a job. I had paid the price in time and effort, not to mention the price tag that accompanies a graduate degree. Somewhere, deep down, I held the belief that hard work pays off in direct pro- portion to the amount of effort expended. While the interviews went well, I began to see myself as prospective employers saw me: a person with insufficient experi- ence; older; living too far away to be useful for on-call or crisis. I felt my dream of a career in the counseling field slowly slipping away along with my plans for self-sufficiency. The two were melded together in my mind: career and self-sufficiency. Here I was feeling dependent onsomeone else's decision to give me a job. That feeling of help- lessness brought up old feelings of anger. A sense of helplessness had been prevalent at the onset of the divorce a few years before. I had worked hard to rise above the fear and despair that divorce generates. Helplessness was not an unfamiliar feeling, in other words. But I thought I had seen the last of it when I graduated with a marketable degree. Once again, I was wrong. All the wrong choices and decisions throughout my life were massing together. At that moment my whole life felt \"wrong?' I began to look at my degree with sad- ness, thinking I had miscalculat- ed somewhere, sdmehow. It was just assumed that all graduates would seek out the job of their choice, and the decision-making process meant you chose careful- ly. But that would imply that one had choices. I resented my high hopes. I also thought of the pro- fessors who somehow had pre- sented a skewed version of reali- ty. I didn't resent them, but I did question whether the curriculum ought to include a piece on options other than working for established agencies. I felt silly for thinking it would be just a matter of applying to the jobs of my choice. I felt my opti- mism leaving me, like a visiting spirit that had decided to move on. I looked out my window, out over the trees for a peek at theocean. What was I going to do? My kids depended on me to be there in all ways, and this dismal spirit of mine surely wasn't \"pre- sent\" to them. How could I tell them that even I, a grown-up, felt cheated, given the short end of the stick, without sounding like a whiner? How could I share my fears with them, including my financial concerns for the future? How could I tell them that Mommy's high hopes weren't materializing despite the three years of hard work I (and they) had performed to get my degree? Realistically, what was I going to do with the rest of my life if no one wanted to hire me? My whole future had been wrapped -up in the idea that a counseling position would offer not only financial stability but also perhaps health insurance and a retirement plan. I had wanted to get my state license and had lined up a supervisor to that end, but with no clients, that wouldn't happen either. The beach house I had moved into (part of the divorce settlement) had an office space above the garage. I moved the computer up there and often retreated there at the end of the day in the appear- ance of checking e-mail. I basi- cally liked the quiet of the space. The space was the previous homeowner's office. You ap- proach it via a front staircase from the outside. It comprised two rooms and a stairwell downthe back to a bathroom. During my moments of sitting in the of- fice room, the one with my com- puter, I daydreamed. This was my way of dealing with the stress of not succeeding and of not hav- ing abundant resources to draw upon. My friends were confident in me, despite what the reality was showing. Instead of being helpful, their words of encour- agement actually hurt, since somehow I couldn't live up to their expectations. The financial situation I faced as a single mom meant that I absolutely needed employment. At some point, a job would not be simply optional or desirable. I would not have the luxury of wishing and hoping. All that soul-searching paid off. I looked around and realized I had the space for a counseling office. I felt a spark of hope. Could this work? Maybe. I knew there was more to an office than hanging out a shingle, but how much more? The calls didn't flood in. Ireal- ized that in a small town, I could not sustain myself financially on the occasional client. Once again, I felt foolish. I felt like I was play-acting, like I had set up house and was all set to play counselor. Who was I kidding? I still perused the want ads for counseling jobs. I didn't bother answering them though, finding logical reasons why I would not Continued on page 32 Professional liability insurance Know what you're getting BY PAUL L. NELSON FOR COUNSELING TODAY \"Claims-made\" or \"occur- rence\" policy -which type of professional liability policy best suits a counselor'i needs? Be- fore agreeing to any type of pro- fessional liability insurance, it is important for counselors to know the distinctions in these policy types. Medical doctors, psycholo- gists and insurance agents are usually offered insurance on a \"claims-made basis.\" Claims- made policies require both that a claim occurs during the policy period and that it is reported in the same policy period. These policies were established to pro- tect the insurance company inthose instances where claims can be made many years later and to simplify the determina- tion for rating and experience factors. The difficult issues con- cerning exposure to asbestos were a key factor in insurance companies moving to claims- made coverage. A worker exposed to asbestos in 1960, but who didn't realize the onset of symptoms until 1990, would be excluded from making a claim under this type of insurance. Some claims-made policies can be issued with a retroactive date. If you have a retroactive date, you can be protected back to this date. If you wish to change from a claims-made to an occurrence policy, you will have to purchase additional pro-tection through a policy known as a \"tail.\" A tail policy is usual- ly rather costly but very neces- sary when converting to occur-, rence. If you simply drop a claims-made policy, you are left without protection against claims presented in the future. As a rule claims-made policies are less expensive, but some of them have steep increases through the first four or five years, until a rate is achieved that is comparable to an occurrence policy. At that point, the insur- ance company may convert the policy to the occurrence type. Occurrence policies cover incidents that occurred during the policy period but can be reported at any time in the future, For example, say a coun-selor with an occurrence-based policy worked with a child who manifests difficulty later in his life. The client may try to make a claim saying the counselor misdirected him and caused emotional or economic damage. The occurrence policy that was in effect during those early counseling sessions would pro- tect the counselor who saw the client in '1990 even though a claim was not made until 2004. American Counseling Associ- ation members have the pre- ferred type of insurance avail- able to them through the spon- sored program. ACA Insurance Trust recommends starting with an occurrence policy and stay- ing with this type of insurance. For information, go to www.hpso.con, or call 800.347.6647 ext. 284.

Your Way Continued from page 30 be hired -too far away, not the type of job I wanted, hours wouldn't work. Excuses. I felt shame. I wasn't succeed- ing, and I wondered if my class- mates were. I often bumped into them at conferences. Many had been hired at their internship sites. I consoled myself with the thought that I, too, probably would have been hired where I interned if I hadn't moved. I en- vied the ease and comfort with which my classmates spoke of their jobs. I stuttered and stam- mered and talked about \"my of- fice:\" Oh, private practice? Some thought that was so brave of me. Others expressed their own wish- ful thoughts of starting private practices. I didn't tell them I only went into private practice be- cause I seemed unhirable. Private practice by default.But I was focused on the track I found myself on -the private practice track. Eventually the desperate feelings diminished. They were there but less painful. Private practice. I liked the sound of it. It sounded very indepen- dent. I reflected on the words my peers had used: \"brave\" and \"lucky.\" Often I didn't feel either of those things. In fact, I usually felt quite the opposite. I had fears of failing once again, and this time with no excuses, no one to blame but myself. Today, my private practice is growing. My confidence is build- ing. I'm busy, between the vol- unteet time at the agency and the clients I see in my office. It also feels good to see the monthly balance edge upward, knowing that to some extent this is a busi- ness I generated out of sheer willand determination (and despera- tion). It is not self-suppoting yet and may never be. But at the moment, I am in the position of getting what I need to feel good about myself again: supervised client hours and, more impor- tantly, clients. I mistook having ajob with my identity as a counselor. When I found I could function as a coun- selor -both in my practice and in the agency -it teaffirmed my belief in myself. Before that, with no clients and no paid posi- tion as counselor, I think I lost part of my vision. It's hard to see oneself as a counselor if no one partakes of the services you offer. A counselor without clients is like one hand clapping. I still have days when I worry that I may never have another client. At times when I'm frus-trated I decide that maybe coun- seling just isn't for me, and it takes only a mental minute to turn my home office into a home entertainment room for the kids. But all in all, I think the frustra- tions I faced meant that I needed to solve the problems. If I had to backtrack and do some things over, my wish would be more honesty on my part. I allowed myself to feel humbled and yes, shamed, that I couldn't get hired. I convinced myself that everyone else Was being hired. Failure isn't talked about often in tins society. I felt like a failure. I covered it up, even among my peers. I like to think that my story ends well. I think there is a way of looking at the last two years and connecting the dots to arrive at the place I find myself today. I now realize that success means doing whatone wants to do, what one has been schooled to do, and for me that means having the privilege of counseling.

Miller and Janet C'de Baca, 2001, New York, N.Y: The Guilford Press, 212 pages, $15.95 (paperback), ISBN I- 57230-505-3. This book's theme focuses on a funda- mentally important concept in the counsel- ing profession -the concept of change. Traditionally, the counseling profession has viewed change as something akin to the movement of glaciers. Consistent with more postmodern approaches to change, William Miller and Janet C'de Baca focus on what they identify as \"quantum change\" -predominately an inner, rapid transformation that has enduring qualities. Quantum change is not a household term. Yet evidenice 6f its existence abounds. For example, the authors point to the transformation of Ebenezer Scrooge in Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. Led by his dreamed ghosts, Scrooge' experi- ences a -quantum change that transforms his personality, his life and the lives of oth- ers. Drawing from interviews of people who have experienced quantum change, the authors provide many real-life exam- ples. The authors discuss change from this broader context, which extends beyond the traditional view that change occurs slowly, in a systematic process. They also explore the idea of unpredictability, drawn from quantum mechanics, without requiring that readers possess an understanding of physics or mathematical theories. Quan- tum change is a sudden burst or shift that dramatically alters one's pefspectives and life. The authors note that \"quantum change is a vivid, surprising, benevolent and enduring personal transformation.\" .Miller and C'de Baca lay a foundation for how sudden bursts of change occur throughout the lives of people from all walks of life:. For example, a woman with lupus described her quantum change this way: \"I knew that day with absolute cer- tainty that things were going to be differ- ent. It just felt different from all the half- hearted resolutions I had ever made in my life. The biggest change was taking con- trol, believing that I knew more about myself and my body than anybody else, and now two years later, I'm feeling the best that I have felt in at least 10 years?' .The book's real usefulness lies not in the principle of quantum change, but in show- ing how individuals tap into and haniess the power of quantum change through making personal meaning of insights, epiphanies and reflections. The book showcases personal accounts of quantum change as described by interviewees and traces the stories of what happened before and after a quantum change event in indi- viduals' lives. In the chapter entitled \"Before,' these moments are variously described as hitting bottom, having a trau- hatic experience in childhood, feeling trapped in some sense, wandering aimless- ly in life, coinecting to a higher power ii religion and through prayer, and even experiencing extreme peace and.joy. In thechapter entitled \"Aft&r,\" these moments are marked by a swing in emotional states, changing or establishing priorities in life, altering behaviors, feeling the effect bf change on relationships, noting the devel- opment or strengthening of spirituality and moving toward self-actualizatiod. Counselors may fihd it useful to connect to and share the healing qualities of the book and its stories of hope. Quantum Changes also seems fitting for counselors who may find a renewed sense of hope stemming from the power of accepting the meaning that clients give to their stories of quantum change.

Staying in Control: Anger Management Skills for Parents of Young Adolescents By Millicent H. Kellner, 2003, Champaign, Ill.: Research Press,. 75 pages, $75.95, ISBN 0-87822-497-17. A number of parenting books address ways- parents can manage the anger 6f their' children. Books abound offering parents strategies forimanaging the explb- sive child or the out of control adolescent. Relatively few books address the topic of how parents of adolescents can control their own anger. Millicent Kellner's book (actually a self-help workbook) takes a different pathway to-foster anger manage- ment skills in adAlescents. She targets the anger management skills of parents. Kellner's reasoning for this approach is based on the following observation: \"The way ... we as paients and caregivers behave when e are angry -especially toward our loved ones -sends a strong message to our children about how we expect them to behave.\" t The first two chapters present the pro- gram's rnajor principles, the anger log and joumal, and practice exercises. Accompanying each principle are hints, insights and caveats for readers to remember when eaangn their adoles- cent in the anger management process. Each firster concludes with scenarios,an anger management checklist, an anger log and a review of main points covered' in the chapter. In Chapters 3 and 4, Kellner instructs parents on using an anger log to under- stand their anger and the anger of their adolescent. The-log is used to identify and record anger triggers, locating when and where feelings of anger emerge. Kellner briefs parents on typical interpersonal dynamics that often influence the degree of anger. She also assists parents in identi- fying when and how to interpret or avoid interpreting an adolescent's motives. Kellner introduces parents to self-talk and positive self-statements in Chapter 5. The use of these statements is then record-' ed on a form, \"My Self-State- ments.\" The anger log monitors the implementa- tion of physiological tools, thinking tools and behav- ioral tools. In Chapter 6, Kell- ner moves on to self-evalua- tion. She helps parents to model acceptance of criticism as well as the gentle delivery of criticism to others. The anger log includes a self-evaluation/self-monitoring scale to track how parents and adolescents handle any given anger situation. The pro- gram's final tool, the anger management plan, is presented with hints to guide par- ents in developing and executing the plan. In Chapter 8, Kellner touches on how drugs and alcohol indermine the pro- . gram's basic aim to get in touch with and stay in control of one's feelings. She sflg- gests no interventions here but includes a few referral resources for parents or ado- lescents in need of further help. The final chapter provides a short review of the program's principals. It also includes sug- gestions for seeking outside help from friends and relatives, as well as ideas for starting a support group and using Stay- ing in Control to focus group discussion. This simple guide could be an excel- lent resource for school or family coun- selors working with self-motivated par- ents. The program is well suited to address an adolescent's out of control anger behavior, especially when parents are part of the problem.

In it, Lapan attempts to bring career counseling theo- ry together with practice for a wide audi- ence. The primary strength of this publi- cation lies in the literature review and Lapan's ability to weave together theoret- ical, political and historical elements related to career counseling. Lapan addresses cultural contexts and their ramifications for career counseling. He primarily focuses on how career devel- opment intersects with socioeconomic status and gender. When race is consid- ered, Lapan provides examples drawn from African-American cultural contexts. Examples that highlight the racial and eth- nic complexity of the United States would be helpful for those serving immigrant, Asian-American, Native American and Hispanic-American populations. Case examples illuminate ways to put theory into practice. Most of Lapan's case exanples involved high school upper- classmen; there were relatively few vignettes involving college students and only one involving an older/returning stu- dent within the postsecondary environ- ,ment. Lapan mentions individuals with disabilities several times, but only in passing'and with a very narrow foctis on that literature. No cases or applied infor- mation at the K-5 levels were noted. Chapter 9 is notable for the way that Lapan combines practice with theory. When he devotes more time to a specific practice (e.g., interest assessment in Chapter 5), Lapan usually spotlights one instrument. A few case scenarios were presented in the various chapters; a more liberal use of case scenarios would likely appeal to a broader audience. These were most effective when the connection between theory, practice and the case sce- nario was tightly drawn. The book works best when it promotes, an understanding of how the theoretical, political and historical elements related to career development work togethe. Re- searchers and theorists would likely appreciate the theoretical orientation of this book.

Sure, the recent presiden- tial campaigns and election brought politics to the forefront of our consciousness, but that is surely not the only source of our attention to political matters. We often hear people talk about the \"politics\" going on at their workplaces. Individuals fre- quently speak of the \"politics\" underlying the development and implementation of new policies at the universities where they are employed. We still hear individ- uals deride the \"politically cor- touse when speaking about per- sons who come from diverse groups and backgrounds that have been and continue to be treated unjustly in our contem- porary society. Keeping in mind the numerous ways in which \"politics\" and the \"political\" touch our consciousness and daily lives, it is important to note that the appropriateness of dis- cussing and dealing with various \"political\" issues continues to be a controversial topic in our field. Understanding the terms politics' and 'political' Many .counseloys have a veryparochial way of thinking about the meaning of the terms poli- tics and political. Upon looking up the definition of these words in the dictionary, one will find that these constructs commonly refer to the \"dealings of govern- these defini- tions frequently dominate the thinking that many people in our society generally have about the terms politics and political, they reflect only a par- tial understanding of other, more fundamental meanings. A closer examination of Webster's Dictionary reveals that the word \"politics\" relates to the citizens of a nation and the policies and practices of the nation that one is a part. The multicultural-feminist- social justice movement directs particular attention to the latter definitions of the terms politics and political. In doing so, numerous multicultural-femi- nist-social justice 'counselingadvocates have explained that counseling in general and thd counseling profession in partic- ular are inherently political in the sense that they either help to support and maintain existing societal, g6vernmental, organi- zational and institutional poli- cies and practices, or strive to change policies and practices that affect the day-to-day lives and psychological development of all the citizens in our nation. Contradictory examples of both are found in the American Counseling Association. For instance, our legislative initia- tives have spearheaded efforts that support government fund- ing of Medicaid and expansion of the Elementary and Sec- ondary Education Act. On the other hand, ACA continues to be very active in lobbying sup- port for new legislative actions that advocate for persons in our society who cannot advocate for themselves.It has also been pointed out that a person's politics are not only manifested when an indi- vidual publicly articulates sup- port for a particular candidate or actively works in that candi- date's campaign. Operating from a more expansive and comprehensive definition of the terms \"politics\" and \"being political,\" many multicultural- feminist-social justice advocates emphasize that we are all politi- cal. This is regardless of whether we verbally endorse persons who are running for public office, articulate support for various social justice issues or remain silent in the face of critical issues that we know are adversely affecting the psycho- logical development and per- sonal well-being of millions of persons in our nation and around the world. The violence of our silence Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had much to say about the politics of individuals who remain silent in the face of injustice. As he saw it, much of the military, social, racial and cultural violence and injustice that continue to be per- petuated in our society is made possible when people relinquish their moral responsibility to speak out and actively resist the unfair psycho-social-economic- educational policies and prac- tices that diminish the dignity and development of any human being in our society. King's phi- losophy presents us with the argument' -that maintaining silence in the face of injustice is indeed a political statement that has a resounding impact in our world. The multicultural-feminist- social justice counseling move- ment represents an active and organized force within the men- tal health professions -a force that insists upon the right and responsibility of all counselors to speak out against injustice and the importance of actively working for peace and justice in our society. The importance of doing so is underscored by our knowledge of the many ways in which promoting peace and jus- tice in our society leads to heightened levels of mental health and a greater sense of personal and collective -well- being among millions of per- sons from diverse groups andCC .0E C 0) 0 V *0I- 0) C C, U, C 0 C-, backgrounds. This professional responsibility includes support- ing the right of all persons in the counseling profession in general (and within ACA in particular) to speak out against injustice wherever it is manifested. It means taking a stand to discour- age the silencing of persons in our field who are committed to initiating difficult discussions, even when such discussions are unpopular and cause discomfort in others. Promoting and engaging in difficult discussions The cultural competencies developed by the Association for Multicultural Counseling and Development in 1992 and formally endorsed by ACA in 2003 underscore the importance of engaging in discussions that, although difficult and uncom- fortable for -some, foster a greater understanding and \"knowledge of the sociopolitical influences that impinge upon the life of racial and ethnic minorities\" (multicultural coun- seling competency No. 14). This professional competency also highlights the need for coun- selors to acquire an in-depth understanding of the ways in which these influences are tied to \"immigration issues, poverty, racism, stereotyping and power- lessness as they all leave scars that may influence the counsel- ing process.\" An expanded and inclusive definition of multiculturalism embraces the importance of pro- moting difficult discussions that expand counselors' knowledge of the injustices routinely expe- rienced by women; lesbian, bisexual or transgendered per- sons; the physically challenged; and older persons. It means helping counselors acquire a deeper understanding of the var- ious ways in which these injus- tices adversely affect the mental health and sense of psychologi- cal well-being of the millions of individuals in these groups. All professional organizations and their leaders have the power to promote these discussions within the context of the cultur- ally diverse society in which we live and work. ACA is no differ- ent in this regard. However, as many multicultural, feminist and social justice advocates have stated rigorously in the past, more ACA members needto take an active role in support- ing difficult discussions on these topics. These difficult dis- cussions can increase at our association's annual conven- state confer- ences, and within ACA's profes- sional publications. In fact, such discussions have taken place in greater numbers at our annual conventions during the last sev- eral years. Issues of racism, sex- ism, heterosexism, able-ism and classism have been addressed. New and innovative interven- tion strategies tested and found to be effective in dealing with these complex sociopolitical problems have been presented. This momentum must continue. During the 11 years this col- umn has existed, a broad range of related and controversial issues have been discussed. These have included numerous columns outlining concrete intervention strategies coun- selors are using to effectively promote the dignity and devel- opment of women, poor per-sons, gay and lesbian individu- als, the physically challenged, homeless mothers and their young children, as well as per- sons from African, Asian, Lati- no/Latina and Native American descent, to name a few. As edi- tors of this column, we inten- tionally hoped to promote an increased awareness and sensi- tivity to the sociopolitical chal- lenges we face as professional counselors. We also have actively and explicitly advocat- ed for the elimination of the various forms of racism, sex- ism, heterosexism, ageism, able-ism, classism and other forms of cultural oppression that undermine the health of millions of people in our coun- try. In this vein we have tried to be a voice within ACA that calls for equality for all women, for the rights of gay/lesbian/bisexu- al/transgendered persons, for the need to have a more equi- table distribution of wealth and resources in the United States, for educational equity as well asexcellence, for the right to uni- versal health care, for the elim- ination of war and the promo- tion of world peace, for immi- grants' rights and bilingual edu- cation programs, and for the amelioration of violence in our society, including state-sanc- tioned capital punishment. We suggest that it is indeed our pro- fessional responsibility to open- ly discuss these and other sociopolitical issues without being subjected to disrespect or reprimand from others. Politics is a comprehensive and integral part of life when one embraces an expanded defi- nition of this concept. Let us never shy away from our civic, professional and moral respon- sibility to talk about the various forms of injustice and oppres- sion that continue to be perpetu- ated in our society. These issues are clearly relevant for the work we do as professional coun- selors, and their importance will only increase as the United States continues to undergo acultural-racial transformation in the make-up of its citizenry. For all of these reasons, it is vital that we commit ourselves to promoting difficult discussions regardless of the discomfort they may foster in ourselves or other persons.

The Institutes will take place on Wednesday, April 6, and Thurs- day, April 7, with daytime ses- sions from 9 a.m.-4:30 p.m. and evening sessions from 5:30-8:45. ACA offers the Institutes to enable attendees to earn addi- tional continuing education credit while gaining in-depth' knowledge in a particular area. So that 'attendees can make appropriate selections, each Institute is identified by one of four levels: introductory, inter- mediate, advanced or compre- hensive. The presenter deter- mines the level.\"The Institutes have been extremely popular year after year,\" said Holly Clubb, ACA's manager of Learning Resources, \"because attendees are traveling anyway and can rack up more' training and more CE credit while also attending the major counseling conven- tion in the world.\" Attendees can earn up to 18 hours of additional CE credit by taking one daytime Institute (six hours) and one evening Institute (three hours) on both April 6 and April 7. \"When you add this to the 21 CE credits attendees can earn at the convention only, it means that attendees can earn up to 39- CE credits before they pack their bags to go home!\" Clubb pointed out.Learning Institutes-at the ACA ConventionClubb advises prospective reg- istrants to register early because sessions do fill up and some- times get closed out. Another advantage of early registration is that attendees can pick up their CE certificates while in Atlanta. Those who register after March 31, 2005,'will receive their cer- tificates in the mail. There is a separate registration fee for the pre-convention Learning Institutes. The fee ranges from $70 to $135 for ACA members who register prior to Jan. 15, 2005. Non- member general attendees pay $185 for daytime sessions and $145 for evening sessions. All registration rates, including the general convention registration rate, increase after Jan. 15. Topics for the 2005 Learning Institutes include a mix of ses- sions that routinely draw large audiences, such as William Glasser's \"Mental Health Is Happiness Is Choice Therapy,\" Richard of Clients' session, -\"No School Counselor Behind,\" also has proved to be especially pop- ular in recent years. All session submissions are peer-reviewed (though not a blind review) at two levels. The ACA Program Review Commit- tee, which is composed of repre- sentatives from all ACA divi- sions and regions, conducts the first -review. This committee reviews each session proposal three times and. scores them. The highest scoring submis- sions are then sent to ACA's Blue Ribbon Panel, composed of five ACA members plus the ACA president. The president, Samuel T.

IAA0C unveils several key initiatives Submitted by Kelly M. Burch- Ragan kelly.burch-ragan@wku.edu The International Association of Addictions and Offender Counselors is the premier inter- national organization for pro- fessionals trained at the mas- ter's level and beyond in work- ing effectively with 'persons whose lives are impacted by addictions and offender behav- ior. In keeping with this'role,ACA's mission, the profession- al identify of the counseling profession and its specializa- tions, and appropriate training of addictions and offender counselors, educators, and researchers, IAAOC has launched key initiatives to facil- itate these critical dynamics. One initiative is IAAOC's sponsorship of an interdiscipli- nary task force to review and develop standards of training for the specialization of addic- tions. David Whittinghill of the University of North Florida leads this task force. No doubt, the standards of training topic is a hot issue nationwide. Specialized train- ing programs are quite diverse, ranging from persons with no training beyond being in recov- ery to master's level and spe- cialized internship practice working with individuals, cou- ples and families related to addictions and dual diagnosis. State legislation affects who is deemed a qualified addictions specialist as well. The issues are complex. Nonetheless, ef- fective treatment for this spe- cialized population demands advocacy at all levels,, educa- tion of the populace, interdisci- plinary collaboration and accepted, continually reviewed standards of training. Without such actions, client care is extremely at risk. Another initiative IAAOC is sponsoring is the promotion of research and professional in- volvement among profession- als and graduate students. Sev- eral awards will be presented at the 2005 ACA Convention. These include a graduate stu- dent research grant competi- tion, a graduate student essay competition and a profession- al/regular member research grant competition. Three grad- uate student attendance support grants for the ACA Convention are also available. Additionally, IAAOC will continue the spe- cial categories of recognition initiated at the IAAOC Awards Breakfast.and Ceremony at the 2004 convention. IAAOC is also offering on- site training that is. custom tai- lored for your location. The pri- mary advantages of on-site training are the convenience and customization. As an added bonus, it is often more cost- effective. Information about grants, scholarships, awards and train- ing support is available on.IAAOC's new website. Please visit, the site to learn more about what is happening in your organization and the spec- ifications for this year's awards. As the elected leaders of IAAOC, we work to best serve the organization and its mem- bers' needs. As such, we need member involvement. If you are interested in becoming more involved with the organi- zation, don't hesitate to contact one of your Executive Commit- tee representatives or special committee chairs.

NCDA launches redesigned website Submitted by Melanie Reinersman Melanie..reinersman@ncda.org A 21st-century update was needed on the National Career Development Association web- site (wwwncda.org). Thanks to a collaborative effort, the changes went online Sept. 23, providing website visitors with a more navigable, searchable and visually appealing site. A committee designed the first NCDA website about five years ago. By Internet stan- dards, the site was ancient. Updated information had been added through the years, partic- ularly after the arrival of the website editor and Website Committee in 2002. However, the look, navigation and pur- pose of the website needed a real refresher. At the January 2004 NCDA Board of Directors meeting, a strategic decision was made to \"invest in the website as our mouthpiece, our PR, our voice.\" A committee formed to investigate the heeds, desires and dreams for the website -in terms of technical aspects, con- tent and layout. The committee agreed that the site content was superior and could be left unchanged. However, the lay- out and technical navigation needed help. NCDA solicited miember i.nput on the website redesign by e-mailing a survey in April. Among the findings: N Positive comments about the e-mails received from info@ncda.org confirmed the value of e-m'ail bulletins in reaching out to members. * There was strong praise for Continued on page 70E W0' U 39i2 r) C, a' a0 U 0 C a 39 Information subject to change.

Goals statement Strategic change within ACA is needed to deliver effective and economical ser- vices to its members. In today's world, a good organization is lean, with highly skilled people rather than lots of people going in many directions. We must choose and expand what makes sense today and eliminate ineffective things that are no longer relevant to member needs. Our contemporary needs are for a resilient, quality organization that is inno- vative, member/customer-fodused, flexi- ble and results-oriented. Economies of operation and eliminating redundancy should enable us to keep expenses level and perhaps even reduce dues levels. Modem business tools are needed, such as open database architecture with real- time access for meinbers and divisions to reach members and deliver meaningful services. Timely, accurate member ser- vices need to be the hallmark of ACA. We already have excellent examples within ACA, such as capitalizing on the Internet infrastructure for membership (ASCA); unified dues program (AMHCA dual branch/division 20 percent discount); teleconference outreach (NCDA). Strengthening divisions. The last few years' trend of divisional memberships waning, even while overall ACA mem- bership was growing, must be reversed, or there will.be conti'nued overall losses *of relevancy as other, more focused gfoups usurp traditional ACA roles. Nur- turing leadership development for divi- sions and financial incentives are a few ideas that need examination. Strong professional counseling advoca- cy. While counselors and counselor pdu- cators do a good job for clients, it seems that few of us advocate with vigor for the profession. ACA must be proactive in communicating who we are and what we do in a meaningful, unified miumer; oth- erwise others will -and already are red.efming who we are. .Achieve a seamless flow of information and benefits between ACA' and state branches. Leverage and expand ACA ser-vices to meet member needs by becom- ing an intermediary, linking to organiza- tions with beneficial common services amid resources. Candidate questions Q: One aspect ofACA's mission involves \"using the profession and practice of counseling to promote respect for human dignity and diversit.\" What ideas do. you have about strategies for carrying out this charge? A: Actively seek and provide greater sup- port of groups within/outside ACA that address high-need significant disparities, within our society. NECA and ARCA, with support from ACA, partnered to pro- duce a \"One-Stop Career Systems: Access for Persons with Dis- abilities\" for training and dissemination among professional counselors and the human development and public policy' arena. The sheer size of the population with disabilities and the significant differ- ence in employment rates of people with and without disabilities is the largest dis- parity among working-age populations. The monograph discusses the counselor's role in contributing to increased employ- ment and long-term successful career outcomes for people with disabilities. Practicing principles that create harmo- nious relationships in our ever-changing society is a challenge with changing demographics, global business, downsiz- ing, outsourcing and re-engineering. Pro- moting peace and respect for human dig- nity and diversity is a fundamental iart of our professional development experi- ences. A presentation at the recent NECA professional development workshop con- cluded with Sondra Thiederman's short but powerful video, \"Getting Along: Words of Encouragement,\" about build- ing productive relationships with people who are different from ourselves. Com- passion and interpersonal skills are essen- tial in the workplace and in'our commu- nities for our society to be a harmonious and productive place. Q: What do you perceive as the external challenges to the counseling profession at this time and how can ACA best address those challenges? A- ACA must counter pressures to reduce services from increasing,costs by re-engi- neering the professional counseling asso- ciatiori with sound business practices. While this has been happening almost everywhere in the private sector, public agencies and nonprofit organizations have been reluctant to take the strong leadership necessary to initiate change. In an era of declining membership, which means declining revenues, it is vital to prioritize programs and costs and make sure every dollar in the budget is going for a purpose vital to the effectiveness and growth of the organization and its profession.One of the most important thiigs a pro- fessional organization like ACA can do is to strongly represent the profession in the legislative and public policyarena, where challenges from other organizations and groups are.a constant fact of life. ACA's efforts have been strong to date, but ini- tiatives to partner with organizations with similar needs and interests to strengthen the impact op elected officials and admin- istfatiofi groups is essential, not only to protect existing programs, but also to cre- ate and help design new ones. Q: What do you intend to do to increase the public visibility of professional counseling and market the profession to our external constituents (e.g., members of Congress, our sister professional associations, the public)? A: Be proactive rather than reactive ... rather than wait to be invited to provide a sound bite on CNN, CBS \"Marketwatch,' an article in the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post or New York Times, be an advocate for the counseling profession by providing timely position statements addressing societal issues where counsel- ing can be effective. Be a visible voice in bridging the gap between public- policy and counseling/human development issues (e.g., technological progress, immigration and the growing genera- tional imbalance of fewer young people supporting a growing number of retirees). Take advantage of opportunities to let the public know what we're doing. In Kansas City, Mo., ACA and its divisions all addressed issues that were newswor- thy outside, the ACA arena. Yet NECA was the only professional group that made the business section of the Kansas City Star, through recognition of the Women's Employment Network in Kansas City for its success in assisting wofien in raising self-esteem and achiev- ing economic independence through sus- tained employment. We must address issues in the public- mind, draw attention to our activities and prograis and, finally, make sure the word gets out. One example of these issues that professional counselors could address is demoralization from long-term joblessness.in our society. Q: Explain five principles of leadership that you believe are most.critical to the ACA'presidency. A: ACA leadership efforts must concen- trate on making changes happen success- fully. In my leadership roles, I have emphasized five key elements of making lasting change: 0 Approach: To make a difference and 1asting change, Goethe sums up. my approach: \"Whatever you can do or dream you can do, you can. Boldness has a genius, magic and power to it.\" Information subject to change E Readiness: Timing is everything and especially critical for changes in the way we do things. We must be ready to let go of anything that is no longer working. A comfortable system that has worked well for years may have become a barrier to growth without strong purpose for continuation. a Passion: Energy is needed to keep the fire burning with ACA's initiatives. If we are not willing to spend the energy toward creating what we want, we get to spend the same amount of energy coping with what we get. * Perseverance: Commitment is essen- tial to keep the passion moving. Change is not easy, and long-term change, by def- inition, does not happen immediately. * Support: Few entities can make sig- nificant changes alone. ACA needs sup- portive others as partners in our endeav- ors to bridge the gap between client needs and public policy programs. Marie A.

Goals statement The longevity of ACA, as an invaluable resource for the counseling profession, hinges oi membership involvement, ser- vices provided and the \"how\" of conduct- ing business. The DNA of this organiza- tion is dependent upon quality leadership that works for the organization, interjects life and empowers the effectiveness of members. Within the counseling profession, there are tremendous opportunities to partici- pate in leadership roles. In Nevada, I served as president of the Southern Neva- da School Counseling Association and the Nevada Counseling Association. I am currently assisting with the reorganiza- . tion and licensure campaign. As an involved member of ACA, I have welcomed responsibilities assigned to me as Western Region Chair, Governing Council Representative, Strategic Plan- ning Chair, Finance Committee observer, Executive Committee observer, Nomina- tions and Elections Committee member and program coordinator of the \"First Timers\" Luncheon. I am deeply humbled by this nommation to serve in a capacity that allows me to articulate the values of ACA with very skilled and dedicated pro- fessionals. ACA hag had a rich history due to phe- nomenal leadership and committed mem- bers. Their wisdom and guidance laid the foundation as the fortitude for counsel- ing. With the help of past presidents, the Gov'eming Council, ACA staff and otherinvaluable leaders, I am committed to meeting challenges and promoting strate- gic thinking by: * Cultivating relationships that promote greater inclusiveness and value in divi- sion and branch participation. N Ensuring the innovative means of maintaining high professional standards balanced with financial prudence. E Expanding the technological re- sources that increase collaboration, recognition of current research and the multiplicity of training opportunities. N Responding proactively to the unre- lenting efforts of personnel in the advoca- cy and legislative arenas. Think strategically, instill a mindset of continuous improvement, and reinforce standards of excellence. Just as I use hats metaphorically, leaders must \"walk the talk.\" Hats on for the leadership of ACA. Candidate questions Q: One aspect ofACA's mission involves \"using the profession and practice of counseling to promote respect for human dignity and diversity.\" What ideas do you have about strategies for carrying out this charge? A: As architects of human relations, the blueprint of ACA includes the course of action to advocate for respect of human dignity and diversity. As counseling pro- fessionals, our attitude must be calibrated to the values that defy social injustices. A goal indicative to the profession is to embrace practices that masterfully meet the needs of all groups of people. Change begins with recognizing and understand- ing issues, challenging policies that inhibit success and accessing resources that will mobilize effective action. ACA's mission to use the profession and practice of counseling to promote respect for human dignity and diversity enables a proactive paradigm to build a bridge of acceptance, openness and com- passion. Action steps include N Continuing to update online resources for special populations (including prison inmates and the aging) and ensuring that counselors are skilled to teach clients the art of self-advocacy. N Encouraging regions, divisions and branches to embrace the tenets of the Multicultural Competencies as a preven- tive measure. E Inviting influential legislators of diverse backgrounds to attend an activity during the ACA national convention to establish a dialogue of the profession's challenges, successes and projects and to build the foundation for A strong negotia- tion base. * Leading by example.Q: What do you perceive as the external challenges to the counseling profession at this time and how can ACA best address those challenges? A: The counseling professional has been faced with major dilemmas that plague the existence of employment opportuni- ties, services rendered and the broad spectrum of skills needed to meet diverse mental health issues. External challenges include the loss of connection/interaction with people, as the Internet has become an alternative source for communication and resources; economic trends challeng- ing funding sources, resulting in the elim- ination of counseling programs and posi- tions; the division of practitioners in the counseling profession based on creden- tialing issues; legislative action that may be discriminatory in nature; and the need for more diversity in the ranks of coun- seling professionals. As the staff and leadership work relent- lessly to hallmark the organizations' knowledge and expertise, external chal- lenges require the consistent effort of strategic thinking within a strong internal structure. Strategies include * Promoting a stronger voice of visibil- ity through an active presence on various, boards, published data on the benefits of professional interventions and utilization of effective counseling programs that enable communicatipn. * Increasing dialogue with related counseling professionals resulting in one voice for stronger advocacy and shared knowledge to address the increasing mental health issues. * Expanding incentive ideas that will align the counseling ranks withthe diver- sity in population. Q: What do you intend to do to increase the public visibility of professional counseling and market the profession to our external constituents (e.g., members of Congress, our sister professional associations, the public)? A: Increasing public visibility of profes- sional counseling and marketing the pro- fession to .our external constituents is imperative to ACA's fiscal and human support, organizational credibility, eco- nomic stability/cohesiveness, venues of communication, membership involve- ment/pride, performance levels and the mindset to improve. ACA has a profes- sional obligation to be accountable to the membership and the public it serves, stay alert and current with mental health issues and advocate for change. As a leader in the nucleus of the orga- nization, communication and collabora- tion is key to ACA's visibility and resourcefulness. Much is to be gained through knowledge and understanding of emerging issues faced by generations and special populations, constructive feed- back to direct strategic thinking and I.C 0 N S 0 0 41 Information subject to change greater unity through networking. ACA staff and menibership are applauded for their accomplishments. Other strategies include: * Establishing an annual forum at the national ACA conference for sistef pro- fessional organizations, interested legis- lators and human resource departments to learn of ACA's agenda and concerns needing attention. N Expanding the website for greater util- ity as a knowledge base of general infor- mation about counseling and available resources for the public, including the expertise of the membership as speakers. * Establishing brochures on various topics of interest and disseminate in mar- ketable areas. Q: Explain five principles of leadership that you believe are most critical to the ACA presidency. A: The lifeline, longevity and legacy of ACA are empowered through the pres- ence of leadership principles upheld by each association president. Transforming values into action, visions into realities, obstacles into opportunities and sepa- rateness into cohesive collaborations are challenges along the leadership journey. I subscribe to the following principles that I believe are vital to leadership in ACA: credibility, strategic thinking, rela- tionship building, personal growth and accountability. E Credibility is the foundation of lead- ership. Evidence of commitment, consis- teiit practices and loyalty has a direct cor- relation to membership behavior. M&m- bers must feel proud to talk about the organlzation, align values with the orga- nization and develop a sense of owner- ship, which significantly affects the gray- ity of performance. N Leadership deals with direction that paints a picture for the future. Strategic thinking enables multiple options for charting the vision, reflecting unique characteristics of the organization. * A critical component to the lifeline, longevity and legacy of ACA is a leader's ability to build a strong sense of collec- tive identity and community spirit to acfhieve goals and accomplish the vision. E A leader's personal growth embraces change to create new opportunities. E U Accountability provides invaluable feedback for organizational efficiency m and the measure of progress. 42E.

Goals statement Thank you for taking the time to read and reflect upon each caididate's goals and answers. Your interest in our profes- sion and our organization is essential. The many leaders within ACA are vol- unteers who, at the end of various meet- ings, return to their own counseling work with everyday people in a multiplicity pf settings. I started out doing in-home counseling for older adults, moved to working with college students knd now work as a counselor educator and private practitioner. I became involved with my local counseling association, moved on to my branch, the region, Governing Coun- cil and a division. \"Leadership\" was not something I set out \"to do\" but was some- thing that emerged from my involvement and networking with many professional counselors. Counselors working day to day to facil- itate change are the flesh and blood of ACA. I celebrate the diversity of our members and the varied venues in which they serve many individuals. I have faith in the grass roots of ourprofession across the country and in the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and our European branches. I welcome the evolving technology now available to assist us in our work with clients and to support our communication with one another. I am a voice for the \"everyday counselor\" and would be hon- ored to serve as ACA president. As presi- dent I will: * Work with the Governing Council and Financial Affairs Committee to maintain fiscal stability for ACA and provide a nimble governance structure. N Explore new services desired by the membership in addition to continuing provision of cost-effective traditional ser- vices: journals, insurance, professional development opportunities, etc. N Work with leaders in the divisions and regions to enhance and collaborate ser- vices for members. * Continue efforts being made toward the portability of counseling credentials. Candidate questions Q: One aspect ofACA's mission involves \"using the profession and practice of counseling to promote respect for human dignity and diversity.\" What ideas do you have about strategies for carrying out this charge? A: Carl Rogers proposed the \"Necessary and Sufficient Conditions of Therapeutic Personality Change\" in 1957. In the 1970s, Carkuff added \"respect\" and \"immediacy.\" In recent years, our under- standing of \"culture\" and \"diversity\" has contributed to the development of our multicultural counseling competencies, which are an integral part of our profes- sion. When all is said and done, (ye returnto our roots based in warmth, genuine- ness and being in the moment. Our counseling lives are guided by the ACA Code of Ethics, by a developmental wellness model and by ongoing profes- sional development. We aspire to be who we say we are -this is a process, not unlike the counseling experience. My \"strategies\" to \"carry out the charge\" are to use the venues we have available to us: Counseling Today, regional professional development pro- grams, our Public Policy and Legislation office and tools to raise consciousness, provide educational opportunities and advocate for the welfare of our clients. It is my goal that we strive to be individuals who have integrated the promotion of human dignity into our lifestyle beyond our work as counselors. I believe we operationalize the ACA mission by our example. Then individuals will know we are counselors by our day-to-day lives! Q: What do you perceive as the external challenges to the counseling profession at this time and how can ACA best address those challenges? A: What a quagmire! The economic and financial constraints experienced in recent years by health care agencies and educational institutions -by businesses, by local townships and, ultimately, by individual families -certainly have a taxing domino effect on so much of what we try to do for both our members and the constituencies we serve as counselors. Counselors are being asked to \"do more with less.\" Less staff, less profes- sional development provided by the work site, less financial support to pay for pro- fessional dues, less support of release time for professional development, etc., all demanding that the individual coun- selor find the means within personal bud- gets and time to keep up with the growing demands of client needs. Counselors are often required to do \"more\" with \"less\" time. Counselors juggle these demands with the demands of family and life beyond one's office. ACA can assist our members by con- tinuing to explore venues for profession- al development that utilize today's: tech- nology and the expertise within our ferences, regional programming and col- laboration with local colleges/universi- ties. This collaboration includes working with the leadership of our divisions, regions and branches to do more .(not with less but) with energies that already exist among us. Q: What do you intend to do to increase the public visibility of professional counseling and market the profession to our external constituents (e.g., members of Congress, our sister professional associations, the public)? A: Counselor licensure throughout Information subject to change 25-plus years in almost all of our ACA branches has increased the visibility and credibility of professional counseling. Recently, ACA members have testified during congressional hearings, collabo- rated with our colleagues in \"sister pro- fessional associations\" and worked with individuals here and abroad to facilitate change. They are advocates for our pro- fession! ACA has a strong Public Policy and Legislation office. Their work and resources are magnificent. I will work to promote and highlight the work of our PP&L office. Some ACA branches and regions could benefit from more contact with our PP&L office. Assistance with local initiatives might increase the visibil- ity of professional counselors and pro- mote counselor identity and professional self-esteem of grass-roots counselors. I want to explore ways to increase our presence in the media via public service announcements, \"expert\" interviews on network programs and the formation of a team of \"regional representatives\" avail- able to the media for c6mmeritary. It has also beefn observed that when tragic events occur, seldom has a \"counselor\" been on camera. I am not advocating that we exploit the catastrophe but, rather, see this as an opportunity to contribute and assist individuals beyond the scope of the event. Q: Explain five principles of leadership that you believe are most critical to the ACA presidency. A: A \"situational-transformational\" mind- set (Hersey & Blanchard, Bass, 1985; and Posner & Kouzes, 1987) sug- gests that beyond the demands for good interpersonal skills, problem-solving and management skills, a leader: N Is aware of self- using strengths to facilitate change with the recognition and compensation for limitations, plus has the capability to give bimodal (micro/macro) attention to association concerns. N Envisions afuture with an \"outcome\" orientation and communicates a clear plan of action. There is no surefire path, but a leader draws in others to create new paths toward successful results. E Understands that the history of ACA shapes us but does not dictate our future. We can initiate \"course corrections\" with resilience to take appropriate actions based upon new information. * Develops coalitions to achieve results. By learning what others do best, one can delegate tasks appropriately and chal- lenge others to stretch to reach personal and organizational potentials while pro- viding the necessary support to succeed. * Mentors and engenders a sense of excitement about the significance of ACA's contribution to society. Leadership is not only a matter of the head but also of the heart. When we encourage others, weshare passion and inspire enthusiasm for what we do! Robert K.

Community Service: Human Relations Commission, IRB, international consultant (e.g., China, Northern Ireland), CACREP Team Chair. Goals statement As a counselor and counselor educator, I have a career-long (34 years) commit- ment to prevention, social justice, group and ecological approaches to counseling -as well as to the more traditional approaches. I work within the system as achange agent to help improve current and future practices and to educate others to do so. I can be counted on to collaborate with others to seek common goals out of diverse perspectives while also being clear that my own values are strongly in support of empowerment, reducing oppression and exploitation and strength- ening assets. All my extensive profes- sional writing and leadership experience has been consistent with those values. Along with everyone else, I am very concerned about ACA's continuing via- bility and equally with that of the divi- sions and regions. I understand, as Robert Putnam pointed out in \"Bowling Alone,\" that participation in informal and formal social organizations has precipitously declined since World War II and that there is much competition for our time, effort and money. Against this context, we need to approach membership decline and work together to generate goals and strategies for improving membership in ACA and across affiliated entities. In terms of goals, I have five: E Recognize our strengths and assets, something which we too often forget, even though we are counselors. * Recognize and act from the position that we are all in this together and our dif- ferences can contribute to strengths. * Attend to the context of professional counseling at local, regional, national and international levels. * Expand what I have called the \"Coun- seling Services Paradigm\" of individual, remedial and direct service to comprehen- sively embrace preventive goals that are collaboratively sought through multiple ways and with various, target populations. N Continue advancing our relationships with other helping professions and with our Public Policy and Legislation initiatives. Candidate questions Q: One aspect ofACA's mission involves \"using the profession and practice of counseling to promote respect for human dignity and diversity.\" What ideas do you have about strategies for carrying out this charge? A: Promoting human dignity and diversi- ty is not just an aspect of ACA's mission but rather its core element. All that we do as a professional organization, as a pro- fession and as individual counselors and counselor educators is grounded in and guided by this essential concept. There- fore, promoting human dignity and diver- sity is an ethos that needs to be continual- ly reinforced as counselors and officers of ACA make professional choices and decisions on a daily basis. A mission and a vision are useful only if organizational members consistently discuss them so that they become part of the culture, resulting in actions that are guided by the mission and vision. Effec- tive missions and visions become part ofthe daily dialogue of colleagues. They are referred to naturally within all contexts of professional practice. Governing Council members, division presidents, region chairs, counselor education faculty and individual counselors all are important partners in this ongoing, daily discourse. In addition, it is important that preven- tion programs, training sessions, work- shops and other services that are delivered programmatically be intentionally guided by the promotion of human dignity and diversity. Finally, ACA should develop a public education campaign to promote human dignity and diversity among citi- zens, as well as to influence public policy and legislation, as situations emerge. Q: What do you perceive as the external challenges to the counseling profession at this time and how can ACA best address those challenges? A: ACA exists within a dynamic society and world. The first challenge to be faced is for ACA to adopt a strategy of continu- ous scanning -intentionally looking outward (and inward) -for opportunities and threats. The sec6nd important con- cept is that not all challenges are nega- tive, and they often represent areas for growth and opportunity. With those background comments, the external challenges facing ACA are polit-- ical, economic and perceptual. Percep- tions are always with us -we must develop comprehensive strategies to inform and educate those in other profes- sions, elected officials and the general public about what counseling is and about its value for the real lives of people. Political challenges exist within our work sites and among sister professions. For instance, our \"Healthy Schools and Families\" prevention grant in Cincinnati is always challenged by the fact that there are no elementary counselors in the pub- lic schools here and by negative effects of aspects of the \"No Child Left Behind\" legislation. Sister professions, such as social work and, psychology, also are becoming more involved in schools, gen- erating professional turf issues. At the economic level, ACA is confronting membership issues as well as how to edu- cate and persuade legislators about the value of counseling. Q: What do you intend to do to increase S the public visibility of professional counseling and market the profession to our external constituents (e.g., members of Congress, our sister professional associations, the public)? m A: If elected president, emphasizing pre- vention will be one of my main goals. 12 Within prevention, a major strategy is to raise public awareness through various strategies, including the creative use of mass media, supplemented by action 0 steps. I will promote this strategy, explor- ing how ACA can develop and market a 43 Information subject to change mass media campaign about the value of counseling in peoples' everyday lives. I will support ACA's Public Policy and Legislation efforts to influence passage of mental health parity, oppose discrimina- tion based on sexual orientation, secure our capacity to administer tests, promote third-party coverage for LPCs and other important legislative efforts. I will advo- cate for ACA's continued and expanded involvement in the Alliance of Mental Health Professions, working with our sis- ter professional organizations to advance our joint cause. I will make specific liai- son efforts to connect with sister organi- zations, such as the American Psycholog- ical Association (of which I am a Fellow) and the National Association of Social Workers, to proactively explore coopera- tive measures we can take to promote mental health while being sure that ACA is a key partner. I would sponsor efforts that ACA can take to increase access to counseling and mental health services in underserved communities. Q: Explain five principles of leadership that you believe are most critical to the ACA presidency. A: * Vision: The ACA president must artic- ulate and communicate a vision that is inspiring, involving, pragmatic and in keeping with dominant organizational and professional values. Leadership with- out a large motivating vision is, at best, management. M Style: The ACA president needs to work collaboratively with others. An effective leader motivates others and knows how to coordinate their efforts. The style needs t6 be transformative as well, combining talents and energies in such a way so as to generate new ideas * and solutions from the mix. M Active engagement: The ACA presi- dent needs to expend continuous and high-level energy in a focused. way: The job is a daunting one, requiring a wide variety of skills demanded adross an array of situations. N Organization: The ACA presidenta ' will be ineffective if great ideas and .o directions cannot be translated into orga-Enized applications. Being able to see the big picture is essential, but then also to * reconfigure it so that action can occur. M Accountability: The ACA president needs to set goals with others that are = aspirational yet feasible. A leader is a per- son who works with others to reach nec- 0 essary and desirable goals. Only mea- sures of accountability can provide the .evidence.Brian S.

Goals statement As president, I would work to increase the efficiency of ACA, using associationresources to better promote the counsel- ing profession and the interests of coun- selors. I would emphasize three major goals: N A renewed partnership with the divi- sions. Counselors are a diverse profes- sional group, and our association should reflect this diversity. Unfortunately, most counselors are not members of ACA. Even more alarmingly, in 2003, ACA lost more than 17 percent of its membership. Clearly,change is needed. One strategy to revitalize ACA would be to create a new partnership with the divisions, one that respects the unique mission of each divi- sion and focuses on mutual interests. I believe healthy divisions are the key to a healthy ACA. E Improved efficiency and membership value. It is important to remind ourselves that counselors do not exist to, support ACA; the association exists to support counselors. As ACA president, I would lead efforts to initiate an external manage- ment audit to review current association operations in order to make ACA a more cost-efficient organization that provides better membership value. The responsibil- ity for improving our association rests with the elected leadership, not the pro- fessional staff of ACA. We have some very competent professionals working for our association, but they only follow the directives of the elected leadership. N Work toward achieving parity with other professional groups. Counselors do not enjoy professional parity with other groups. This inequity extends to third- party reimbursements and participation in many managed care networks. As presi- dent, I would work to increase parity, par- ticularly in the public sector. One effort would be to initiate a dialogue between ACA and the Department of Defense to recognize counseling as an area of special- ization within the armed services. Another would be to lobby state legislatures for inclusion of counselors in managed care networks and state employment. Candidate questions Q: One aspect ofACA's mission involves \"using the profession and practice of counseling to promote respect for human dignity and diversity.\" What ideas do you have about strategies for carrying out this charge? A: The full ACA mission statement reads: \"The mission of the American Counsel- ing Association is to enhance the quality of life in society by promoting the devel- opment of professional counselors, advancing the counseling profession, and using the profession and practice of coun- seling to promote respect for human dig- nity and diversity.\" While we should rightly applaud our successes in promoting respect for human dignity and diversity, more effort needs to be placed into promoting the develop-ment of professional counselors and advancing the counseling profession. Many of us believe that the primary pur- pose of ACA is to serve as an umbrella organization that provides a common voice for all counselors. As ACA presi- dent, I would work to enhance the status of counselors ill society through an increased public awareness of the coun- seling profession. I believe that only through building a stronger professional identity can we hope to be an effective voice and catalyst for positive social change. Q: What do you perceive as the external challenges to the counseling profession at this time and how can ACA best address those challenges? A: Many external factors impede our pro- fession. Obvious ones include market competition with other groups (e.g., social workers), legislation that limits the nature and scope of counseling practice and the evolving tragedy of managed care, which undercompensates or excludes counselors altogether. Our leg- islative lobbying efforts should be increased to address these critical issues. However, I don't believe that the major challenges facing our profession are external -I believe they are internal. In recent years, some within our association have attempted to define counseling as a monolithic profession with a singular identity. In my opinion, such efforts, while perhaps well-intentioned, are wrong-minded. While all counselors share a similar philosophical foundation, increasingly the counseling profession is a heterogeneous mix of often-disparate groups. ACA can play a key role in mov- ing the counseling profession forward by accepting the reality that all counselors are not alike and engaging our diverse member groups in a dialogue based on areas of common interests and need. One size does not fit all, and ACA can best serve our professionalinterest by serving as a true umbrella organization and com- mon voice for all counselors. Q: What do you intend to do to increase the public visibility -of professional coumnseling and market the professioh to our external constituents (e.g., members of Congress, our sister professional associations, the public)? A: I would propose a major public rela- tions initiative to spotlight the counseling profession. This effort would target the consumer public, as well as state and fed- eral officials, and educate the public about counselors and the work they do. Such an initiative would be closely coor- dinated with organizations in each state. The focus of this initiative would be to educate the public about the different types of counselors (e.g., school coun- selors, mental health counselors, mar- riage and family counselors) and the var- Information subject to change ious professional roles counselors play in meeting the needs of society. While such a PR. effort would undoubtedly benefit individual counselors and expand, em- ployment opportunities, it would not be an entirely self-serving endeavor. As pro- fessionals, we have a responsibility to make the public aware of the availability of services counselors have to offer. Q: Explain five principles of leadership that you believe are most critical to the ACA presidency. A: * Collaboration -a penchant to listen to others, an ability to articulate key issues in a clear and concise manner and the. patience to engage disparate constituen- cies to work toward common goals. E Positive public presence -someone who will present a positive public image on behalf of the association. An ability to effectively convey ideas to individuals and groups both within and outside the association. * Organizational ability -the experi- ence and skill to organize and efficiently conduct business. A willingness to appropriately delegate authority to pro- fessionai staff and hold them accountable for the results. N Analytical skill -the ability to gath- er information, weigh all perspectives, critically analyze data and the courage to act decisively in the best interests of the association. E Motivation -maintain a positive environment that invites members to invest their time and energy on behalf of the association. Strive to make involve- ment in all ACA activities a personally and professionally positive experience. This is essential when working with peo- ple who volunteer their time.

I am proud to serve in leadership and offer a sincere thank you to those who have walked this path before me and continue to guide the way. As president-elect, I will find common ground among mem- bers and assist in unifying our forces as we address the growing number of issues facing our profession and division. I am committed to the following goals: * Membership: An organization's strength depends on its members. I will promote outreach efforts to attract new members to the AADA family. To ensure members receive the highest level of ser- vice, I will create additional benefits for members. * Collaboration: Working with regions and state divisions, I will ensure relevant issues to adult development are ad- dressed. I will continue to work with other divisions on projects providing AADA opportunities to advocate for the profession and promote awareness of the issues facing adults during all stages of their development. E Mentorship: This division has always provided a family atmosphere whereby new members are nurtured and cherished. The wisdom and experience of longtime members are invaluable. Thus, I will devel- op a formal system within the division to mentor newer members, providing oppor- tunities for involvement, to all members, continuing and strengthening the tradition. E Certflication: I will continue the work to re-establish certification for counselors who work with older adults. This will increase awareness of the work coun- selors are doing with these individuals. As the older adult segment of the population grows, it becomes of paramount impor- tance that counselors are trained to under- stand the unique needs of this population. * Training: Building upon the efforts of those who have dedicated time and ener- gy to AADA, I will create training oppor- tunities for members through workshops, video training and website downloads.

Goals statement Today's leader must possess a combi- nation of skills that may not have been a part of one's formal training but that are developed during one's career. Under- standings of the issues that are unique to the field are mandatory, but so are the knowledge and resolve to accomplish what must be done. AADA is the division that is primed to address the topics that haven't even been identified relative to. the aging of America. AADA is the divi- sion that is uniquely situated to provide support and information for counselors, their clients, counselor educators and their students about retirement, health care, parenting, grandparenting, etc. Medicare reimbursement for counselor services continues to be an important platform that must be adopted by Con- gress. Recognition of counselors with a national credential in gerontological counseling is also essential. My experi- ence as a counselor, counselor educator and association leader qualify me to assume the position of president-elect and work for the good of the organization to accomplish the goals that have been set out by AADA's leadership.AADA Treasurer Richard Balkin Title and Full Business Address: Assistant Professor, Department of Coun- seling, Texas A&M University-Com- Ph.D., counselor M.Ed., counseling psychology, University of Missouri-Columbia; B.S.Ed., secondary education, University of Missouri-Columbia.

Community Service: Strategic Planning Committee chair, City of Salem Senior Center; trainer for State of Oregon pre-licensure education pro- gram for adult foster home providers, Goals statement I have served in leadership positions and have been an active 'member of AADA since its inception as a division of ACA- in 1986. Currently, I have been appointed to serve as AADAs Governing Council Representative for 2004-'05. My other leadership positions have included a three-year term as AADA president-elect, president and past-presi- dent, as well as two terms as division treasurer, service as newsletter editor and as chair of division committees. I was also honored as a recipient of AADA's Distinguished Service Award. In addition to my service with AADA, I have also held leadership positions within other ACA divisions, at the regional level (ACA Western Region chair) and at the state branch level as president of the Ore- gon Counseling Association. I believe my in-depth knowledge of AADA, my current service on the Gov- eming Council and my experience across all levels of the ACA organizational structure provide me with an important combination of organizational knowledge and skills that will allow me to continueto bring AADA's concerns to the forum provided by Governing Council. I am committed to working with my Govern- ing Council colleagues to discuss issues affecting our profession and our associa- tion in a thoughtful, productive manner and to consider the opinions of AADA members when making governance deci- sions that are in the best interests of ACA.

Community Service: Church, school and adult center volun- teer, workshops and classes. Goals statement Besides considering AADA's request to accept their nomination to represent them as a member of the Governing Council an honor and a privilege, I believe that my experience in leadership positions for ACA throughout the years enables me to bring perspective and insight to the role of a Governing Council member. My responsibility will be twofold: (a) to rep-resent the issues and concerns of members and leaders of AADA to colleagues who compose the Governing Council, and (b) to work in a collaborative manner to assist ACA with the development of policies, position statements, etc. that will be in the best interests of both ACA and the profes- sion of counseling. In addition, there are a myriad of topics related to addlt development across the lifespan that I may be able to help ACA, and hence the profession, address. For example, even though the demographics of the adult population in the United States are changing, we have a youth cul- ture that denies, and often pathologizes, aging. A healthy model of adult develop- ment promotes wellness for all age groups, recognizes the mentorship and role-modeling contributions that experi- enced adults can provide to today's youth,and embraces the perspective that the life experience of older adults can con- tribute to the divefse culture around us. In addition, better-educating counselors for their roles in assisting adults with grief and loss, change and transition and career decision-making; and intervening -to lower the high rates of depression, suicide and addiction that currently' exist among older adults must be emphasized. Finally, AADA and ACA have much to do to influence public policy and funding for counseling positions in adult centers, independent- and assisted-living facilities and long-term care settings.

Goals statement For as long as I have been a member of APGA, AACD and ACA (more than 25 years), I have heard that we are \"at a crossroads,\" \"coming into our own,\" \"we've almost made it,\" \"one of these days, we're to get day now,\" our glassis too want a place the table,\" \"wejust need to define what coun- seling is or who is a counselor\" \"maybe a new governing structure will help,\" and on and on and on. Good grief! Well, I don't know about you, but I'm already there. I'm a professional coun- selor who works in a higher-education setting. I don't take a backseat to anyone, and I believe with my entire being that neither should you! I'm not waiting for anything. I'm not waiting for anyone. Quite the contrary, I am out in front and leading here in my community, my state and my country. I am not \"just\" a coun- selor! I am a Professional Counselor. My education, training and experience will match up with, and in fact surpass, any of my colleagues. Members of ACCA, we have a great organization and we must continue to \"grow it\"! We can become larger and stronger, and we will with your help. Our publications are the best! Our conference is the best! We can make any program or service we want the best! Join me and the 2,000 members of ACCA as we continue to make our mark in the future. That's where the action is. That's where I will be living and working and serving. How about you? Thank you!

The role of the ACES president is to provide the continu- a ity necessary to link the successes of pre- vious years with the passion and energy g of the current and future membership. ACES members have a rich tradition of serving the association. Colleagues offer countless hours by volunteering their expertise, time and energy at both the regional and national level. Collaborating 50 with individuals and regions, as well aswith other key entities, is critical in hon- oring the voices and perspectives of such a diverse and dynamic group. While vision, consistency and team- work are the ingredients to success, cre- ativity is the spice required for excel- lence. Unleashing the imagination leads to amazing accomplishments with limit- ed resources. Thinking \"outside of the box\" will assist ACES in being recog- nized \"as a vanguard of change within the counseling profession.\" In conclusion, realizing our vision requires continuity, collaboration and cre- ativity. I am proud to be a member of an association that honors these attributes. I welcome the opportunity to serve.

ACA, Branch, Division, and ous refereed journal articles, book chap- ters and monographs. I have been a regu- lar presenter at professional conferences, with more than 125 presentations at state, regional and national conferences. Goals statement I am honored to be a candidate for pres- ident-elect of ACES. As a past ACES sec- retary and SACES president, I appreciate the level of commitment, knowledge and talent that ACES members bring to ensur- ing excellence in counselor education and supervision. I believe ACES also has a responsibility to influence the direction of our profession, the ways in which counseling services are provided and how effectively we govern our associations. As those charged with preparing future generations of counselors, I see two key challenges and opportunities for ACES. The first is to advocate for culturally competent practice in ways that positive- ly affect the profession, our students and supervisees, and the clients whom we serve. The second is to model rising above divisive politics and focus on strengthening collaborative relationships with ACA and other ACA divisions. ACES members need to continue to be leaders in creating a shared sense of com- mitment and ownership that can help unify the counseling profession while valuing and finding ways to truly incor- porate diverse perspectives and ideas. As ACES president-elect, I would con- scientiously work to lead ACES in: * Continuing efforts to increase participa- tion of people from underrepresented groups in ACES membership and leader- ship teams, including strengthening the voice of field-based counseling supervisors. N Exploring ways to increase opportuni- ties for educators and supervisors to dis- seminate information and obtain continu- ing education. * Modeling thoughtful and creative approaches to developing a more effec- tive model of governance for ACA and its divisions. * Critically examining the benefits pro- vided to members. I would consider it a privilege to serve as president-elect for an association that has been so instrumental in my own development. I feel that my varied leader- ship experiences and collaborative style would lend themselves well to facilitating the work of the ACES leadership team. ACES Secretary Tracy C.

Goals statement For AGLBIC to continue to have a crit- ical role in advocating for social equality, its leaders must be able to promote these ideals to its members and the counseling profession at large. I am capable of lead- ing our division because of my familiari- ty with AGLBIC, leadership skills and commitment to the issues facing our community. As a nine-year member of AGLBIC and having served on its Executive Board, I have worked alongside many of its found- ing and current leaders.

As founding president of North Carolina's Association for Gay, Lesbian and Bisex- ual Issues inCounseling, I worked along- side dozens of counselors and students to establish a statewide organization that would advocate for GLBT issues and educate mental health professionals. I am proud to claim my professional identityas a counselor and remain active in vari- ous divisions/affiliates ofACA, including ACES, IAAOC and CSI. My knowledge and professional com- mitment to GLBT issues is exemplified by my work as a counselor educator at Georgia State University and award-win- ning research around such issues as well- ness, self-disclosure, parenting, sexual addiction and internalized homophobia. I have presented numerous presentations at local, state and national. conferences. I have also served as a consultant with leading national organizations, such as PFLAG and GLSEN, to educate and train volunteers.

Goals statement First, I would like to thank those who nominated me for their trust. I am hon- ored to be a candidate for AMCD presi- dent. My professional, career has been committed to multicultural and diversity. issues. I first became a member of AMCD in. 1979 and have supported the mission of -the organization since that time. I have served on the editorial board of Y7 and Adultspan. I serve on the Human Rights Committee for ACA, and I am a past member of the ad hoc com- mittee for fellows status.

In Utah, I served as chair of the Cultur- al Competency Steering Committee for the State Board of Mental Health, as a member of the' Coalition for Minority Advisory Comihittees to the State Office of Education, and on the 2002 Salt Lake Olympic Diversity Committee. With the Supreme Court ruling in sup- port of affirmative' action for college admissions, we enter a new era for diver-sity. Our membership is presented with the opportunity and the responsibility to reach out to institutions and organizations to develop atrue multicultural climate. As president, I would: N Actively recruit from underrepresent- ed as well as mainstream populations for our membership and our leadership. Our organization and its public image need to be accessible for the growing numbers of non-English speaking individuals, practi- tioners, educators and clients. * Promote the visibility of multicultural counseling as an integral part of the pro- fession. We need to continue to 'support integration of the multicultural compe- tencies in training and in the profession. Encourage cutting-edge innovations for providing mental h6alth and school coun- seling services for minority clients by supporting fliew and effective counseling techniques. E Actively collaborate with sister orga- nizations to piomote diversity across the disciplines in order to provide all clients with equal access to appropriate services. Beverly J.

Goals statement It's time for AMCD to spread its wings as the unique entity that it is within the ACA organizational structure. It should serve as the association for issues of mul- ticultural- counseling and development, and 1) as the bridge to \"mainstream\" con- sciousness relative to cultural and ethnic parity and equity, 2) the gatekeeper of \"mainstream\" adherence to fair and equi- table implementation and practice, and 3) the visionary provider of culturally con- scious initiatives and products. This is an oppiortunity that should be neither wasted nor taken for granted. We have made tremendous strides since our inception. Through the tireless efforts of our founder, committed leaders and active members, we have raised consciousness through advocacy, publications, trainings, legislation and public relations. Now, we're uniquely positiofied to enhance and fortify our roles as standard-bearers and enforcers of equity and parity regarding multicultural issues. But, to be effective, we must be pfepared for multiple publics, proactively engaged, politically poised, published in multiple disciplines and pro- lifically positioned throtighout the United States (and abroad). Expanding existing infrastructures such as our mentoring component to \"grow\" exponentially at the preparation level; expediting initia- tives such as our competency certification to infuse awareness, knowledge and skills into multiple disciplines from mental health, pilblic health and beyond; estab- lishing substantive collaborations with unencumbered by insti- tutional entrapments; and seeking fund- ing sources to implement initiatives can produce extensive internal and tangential organizational advances that would tran- scend any onb leader or initiative.0 0 N 0 2 0) C, 00 U 0 0I- 0, C 0 0, C 0C, 52 , Information subject to change I want to take us there. I have the skills, knowledge and desire. I want to give back to this organization that supported me in trying times, and I want to initiate and institutionalize an enhanced infrastruc- ture to produce organizationally focused, system-knowledgeable leaders to ensure representation at \"the table(s)\" in far greater and more equitable numbers than we have currently.

Community Service: .- Volunteer counselor at EdinburgRehabil- itation Hospital, editorial board member of three journals, UTPA community ser- vice lecturer and motivational speaker. Goals statement: It is an honor to be considered for the ARCA presidency at such 'an exciting time in our history. Having served ARCA in various roles during the past eight years and most recently as its treasurer, I am uniquely aware of the challenges and opportunities facing both ARCA and the counseling profession in general. As a rehabilitation educator during the past 12 years, former CRC chair and board member at-large as well as ARCA's representative to CORE, I have been involved at the curriculum and certifica- ion levels in our profession's pursuit of parity recognition with LPCs. In continu- ing collaboration with our fellow associa- tions, one of my primary goals will be to continue to aggressively approach parity issues in curriculum and certification. There is no. doubt that rehabilitation counselors are equally if not more quali- fied to work with persons having mental, emotional, physical or sensory disabili- ties. As such, ARCA must continue to advocate for rehabilitation counselors' full inclusion and practice rights. A second priority is to continue our efforts to increase ARCA's membership and develop additional incentives for marketing to new graduates. Realizing that most current members are practicing counselors, we must offer more to these members in terms of conveying applied. research findings into rehabilitation counseling practice recommendations. This can be accomplished through our journal as well as a return to an annual stand-alone training conference. Continu- 'ing efforts to expand and provide mentor- ing to student chapters is also a priority. Finally, as advocates for persons with disabilities, our association and its mem- bers must remain diligent in resPonding, to legislative alerts by writingleducating our state legislators concerning the rights of persons with disabilities. ARCA has begun to explore a listserv for communi- cating with each other, and this would be an excellent way to alert our membership.Virginia A.

Phoenix, Ariz. Goals statement First and foremost, I wish to fit my goals and efforts into the priorities and goals set by the ASERVIC board. Many capable and talenied individuals have spent a great deal of time and energy in the service of the organization, examin- ing today's issues and needs of the mem- bers of ASERVIC and how the mission of 8 ASERVIC fits into the world of the coun- selor and those of our profession con- cerned with the development of the per- son from career issues to spiritual issues. Second, my practical goal for the asso- a ciation is to see that people hear about the issues and the role that ASERVIC can 2 and does play in addressing the issues. gHopefully, in spreading that good news, 5 we will be able to attract more members 2 to be a part of the ASERVIC tradition and to make a difference in the lives of the people we serve. 54 Finally, I would like to engage in whatMarty Marty refers to as \"The Conversa- tion,\" not the argument or debate in which there are often winners and losers but, rather, the conversation about the role of religion, spirituality and ethics in the world of our schools, colleges and mental health institutions that is long overdue. We must ask supporters and detractors alike what kind of world do we wish to live in and how we are to set about on a course for that world. The principles of ethical and natural cating shared by so many of our religious and spiritual traditions can act as our guide for the conversation.

Goals statement We stand on the shoulders of those who came before us! ASGW leaders and many active members have been working hard on developing a clear strategic plan and implementing systematic action steps to promote professional development, membership services and group work. This is an exciting time to be part of ASGW, and I'm honored to be a candi- date-for president-elect. Ten years ag6, as a new member attend- ing an ASGW c6nference in Athens, Ga., the warmth of the ASGW community quickly enveloped me. Since then, I have been involved in the writing of the Diver- sity Competencies, serving as co-chair of the Diversity Committee and Intemation- al Committee, and for the last twb years (and upcoming year), co-process observ- er for ACA Governing Council. My early upbringings in the Middle East and India, and pursuit of higher edu- cation in India and the United States, have allowed me the opportunity to be im-mersed in a variety of cultural contexts. I believe in a collaborative, consensus- building and open style of leading. I am a good listener, strive to work through chal- lenges by being part of the solution and make every effort to empower and bring people together. I will draw on my leader- ship experiences on boards, committees and university and community work. As president, I will continue to imple- ment the initiatives already launched, such as the Advanced Group Leadership Institute, development of training mod- ules, website, listservs and newsletters. Promoting membership and leadership through grass-roots efforts and keeping the organization fiscally sound through revenue-genefating ventures will be ctiti- cal. I am particularly interested in advancing international group work and infusing multicultural competencies in - policies and practices of every aspect qf ASGW. Finally, I will bring to this position my passion for advancing group work and much energy and enthusiasm to build a strong and vibrant ASOWI Maria I Riva Title and Full Business Address: Associate Professor, College of Educa- tion, 2450 S.

Community Service: Numerous presentations on group work to community agencies in Colorado. Goals statement I have been committed to the practice, teaching and investigation of group work since 1980. Although group work has consistently been shown to be effective, and it has increased in popularity, the power of group work is frequently over- looked or underestimated. ASGW has clearly taken the lead in.developing doc- uments that inform the ethical and diver- sity competent practice of groups. Since I was a graduate student, I have relied heavily on the knowledge and expertise of ASGW for my own growth as a group worker and group researcher. There are many areas of group work that I am currently focusing on and would hope to emphasize these directions* as ASGW president. One of these areas is the emphasis on ethical decision-making. Ethical dilemmas are common in group work, and because of the potential dam- age that unethical decisions can cause to group members and the group as a whole, this area needs an even higher priority in practice, teaching and research than it holds currently. Two other underempha-. sized areas in the group work field are multicultural group work and group work with children and adolescents. ASGW could make important contributions in these two areas by conducting studies on what is effective and'by carefully observ- ing and reporting on what works in prac- tice. I would' also stress that student involvement in the organization is essen- tial and that increased multidisciplinary and international connections with other group organizations and disciplines will strengthenASGW. ASGW is a vital and thriving association with immensely skilled members. As presideit, I would encourage ASGW to continue to take a leadership role in the group work field ard increase its visibility in several other areas. I would be honored to serve as ASGW president.ASGW Go verning Council Representative Karen K. Prichard Title and Full Business Address: Associate Professor, Dept. of Ed.

As one of the first process observers for the ASGW Executive Board, I have had the opportunity to understand the importance * of shared leadership within the association. I think that this same idea is extremely important in bringing the needs of ASGW members into the larger arena of ACA. Because ASGW spans many professions, it is in a unique position to support the importance of group work in all areas of counseling. I believe that niy prior leadership posi- tions, an understanding of the political realities of ACA and an ability to balance the needs or ASGW with those of ACA -qualify me to be a siiccessful GoverningNU 55 Information subject to change Council representative.

Attehd 0 ing meetings of that group three-times pe year for a two-year period helped me gaii a better perspective on the relationship ofly ASOW to ACA and to other divisions. Ia One of the issues facing Governing it Council during that time was a motion t an- reorganize ACA and diminish the role o ,h. all divisions.' I'm happy to report many voices were raised to describe the vital role played by divisions. Much of- th~ intellectual property of our profession has been generated by divisions; division :o- should continue to play a pivotal role in rt- ACA governance. ACA should organiz u- new initiatives to empower and supporisdvio.itsdvsos Membership in ACA and in division has fluctuated dramatically. Each division5' duplicates a membership committee 0, charged-with improving commuinication among its own members. ACA should create additional membership support a~ in part of every divisioni's Management Ser- li- vices Agreement~ (MSA). This would allow ACA to improve membership ser 'vices to all, empowering divisions to fo :- cus on. meeting more specific needs of mmes..ACA now employs a \"one-sizen- n fits-air' model for MSAs. Itemization olna MSA services would benefit both ACA )rt and our division. Supplementingmember- ship services and streamlining manage- ment services would make both ACA and t ASGW stronger As ACA's Rich Ye its noted, \"A rising tide floats all boats:' th ASOW is moving away from depen- 8; dence on membership dues. .Royalties 4; from videos, books and conferences ,r, already exceed membership revenue. Our it- media collection, however, is aging. It is ia important we manage our resources wise- -r, ly in order to gener-ate new projects of ben- ie efit to our members. Production of infor- mation about group work should be owr most dramatic impact on the profession; we must be creative and innovative while establishing a plan to renew our resources.o- r- Counselors for Social Is Jusfice, (CSJ) tm- reidn Carmen E Salazar Title and Full Business Address: Assistant Professor, Department of Coun-' seling, Texas A&M University-Com- merce, Commerce, TX 75429-3011.Education: 9 Ph.D. in counseling and M.A. in counsel- 0 ing, University of New Mexico; B .A. in f psychology, College of Santa Fe.

Goals statement As a founding member of CS!, I have been privileged to participate in the orga- nization's growth from'i a group of indi- viduals committed to social justice to one of ACA's newest' division .As a coun- selor educator involved in the training of school couhselors whose worldviews span a continuum ranging from. progres- sive to highly conservative, I have become aware that the concept of social justice has many meanings to our stu- dents. Articulating concepts of social jus- ticein ways tht encompass the concerns our students .will face in 'the workplace (e.g., gender equity in the schools, theeffects of social class on client treatment) will help bring our division and its con- cerns to the attention of a larger and more diverse audience. My teaching and scholarship and my \"heart connections and passions\" encom- pass many areas: considerations of gen- der equity, multiracial/ethnic concerns, the training of multiculturally sensitive and competent counselors, and the pro- fessional development and success of counseling faculty of color. Social justice is the unifying theme. My experience is mirrored by that of many CSJ members. CSJ has the poten- tial to become a focal point for ACA members to draw together the common thread in the fabric of their interests and passions -social justice. An important step in the division's future is a journal focusing on social justice issues; the jour- nal will strengthen the voice of social jus- tice throughout our profession. -During the short time I would serve as CSJ's president, my goals would include 1) developing the journal and 2) expand- ing the leadership team so that each com- iittee mi'ght be responsible for one annu- al task ' such as increasiig student involvement and mentoring -and creat- ing liaison projects with like-minded divisions and interest groups.

Goals statement My goals are simple ones but, yet, ambitious at the same time. I believe that it is imperative that mental health profes- sionals working with diverse populations (such as the U.S. population) understand that mental health counseling is beyond psychopathology. That, in fact, it must include the effects of oppression on the basis of race, class, sexuality, the state, power and economics. It must transcend academic activist and/or neo-liberal ideas' that have concentrated on the rhetoric of doing the \"right thing\" without a call for action. Theref6re, I would like to get Counselors for Social Justice more involved with, other organizations pro- moting social justice in a form of action. Calling for ACA conventions to be con- ducted in places where counselors could work directly in helping the people of the community. That at least one day of the convention be dedicated as an action day in the community. I also would like to see more cooperation with other ACA divi- sions such as ACES, ASGW, etc. Finally, I would like to increase our membership with different ethnic groups such as Indi- an people, Latina(o)s, African-Ameri- cans, Asian-Americans and international groups, just to mention.a few.

Goals statement ACA has been an integral part of my professional life from the first days of my graduate education. Through the opportu- nity to serve in various capacities at the branch and division levels, I have come to appreciate and understand the importance of each ACA entity. I believe the regions serve a critical function in uniting ACA branches to promote the mission of our profession, to share resources and to equip regional leaders to become ACA national leaders. ACA's Southern Region is a strong region with well-developed branches that work together cooperative- ly to provide a broad network of opportu- nities for leadership development, profes- sional development and rich personal and professional relationships. It is essential, that the regional representative be knowl- edgeable about ACA as a whole and understands the role of regions within that structure. As a counselor educator and an active participant in ACA's, South- em Region, Alabama Counseling Associ- ation, ACES and SACES, I possess that knowledge and understanding. Respect, openness, reflection and an appreciation for practical solutions to challenges are personal strengths that I would use to contribute positively to the dialogue that precedes and accompanies decision-mak- ing in our profession. If elected, it would be a pleasure, an honor and a very real privilege to serve the Southern Region and ACA as regional representative to the ACA Governing Council. 0 AMERICAN COUNSELING ASSOCIATION60 Innovations in Counseling BYSUSANXoDY ACA journal highlights What makes addictions counselors credible? Addictions counselors today are under pressure to deliver brief, effective treatment. Along with other historical influences, this situation makes confronta- tional interviewing (CI) appeal- ing. In CI, the counselor directly and even harshly requests the client to accept his or her addic- tion quickly. Total abstinence is required, and clients can be ter- minated for noncompliance. In contrast, motivational interview- ing (MI) is a less aggressive approach and matches the treat- ment to the client's stage of readiness to change, appealing to the client's problem-solving skills. MI comes from a human- ist theoretical stance. In the October 2004 Journal ofAddictions and Offender Coun- seling, researchers Paul J. Toriel- lo and Douglas C. Strohmer set out to see whether CI or MI approaches influenced clients' judgments of counselor credibili- ty. They made videotapes of counselors demonstrating each approach and showed the tapes to 116 clients at addictions treat- ment agencies. Surprisingly, clients judged both approaches as equally credible. What did make a difference in clients' judgments of credibility was facilitative nonverbal behavior, such as leaning forward, nodding and good eye contact. The study suggests that microcounseling skills might have more impact than the counselor's choice of approach, at least as far as clients' willingness to continue treatment.The pros and cons of collecting data online A recent Journal of Counsel- ing & Development article (Fall 2004) brings together the latest thinking on using the Internet to collect data for research. Length of turnaround is far shorter on the Web (for example, two to three days compared with four to six weeks for mail survey); costs are low compared with the print- ing and postage costs of mail surveys; data can be formatted automatically into a spreadsheet as people respond; the order and formatting of questions can be easily altered; and participants can respond at night if they wish. Among limitations, authors Darcy Haag Granello and Joe E. Wheaton mention that only peo- ple who are used to the technol- ogy are likely to respond, mak- ing sampling error a concern. People also may worry about whether their responses are pri- vate, and efforts to disguise identity add complexity to thesurvey through codes and pass- words. Furthermore, technical difficulties can always discour- age participants from complet- ing an instrument. A hang-up of speed or an inaccessible format message might select out certain people. This article provides several useful guidelines for accentuating the advantages of online data col- lection and circumventing the difficulties. It also explains 12 strategies to assist researchers interested in this type of research. Spirituality groups and women in midlife At midlife, people often con- template existential matters such as the meaningfulness of their lives and the nature of their up- coming deaths. Women in mid- life undergo transitions marked by changing relationships with their children, career changes and retirement, and body changes.A qualitative study in the Octo- ber 2004 Counseling and Values reports on interviews with 10 women who participated in women's spirituality groups dealing with these transitions, outside of conventional orga- nized religion. In interviews with researchers Elisabeth J. Geerts- ma and Anne L. Cummings, women discussed how the groups, which engaged in activi- ties ranging from drumming to dancing to prayer, were benefi- cial to their mental health, pro- vided valuable relationships and gave social support. These bene- fits reflect the common curative factors of group work.f Susan X Qay is a counselor educator in Houston and writes graduate-level textbooks in counseling. Her research has appeared in journals such as Psychological Science, Ameri- can Psychologist The Career Development Quarterly, Psy- chotherapy and The Journal of Counseling Psychology. Influential career counseling theorist passes away at 85 David V 7iedeman and Anna Miller-Tiedeman in 1983.David V. Tiedeman Dr. David V. Tiedeman, who made cutting-edge contributions to the fields of as- sessment, decision theory, computer- based career guid- ance systems and career development theory, died Sept. 25 in Huntington, W.Va. He was 85. Tiedeman received the Eminent Career Award from the National Vocational Guidance Associa- tion (now the Na- tional Career Devel- opment Association) in 1979. He served as the association's president from 1965- 66 and was named an NCDA Fellow in 2002. Despite learning that he had Parkinson's disease in 1990, Tiedeman continued towork, write and consult until 1997. \"Three decades ago, Dr. Tiede- man first presented his ground- breaking conceptualization of career as the imposition of mean- ing on vocational behavior,\" said Mark Savickas, a longtime NCDA member and former edi- tor of the NCDA journal, The Career Development Quarterly. \"Only recently, counselors and researchers have begun to fully appreciate the ramifications of his idea. Dr. Tiedeman's concep- tion of career has shifted the par- adigm that many of us use to think about vocational behavior and work life. For this, and many other contributions, Dr. Tiede- man will be remembered as one of the most influential career the- orists of the 20th century.\" Known for having one of the finest minds in career counsel- ing, Tiedeman is also praised for having one of the field's biggest hearts. \"As a young and un-known high school director of guidance ... I met David (in 1966) and was awed with his eminence in our field as he read his prepared paper about the Information System for Voca- tional Decisions that he was developing at Harvaid,\" remem- bers JoAnn Harris-Bowlsbey, a professor of counselor education at Loyola College and executive director of the Career Develop- ment Leadership Alliance. \"What really impressed me, though, was his humanity, humility and warmth. He gra- ciously accepted me as a young professional and quickly became a friend and a mentor, a relation- ship that I shall treasure until the end of my life:' Rich Feller, a professor of counseling and career develop- ment at Colorado State Univeisi- ty, shared similar sentiments: \"While colleagues at Northern Illinois University, David opened his library and mind to me, butmost importantly he taught me how to honor others. David was a gentle giant to students as he showered them with encourage- ment. Insights about his Harvard work, designing 'career ma- chines' and his relationships with Don Super, Robert O'Hara, Gil Wrenn, Anne Roe and other lead- ers shaped my hope for career development. ... While always ahead of his time, he never put himself above others. David's commitment to equity and find- ing the goodness in others was matched by the size of his smile.\" Tiedeman is survived by his wife, Anna Miller-Tiedeman, who was also his frequent collab- orator in professional matters. She said, \"David was a noble man, a gentle spirit and a beacon of love in its truest sense. The world is better because he was here.\" Contributions can be sent to the David V.

First quarter ACA fiscal report BY JANE GOODMAN FOR COUlySELING TODAY In an effort to keep the membership fully informed and simultaneously com- ply with Governing Council policy, quar- terly fiscal reports are issued in Counsel- ing Today. This quarterly report (summa- rizing July 1-Sept. 30) represents the first report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2005. The Balance Sheet, which is presented with this report, is intended to reflect the American Counseling Association's financial position at any given point in time. The Balance Sheet gives a picture of the association's financial position as of Sept. 30. At Sept. 30, ACA owned $7,300,919 in assets. Of these assets, $5,140,334 was in cash and investments. In addition, ACA holds a $1 million note from its landlord at an above-market rate (8.25 percent). At Sept. 30, the association's liabilities included vendor fees of approximately $553,593, staff salaries and benefits of $454,332 and fees collected on behalf of related organizations of $74,463. Mem- ber benefits to be fulfilled total $3,685,428 and appear as a liability because ACA receives membership rev- enues annually while providing member benefits monthly. As this Balance Sheet indicates, ACA'snet worth at Sept. 30 is $2,533,105. This indicates that the, association remains financially positive. However, efforts must continue to be jmade to ensure the association's long-term stability. At Sept. 30, the association reported $502,561 in excess expenses over rev- enues. ACA's revenues are $89,740 lower than those reported last year due to a decline in membership and a decline in the value of the association's investment portfolio. Expenses incurred through the first quarter are $131,650 higher. The ACA Financial Affairs Committee will continue to monitor the association's revenues and expenditures on a monthly basis. ACA intends to continue develop- ing more programs as it realizes greater success in its legislative activities, and continues to provide established pro- grams and benefits to its members. The ACA Financial Affairs Commit- tee, in collaboration with the administra- tive staff and the Governing Council, convenes monthly to evaluate the finan- cial position of the association and to recommend pertinent action. Quarterly reports are provided to the membership via Counseling Today. 0 Jane Goodman is the ACA treasurer.
