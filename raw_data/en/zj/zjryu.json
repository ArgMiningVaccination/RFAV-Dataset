Vaccines are the single most effective - and sometimes only - way to prevent children from the risk of deadly infectious diseases, including: - Chickenpox - Hepatitis B - HPV - Measles - Polio - Seasonal influenza - Whooping cough - And more Why Children Especially Need Vaccines From the moment we are born, we are exposed to thousands of germs - through the air, our food, and the objects and people we come in contact with. Our immune systems are designed to help us fight and ward off diseases that these germs expose us to. Children are born with immune systems that are not yet fully developed, leaving them more vulnerable to disease. Vaccines help strengthen your child's immune system by building his/her natural defenses against disease. How Vaccines Work There are two ways to protect our bodies from disease. Both ways involve direct exposure to the disease, which allows our immune systems to build resistance against the invading germs. The first, more potentially dangerous way to expose your immune system is to get sick from the disease. The second and safest route is through vaccines. Vaccines allow your child to naturally develop immunity to diseases without becoming sick. They include special molecules called antigens that stimulate your child's immune system to produce antibodies in the same way it would if your child was exposed to the disease itself. Children from birth through age 6 can be protected against 14 infectious diseases through 10 important vaccines. All childhood vaccinations are given as a series of two or more doses. More than one dose of these vaccines is needed to build high enough immunity to prevent disease, as well as to boost immunity that fades over time. Vaccines produce immunity about 90 - 99 percent of the time. The Threat of Preventable-Disease Outbreak in Children Declining vaccination rates among children are allowing some childhood infectious diseases to make a comeback. Diseases such as pertussis (whooping cough) are returning in epidemic proportions and have resulted in child deaths. Following childhood vaccine recommendations can protect your child and others from these dangerous diseases. Child Vaccine Schedule The recommended vaccine schedule for children provides immunity early in life. This is important because young children are susceptible to diseases and their bodies may not be strong enough to fight infection. See the recommended [childhood vaccination schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf) and schedule your child's well visit now. Are you a new parent?
