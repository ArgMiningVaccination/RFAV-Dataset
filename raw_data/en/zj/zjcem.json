The most touted of New Age healing techniques has been the use of crystals. Enthusiasts claim that because rock crystal is almost entirely devoid of color, it is an almost perfect capacitor of divine white light. Explanations of exactly how crystals wield their healing powers vary from practitioner to practitioner. Some maintain that the unique properties of crystals make them excellent receptors of metaphysical energies. Fuller 242/3) Brief [history](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/history-essays) of crystal therapy As has already been mentioned, the history of this form of therapy is to be found in many historical documents and in myths, stories and records from the distant past. Some of these earlier records of crystal healing come for ancient Egypt and India. For example, \"Primitive paintings dating back to 25,000 BC show that the ancient Egyptians used crystals for therapeutic purposes. \" (What is crystal healing) There are many references to India and crystal healing in the East. \" India's Ayurvedic records and traditional Chinese medicine also claim healing with the use of crystals, dating back to 5000 years ago.\" (Crystal Healing: Medindia. Com) There are also references to the use of crystals in ancient Shamanic cultures, such as the Inuit of Canada. In a more modern context, crystal as an alternative therapy emerged in Los Angeles in the 1980's as part of the [alternative medicine](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/alternative-medicine-essays) movement. \"New Age and holistic health magazines, such as Van Nuys-based Meditation Age, began to include stories on crystals. \" (Flores) Crystal healing gathered momentum and popularity in the more \"fringe\" section of modern alternative and complementary therapies and practices. There was of course a [reaction](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/reaction-essays) from the scientifically orientated allopathic medical community. Crystal therapy and the way that crystals affect the body are not easily accessible to scientific investigation. As one medical practitioner states: \"There is no medical evidence of an imbalance of energy in the body....\" (Flores) The future of the history of crystal therapy is marked by a difficult battle for medical [acceptance](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/acceptance-essays) \"Complementary therapists should face tougher regulation and more rigorous tests to prove the treatments they offer are effective.\" (Crackdown on alternative therapy) 4. Demographics and [statistics](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/statistics-essays) At present there is a relative paucity in terms of a comprehensive quantitative overview of the demographics and statistical parameters of crystal healing, in terms of its breakdown by gender, age, number of practitioners and other variables. It can be assumed from various reports that the consensus is that this therapy is most popular and used more extensively among younger [people](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/people-essays) who have more tolerance for and more acceptance of alternative therapies than older people. This is due to the fact that older people have become used to the more formal and allopathic forms of [healthcare](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/healthcare-essays) and this fact is borne out to certain extent in the following [discussion](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/discussion-essays). One of the quantitative studies that have been done on crystal healing indicates that there is conclusive proof that there has been a \"substantial increase in the popularity of alternative medicine for a variety of illnesses and [symptoms](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/symptoms-essays), as well as for preventive health practices and general self-care.\" (Blanchard) an indication of the increasing acceptance of crystal therapy is that it is included in many formal assessments and definitions of CAM or Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Therefore the demographics and acceptance of crystal therapy can also be ascertained from the more extensive data on alternative therapies in general. In this light one study reported, \"...widespread use of CAM using nationally representative random household phone surveys. In 1991, 33.8% of American adults had used at least 1 in 16 CAM therapies, and a follow-up study in 1998 found that number had increased substantially to 42.1%.\" (Blanchard) In a survey of U.S. university students, measuring the percentage use of various alternative Medicine (AM) practices over a twelve month period, it was found that while crystal therapy was featured it was at the lower end of the table. Percentage Use of Different Alternative Medicine (AM) Practices in Past 12 Months I am practice Massage therapy Yoga Relaxation Aromatherapy Megavitamins Chiropractic Lifestyle diet Folk remedies Spiritual healing Homeopathy Bodywork Light therapy Magnets Energy healing Reflexology Crystal therapy Acupuncture Ayurvedic medicine Reiki Qigong Iridology Note. N = 506. Blanchard) The above table illustrates the fact also seen in other report and statistics, that crystal therapy is not as popular or... For example one study shows that that while there have been a measured decline in conventional religious practices in Britain, there has been a concomitant increase in views and practice associated with alternative philosophies of healing and crystal therapy in particular. \"According to recent figures, fewer than 3% of Londoners are now regular churchgoers. At the same time, non-Christian practices such as Kabbalah, Buddhism, Hinduism and crystal healing are flourishing...\" (\"The Return of Paganism\") At present it is estimated that there are in excess of 2000 Electro-Crystal Therapists throughout the [world](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/world-essays) (Huxley M.A.) an interesting statistic is that in studies of alternative therapy is has been found that one of the areas that has shown a greater increase in usage is crystal therapy. In a 2000 survey by Mills and Budd it was found that while some therapies such as aromatherapy has shown lower levels of growth, \"....less well-established therapies such as Ayurveda (+100 per cent) and crystal healing (+109 per cent)...\" shows the highest level of growth. (Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the UK and German) As stated, the demographics on crystal therapy are not comprehensive and one often encounters contradictory figures and statistics. For example, some reports state that more obscure alternatives like crystal theory are not particularly popular among Western users. \"The more unusual therapies are still relatively unpopular - an ICM poll.... showed 1% of people were using crystal therapy, auricular therapy, [treatment](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/treatment-essays) with magnets and Qi Gong. http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/nothing.gif very peculiar practice) This seems to contradict other reports in the same general region and time frame which show an increase of interest in crystal therapy. \"Crystal therapy has gained some recent credibility...\" (Bachelor). Differences in country and [culture](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/culture-essays) may also be variables that influence these results, as well as various perceptions and preconceptions that may exist. Part of the problem that exists in understanding and collating a consistent demographic profile on this subject is that many of the alternative therapies are unknown or unfamiliar to counselors and practitioners. In a survey of the rehabilitation profession, it was shown that many counselors were unaware of alternative and Native American healing practices. More than eighty percent of those surveyed were unfamiliar with crystal therapy. Conclusion: An assessment of crystal therapy There are indications that crystal therapy and healing as a movement is becoming more structured and cohesive. For example, this is particularly evident in the United Kingdom. The Crystal & Healing Federation (CHF) and the Affiliation of Crystal Healing Organisations (ACHO), who are the two main umbrella bodies for crystal healing schools and colleges, have joined forces in order to ensure that professional and adequate standards in Crystal Healing are set and maintained. The result is the British Crystal Healers (BCH), which is now the lead body representing Crystal Healing Standards in the UK. Huxley) One of the problems with the acceptance and growth of this form of therapy is the relative mystery that surrounds its functioning. However the long history of crystal therapy and the numerous personal accounts of its [success](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/success-essays) in treatment indicate that this is a therapy that should receive more [research](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/research-essays) and recognition. For example, crystal therapy has been found to be effective in cases of [depression](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/depression-essays). \"Crystal therapy documentation indicates that clients, having suffered from miscellaneous kinds of depression have been successfully treated by Crystal therapists.\" (Vantol and Tarling) At present crystal therapy is still in the beginning stages of its development in the Western world. Some critics compare it to the way that Aromatherapy was perceived fifteen years ago. (Vantol and Tarling) However there is an increasing awareness of the benefits of crystal therapy in both an alternative and complementary sense.

Source: (http://www.lifepositive.com/body/energy-healing/crystal-healing/crystal-healing.html) There are many instances of art acting as a means of enabling people back to health. This healing aspect of creativity is, I believe, due to the fact that we are liberated from the restrictions of the world in the process of creativity and because artworks are in a sense the residue of the experience of spiritual and expanded consciousness. There are numerous clinical studies which show the effective of 90). Therefore, in the light of these current developments, I envisage that the nurses will require much more comprehensive training in issues related to cultural diversity in the future. For example, the nurse will need to become more knowledgeable about the way that various cultures respond to conventional medicine and that alternative medicine and therapies play in the healing process. The subject of alternative therapies illustrates the way that the role bleep do we know.\" The documentary has been chosen based on the fact that it has highlighted various issues that relate to the quantum uncertainty, spirituality, evolutionary thought and neurological processes that are an important part of life.

Some of the main facts that have been Introduction Gallbladder disease, especially cholelithiasis (gallstones) affects over 20 million Americans every year. The condition often goes undiagnosed because cholelithiasis rarely presents symptoms. Abdominal discomfort, nausea, jaundice and biliary colic are some symptoms of the condition. Imaging techniques are the most accurate diagnosis tools for gallbladder diseases. However, laboratory values such as CBC, serum amylase, liver-function testing and lipase can help differentiate the type of gallbladder disease/or identify related issues. Surgery Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a complex medical condition that affects about 5 million American people. The condition is characterized by \"chronic widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, stiffness, impaired memory and concentration, anxiety and depression.\" (Facts of Life, 2001). Sleep disturbance and an increased sensitivity to pain follow a cyclic pattern in individuals having FMS, the result of which is a positive feedback loop. (Etiology of Fibromyalgia, 2003).
