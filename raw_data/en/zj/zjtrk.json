As a key objective of the work, is the presentation of viable alternatives to the crisis from the state and medical-scientific, giving priority and special interest to public policies of sanitation and prevention traditional non-pharmacological and the implementation of prophylactic and curative mechanisms through homoeopathic medicine and indigenous ancestral practices combined. KEYWORDS : COVID-19, virus, pandemic, synergy, syndemic, vaccines, fears, eugenics, GMOs, globalisation, remedy, disease, homoeopathy, iatrogenesis. ABBREVIATIONS: WHO - World Health Organisation, COVID-19 - coronavirus disease 2019, GMOs - genetically modified organisms INTRODUCTION : As the pandemic is declared of maximum public and world interest, the suitability and importance of homoeopathic medicine being directly involved in the curative resolution of the disease and in its prophylaxis, as a safe, effective and innocuous alternative to synthetic vaccines pharmacological, homoeopathic medicine must be an integral part to face not only this crisis but also the possible other crises that will arise. HEADLINES : - THE PRELUDE TO THE FEAR. - INFORMATION CRISIS. - EDUCATION AND WORK IN PANDEMIC. - THE MIRACULOUS SOLUTION: THE VACCINE. - PLANDEMIC GENESIS. GLOBALIST PROJECTS. - THE REMEDY, WORSE THAN THE DISEASE? - THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. - CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE AND HUMANIST MEDICINE: HOMOEOPATHY. - HOMOEOPATHIC MEDICINE: UNDERSTANDING AND EDUCATIONAL. NATURAL DEFENSES AND HOMOTOXINS. VACCINES AND THE LAW OF 'LIKE'. NUTRITION AND THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. CONCLUSION : a) What is dealt with in the present work teaches us to prevent errors due to excess improvisation, especially in the elaboration of synthesis biologics in the laboratory without strictly complying with the minimum international clinical protocols, regarding the safety and effectiveness of the final product; b) That it cannot be claimed that a biological, no matter how effective and innocuous, has exactly the same effects for one hundred percent of the population; c) That today the population is still being experimented with as if it were a routine clinical laboratory experimentation, and that is extremely serious and irresponsible; and d) That ALTERNATIVE MEDICINES, including HOMOEOPATHIC MEDICINE, should play a very important role in the resolution of global public health crises, and not only in declared pandemics, but in everything related to health and disease, and this requires a greater and efficient dissemination and awareness of the peoples.
