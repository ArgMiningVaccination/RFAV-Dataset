As t he implications sink in, all aspects of our lives are likely to be affected; we fear for the future, and ma y experience anger, confusion, sadness, sometimes depression, a sense of futility, and other emotions that degrade the quality of our day to day existence. We would like to act, to do something that would make the disease disappear, or at least to stop it pr ogressing, but in health care, unlike most other areas of life, the culturally-sanctioned mode of re sponse is still passivity; it is usually assumed that nothing we can do will have much effect on a \"physical\" disease, and that we must simply rely on physicians and others to help us. Nevertheless, there is a gro wing realization that we may be able to take steps to help ourselves, even in the face of serious disease, and there ar e now many books on improving health with self hel p methods. Some of the best-selling accounts promise near miraculous results for little effort, e.g. through a simple change in diet. They sell because they tell us what we would like to hear; the reality is, of course, far more complex. We can help ourselves, we can make a significant difference to our experience, and sometime s to the course of disease, but this requires both time and intelligent effort. In an ear lier work, \"The Healing Journey\", I tried to present in a balanced and comprehensive way an account of this process of helping ourselves through cultivating the resources of our own mind. The present volume is a sequel to \"The Healing Journey\". It embodies my own increase in understanding over the 10 years since the former book was written, an under standing derived from much personal work, and the clinical and research study of many people with cancer. The focus in this book is on spiritual imp lications of life-th reatening disease, and how we can deliberately strengt hen our spiritual connection in the service of healing. When life is threatened by a serious diagnosis we are, almost inevitably, brought face to face with some of the \"big\" questions in life: \"Why did this happen to me? Is there any meaning in it? For that matter, does my lif e have some meaning or am I just a genetic accident? Will I somehow continue to exist afte r my body dies?\" These are essentially \"spiritual\" issues, in that they question the ex istence of an order or dimension that goes beyond the material. These questions have answe rs - not necessarily in the form of reasoned verbal statements, but as what might be called a \"deep knowing\". Spirituality is the attempt to make contact with, or become aware of, this dimension of our being. It may emerge from religious belief, or it may have no relationship at all to organized religion. Why get involved with spirituality as an ai d to healing? For two main reasons. First, spiritual work helps us cope with the c hallenge of disease, and to feel much better, perhaps better than we have ever felt, despite the illness. I have known many cancer patients who have reached this, perhaps surprising, state of mind. Second, strengthening our spiritual connection may modify the biological process of disease. This is a controversial statement to some, a self-evident truth to others. It is also a notion that extends back thr ough millenia in many cultur es. Our technologically- oriented culture tends to dismiss the possibility of any signi ficant effect even of mind on body, let alone spirit, but although scientific evidence is minimal as yet, there is 4increasing support for a potentially healing e ffect of spiritual connecting, as I will discuss. Why was this book written, and for whom? The writing of this account was driven primarily by an urge to offer help to others, based on what I have learned from my own spir itual practice and exploration over more than 20 years, and from my work with hundreds of cancer patie nts, trying to help them cope more successfully and to strengthen their spiritual connection. The motivating force feels to me like a strong and loving impulse to share. Of course there is rational thinking behind it too: a sense that enough has been learned to convey something useful; clinical experience demon strating the value of spiritual work in coping with crisis; a judgement that there is a need for a book that specifically targets the use of spiritual work by people with serious illness, and does so in a moderate, responsible way. While the earlier \"Healing Journey\" vent ured into the spiritual, it did so rather cursorily, the main concern being with mind-body techniques. In this volume the emphasis is reversed. It can be read alone, and I have pr ovided a chapter recapitulating the main practical points about mind-body healing, but fo r someone to whom the idea of self-help against disease is completely new, it might be useful to read the earlier work first or in conjunction with this. The present book has been written prim arily for people suffering from life- threatening illness. My clinical experience is almost entirely wit h cancer patients, a disease which I had myself (in 1987), but the principles apply to most other diseases, and indeed to the lives of those who are \"well\". So t he book is relevant to family members caring for or supporti ng someone who is ill, and to the healthy person seeking meaning and peace in their lives. There is increasing interest among health professionals in the spiritual dimension of illness; I have kept th em in mind also, and trust that they will fi nd that this text helps them to organize or extend their own ideas. What experience will we draw on? The spiritual journey is a very personal one, and I will be sharing some of my own experiences throughout this account. I started to take an intere st in these matters in 1978, at the age of 38, th rough a study of hatha yoga and the philosophy associated with it. I was prompted to do this by painful joints in my hands; having seen my father suffer for years from arthritis, I wanted to av oid it. The arthritis abated, but the yoga did more - it introduced me to a realm that I had not known existed, namely to the idea that underlying this material world there is anot her, \"deeper\" level of reality that we can access through techniques like meditation and reading the writings of \"mystics\", people who have devoted themselves to experiencing this more fundamental universe. I also learned that we can understand ourselves much more fully than is usual, by closely watching our thoughts and reactions to events; this is an insight common to many paths of personal growth, including modern psychology. I was fortunate, in a world of false prophets, to encounter a genuine teacher of unimpeachable in tegrity, Swami Sivananda Radha, and over a period of years spent ma ny months at her ashram in British Columbia and at workshops given by her or her students. My unfolding awareness of 5the spiritual reality led to a change in pr ofessional activity, away from laboratory research in immunology, and, after retraining , towards research and clinical practice in psychology. This transformation was suppor ted by my employers and colleagues to whom I am most grateful; they allowed me to continue in the same institution (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto), but to do entirely different work, developing and researching group therapies for people with cancer and thei r family members. Much reading in several of the major world spiritual traditions accompanied this change; I explored some of them through attending workshops and semi nars, and my practice of meditation, study and reflection continue daily . Many, perhaps all, of these traditions and religions provide guidance in healing. However, I am not a scholar in these areas, neither philosopher nor theologian, and I hope professionals in such disciplines will forgive errors of detail. My interest is pragmati c: what can be learned that will help all of us who need help, whether because of cancer, other illness, or simply dissatisfaction with life? While the substrate for authentic writing about spirituality must be individual experience, there is always the possibility of bias if one relies only on this; everyone is different, we all experience the world in different ways and have differing talents and abilities to access spiritual connectedness. The second source of information behind the text of this book is our work with cancer patients. Several hundred people now attend our clinical programs each year, and m any of them choose to wrestle with the spiritual implications of thei r illness. Many die, of cour se, and we have seen how prior spiritual work can ease this passage. Others, mo tivated to work by the threat of death, find a new world opening up to them through thei r spiritual exploration. As part of our research we have kept detailed notes on people with cancer who have worked intensively with our small t eam of therapists. We have correlated the degree of \"involvement\" in this work with longer survival , as I describe in the first chapter. Thus the book draws on what is probably a uniqu e data base of systematic clinical and scientific observation of a large number of cancer patients over 2 decades. Many participants in our programs provided copi es of written homework (sometimes amounting to a hundred pages or more). I will intersperse the text with (anonymous) quotations from their writings to illustrate points of interest. Although I am a scientist by training, t he evidence behind most of the ideas in this volume is not usually \"scientific\", in the sense of being directly observable by a disinterested third party. Rather, it is \"ex periential\", based on my own direct experience, the reported experience of our patients, and the accounts of many other writers on spirituality. This kind of evidence may be, if honestly and rigorously observed and reported, even more compelling than third party descriptions. Its validity can be established by the consistency of reports fr om many individuals, in different eras and cultures. As in psychology generally, to describe spiritual experiences we have to rely on people's reported accounts. Such incidents as feeling filled with joy and sensing that all will be well are not readily captured by ex ternal measurement, yet the individuals to whom they happen have no doubt about them when they occur. And when we observe that spiritual practices like meditation lead quite regularly to such experience, we know that something important has been documented, as surely as if we measured it on a meter. 6Finally, it is important to acknowledge the limits of my own spiritual development. I do not profess to be some kind of enlight ened being, simply a sincere and dedicated seeker and observer, with much work still to do. I have personally practised everything recommended in this book, and continue to do much of it on a daily basis. But I can guide the reader only to the boundaries of my own experience, and perhaps point the way ahead from there as indi cated by the writings of spiritual masters. 7The content and format of the book; its re lation to the \"Healing Journey\" Program Our \"Healing Journey\" program at the Ontario Cancer Institute in Toronto has been constructed in a series of levels or stages, so that people with cancer, and members of their families, can determine how much of the overall program they wish to attend. Everyone begins by co ming to four, weekly sessions, held in a large classroom, at which they are introduced to some of the basic self regulation techniques: relaxation, watching the mind, using metal imagery, and setting goals. Many then proceed to the next level, consisting of eight sessions, hel d partly in a classroom format and partly in small groups (about eight people with a professional leader), in which they can share feelings and experiences. The techniques of the first level are reinforced and extended in the second, and some new methods taught: journalling, meditation, and \"consulting an Inner Healer\" (for more details you can look at our website: www. healingjourney .ca). Both of these levels have been taught, and their benefits researched, for over fifteen years. \"Graduates\" with serious cancers have also had available to them, for many years, a long term (one year) therapy group, and a \"life story\" program, in which people with cancer write about t heir lives and present them to a small group. More recently we have offered, followi ng graduation from the second level, a course called \"Steps towards spiritual healing\" . The popularity and success of this short course has led directly to the present book. The heart of the \"Steps\" program is a series of exercises for self study, aim ed at diminishing the blocks we all have that hinder direct experience of a spiritual dimension. Teac hing this course has reaffirmed for me something that we have learned in all of our courses over the years: change and growth requires active study and practice. Relatively little can be achieved by simply reading about spirituality. Therefore, the present book is centr ed around a series of chapters with self-study assignments attached to them, much as in our current spiritual healing course, but with some additional exercises. As an example: there is a chapter on the tendency we all have to pass judgements on peopl e and events, and assignments that, if conscientiously done, can help us discover the truth of this for ourselves and begin to undo the habit. The book can thus be used as a text for a discussion group or course on bringing spirituality into healing. This program of active study is introduced by chapters on spirituality and healing, and by a recapitulation of the main techniques of mind-body healing. There is also a final chapter designed for those who have done the exercises, and can begin to sense that what \"healing\" ultimately means: discovering, or uncovering, our true i dentity, and how we relate to our world. Since this book is meant for the thoughtfu l layperson, the writing here is non- technical, and references are minimal. T here is a list of sources and suggested reading at the back of the book. Please view me as a fellow traveller, with ideas and experience that may be useful to you. I trust that t he book will prove an introduction and guide to your spiritual self development, and t hat it will help you orient yourself as you read other books (some titles are suggested), and try a variety of spiritual and self- awareness techniques. Alastair Cunningham, December, 2001. 8 Part I: Principles of Mind-body and Spiritual Self-Healing 9Chapter 1: Spirituality and its importance in healing 1. What is spirituality? Since most of us have a rather foggy i dea of what \"spirituality\" means, we need to start with some definitions. Simply pu t, the spiritual search means trying to gain direct experience of a higher power or order that transcends the material. This order has been given a great variety of names, at different times and in different cultures: e.g. the Universal Mind, the Divine, Brahman, the One, the Tao, t he Eternal, Yahwe, God. To \"transcend\" means, literally , to rise above or extend bey ond, and the implication here is that the non-material spiritual reality not only goes far beyond what we can perceive with our ordinary senses but also profoundly affects our everyday life. Some people reject this possibility, just as, in earlier time s, many used to reject the notion that things we could not see caused disease. We have learned to measure and see micro- organisms, and we may eventually learn to meas ure the spiritual. However, the way the spiritual realm acts on our minds and bodies remains mysterious at present. Perhaps there is a precedent now, in our \"Age of Information\", when we have understood that non-material information encoded in software (basically mathematical programs) can profoundly affect hardware; a factory can be run by such programs, for example. \"Is spirituality the same as religion?\" The words are not synonymous, religions being institutionalised syst ems of ritual, faith and worship, based initially on the spiritual experience of their founders, but not necessarily much c oncerned with the attempt to gain direct experience of t he transcendent. Religious belie f may be adopted for cultural and personal reasons, with or without any underly ing spiritual experience. A spiritual journey or path, on th e other hand, is the process of coming to experience our place in, and our relationship to, a transcendent, non -material order, di mension, matrix, intelligence or power. The me taphor \"journey\" captures the essential fact that such experience rarely comes all at onc e; it takes time and work to realize it. Thus while a religion is an organisation within society, spir ituality is an attribute of an individual. We may say that religion is about belief, spir ituality is about expe rience, and note that people can be religious without being spiritual, and vice versa. Another term you may encounter, which refe rs to the same area of interest is \"mysticism\". According to Evelyn Underhill, a fa mous British writer on the subject, this is \"the art of union with reality\", and mystics are people whose lives centre around this search. The word is widely misunderstood; ther e is a cultural bias, in the West, against anything that is \"mystical\", as opposed to concrete, straightforward, honest, readily visible, and so on! We will be learning from the great mysti cs as we proceed: they are, so to speak, the professionals in this fiel d, people who have devoted their lives to understanding and experienci ng the divine order. We need also to distinguish spirituality from \"spiritualism\" or \"spiritism\", terms that usually refer to some kind of suppos ed communication with the dead. And it is important to differentiate between spirituality and emotiona lity; as the concept of spirituality enters the popular domain there is a tendency to degrade the word \"spiritual\", and use it for any relatively refined and plea sant perceptions or sensations, such as those evoked by natural surroundings. The label is only apt if the experience evokes a 10sense of the transcendent. 2. Healing. \"Healing\" now needs some discussion. T he word comes from the old English \"haelen\", to make whole, and refers to a return to balance and harmony. Medically speaking, healing means restorat ion of a state where all physiological variables, things like blood pressure, muscle tension, digestion, and the various functions of all organs, lie within a range that is considered \"norma l\". You will see that assumptions are made by this definition, since different stat es are valued by different people and under different living conditions; for example, athletes (such as sumo wrestlers) may train their bodies to a state that in some cases is out side this range. More important, a medical definition pays little attention to psychological , social and spiritual aspects of health, registering only extreme deviations in p sychological function as abnormal. An expanded definition of healing would attend closely to all of these dimensions, and a truly healed or healthy state, on this view, would include self-acceptance, harmony in a person's interactions with ot hers, and a strong connection wit h a spiritual matrix. The body and mind have a great natural capacity to recover from various injuries and to return to balance (as seen, for exampl e, in wound healing, or recovery from psychological trauma). In undertaking a self-d irected healing journey we are trying to assist this process with specific methods. Two distinct kinds of action are possible. First we may look for help from external sources. Almost all standard western medical practices are external modes of help, as is mu ch of what is called \"alternative\" medicine, i.e. the administration, by an external person or the indi vidual herself, of drugs or procedures (including diet or dietary additive s used as treatment). The second kind of self-assisted healing looks \" internally \"; it is the deliberate invo king, by the individual, of potentials within his or her own mind and sp irit, e.g. through awareness and changing of thoughts, meditation, mental imaging, setting and pursuing goals, prayer, and so on. We will examine these techniques in more detail in the next chapters. The emphasis in this kind of self-directed healing is on acti ve participation to change states of mind, rather than on manipulating external circumstances. This book is concerned only with internally assisted healing. This kind of healing forms the basis for the rapidly growing move ment of \"mind-body medi cine\". We are concerned here particularly with the spiritual dimension, and will be presenting a systematic program of techni ques and ideas aimed at opening up the mind to spiritual influences, a process that we might call \"s piritual self-healing\". This should be distinguished from the littl e understood phenomenon of \"spiritual healing\" of one person by or through another, for example by the \"laying on of hands\". There are undoubtedly interesting possibilities in such methods, but they are extremely difficult to reproduce reliably. Thus, while we will mention recent experiments on \"healing at a distance\", the book will be concerned with things you can do to help yourself. 3. Why is the spiritual dimension important in healing? Modern medicine is highly effective in tr eating many acute conditions such as bacterial disease or trauma, but much le ss so as diseases get more serious and 11chronic. We then enter a dom ain where spirituality tends to become more and more important, and where it makes se nse to attend to all aspects of ourselves and our lives, in the hope that making changes in psycholog ical and spiritual levels may bring peace of mind, and help us to find some meaning in the experience and in our lives. As we will see, it is reasonable to hope also for a degree of physical healing. The first of these aims, greater peace of mind, is often achieved as people become more spiritually aware, even in t he face of life-threatening diseases like advanced cancer. Spiritual techniques like meditation and prayer quieten the mind, reducing anxiety and depression. Contact with a transcendent or divine order can bring reassurance, a sense that, even if death is immi nent, all will be well, that this is not \"the end\", and something of oneself will continue. To the skeptic, this may seem like a fear- induced illusion; to the sufferer it can be a life- line. Here's what a patient had to say on the effects of her spiritual practice and experience on reduc ing distress, and providing sense of meaning: *I believe that my spiritual work has a very positive effect on my healing. One of the biggest obstacles I have faced to healing has been the stre ss I have experienced from fear, since I was diagnosed with metastatic cancer. I found that this fear manifested in a number of physical symptoms: tightening in my chest, abdominal discomfort, headache, sl eeplessness. I believe that prolonged anxiety affects the ability of my immune system to function, and that the more relaxed and peaceful I feel, the easier it is for my body to heal. I also found that this fear affects my emotional state. It sometimes leads to feelings of sadness, disappointment, anger, resistance , helplessness, etc. The spiritual work I do helps me in both the physical and in the emotional realm. It has helped me to focus outside of my body and physical state, on something bigger than myself. It has given me hope that my life can have purpose, even if my physical abilities are diminished. It has hel ped me to reach a still, tranquil state of mind, which is useful in dealing with fear. I have learned to accept the range of emotions that come up, and to let them come and go, rather than getting \"stuck\" in the emotional and related physical states. I think that this is probably better for healing, as the physical effects of stress are reduced. This quote also speaks to a second, related benefit of spiritual ex ploration, that it may generate a sense of meaning and purpose, replacing the despair that serious disease can induce. Spirituality is closel y associated with the search for ultimate meaning in one's life. As you can verify fo r yourself, meaning come s from relationship to something outside of, and larger than, ones elf. We all need to feel that we matter, that our lives have some significance, and us ually we seek this reassurance from our relationships with other people, through friend s, family and work, and with the natural world. However, when we contract a life-threatening disease, social contact is not enough; many also ask themselves if this catastrophic event has meaning, that is, whether there is some point to it, does it fit into some overall scheme, or is it just a meaningless accident? Is there some way of knowing that our lives do \"matter\" in the Universe? Does the Universe \"care\" what happens to us, or is it cold and indifferent? Is it, as Albert Einstein asked, a \"friendly place\" or not? In spiritual terms, then, finding meaning is about developing an awareness of being part of a larger order or plan, often accompanied by a sense that all will be well, even if one dies, and by feeling loved and cared for by God or some higher power. If we are concerned about these questions, we are ready for the spiritual search. Cancer, or some other life event that threatens our safety, can open us up to the quest. 12More controversially, it is hoped that spirit ual work may actually prolong life. I'll come back to the available evidence for this shortly. To people thoroughly immersed in the spiritual journey, the sp iritual journey may become t he major focus, and prolonging life or even improving its quality may cease to be the main concern. Death is simply a stage to be undergone, perhaps signalling the commencement of a new phase of experience. With this orient ation, the disease serves as a motivating force to bring attention back to spiritual work as t he priority for any time remaining. As a result of my own experience of canc er in 1987-8, and of being afraid for my life, I became much more attentive and re ceptive to this universe of meaning, and willing to put time into trying to contact it. I had many experiences of feeling loved and cared for by a dimension that I would call God or the Divine. There were some remarkable incidents that might be described as paranormal, but the basic and most important change was uncovering a subterra nean river of joy and peace, a sense that all would be well, even if I died, that is still with me, whenever I remember not to be too busily preoccupied with worldly activities. Many others in our cancer healing groups have had similar experience. I learned that we have to create space for this peace, to pay attention to it if we want to experience it, and that living a spiritual life is a matter of conscious and dedicated attention, which, howev er, repays the effort many times over. Although I am acutely conscious of my own limitations of understanding and resolve, this sense of spiritual undercurrent has bec ome secure enough for me to take the step of trying to help others find it. 4. Requirements and obstacles on the spiritual journey. Openness of mind The most important pre-requisite for undertaking the journey is an open mind, a willingness to set aside preconceived ideas and explore for ourselves, using a combination of traditional me thods and modern psychological te chniques like those that you will find here. I want to emphasise, as strongly as possible, this need for flexibility or open-mindedness. In our research and clinic al experience with cancer patients we have found that many individuals simply do not give themselves a chance to have new experiences, because they cling fearfully to fi xed and limited notions of what \"reality\" is, and of what is or is not possible or import ant for them. This rigidity aborts their progress. A particularly important aspect of this open-mindedness concerns prior religious beliefs. Our orientation here is entirely non-sectarian, spiritual rather than religious. If you already have firm ideas t hat are working for y ou, I have no wish to contradict them; I want only to challenge yo u to examine your views. While prior religious experience can help us in our spirit ual journey, inflexible religious beliefs can limit progress. For example, rigid concepts of \"God\", may be stumbling blocks. It is important to remember that the word is not t he reality, and that \"God\" is simply a word. Perhaps it should be viewed as a verb, rather than as a noun. Often it is an attempt to understand the transcendent by representing it as a human-like figure, albeit a magnificent, perhaps omnipotent one, a sort of idealised parent. This sort of model or 13picture of the Divine is a \"projection\" (a te rm we will discuss in chapter 7), that is, an attributing of our preconceptions to someth ing we can't fully understand. In many cultures, for example, God has been seen as punitive, reflecting our own guilt and sense that we deserve punishment, which can lead to the view that \"I don't deserve spiritual help\". So here, perhaps, is your first test of open-mindedn ess: if you already have a concept of God that y ou like, are you willing to think about your ideas, how you arrived at them, whether they still serve you well or need modification? The exercises in chapters 3 - 11 are useful in deepening our understanding, even for people with long- established religious views. Another attitude that is common today is that \"God\" is nonsense, a sort of insurance policy for the weak. If this is y our view, you will only be able to undertake a spiritual search if you ar e willing to suspend scepticism and seek actual experiences (The exercises at the end of c hapter 3 invite you to engage in an exploration of your current concepts of God). To reiterate, please understand that it is not the words, or even the concepts, that matter ultimately; w hat is important is acquiring the subtle experience of being part of a larger order, a sp iritual matrix or dimension, and enjoying all the benefits that flow from this. The words often get in the way, although we need them to communicate with one another. My hope for everyone, whatever your pre- existing beliefs, is that you will find your own way to the Divine, and your own words and concepts to define your experience to yourse lf. Read the statemen ts below, from two patients who were unable to get past some pr e-existing limitations in thinking about spirituality, and from a third who embraced it enthusiastically. *I continue to smart from my first experiences with religion. It's very tender and I stay away from things like acts of faith. It has to be demonstrated to me somehow. *It feels hypocritical to pray to God only when I am in trouble. *I feel much more committed to the spiritual work . I sense that a power is working to teach me something and I must stay focussed to allow the pr ocess to happen. I have no idea of the time frame, but it doesn't matter. The journey is the learning curve. Willingness to work Some readers may ask: \"why do you empha sise 'work'? Isn't it enough just to pray, or go to church, or ask for help from some divine source? Won't it just happen?\" Well no, unfortunately not. Si gnificant progress on a spiritual path requires active work on our part, as sages in all the main tradition s tell us. You can choose to see that as a burden, or alternatively, feel glad that there are things you can do to help yourself. Metaphors can help us understand the process of spiritual connecting. For example, taking a healing or spiritual journey is in many ways like learning a new language, and familiarising ourselves with the culture behind it: we need to suspend criticism, explore new ideas, and above all, practise techniques and ways of being. Or you could imagine yourself as imprisoned at the bottom of a deep hole in the ground, and that someone throws you a rope. It is of little us e just gazing at the r ope, wondering what it's made of, or whether it will support our weight - we need to grab hold and allow ourselves to be pulled up, assisting our progr ess by whatever climbing we are able to 14do. Trust is required. The \"rope\" in this context is the accumulated wisdom of spiritual seekers from various cultures over several millenia. We found, in the research I describe bel ow, that willingness to work and change was a strong predictor of l onger survival. Many or our patients, who tended not to outlive medical predictions, had an a ttitude rather like the following: *I wouldn't be prepared to take 6 months and do only this self-healing work; the benefits are not sufficiently clear\"... \"If there was something that guar anteed healing I woul d probably do that all the time\", but I'm \"unwilling to devote 8 hours a day on self-help work By contrast, those who lived longer than expected had a different atti tude, like that of the following patient (alive and well 7 y ears after being diagnosed as incurable): *I wake up each morning thinking what am I going to do today for myself (relaxing, meditation etc.,) and when shall I do it. I know it is the most important thing to do in my life at the moment. One circumstance that often stops people wo rking is feeling well! Paradoxically, as we sometimes say half joki ngly, this can be \"dangerous to your health\", because the motivation is lessened, and its easier to believe that everything will turn out all right. If, for example, you have had a primary cancer remo ved, you may just want to return to life as before. Yet this is probably the most effe ctive time at which to do self help work. Some cancer cells remain in the body afte r surgery, but the num bers are relatively small, and our regulatory systems (see next c hapter) have an easier task to control or eliminate these remnants than w hen cancer is advanced. This is a time for an all-out effort, using healthy mental and physical prac tices, to help our body's natural healing powers and minimise the chance of a recurrence of disease. What if you, the reader, ar e in fair physical health? Is there still healing to be done? Well of course. Bodies are all subj ect to gradual deterioration and eventual death. If we continue to see ourselves only as a body, we are likely to become progressively more miserable as aging progresse s. On the other h and, if we learn to see our essence as spiritual, the decay of the body-vehicle is much less important. It is perhaps a value judgement to say so, but if we are not engaged in seeking meaning after mid-life, we may be wa sting our time (as Carl J ung, among other thinkers, has pointed out). A quote from the great modern sage, Paramahansa Yogananda, is relevant here: \"A person is old only when he refuses to make t he effort to change\"! 5. What is the process of getting spiritually connected? Methods of seeking For the thinking person, the search for di rect spiritual experience is best begun with a rational examination of concepts. As these are explored, one's mind-set changes to allow new experiences, and we move to a deeper \"felt-sense\" of what the concepts mean. As an example, in c hapter 4 we look at \"judgement\". The first task is to recognise the pervasiveness of judging in our mental life (an idea that might be indignantly rejected by someone not willing to do the introspe ctive work), and then to try to diminish this habit. Practising non-judge ment leads to a felt-sense of greater 15acceptance of others, and ultimately of oneself. We are responsible for creating the mental receptivity that leads to changes. This work is not about dogmatically imposing or uncritically adopting a set of beliefs. Nor has it much to do with mora lity. It is rather an invest igation, an \"archeological dig\" within the mind, a \"work-in\" rather than a \"work-out\"! But as we proceed, we find out that we do not have to do ever ything alone; there is a spir itual power that helps us; events seem to unfold as we need them to; \"g race\" descends. It might be more correct to say we co-create our spiritual state, in much the same way as we co-create, with the artist, a sense of beauty in looking at a picture. This creation or co-creation has two as pects. The first is removing obstacles, and the second, adopting new practices. The fi rst is much the more painful, because it involves acknowledging and diminishing i ngrained selfish habits, like judgement, guilt, and exaggerated desire. Most of the exercises in subsequent chapters are devoted to this end. Think of it as removing weeds from your personal garden! The second approach corresponds to planting beautiful flow ers, which can only flourish in cleared ground. It is, basically, the adoption of habits of thought that connect us with the Divine: \"listening\" for guidance, rather than always seeking control, readi ng spiritual texts, meditating (which can serve both functions, cl earing and planting), adjusting lifestyle to allow time for reflection and meditating, meeti ng with other seekers, and other practices. Note that either approach al one is not enough, and specifically that we cannot just impose new habits, like daily meditation, on top of a \"normal\", unexamined, selfish thoughtstyle and hope for significant and lasting spiritual change. Drawing on established traditions Modern western psychology can be helpful in the removal of blocks - in fact, the aim of most psychotherapy is to correct t he distorted self concept, and hence conflict, that many people experience. Thus regular psychotherapy can be a valuable preliminary to the more p sycho-spiritual work we are addressing here, and for some people, those with more serious psychological problems, it may be essential. But psychology does not go far enough; it has little to say about the \"beaut iful flowers\" that we need to cultivate in place of the weeds of conflict that we have removed. For this we need to consult the spiritual masters. If you are new to spirituality, and want to get an impression of these traditiona l methods, try the \"Yoga Sutras \" of Patanjali, within the Hindu tradition, or the \"Dhammapada\", sa yings of the Buddha. I offer ideas and quotations from such traditions in this book Be aware that the language and symbols used often differ from what we are accust omed to (and hence may pose a challenge to our openness of mind). If you are feeling really adventur ous, study \"A Course in Miracles\", text \"channelled\" fr om Jesus in the 1960's. I have drawn heavily on this text, since it is the most profound book on healin g and spirituality that I have encountered. There are, of course, m any spiritual paths, many \"routes up the mountain\", although they share common features and arrive at the same peak. The oldest known system of human spiritual development, y oga, defined by scriptures going back more 16than 4000 years, recognises four main paths , which suit differ ent personalities and cultures: the path of understanding the path of meditation the path of devotion (to G od or an avatar - a human who has fully realised his or her oneness with the divine Order) the path of selfless service. As I've indicated, the present introduction to spiritual growth mainly follows the path of understanding, which seems to o ffer the best chance of relati vely rapid transformational change. This is because the power of r easoning is much the most highly developed ability in most western people. Meditati on is incorporated and encouraged, however (beginning in chapter 3), and devotional rituals and ideas are also introduced. Meditation is a vital part of the journey, quietening the mind and helping us to sense our true nature, but understanding is also needed; insights that emerge during meditation need to be digested and adopted wit hin a growing framework of concepts about reality. A purely devotional path, on the other hand, wit h its call to surrender to the Divine, is difficult for many westerners, although a sense of love fo r the Divine Order develops gradually as we pursue understanding. Selfless service to the Divine (through serving others) is less suited to a person with severe illness, although as we heal, it becomes compelling. We will come back to these concepts in later chapters. 6. What is the goal of the spiritual path? The eventual aim of the spiritual path is to arrive beyond the concept of oneself as just a body and mind, and to experience that we are in fact part of God or the Divine Ground, both before and after bodily death. It is a lofty goal, perhaps one whose very desirability is unclear, as yet. All of the gr eat traditions extol, in various ways, this ultimate goal of \"God-realisation.\" To a B uddhist there is no separate self, and our work is to drop that misconception. To a Hindu, Atm an, the Higher Self withi n, is part of God, or Brahman. To most Christians, and many Jews, each of us has an immortal soul, and the hope is that through the love of G od, we will be \"resurrected\" after death. How is this spiritual search related to t he \"healing journey\", t hat many of us are on? I offer a brief outline here, and expand it in chapter 12, si nce the concepts will make more sense after worki ng through the exercises in chapt ers 3 to 11. In the end, the spiritual and healing journeys are the same. If we are, or have been, ill, we usually begin our search for healing by seeking out support, and learning coping strategies and some degree of management of our thoughts. If we continue , the journey becomes an attempt to find some meaning in the illness experience. As I indicated earlier, in looking for meaning we are asking how the disease is related to all other events in our lives. We come to see that we can't separate them - if one event has meaning, all do. This investigation of the relations hip between all aspects of our lives ultimately becomes a search for our identity: we are asking \"Who am I , really?\" Our culture has one answer, 17that we are entirely separat e beings. The mystical traditions have another: that this separateness is an illusion, a creation of our minds, that we are, in fact, part of \"one mind\". Nevertheless, we defend our individua lity vigorously, mainly because of the fear of what we might lose if we saw ourselv es as merged with something larger. The process of returning to an awareness of uni ty requires active work because we need to overcome the many obstacles posed by our false conception of separateness. According to the spiritual view, this is the ultimate purpose of our lives. We have to address these obstacles directly; we cannot bypass them, and hope simply for enjoyable spiritual experiences, since our psychological views will undermine our capacity for spiritual connection. As Swami Radha puts it in her book, \"Kundalini Yoga for the West\": \"we need to face ourselves on the gut level\"! 7. Where will we end up? What state of mind may we reasonably hope to reach? An undercurrent of joy, peace, love, \"flow\", unity with other people, living things and the Divine, are achievable, even if you are facing serious disease. We have seen this in many cancer patients, even in some not far from deat h. You can expect to get a sense of meaningfulness of events, and that you have a role in the creation of this meaning which will, in turn confer a satisfying sense of purpose in your own life. If you have cancer, you will perhaps be able to see the disease differently, for exampl e as a motivator for your spiritual work, even as a \"gift\". We have often heard this fr om patients. If you are, or become, well, you will almost certainly want to shape your life towards doing more things that are helpful to other people. In any case, if you are struggli ng with a disease, the physical problems will become less prominent, and the sp iritual search more so. \"Success\" on the spiritual path is evidenced in your st ate of mind, and in your impact on others around you, which can be very great, even if you are dying. To quote from Paramahansa Yogananda again: \"Success is when you have so expanded your consciousness that your life is a glory and happiness to yourself and others\". *Now that I understand that unconditional love is in me through God who is in me, I want to know, feel and experience the world as a fully alive person..... What I hope to give to others who seek it is a chance for their personhood to be recognized and accepted for what it is. *On many solitary walks in nature, I have been overwhelmed by the se nse that I have not been alone, e.g., a gust of wind on my face, climbing hill s, standing or sitting at the peak of a significant pinnacle and reflecting ..... On this type of 'walk-ab out' I can converse with God in one of the most meaningful/successful ways. I have tried to present the e ssence of the spiritual search in a way that can be used by anyone, regardless of prior religious views, provided they are willing to work conscientiously with their own minds. In this spirit I offer here a theme, or mantra, that would be endorsed by all the main spiritual traditions: CHOOSE ONLY LOVE It is a strategy appropriate for all occasi ons! Even small progress towards this end brings immense benefits in terms of peace and reassurance. In the working sessions 18we will practise approaching the world in a non-judgemental way, thus creating an openness through which connection with the Divine may come. 8. Scientific evidence that spirituality aids healing An association between spirituality and healing has been consistently noted in diverse cultures and epochs. In spite of t he materialistic orient ation of our current western culture and health care system, this belief and interest persists. I looked up \"spirituality and healing\" and \"healing journey\" on the internet, and found some 300,000 entries for each! Scientific data is considerably more sparse. There ar e approximately 300 articles published in English on the relationship between religion or spirituality and health. Most of these have rela ted simple habits, such as regularity of attendance at a church or synagogue, to better physical or mental health. The physical benefits have included less hypertension, heart disease or pulmonary emphysema, lowered mortality overall, and better recovery after illness. It is not possible from these studies to conclude that the religious habits are the cause of the better health, since it can be argued that, for example, the improved health of those who attend church is attributable to other healthier lifestyle habits; the social support, emotional release of religious practices, and differences in personality bet ween religious or spiritual people and the non-religious might also account for the differences in health. However, expert panels, such as a recent one at the US National Inst itutes of Health, agr ee that being religious or spiritual aids health. There is an intriguing body of experim ental data on a related, much more esoteric, group of phenomena: the idea that \"laying on of hands\", or prayer at a distance (see chapter 3), or the pa ssage of hands by a healer over a patient (\"therapeutic touch\"), can also promote at least some aspects of good health. Such effects have been shown in animals and even in plants, treated by healers. They are widely dismissed by orthodox scientists, as one might expect, although many of the experiments would be quite acceptable if the results were less radical. They are not, however, strictly relevant to our topic, wh ich is the impact of an individual's spiritual qualities on his or her own health. Perhaps the main difficulty that sci entists have with the proposition that spirituality, prayer, or distant, non-physical events might foster healing is that nobody knows how to measure these forces or energies, if that is indeed w hat they are. Our science cannot account for ways in which a non-material event, connecting with a transcendent reality, could inte ract with the material or ph ysical world, as represented by our bodies. This does not mean that it is impossible, although that is often concluded, but rather suggests that our theories are currently too narrow to accommodate the phenomena. The truly scientific attitude is to maintain an open mind, look for more factual evidence, and to devise broader theories. A few responsible scientists and clinicians in the health field are currently pursuing this goal. Does spiritual therapy promote longer life in cancer patients? I have not found 19any systematic studies dealing specifically with this question (although the anecdotal evidence for an effect of deep meditation on cancer remission, by Meares, cited in chapter 3, is interesting). There are, however, a number (currently about a dozen) published studies of fair quality testing the impact of various psychological therapies on lifespan of people with serious cancers. In much of this wo rk, spiritual or existential issues were discussed as a par t of the therapy, but were not a predominant part. Some of these studies have given positive and so me negative results; since \"The Healing Journey\" was written there have been further negative results. Thus we cannot yet make definite statements about t he potential of psychological or spiritual therapy to slow progression of cancer in a majority of pati ents. One of the pr oblems here has been that investigators have generally adopted the kind of experimental method used to test new drugs: comparing a group of patients who received the therapy against a control group who did not. With this design, it is difficu lt to detect a healing e ffect in a minority of patients who may have worked hard at helping themselves - thei r results are lost in the average of the whole group. Anot her limitation is t hat the therapies have generally been rather non-intensive - usually some form of support and encourag ement of emotional expression, but without emphasising active se lf-control techniques. Thus reasons for our current lack of scientific knowledge about the possible in fluence of either mind or spirituality on healing from cancer include: a small number of studies so far; insufficiently intensive therapy; and ex perimental designs that conceal the achievements of exceptional ly dedicated patients. How, then, can a scientist justify writ ing a book advocating spiritual work for cancer patients? Mostly because of my personal experience, and because of clinical observation of the value of spiritual connec tedness, made over many years by many therapists, ourselves included. As I've described, spiritual practice promotes greater peace of mind, acceptance of difficult conditions, and better quality of life generally. An association between spirituality and physical healing has been anecdotally noted by therapists, and there ar e a number of papers on \"remarkable survivors\" or \"spontaneous remissions\" of cancer (meaning remissions of unknown cause) where patients have often displayed a strong interest in spiritua lity. There is one further reason: a unique experiment which we have done, and which we are currently replicating in our own research unit at the Ontario C ancer Institute, Tor onto, that I want to describe briefly now. The reasoning behind this experiment was straightforward: to know whether psychological and spiritual self-help work and growth is associated with living longer, we felt we needed to study very closely a group of people with medically incurable cancer, over a prolonged period of time, and relate what they thought, felt and did to the duration of their survival. This may seem like common sense, but it is not the way experiments are usually done in medical sci ence, where large \"randomised trials\" are the favoured method. We had already done one of those trials, with negative results, yet we were convinced from our clinical observations that people highly involved with their self help often lived much longer t han expected (there was even evidence, within our trial, that a small s ubgroup who made greater efforts to help themselves lived significantly longer). So we recruited 22 pe ople with incurable metastatic cancers of 20various kinds into our therapy groups. Each patient was free to stay a year in the therapy, and most did so. During this time we asked them to do extensive written assignments at home (much like those in chapters 3 - 11 here), and we also made detailed notes of the views t hey expressed in the therapy discussions. From this mass of records we distilled, with standard me thods, a number of psychological qualities, such as \"openness to change\" and \"dedication to self help work\". These qualities were given a numerical rating, by a team of p sychologists who inspected all the data. We added up all these numbers to obtain a compos ite index, \"involvement in self help work\". We now related degree of involvemen t to the patients' observed survival; not simply to the number of years lived, but to the extent to which each individual, considered separately, outlived the survival predicted for them at the time they entered the study. These predictions were m ade by an expert panel, consisting of 14 oncologists at our institute who kindly inspec ted the relevant data from the charts of each patient; an average of their predictions was taken. The results were quite dramatic, and high ly significant statistically. Being strongly involved in self help work was a ssociated with living much longer. The one- third of the patients who became most involved in their self help work generally lived at least three times as long as predicted, ( and two had complete remissions of disease lasting seven years at the time of writing) , while the one-third at the low end of the \"involvement\" scale died, on average, at about the predicted time of one year. The remaining subgroup, showing an interm ediate level of involvement, lived an intermediate length of time, on average around t wice as long as predicted by the expert panel. It was not simply a question of differenc es in seriousness of disease at the start of the experiment - this was equivalent for the three subgroups. Furthermore, attendance at therapy did not differ signifi cantly between the subgroups - lack of involvement was not, therefore, a result of incapacitating illness. There were other, more sophisticated analyses of the data, wh ich you can read, if you wish, on our website: www.healingjourney.toronto.on.ca. The most probable conclusion appears to be that getting involved in helping yourself p sychologically and spirit ually prolongs life. Technically speaking, the differences in su rvival could conceivably be due to other factors, but it is very difficult to see what these might be. It is also not possible to say for sure that spirituality was cr itical, but we observed that it was very important to all in the top third, while there was very littl e such interest among the bottom third. I hope this is encouraging to cancer patients and members of their families reading this account. The experiment confirmed what my team and I had been observing for many years, and our current work with further patients is tending in the same direction, although it will not be complete for some years yet. You should know, however, that the mainstream medical research community is little moved by such an experiment. While our initial results have been published, they were rejected by the 2 prominent medical journals to which we sent them at first. To a physician or other professional who has been educ ated in the philosophy that only material means will affect physical diseases, and who has not worked with large numbers of patients interested in helping themselves, it will take mu ch more than this experiment to change his or her views. This is not unusual in science: for very many years, technical and 21statistical arguments were levelled against t he idea that smoking causes lung cancer, until the evidence became overwhelming. Much the same process will have to be gone through, I believe, with healing through mind and spirit. Meanwhile, people are getting cancer, and looking to help themselves. It is left to the individual reader to decide whether the case for physical he aling is sufficiently compelli ng at this point to provoke their interest, or whether the undisputed qualit y of life benefits that come from spiritual connecting warrant active involvement in this kind of work. 22 Chapter 2: Mind-body heali ng - the basic techniques Before we begin the practical work of trying to str engthen our spiritual connectedness, I want to recapitulate the main principles of mind-body healing. In this chapter I first provide a brief justificati on for the mind-body approach to healing, and then describe the basic techniques that we need to learn as a preliminary to our spiritual work. This introductory material has been covered in more detail in \"The Healing Journey\", and the techniques are used by many therapists, so you will also find them, or variations on them, described in books list ed in the suggested reading at the back of this one. 1. Why it is reasonable to expect th at mind can influence physical healing? Since we live in a culture that sharply separates mind and body, we need to explain how our minds affect our health. First, we all know that our behaviours are important in maintaining health, i.e. not smoking, eating wisely, getting adequate exercise and rest. I will assume that these principles are known to readers (even if there is sometimes a divergence between our awareness and our actions!). The view that the mind can affect the course of an existing illness, however, and particularly cancer, is more controversial. Let's look at why cancers develop - there are two main reasons - then at the possible influenc e of mind on their progression. The first main reason why cancers devel op is that random c hanges or mistakes occur in the DNA, the genetic material, of cells as they divide. These mutations may be provoked by external agents, like the carci nogens (cancer-producing agents) in tobacco smoke, or they may have no known cause. Certain kinds of mutation give rise to potentially cancerous cells, which may t hen divide repeatedly to yield a dangerous mass. The second reason for cancer dev eloping is inadequate control of these repeated cell divisions. All dividing cells are regulated by a series of messenger molecules in the tissues, but if this system of regulators is somehow deficient, potentially cancerous cells, which are present in everyone, are more liable to grow into clinically detectable cancers. Although this regulation is not well understood, even after decades of research (because it is so complex), there is a lot of evidence that it exists. For example, when breast or prostate tissue is examined at autopsy of people who have died from causes other than c ancer, the pathologists find small \"pre-cancerous\" lesions or nodules far more frequently than would be ex pected if all of these were inevitably going to grow into full-fledged cancers, pointing to effective control of potential cancers in most people. Our minds influence both \"causes\" of canc er. We can influence the probability of mutations by healthy behaviours - not smoki ng, choosing a healthy diet (probably one relatively low in fat and high in fibre and green vegetables, although experts are still not in full agreement), and adopting other healthy habits such as moderating our exposure to sunlight. Once we have a clinical canc er however, we can't reverse the mutations 23but may address the second reason for cancer progression, that it grows because of a failure of the body to regulate or control i t. We need to strengthen the mechanisms that regulate cell growth. How? Eventually we may know enough to do it by injection of chemical agents that make t he normal controls in the body work more efficiently. For the present, we don't know how to do this, but we do know something that will help us, which is a central idea in this course: we know that the mind, or the brai n, is the master regulator in the body . We can work with our minds to improve conditions in the body so that the cancer may find it more difficult to grow. The mind/brain has an effect on almo st everything that happens in the body, through two pathways; the nervous system and the endocrine, or hormonal system. There is an elaborate network of nerves spreading from the brain and spinal cord, that penetrates into and influences virtually all the organs in the body. And the brain, through the pituitary gland directly underneath it, and by other routes, sends chemical and nerve signals to the adrenals, the pancreas, the gonads (sex glands) the thyroid and parathyroid, the thymus, and lymph nodes, a ll small organs which in turn produce a second wave of messages and cells that carry out the \"instructions\", so to speak, of the brain. If those instructions are to pr omote harmony and balance in the body, then the nervous system and endocrine system will endeav our to carry out that plan. One particular pathway that is well documented is the effect of the mind/brain on the immune system. Mental perception of st ress can significantly diminish the power of the body to make an immune response, which in tu rn may weaken defences against certain cancers. This may all seem a bit technical. I ex plain it in more detail in \"The Healing Journey\" but you could think of it like this: cancers usually take years to develop to a size where they become detectable. When t hey are finally found, they have grown very accustomed to the chemical environment or \"soup\" that your body provides. If you are an angry person, they have grown to tolerate angry soup. If you tend to be depressed, any cancer that grows to visible size tole rates depressed soup. In order to change its rate of growth from the inside, and so help your body resist the growth of cancer, there must be changes in the soup. The direction of those changes is towards harmony, peace, relaxation, absence of undue stress and c onflict. As the mind changes in this way, it will signal the body that all is well, and the soup will return to a composition that is the best possible for healing an d restraining cancer growth. Much the same principles hold for many chronic diseases. The body has many mechanisms for maintaining its equilibrium in t he face of a multitude of challenges from outside. Think, for example, of the way our body temperature is maintained within a narrow range, in spite of wide variations in ambient conditions, or how blood pressure is held relatively constant. By consciously tr ying to live in harmony within ourselves and with our environment we provide the best internal environment for restoration of health. 2. Healing as a journey When people consider how they can assist their healing, the initial hope is often 24that some simple remedy, or perhaps a tri ck of the mind, will prov e effective. Many popular books and irresponsible therapists prom ote such simplistic \"remedies\", and this is partly why \"alternative medicine\" has gain ed a bad reputation in medical circles. In fact, self-mediated, or mind-mediated healing is a process that takes time and effort. If you think about it, how could it be otherwise? An y simple material remedies, if effective, would already be part of the regul ar treatment repertoire. While everyone is a little different, t here are common features in people's journeys, which tend to have three main stages, shown in the \"map\" in fig 2.1. The first stage we may call \"taking control\". In this phase, having acknowledged the seriousness of a threat to health (without which there is unlikely to be moti vation for change), the person learns certain basic self control strategies. These continue into the second stage, \"getting connected\", wher e the emphasis shifts towa rds understanding how one's mind works, and getting to know the old-established patterns, many of which hold us back. Then the third stage, \"finding meaning\" is about disco vering how we fit into a larger, spiritual reality. The present chapter recapitulates the methods of the first stage. The bulk of the book, however, is a combi nation of the second and third stages, understanding the psychological blocks to spiritual connection, and learning techniques for enhancing spiritual experience. 25Fig 2.1: The Healing Journey (map) 26I'll repeat here a diagram from \"The Healing Journey\" si nce it has proved so useful in helping people organise their self help efforts. It is another \"map\", this time of a person, showing that we have not only a body, but also several other dimensions. There's our conscious mind, or stream of th oughts. Then what we can call the \"deeper mind\", which includes our emotions, our ima gery and all the buried ideas and fears that may never come to our awareness, but whic h influence our actions all the same (more about all this later). Those are the first thr ee rings in the diagram. The fourth ring is \"social\", indicating that we all belong to some society of people, and couldn't exist without them - so, in a sense, we each contai n part of this social organisation. And finally, there is the existentia l or spiritual dimension. The old-fashioned view of cancer, still preval ent in some medical circles, is that it is purely a genetic accident in the body (repres ented by the small mass, A, in fig 2.2). The newer view, which takes into account the biological research that I outlined above, is that factors at all levels may contribut e to development of cancer, by affecting regulation at the tissue level. I have shown this as a kind of \" party balloon\", in fig 2.2. It presents the idea that we can intervene at all of these levels to help our bodies fight the cancer. Think of it as sticking a pin into the balloon at any level! Fig 2.2: The 5-circle diagram 27The diagram helps us see what we have to do, to organise our self help work. We need to connect with all of these dimensions or levels of ourselves. To \"connect\" means to become aware of what is happening and what needs to happen at each level, then to supply that need. As this process get s stronger we move cl oser to a state of balance or harmony. 3. The social level Let's start with this, since the ideas ar e quite familiar to most people. The important principle is: \"Communicate\" . And the first person to communicate honestly with is yourself! We begin taking control by looking honestly at our situation. Is our life under threat? Most kinds of cancer do pose a threat, alt hough it varies greatly with the site where the cancer begins and the extent to which it has grown and spread. So are we willing to acknowledge this threat, or do we prefer to say to ourselves \"t he doctor got it all; it won't come back; it won't spread further, not in my body?\" The problem with these kinds of reassuring self-statements is t hat they may prevent us from taking helpful action. It's not that we want to be living in constant f earfulness, just that we need to be authentic about what is happening. Having acknowledged to yourself what is really happening, be equally honest about how it makes you feel. It helps greatly to talk to others about this. There will be times when we are scared, or depressed; perhaps times when we feel angry. These feelings are normal, a normal reaction to an overwhelming challeng e. So please don't blame yourself for having them - and don't just bottle them up. We don't really need to protect others around us. In fact it's a lot mo re respectful of them to say how we truly feel. If you can talk to your family, do so . Make time, when nobody is rushed. Discuss what will happen if you die - many couples never do this but it needs to be brought out into the open, and you will all feel mo re comfortable, event ually, if you do. Of course with young children a somewhat different approach may be needed, but it is still helpful to be honest about what is going on, otherwise they may get all kinds of strange ideas, such as that they somehow \"caused\" your illness. Other people may find it difficult to cope with the relatively sudden changes in you that a life-threatening disease has induced; be prepared to reassure them, and tell them what you need from them. For example, it might be appropriate to say \"I know I'm less tolerant these days, because I'm worried about the cancer, but I value your company and support\". If the family refuse to hear how you feel, or insi st on being \"positive\" all the time, you may instead find a friend to whom you can talk fr eely. It's an excell ent idea to attend a support group, a small discussion group with per haps 6-10 members. It's usually better to attend one that is led by an experienced pr ofessional. However, if you live in the country, or away from such services, you might try getting a group of like-minded people together to talk. Apart from sharing with others how you f eel about the cancer, we all need the 28friendship and support of others. Seek out those people who make you feel comfortable, appreciated, and avoid others who do the revers e. It is appropriate to avoid more superficial, perhaps stressful soci al interactions, and to favour those, like heart-to-heart conversations with old fri ends, that are meaningful to you. *Communicating with other people in order to learn more about myself, share my knowledge and learn about things that interest me is important to me. Through this process, I will understand more about myself, help others with my experience and knowled ge and learn about how the wo rld really is. .... In addition I am expanding my ability to forgive myself and people around me, which is giving me the ability to communicate with and learn more about who these people really are (i.e. becoming more perceptive as the need for control goes away). The process of becoming is very exciting. I have yet to figure out what job(s) will suit me in the future, but I trust that will become clearer as I go along. 4. Body level When people think about this level they fr equently wonder first if special diets can have value for their healing. Br iefly, it is important for g eneral health to eat well (which often means some changes to our habits), but there is no evidence that the extreme diets advocated in some quarters make any di fference to an existing cancer. There is no rational reason, for example, to \"avoid all meat, dairy, sugar, processed flour, coffee and alcohol\", which is the advice that some of our patients have re ceived from various sources. In fact, there is good reason not to take these draconian measures: life can seem less worthwhile if you do, and you can be a considerable nuisance to the people around you! The problem of how to judge the value of unconventional diets or other remedies has been dealt with at length in \"The Healing Journey\". To re capitulate briefly here: we can ask three questions about any alternative remedy. First, is there evidence that it works? Not just claims - claims are easy to make - but documented evidence e.g. how many people tried it, with what kinds of c ancer, and for how many did it \"work\", i.e. cause a remission. Most important, for how many did it not work? (This we are rarely told!). Second, is there a rationale , a plausible mechanism by which this remedy could work, one that makes sense to people ab le to judge? And third, is there consensus that it works, again among people with relevant experience, and no vested interest in promoting it? Unfortunately, the \"alternative\" remedies generally fail al l 3 tests. There is one value that they may hav e; they may inspire hope. The same hope, however, can be generated by adopting rational, psychological and spiritual self-healing methods. For these there is considerable evidence of effectiveness, a rationale (for example the improvement of immune function by cont rolling stress, as I described above), and consensus among professionals who have studied these methods (which includes some, but not all, physicians). The most basic and important new techniqu e to learn at the body level is deep relaxation; not the kind of relaxation that comes from a pleasant or undemanding activity, like reading a novel, but a deliberate pr ocess of releasing tension in your main muscle groups. This produces a state of mind that most people have never 29experienced, in which the mind also becomes very quiet and peaceful. ............................................................................................................ ................... ............. Box: methods of relaxation There are various ways to relax. We start always by closing the eyes and focussing our attention closely on the breathing for a minute or two. Then we might use \"progressive muscle relaxation\", which invo lves tensing and then relaxing all the main muscle groups of the body, sequentially, so that we end up with all of them relaxed to a much greater degree than usual. Or we ma y simply \"scan through\" the body, in our imagination, slowly, noting whatever feelings of pressure, tightness, discomfort or other indications of tension we find in each region, and then \"letting that go\" or \"breathing it out\", or imagining \" relaxing energy flowing through\" the area. These techniques are best learned with the aid of a teacher/therapist or an audiotape; you can get our relaxation tapes in the package \"Helping Yo urself\" from the Canadian Cancer Society (see booklist at end). Once we have begun to relax the muscles , we can \"deepen\" the relaxation by imagining going down a flight of stairs, or better, being carried down on an escalator, relaxing further as we go. We may end up in a \"healing room\", which we furnish in our imagination, putting a big recliner chair some where within it, and we go to this chair and sink down into it, letting any remaining tensio n drain away. Or, alte rnatively, we can, following the initial muscle relaxation, take an imaginary trip to the beach (or to a garden, or chapel, or cottage, or any other place we associ ate with our own relaxation and peace of mind), then paint a det ailed mental picture of t hat place and imagine being there, as intensely as we can. The body , which does not know the difference between \"real\" and \"imaginary\", will act as if it were ther e, that is, it will relax profoundly. Again, you can find these instructions on the tapes I have mentioned; also on a lot of the relaxation tapes that are commercially available these days. ............................................................................................................ ................... ............. Learning to relax deliberat ely is the absolute bedrock technique for healing through the mind. It is immens ely valuable in itself because it gets your mind and body into a quiet state conducive to healing. Fu rthermore, we can't do much in the way of imagery or meditation without some ability to relax. So please do find yourself a tape that you like and practice daily until you bec ome reasonably proficien t. It is a good idea to have a regular time each day at which y ou practise; that may save you from the constant negotiation - will I do it now or late r? - that can otherwise lead to missing sessions and finally abandoning it altogether. Y ou'll need to explain to your family what you are doing, and make the time and space (in private) for yourself. Put the cat out, take the phone off the hook! A big reclinin g chair is perhaps the best support for learning. 30*I can let my body relax by thinking about the relaxing and letting go. I do this when I think of it - it makes my mind think about itself and I try to slow things down. If I do this often enough and long enough I generally feel quieter - I sleep better at night. The mo re you relax your body the faster your body learns to \"let go\". I can sit quietly and take a few breath s and relax while breathing out and then think about my left arm and my body relaxes. *While I'm sitting, I have changed the focus of my relaxation and meditation somewhat. I often start with a body scan, some breathing meditation (noticing thoughts, images and feelings), and then I visualize white, warm energy/light travelling thro ugh my head and into each part of my body. I feel the physical sensation of energy flowing. I give thanks to God for sending this healing energy and I imagine it flowing out and through other people I love. I think about the many signs of divine presence I have noticed each day and give thanks. If I have trouble vis ualizing this healing light and energy (some times it comes more easily than others), then I try affirmations such as \"God's warm, healing energy is flowing through my chest\", etc. There are many more sophisticated techni ques that aim to connect mind and body, that is, to bring into your mind more awareness of how your thoughts are influencing your body in subtle ways. For example, yoga and tai chi are available in most cities these days; I have had experienc e with both, and they are powerful, and can in fact take you a long way on a spiritual pat h by themselves, if intensely pursued. Chi gong (Qi gong) is said to be good also. But fo r the purpose of establishing a basis for your spiritual work, learning to relax well will be enough at first. 5. Conscious mind Getting acquainted with our thoughts: A stream of thoughts is passing through our minds most of the time, often without our being aware of most of t hem. Yet these thoughts define what we experience. For example, we may walk into the doctor's office feeling fairly well and not unhappy with life, and walk out an hour or two later, hav ing been diagnosed with cancer, feeling filled with despair and hopelessness. Nothing has changed materially, except for the thoughts in our minds. In other words, it's not usually the cancer itself, or events in general, that make us depressed, it's our thoughts about them, what we think they imply. It is fundamental to self-healing to becom e conversant with our thoughts. Most people, I have found, have surprisingly little aw areness of what they are thinking (I didn't either until I began watching my mind, about 25 years ago). Without this, we cannot change, and changes in all aspects of our lives usually start with our thinking. How can we gain this awareness? A good first exercise is simply to sit quietl y for 10 minutes or so, eyes closed, and \"watch\" your thoughts. You may feel that you have an \"observer\" in the back of your head who watches with intere st. Then at the end of this period (use a timer if it helps), write down the main ideas that you can remember passing through your mind. \"Know thyself\" said the Oracle at Delphi, over two thousand years ago, and we know ourselves, initially, by being aware of our thoughts, wh ich define who we think we 31are. So if you want to know yourself, whic h is the first step in healing through the mind, please don't skimp this little exercise. Instead do it many times, until it becomes a habit to monitor your thoughts as you go about your daily round. If y ou are one of those stern, tightly controlled types who say: \"My mind is naturally quiet; I don't notice any thoughts when I sit with my eyes closed!\", th en you are almost certainly not catching them, and need to relax a little and observe more closely. And don't worry that this practice will interfere with your actions or your spontaneity - it will in fact free you from much of the automatic behaviour that is driven by unrecognised thoughts and emotions. What do we discover when we watch our thoughts? For most people, there's a torrent of ideas, impre ssions, reactions, with the mind jumping about from one thing to another, and largely out of control. If we liken the mind to water, then in our usual state it resembles a muddy torrent, rushing down a hillside, and carrying all before it, rocks, trees, other debris. Sometimes it gets fixed in one channel, roaring on, with a \"will of its own\", and it may be very difficult to stop this, as when we worry about what might happen becaus e of disease. W ouldn't we rather have the mind like a still lake, calm, serene (at least most of the ti me)? Meditation is essentially clearing the mind, letting the mud se ttle, so to speak. When it's still we can see down into the depths; if the surface is choppy, we can't see beyond that. Furthermore, our bodies adjust to our thinking, and if we are in a state of constant (usually unpleasant) arousal, a great deal of energy is wasted, energy that we need to fight the cancer. Constant aimless thinking, even when it is not fear ful, wastes energy in this way. So the initial discovery is likely to be c hastening; the content of our minds is not very elevated! In fact it tends to be full of fears or anxieties, resentments and judgements, replaying of old grievances, compulsive planning for the future. Acknowledging this to ourselves is a good st art. What else will we find out as we monitor our thinking? It begins to dawn on us t hat thinking is a voluntary act - we don't have to think! We do not need to be slaves to our unruly minds, tyrannised by uncontrolled thoughts. It follows from this that we can ex ercise some choice in what we allow or put into our minds. Our minds functi on at the level of what we put into them. Unfortunately we are surrounded by \"junk th oughts\", in the media, in superficial interactions with others, so we need to be vi gilant if we are going to refine our own processes. Another discovery we will make is that a close bond exists between thoughts and emotions; essentially all emotions are preceded by a thought (check this out for yourself). Sometimes the transit ion to emotion is very fast, but if you are feeling afraid or angry, \"backtrack\" a bit, and you will find the ideas that led to that feeling. This is important because it gives us a powerful means of control over our emotions. Once a strong emotion has taken hold, it is very diffi cult to change, but if we catch our thinking early enough we can stop the fe eling from developing, or modify its expression. 32Managing our thoughts. We can now set down a series of steps in exercising some control over our thinking, steps that are particularly valuab le when we are faced with serious disease, and when our thoughts tend to become exaggerat ed or irrational. An example, familiar to most people with cancer, is that ever y little ache or pain means \"my cancer is spreading!\" First step : find out and acknowledge to y ourself what you are thinking. Second step : acknowledge what you are feeling and determine how it is related to your thoughts. Third step : express the emotion appropriately. If we are very depressed or angry, we need to express this in some wa y, as in the old sayings \"letting off steam\" or \"getting something off our chest\" . The best way is usually to talk to someone else. Other ways to \"let out\" emot ions are: writing in a journal; going for a long walk or taking other exercise, while consciously \"letting it go\"; using music to match and express your mood; bash ing a pillow with a bat or racquet to let out anger, driving with the windows of the car up so that you can yell or scream (one of the few plac es where we can do this!). Fourth step : changing the thoughts. This will usually mean substituting a more \"positive\" or optimistic or life-affirm ing idea for the old depressing one. For example, if a thought that keeps going r ound and round in the head is: \"I've got cancer and I'm going to die\", you mi ght, having acknowledged it and allowed yourself to experience and \"let out\" some of the fear, substitute: \"today I am well, and I am going to enjoy every minute of th is day\"; or: \"I am doing everything I know to oppose this cancer\"; or \"this discomfort means my body is fighting the cancer; I am optimistic and strong\". You will probably find that you need to do this whole process many times, to \"fight it out\" with your own thoughts. It is hard work, but it does work. If you think y ou can't do it, consider the focus you are able to bring to bear in other areas of y our life, for example on a hobby or a sport, or recall your first romantic love inte rest - was concentration a problem there? *I've observed the connection between the thoughts I've been having and the emotions I feel. I try to sit with the feelings, noticing how they affect my body, having faith that they will pass. I imagine a healing light around me, that I can breathe into my body . Painting helps me to relax, and to get out of my obsessive anxiety thoughts. Daily prayers where I focu s on things that I am thankful for and feelings of love for friends and family are helpful. Crying seems to help relieve the stressful feelings, so I can do some of the other things listed above. But each day I do my prayers, meditation and visualization, and it restores my hope. During these times I sometimes find it very hard to sit with feelings of sadness, discouragement, etc. When this happens I try to tell myself that it will pa ss - and eventually it does. *For the last few months, I have had sporadic pain in the left side of my back (rib area). Over the last 2 weeks, the pain has become quite regular, i.e. daily. This, of course, makes me think that the cancer has spread to this area. I know that cancer patients often react to any new pain, discomfort or 33change in their body as a sign that the cancer has spread..... I asked my self, \"if this were true, what would it mean to me?\" This exercise was useful. It helped me to be aware that my underlining concern is going back into more treatment. Being aware that this was the worst of my fears, I was less tense and anxious when I thought about the pain. I (also) became keenly aware of how readily I have an internal monologue about the appearance of others. I was constantly criti quing others clothes, body shapes, ac tions and speech. I thought a great deal about how easily I \"label\" people. I don't even know them, but I am ready to place a label on them based on my immediate reaction to what I see or hea r and my preconceived notion as to what that means to me. 34After a while, I was able to consider the endless body shapes that God has created, the beauty of so many people and the fact that a number of people no doubt had negat ive thoughts about my appearance. If I am happy with my appearance, I am su re that most of the people I internalized about are quite happy with both their choice of clothes and thei r bodies. I observed others differently, instead of grabbing on to what I perceived as the slightest we akness or flaw in someone and generalizing it as a character trait or bad choice on their part. I learned that hesitating and delaying judgement was better than rapid judgement . There is plenty of scientific evidence for the value of such thought changing, which is now widely used as a therapy for depre ssion. It is importan t, however, not to expect magical effects. For example, just telling yourself that \"the cancer will be gone tomorrow\" will lead only to disillusionment. Your deliberate thoughts should be realistic - e.g. \"my defense system is attacking my cancer\"; they should also be simple, and direct, without negatives, e.g. if you say to y ourself: \"I will not succumb to the cancer\", your deeper mind might miss the \"not\"! People label some thoughts as negative and others as positive. It's not really an accurate description; unpleasant and pleasant would usually be what is meant. There are no negative thoughts, just thoughts - the whole range of ideas and emotions are equally part of who we are. It has been said that \"the only bad emotion is a stuck emotion\", the point being not to become fixed in any one emotional state, but to let the feelings \"flow through you\", so to speak, t hen to dissipate, leaving space for the next set. It is important not to think that havi ng occasional negative (pessimistic) thoughts is somehow a failure, or dangerous to our health. Rather, it is our habitual thinking patterns that matter. Allowi ng constant anxious or depressing thoughts to take over our minds is going to produce a corresponding mood, and have an effect on our bodies. Note also that simply avoiding anxiety-pr oducing thoughts, without first acknowledging them and dealing with them in the way I've described is not a helpful strategy in the long run. The thoughts and emoti ons then stay in your mind, and may break out in other ways later. We need to face what we are th inking and experiencing, and to tolerate the initial discomfort of doing so, if we are to make significant change. 6. Deeper Mind Emotional management The\"deeper mind\" is a non-technical term, intended to include our emotions, our imagery, our dreams, and those ideas and impulses that we are not aware of, but which influence much of our normal conscious life. As we have seen, our thoughts affect our emotions, and thus every part of our liv es; the conscious and deeper mind levels overlap here. We have talked a bit about t he great importance of sharing our emotions with people who are prepared to listen. This moves the em otion out of the deeper mind, into conscious awareness, and eventually \"di scharges\" at least some of it. That's a metaphor of course, but it is how it feels. Everything we do in our Healing Journey affects mood: our imagery, wh ich we will come to in a moment, our awareness of the impulses that drive us, our spir itual connectedness. It would be fair to say that mood, or 35emotional state, is one bar ometer indicating the degree of balance or harmony in our lives. The aim of the journey is to reach a state of fairly constant, calm joyfulness, which can only happen when we are not tossed around by uncontrolled thoughts and desires. Mental imaging There are two main pathways by which our mind controls the reaction of our bodies to the environment. The first is th rough thoughts, the second via imagery. The diagram (fig 2.3) shows this. The two are connected - thoughts and emotions inspire images, and vice versa. Imagery is really a language, and a much more primitive one than words. Our ancestors must have relied on it almost exclusivel y during most of the evolution of our species, so we will not be su rprised to find that it has in some ways much more power over the body than words do. In learning to focus our imagery we are not simply acquiring some kind of mental trick or technique, but rather taking some control over this parallel l anguage, one which our mind uses constantly to communicate internally, and with the body. Fig 2.3: pathways of thoughts and images 36Images are representations, in the mind, of what we perceive with our senses. They are formed as we experience the world around us, but they may also be summoned up from our memory, or made up fr om fragments of earlier experience. Usually when we speak of imagery we mean \"p ictures\" in the mind, that is, visual imagery, but we can have images in any of our sensory modes; fo r example, you will find you can imagine a tune, or the sound of a distant bell (aud itory imagery), or a touch, smell or taste. Anything asso ciated with \"imagination\" is suspect in our culture, so you may be reassured to know that images are the product of \"real\" physical events in our brains - nerve cells passing electrical cu rrents and specific chemicals from one to another. It is also helpful to recognise that imagery is not something exotic; we use it all the time. Imagine, for a moment, that y ou plan to do some task around the house; if you watch your mind closely, you will detect, flashing through it, a series of images of what you need to do to accomplish the task. Deliberate use of mental imagery The language of mental imagery has multiple uses, which fall into 2 broad categories: \"diagnostic\" and \"therapeutic\". T he former means learning more about what is going on in your mind through examining your imagery. For example, if you imagine, and then draw, the effect you think your cancer is having on your body, these drawings may tell you quite a lot about your deeper thought s and fears. You may be able to see something new in them yourself, or you ma y need the help of a professional to interpret them. The second broad use of imagery is in trying to make changes in one's mood, or in the body (often both together). For exam ple, relaxation of body and mind may be aided by imaging oneself at the beach. Nausea and pain may sometimes be alleviated by imagining peaceful surroundings, or by using symbols; for example, the nausea might be seen as a choppy sea, rendered calm through imagery, or pain seen as a weight, a blade, a fire, being lessened by im agining other symbols that would counteract the pain-inducing ones. Then there are inst ances where imagery has been used to alter body functions in less obvious ways. For example, scientists researching hypnosis have found that certain ski n conditions, in some people, respond to the subject imagining a return to normality; warts, which are tumours caused by a virus, are a case in point. The imagination, primed by suggesti on, can do all kinds of things to the body, again in some people more than others, e.g. it can cause analgesia (insensitivity to pain) in specific areas, or paralysis of parts of the body, or weals on the skin, even bleeding. In some cultures, anthropologis ts have noted that w hen the medicine man puts a hex or curse on a member of the tribe, that person may die suddenly - a dramatic example of the power of mind over body! W hat these observations tell us is that the mind has potentially considerable powers to influence the body. This does not mean that we can all do these things routinely, but it suggests that there is a great deal of room to learn to use our own minds therapeutically. 37 ............................................................................................................ ................... ............. Box: Using imagery as a way of \"fighting\" the cancer. Plan a regular daily or twice-daily practice of relaxation and imagery. Sitting in a comfortable reclining chair, with the eyes closed, take yourself through a relaxation, using a tape if it helps. Then bring in the imagery component. Y ou will probably need a tape for this also. One of our tapes in \"Helping Yourself \", the workbook and audiotape set put out by the Canadian Canc er Society, has a combined relaxation/imagery on it. The tape asks you first to imagine that, with y our mind, you can call up a vast army of lymphocytes, the small white cells that help k ill many kinds of cancer cells. See them attaching to the cancer cells and destr oying them. Then see the macrophages, big scavenger cells, coming along after the battle, and mopping up the bits of broken down cell, for re-cycling. If you are getting c hemotherapy or radiatio n therapy, see the chemicals or the radiation des troying many cancer cells, and \"softening up\" others, for easier destruction by the body's defenses. Or you can use more symbolic imagery, visualising the cancer as, fo r example, bits of meat, and your defensive system as dogs eating up the meat, or the cancer as small crustaceans and the defenses as fish, swimming around and swallowing them. If you prefer less aggressive imagery, you might instead see your body as a garden and y our mind as the gardener, removing the cancer weeds, and leaving intact the healthy plant cells. There is no limit to the images you can devise. They need to feel powerful and believable to you, however. So match t he defence symbols to the cancer symbols, and make sure the defences can prevail over t heir targets. I would suggest doing some reading about imagery also. Jeanne Achterberg's books are valuable, as is the Simontons' and that by Martin Rossman. There are others in the reading list. ............................................................................................................ ................... ............. Imagery is also a powerful way to improv e our relations with others. In our classes we do a \"resentments\" exercise (chapter 5), which basically involves imagining a resented person, looking closely at them, and trying to s ee behind the resented features and behaviours to the needy indivi dual underneath. We then can imagine surrounding them in light, or giving them a hug. Similar techniques can be used to strengthen our relationship to religious figures , as we will see in later chapters: we can, for example, imagine talking to or being hel d by Jesus, Mary, t he Buddha, or other figures that have symbolic meaning to us. *The image that I like to think about is that of me being filled with The light . I call this my healing light. My body becomes filled with light and al ong with the light comes peace, love happiness and serenity. But the best part about the light is that it has the ability to melt away the deadly cancer cells, which are excreted through my pores and orifices. I do this imagery laying down with my hands above my head being totally open to the light. I find that when I slowly start bringing the light into my body from the top of my head, it brings a real sense of calmness to me. I think that this imagery also helps me to 38further relax my body completely. 7. Summary This chapter has been a brief review of the major self regulation strategies: learning to relax body and mind, becoming acquainted with the stream of thoughts and beginning to modify them, and starting the proc ess of deliberate use of the language of imagery. The principles, as you can see, are simple enough; havin g the self discipline to practise them, and to make changes, is a ma tter for individual resolve. It may assist your motivation to think of this work as cont ributing to your personal growth or evolution, over and above any physical healing effect it may have. Nobody wants to be thinking about cancer all the time, as some of our patients put it, so think about it instead as focussing on healing - a much more attracti ve idea. Once you have worked on these basics for a while, you will be ready to begin t he more spiritually oriented work that forms the body of this book. We will meet the basic tec hniques repeatedly, and in more advanced form, as we pursue our main task of becoming more spiritually connected. 39 Part II: The spiritual self-healing work 40 Chapter 3: Ideas of the Divine. Meditation We now come to the main focus of the book: working actively to promote our own spiritual connection. The next nine chapters are arranged in a form suitable for a self- study course, working at your own pace. In our classes we do a chapter a week. Each begins with a brief discussion of the central ideas of the chapter, followed by illustrative quotes from written assignm ents done at home by our pati ents. Then there are a number of exercises to do, ex ercises that inspired the re sponses from patients. The process of personal spiritual work. It is a challenging process to change old habits of thought and behaviour; if you have done psychological work like that descri bed in chapter 2, you will have learned the truth of this for yourself. The same applies to making spiritual changes. It is easy and pleasant just to read about spirituality, but much more is gained when we become actively involved in doing relevant exercises, like meditation or the introspective projects we describe here. We have al so found, from twenty years' experience in helping people in this way, that the impact of the work is greatly enhanced by writing about whatever you discover. This crystallises and conc retises your experiences and insights, and makes them available for futu re revision and for building upon. Then it can be kept as part of a journal, recording your progress. Don't worry if you are not accustomed to writing: just jot down ideas and findi ngs in point form if you prefer. At the end of each of the next nine chapt ers you will find a number of questions to reflect upon, and various exercises to try, notably meditative and imagery techniques. For example, in chapter 4 we suggest y ou think about other people whom you resent, listing their \"bad\" qualities. This is obvious ly not an academic exercise; the point is to apply it honestly to your own life. Like much of this work, the process can be uncomfortable - in fact if you don't ex perience discomfort, you are probably not accessing the relevant thoughts and feelings! Yet even a little progress in such a venture can make a huge difference to your lif e. In this exampl e, becoming aware of our constant judgementalism, unwelcome though this insight may be, can lead us to much greater acceptance of others, and hence to more peace and happiness within ourselves and in our relationships. As you reflect on the ideas, let any awareness \"sink down into your body\" - you may be able to feel a subtle \"shift\" in your physical state as the truth of some new idea becomes evident to you, a kind of \"Ah-ha\" sensation. We have all had such revelations from time to time, as, for exampl e, when we suddenly realise why we acted in a certain way that later seemed out of character. This work is easier if you belong to a group of fellow students, with a more experienced person as leader if possible, although many people find they can do it alone. If you are a professional conducting a class based on this book, then it is of course important to do the exercises yourse lf before assigning them to others; to be authentic in this work we must pr actise what we teach (preach!) 41The present chapter invites you to consider what you really think about \"God\" or the Divine, then introduces meditation. As we have discussed, the basic idea behind connecting spiritually is simple enough. Our true self, it is said, is part of an immortal, self-transcending Divine Mind or God, but this becomes obscu red by the \"ego\" or small self, a collection of impressions and opinions that thinks of itself as separate and all- important. We need to shift fo cus (to get an overview of p sychospiritual healing you can look ahead to chapter 12, and in particular at fig 12.1). When we begin to explore the aspects of ourselves that hi nder connection with our deeper spirit ual self, the first barrier that we encounter may be doubt, or disbelief that anything more than ourselves really exists. Sceptics raise arguments like: \"If there is a God, why is there evil in the World?\" (meaning why aren't things the way I would like?). So let's begin by seeing what evidence we can muster that t here is a God/transcendent order, or at least that there is more to \"reality\" than we normally thin k, leaving room for a divine presence. (1) Unexamined ideas: Most peoples' ideas about \"God\" are hazy, and not examined. Few any longer may imagine an old gentle man with a white beard up in the sky somewhere! But you may think that if God exists, He (or She? or It?) is some kind of super-parent, some agent who examines our thoughts and rewards or punishes accordingly. When you look at such be liefs squarely, it appears that they are extensions of our childhood views of our par ents - whom we saw as powerful, large figures. You would probably agree that God is not likely to be a material entity, in the sense of being humanoid. When the Bible says we are created in God's image, it presumably is referring to mind or spirit within us. Reflect on this question as you do exercise 1 below; it helps to have some clarity about what you think God is not, at least. Or you may believe that there is no such thing. If so, ask yourself, how do you know? Is the atheistic position any more rational or scientific than theistic beliefs? Or you may return a verdict of \"not proven\". (2) Our own experience: This is ultimately the most convincing kind of evidence. The work of this course aims to help you make your own \"contact\" with a transcendent or divine dimension. As we proceed you ma y have experiences that can't be rationally explained, e.g. unexpected and highly unlikel y events happening to su pport you, strong feelings of being loved and cared for, even \"co mmunications\", verbal or intuitive, from unknown sources. (3) Ideas and evidence about the nat ure of material reality: Meanwhile, (i.e. while waiting for our own experience! ), let's examine just how ce rtain our conventional views of \"reality\" are. The world is just as we see it, solid, org anised into clumps of matter, obeying the laws of thermodynamics. Right? Wrong! (a) Modern Physics tells us that matter is mostly space. The laws of thermodynamics are not universally valid. Space and time are not absolutes, but 42depend on conditions of observation. At t he atomic level, matter turns out to have various peculiar properties; for example, it is not possible to determine simultaneously the position and velocity of an electron. Changes in a particle can induce similar changes in an associat ed but distant one at exactly the same time (violating our ideas about cause and e ffect). The act of observing changes what is observed (as it does also at the psychological level). (b) Philosophers east and west have pointed out that what we think we perceive depends on the nature of our sense organs and brains, that is on our biological make-up, on our training, on our curr ent state of mind, and a host of other factors. The view that the world is just as we see it has long been shown to be untenable (\"naive realism\"). Our world is ve ry different from that of a bee or a squirrel. People from diffe rent cultures see things differently; an extreme case would be the occasional child raised with wolves or other animals, whose world comes to take on many of the characteri stics of the species he was nurtured by. Who is to say that \"our\" current world view is the correct one! (c) Paranormal phenomena: although many scientists scoff (usually because of ignorance), there is now good evidence that the mind c an interact with matter in ways that can not be explained by conventional science. For example, mental intention alone can influence some physica l events (such as the generation of random numbers by machines), and \"distant viewing\" is possible, namely getting an impression of a distant site that someone else is looking at (these experiments are well documented in \"Marg ins of Reality\" by R. Jahn and B. Dunne). There are many reports of \" out-of-body\" and \"near death\" experiences; no doubt there can be deception and mistak en interpretations, but I have spoken to a number of sincere people, including peo ple with cancer in our courses, who have had such experiences. My own perso nal experience includes precognitive episodes, or knowing what would happen in a few minutes to a few hours' time. These can be just as \"real\" as conventional perceptions, and seem to show that the arrow of time is not inescapably linear and forward moving. In other words, as many have known over m illenia, the world is much stranger than we think, which seems to pave the way for acceptance of realities other than the usual materialistic conception. (d) Back in the early eighties there was a very interesting experiment done, much advertised by New Age writers, in which people who had recently had a heart attack recovered with fewer incidents if they were prayed for by others outside the hospital. The patients did not even know they were being prayed for, and those doing the praying did not personally know the patients and had very few details about them. This experiment has recently been repeated (with a few variations), and with a similar result. Bo th trials were done according to the standards of good technical design. T hey appear to say that a non-material intervention, prayer, can affect a physical disease ( ther e are also published studies that failed to find such an effect). Other recent studies, for example with people with HIV/AIDS, point in the same direction. And there are even more surprising studies on the effects of \" hands-on\" healing of people, animals and 43plants. A champion of this cause of \"non-local\" healing is Larry Dossey, a medical doctor who has written a number of good, easily readable books on the subject. (4) The writings of the mystics: (ie people who have had direct experience of a larger reality or God). We have r eadily available to us, in the West, published accounts from all of the great spiritual traditions. The impressive fact is the commonality of experiences related by numerous individuals fr om widely differing cultures at different points in time. These people are not \"cranks\" or simpletons, but are highly intelligent and have often been very influential. The best way to appreciate this is to read, first, an exposition or anthology of spiritual phenome na. A well-known one is Aldous Huxley's Another, among many, is F.C.Happold's \"Mysticism\". Happold says (I'm paraphrasing) that mystical experience has manifested in similar forms in all parts of the world, giving rise to the expression \"the Perennial Philosophy\" (a term coined by Spinoza), for which he lists the following common features: the world of matter and individual con sciousness is only a partial reality and is the manifestation of a Divine Ground or G od in which all partial realities have their being. man can know this Divine Ground by dire ct intuition, which is superior to discursive reasoning. although we are chiefly conscious of t he separate ego, we can identify with the spark of our divinity within, that is, with that eternal aspect of ourselves which is part of the Divine Ground. it is the chief end of our earthly exist ence to discover this eternal self (p 20). 44 WHAT OUR PATIENTS HAVE WRITTEN *To me God is not an old gentleman with a white beard up in the sky somewhere. He is not like a parent or powerful figure that makes bad things ha ppen. He has no human characteristics; he is not material, he is not even a \"he\". I say \"he\" out of habit. I tried to change what I say to \"it\" or \"she\", but I decided that it really does not matter. \"He\" comes natura lly to me when referring to God so \"he\" it is. In my visualization, I sometimes see a face of a Christ-like being, but I never see a vision of God. *For most of my adult life I've pondered the questi on over and over of whether or not God exists, and what is the nature of this God. I have hoped for some kind of sign, in a personal experience, that would enable me to \"know\" with certainty, that God exists. This need for \"proof\", or at least what my mind considered to be proof, made it difficult for me to accept the idea of a greater spiritual being, in my heart (because I relied on a concrete experiential proof, which didn't appear). I think I have been trying to control how God/Spirit should manifest to me, instead of looking at what already exists in my life and seeing God within that. I've wanted to see a sign so that I can have faith, believing that faith isn't possible without this concrete belief. With the help of the people in my life, the readings I've done, and my own intense motivation, I've started to come out of the box that was holding me back. At some point I started to get a strong feeling of \"knowing\" that I had to forget about this idea of fi nding proof, before committing to belief, and instead to allow myself to feel the faith that I now think exists, in some way, in everyone. *I have also felt God around me..... He sits now, calmly, quietly and I believe that is God inside of me and that's the first time I ever thought of God as being a part of me rather than a separate thing. *My views on the possible existence of a higher powe r is more than a belief system with me - it's a knowing and very difficult to communicate on paper. The feeling of joy that I awaken with each morning; the feeling of being guided even in the most difficult situations - that I am being looked after. When I'm in pain, prayers lessen the pain. I thin k of God as energy, existing everywhere and in everything, encompassing and enveloping all (sparks of energy) and that each and everyone of us is a spark of that whole. For me that spark can nev er by extinguished and I have had some of the most beautiful connections with loved ones that have passed from this existence. These experiences I have had are real and, again, have made me feel protected and guided. *I'm taking this course....because I have cancer, but the cancer has only been the catalyst. The need existed previously. I am seeking peace in daily living, acceptance in da ily living, and a connection to the Divine Power in daily living. If I can find that, then my death and dying, whenever it comes, will be less a cause for anguish, but that w ill be a by-product, not the goal itself. *What I think God is not is a vengeful and judgmental force ready to punish the individual for his or her sins. The Jewish High Holidays are coming up and that includes Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. On this day Jews fast and attend synagogue to pray that their lives w ill be written in the Book of Life for another year. I remember that as a child I always felt guilty on this day although I never knew what for. As I got older I stopped attending synagogue on that day. I rejected a God who had to be bartered with for another year of life. This was a force to be frightened of, reminding you that you were but a speck of dust, a sinner who had to plead for forg iveness. For many years I held this image of God in my head and abandoned all religious practice. These images represent what God is not. 45*I \"know\" a higher power exists. This knowle dge is in the core of my being and seems to have always been there. I have never tried to intellectually analyze this feeling as it is beyond words - it seems to me that although the mind is a powerful tool for our use it can be also \"the slayer of the Real\". I have tried to use my mind and intuition to develop discernm ent. Of course, another reason that I do not use rational analysis in my definition of the Divine is that my modus operandi is through feeling and experience. I can use the rational mind for doing In come Tax, balancing my bank account, having some opinions on various and sundry curr ent events etc. etc. but find THE BIG PICTURE is beyond my powers of definition! 46 EXERCISES 1. Your views: (a) Write an account of your current view s on the possible existence of some higher power, order, intelligence, or God. (b) What would you regard as evidence? W hat would it take to convince you? (c) What kinds of doubts or resistance do you have? E.g.: \"I haven't seen anything that couldn't be rationally explained; I would feel that I was betraying my s ense of honesty if I considered something that was beyond my experience; I can't turn around now, a fter many years of not going to church and being an agnostic, and say that I hope there is something more; \"Religion is for wimps\". Or perhaps you have had experiences that convinced you of the existence of a higher power? If so, write about them. 2. What is the Divine like? If you believe, or are prepared to consider, that a Divine Power, Order, Intelligence or Being exists: What might this be like (assuming for a moment that He/She/It exists)? What is God not like? What is your relationship to this power - how do you fit into the picture? What would convince you of t he existence of such a Power? What would convince you that it does not exist? 3. Reading: Choose and obtain at least 2 books written by people who have demonstrated a high degree of spiritual development in their lives and writings. Examples St Teresa of Avila, Saint Augustine Buddhism: The Dhammapada, A 47and there are of course many othe rs available. It is important to go to original sources, and not be satisfied solely with books by popularisers who write about spirituality, but may not have done a lot of spiritual work themselves. Begin r eading at least one of these books and write about what you read. It would be most helpful to continue this reading at least for the next several months. 4. Your expectations and goals from this work: (a) What do you expect to \"get\" from r eading this book and doing these exercises? (b) What are your goals from your spiritual journey? What do you hope to achieve, after working through these chapters, and eventually ? (You can revisit these questions after completing chapter 11, and compare what you experience then from your present experience). Mind watching: Mind watching means finding out what you ar e telling yourself; as pointed out in chapter 2, there's a stream of thoughts going through most peoples' minds almost all the time. Often, much of this thought stream is unrec ognised, but it nevertheless controls our mood and our behaviours. So o ne of the very first and most important tasks of self healing is to get to know what you are thinking. Sit in a quiet place, and for about 10 minut es just observe the thoughts that pass through your mind. Then note down as much of this as you can remember (you won't get it all, but that doesn't matter; the main thi ng is to start to monito r this flow). This exercise can be done as often as you like, but do it at least 3 times and write about what you learn. Meditation: The Nature and Effects of Meditation At this point we will introduce the centrally important process of meditation. I include here instruction in tec hnique and remarks about its value. Meditation has been known for thousands of years in many cultures and is now taught widely in the West. While it is often associated with religious faiths, there is no necessary connection. Neither is it some thing occult or paranormal, although its practice may lead to an expanded view of reality. What is it then? Perhaps the simplest way to describe meditation is to say that it's like listening rather than talking. Another way is to say that the meditative state is an awareness based on concentration, in the relative absence of thought. Terminology va ries, but these defin itions express the essence of the process. Why is it valuable to meditate? You will probably have discovered for yourself how restless the mind is, how it races around from one idea to another. In a sense we 48are constantly constructing our own little wo rlds, telling ourselves, for example, that certain experiences are going to be difficu lt or unpleasant, that someone we know always behaves badly, that we are tired or getting a headache, and so on. We become locked into a few restricted ways of looking at things. Meditation provides us with an opportunity simply to be quiet for a while, to sense our world and our place in it without these prejudgements, and can t hus open doors to radical changes in our attitudes (thought patterns). In terms of the \"connectedness\" we have discussed earlier, meditation removes some of the blocks put up by the mind that prevent us from fully experiencing the higher, trans personal levels of ourselves (social, natural world, spiritual). It is like deep relaxation but diffe rs from this or from sleep in that the mind remains alert; in fact, the m editative state of consciousne ss is different from anything most of us have previously experienced. Good books to read about the subject are Leshan's How to Meditate and Easwaran's Meditation (see reading list). What does it do for health? At the mo st obvious level, meditation brings relaxation, inducing a state with characteristic brain-wave patte rns. It has proved useful in diminishing anxiety, addictive behaviour, asthma, and hypertension. More generally, it promotes a sense of harmony and inte raction that probably reflects an underlying sense of balance in the nervous and hormonal systems; invoking this balance repeatedly may help to control any disease, including cancer, where regulation is disordered. An Australian psychiatrist, Dr. A. Meares, taught prolonged (2 hours), deep, daily meditation as therapy for cancer patients, and reported that of 73 people with advanced disease, 5 showed complete remission, 5 had marked slowing of the cancer growth, and a much larger portion achieved im proved quality of life and significant relief of suffering. This was a clinical study wit h no control group (not meditating) but the results are most encouraging. An exercise in focussed meditation There are many methods of meditation; one of the simplest is to use a focus, allowing one thing to take the place of m any, scattered thoughts. This focus can be an image, the breathing, a prayer, a series of movements, or a simple word or sound, chanted aloud or repeatedly silently. The work of meditation, and it is work, consists of repeatedly coming back to this focus, pushing other thoughts aside. This has been described as a passive effort, an attempt to prevent the usual random thinking. To begin, sit with the back straight, either on a chair or, if you are supple enough, cross-legged on a thick pillow on the floor. Have the eyes closed, hands resting with palms up on thighs or knees. Drowsiness is more easily avoided if you are not too comfortable. Here are three kinds of focussed meditation: I Breathing : Count \"one\" on the first breath (in and out), \"two\" (breathe in and out), \"three\" (in and out), up to 10 and then start again at \"one\". if your mind strays from the counting, br ing it gently but firmly back again to 49the breathing. II Word Repetition : This is also known as the \"mantra\" technique. Select a word which has no distracting associations. \"Food\" would be quite unsuitable! Try \"Ra-ma\" (one of the names of God which is a popular Indian mantra, used by Gandhi), or \"Ah-nam\" (a meaningless word) and repeat it at intervals of a second or two, bringing the mind back whenever the thoughts stray. III Imagery Technique : Imagine yourself sitting qui etly at the bottom of a clear lake, absolutely still. Every ti me a thought comes into your head, watch the bubble of air escape and move up to the surface. There are big bubbles for large distractions and sm all bubbles for minor ones that you \"nip off\" before they take your mind away from the exercise. After a couple of days trying each techni que for 5 minutes or so, select the one you like best, and practise it for 15-20 minut es daily. Most people find the mantra easiest. It can help at first to use a timer, pr eset to give a quiet signal at the end of your meditation. It is interesting to compare notes with others on your experiences. Did you notice any change in quality of y our mental state as time pa ssed or at the end? Almost all of us, when we begin to meditate, and ev en after doing it for years, come up against our mind's tendency to wander (if this s eems like an insurmountabl e problem, try the thought-stopping ideas listed in chapter 5). The patients at our classes are often encouraged (and sometimes diverted) to hear that although I have been meditating daily for over 20 years, I still often have to struggle to quieten my mind! Selecting a Mantra The mantra (or mantram) has been called \"protector of the mind\", i.e., a focus providing respite from the constant unproductive and often harmful rumination in which we all indulge. Different cu ltures and traditions have fav oured different mantras; for example: Christian : \"Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on me\" (or just \"Jesus\" or \"Jesu\"). \"Be still and know that I Jewish : \"Shalom\" just a few of many possibilitie s. Mantras may be longer than this, but they are often simply names fo r the Divine. They may be a form of prayer. It makes sense to use a spiritually symbolic word or phrase, and one that has been used by many others for centuries: the words are said to attract an energy or special significance. However, if you are a determined agnostic, use a neutral sound. Relationship of Meditati on to Other Techniques You may notice great similarities between the state of mind you get into when you do various things: for example, the differ ent kinds of meditation, relaxation, mental imagery, and chanting. Those who practice prayer or contemplation may notice that these also bring about a similar state of cons ciousness. It is important not to get hung up on what is \"really meditation\" and what may be something else. They are all related, all beneficial. The point is to start your ow n exploration of your \"inner space\", and you will come to know what works best for you. Not everyone can meditate in the way we have described in this chapter, so if you find, after a thorough trial, th at it's not for you, return to an approach like deep relaxation or imagery, and don't worry! It is important, however, to practice some kind of mental quieting and looking within. Meditation as an active process In the West we frown upon apparent idl eness and habitually pursue various goals with an obsessive, even frantic, busyness. For this reason, many people are initially uncomfortable with meditation, which seems like \"doing nothing\". Yet most of us spend many unproductive hours each week, for exampl e, with the media. Meditation, despite outward appearances, is an intensely active process which has been likened to the exploration of \"inner space\"; it is a r oute to expand awareness of oneself and one's relationship to the world. The regular withdrawal from others for a time is often rewarded by greatly improving relationships with them during the rest of the day. Another \"hang-up\" of our culture is t he need to be assured that we are doing things right. The value of meditation lies in th e process itself; if you do this, bringing the mind back constantly to a quiet focus, then there is no right or wrong end result, and indeed there should be no particular expectations of outcome. It's worthwhile even if it doesn't seem 51to go well. Having said this, it must be adm itted that there are day s when quietening the mind is impossible, often, unfortunately, when we are most di stressed. Regular practice will diminish the frequency of these occasions. Practising meditation regularly In each of the following four chapters I will describe another kind of meditation, which I 20 - 30 minutes. At the end of t hese five sessions, which ideally would be spread over five weeks or more, you will be able to pick one approach for continuing practice. If you already have an established practice of meditation you may want to explore new methods, or you may wish to c ontinue with a method that works for you. Patients' comments on meditation: *\"Om Mani Padme Hum\" is the Mantra that I use. I like the meaning of \"the jewel is in the lotus\" or that the Buddha is within us all and that this M antra is used to generate loving kindness and to open one's heart. I have a tape of a chant of this Mantra an d use that as an aid to meditation. From time to time I also say the Mantra during the day while driving the car, walking, doing the dishes, etc. etc. Another favourite of mine is the Jesus prayer ' \"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me a sinner.\" I feel peaceful and tranquil during meditation and find that the repetition of the Mantra helps to calm the endless chatter of the mind. *This week has been one of further discovery for me as I find it much easier to go right into my meditation and can actually use the calming impact of the meditation instantly if I need it during my every day activities. My example of this was when I receiv ed my CEA results last week, only to find the levels elevated 50%, which indicates that the cancer has de veloped a resistance to the chemo we are currently using. My immediate response was that \"cold\" feeling running throughout my entire body. However, within a matter of a couple of minutes I was totally calm and relaxed and ready to investigate the next step of the medical process. I was able to leav e behind the fear and sens e of being discouraged, and replaced it with the calmness Again a feeling of being full and totally content seems to be the controlling emotion within. Perhaps this is due to the intensity of my meditati ons and the surrender to the Divine Power just knowing that all will be as it should be and will unfold to me as I need to know. *My meditations have undergone some changes. I have begun to wake up at about 4:00 am. I decided that since I was awake I'd use this for meditation. As it turns out I've found this to be a great time for me. I seem to be able to still my mind easier and I seem to reach that place of inner peace easier and stay there longer. Also, when I do a healing meditation at this time I experience it differently. It 'feels' much more physical in that I actually seem to ex perience it on a physical level as well as spiritual. * Repeating mantra is taking me d eeper into the silence. I experience visions, peace and harmony. Unaware of time but intuitively know when to come back. Sometimes I drift into the void and cannot recall my experiences. Unaware of the physical. It is as if I am divinely supported in my chair as 52my mind travels into the velv et blackness of the Void. 53 Chapter 4: Judging Words can be misleading, so we need to be clear what is meant by \"judging\" others; here it refers to any kind of crit icism, resenting, blaming, running down, attributing our problems to or adverse comment about them, that has an emotional \"charge\" attached . We are not talking about the kind of dispassion ate judgement or discrimination that often has to be made in lif e: (\"She would be better at that job than he would\"). We are concerned with judgement in the form of resentment, a thought, accompanied by feeling, that so-and-so is not doing what they ought to be doing, and usually, they are inconveniencing us! This kind of judgement, to the detriment of others, absolutely permeates the mental life of most people (we will ask you to te st this for yourself in the \"Exercises\"). The following is a quote fr om the written homework of one of our students: \"When I really scrutinise my reactions to others closely I realise how many thoughts I have that are judgemental of others - often barely noticeable to myself. I have recently been noticing my defensive reactions more, and how defensiveness involves some judgement of the other person (i.e. I am right, so therefore you must be wrong in your statements about me .....). I'm practising being able to hear critical comments from others as just statem ents about their thoughts and feelings, without attaching blame (i.e. reacting as if I'm being attacked or blamed, or blaming them in response).\" Judgement is perhaps most often of other people, but it is frequently applied to situations also: (\"The blasted computer is dow n again\"! \" This is not part of my job\"!). Often, when it appears to be directed at a si tuation, there is a blameworthy person lurking behind it, as in the last example. What's wrong with this kind of mental behav iour? After all, there can be a sense of relief at blaming someone else for discomf ort or inconvenience or threat. And often this seems justified, as w hen a dangerous driver imperils our safety, or a family member or colleague doesn't seem to pull their weigh t. In this book we are challenging the value, even the validity of reacting to other s in a judgemental way, a point of view that cuts across predominant societal custom. Reserve judgement (!) and play along for a while. The first harmful effect of judging others is that it separ ates us from them. We feel badly about them, and in re turn, they usually react negatively to us. \"Judge not that ye be not judged\" as t he Bible says. Second, it is harmful to our own minds and bodi es, as well as to our social life. It is worth citing Easwaran's \"Original Goodnes s\" here; if you haven't read any of his books yet, this will give you an idea of his clarity and force: 54\"Indulging in anger (judgement) is pointing a poison-tipped arrow inward, aimed straight at ourselves. It taints our th inking, poisons our feelings, turns our relationships adversarial. If we continue to think resentful thoughts, mistrust spreads in consciousness like some toxi c underground chemical until we have a permanent disposition for suspicion. When anger pollutes our internal environment to this extent, we don't need part icular events to trigger suspicion; it has become an automatic response, drai ning us of energy like an insidious hidden leak. Our nervous system and vi tal organs react angrily on their own, without any connivance from the mind. The long-term effects ...... can be disastrous: heart disease, stroke, extrem e emotional stress, perhaps even lower resistance to disease and impai red ability to heal\" (p153-4). As indicated here, anger follows close on t he heels of judgement; if we are continually judging that people and things are not as we w ould like, we will be in a state of chronic anger (I like Swami Radha's definit ion/explanation of anger as \"f rustrated desire\"). This wastes our vital energy. A third effect, the most important, is that judgement separates us from God/the Divine Ground. Why? Because, according to all other major spiritual systems, we are all a part of God; if we judge and angrily reject another person, we are rejecting God. This concept will become clearer as you move on with this course. 55 WHAT OUR PATIENTS HAVE WRITTEN *During the brief period that I was able to devote to this week's exercises I realized that I judge people continually. I have been absolutely unaware or i mmune to the fact that I am assessing other peoples' worthiness or unworthiness with almost every encounter. It is a habit with no real harm intended but it does cause harm because it separates me from those I judge. I made a long list of things that aggravate me about someone close to me and recogniz ed that it is no wonder that this person feels uncomfortable when we are together. Recognizing this, I intend to make our next visit a lot more comfortable for both of us. I will continue to work at breaking this \"judging\" habit and keep a record of the results of my efforts. *I find I have a particularly strong negative reaction to critical/judgmental behaviour in others. When I look at my own behaviour I see that I hav e fleeting judgmental thoughts that I hardly notice at times, e.g. when passing someone I don't know on the street. It used to come out more often when I was working and would joke with my colleagues about other people. Sometimes now I notice it after the fact, when I feel a lingering resentment or irritation at someone - I can almost always trace this back to some judgmental thought I've had about them. *When I think judgmentally about someone it definitel y feels like an attack on them. It is almost like there is this part of me that wants to be m ean and wants revenge for the wrong I perceive them as having done to me. It feels like a childish, vengeful part of my personality and it is a struggle to not let it take over, sometimes it wins. What I have learned: - Feelings of judgment/criticism and resentment aris e when things don't go the way I want them to, which is the frustrated desire Swami Radha was talking about. - Feelings of resentment often are the result of my feelings of rejection. I realized that I have some deep seated feelings of rejection from my mother and it clo uds my perception of others. I look for rejection. I anticipate it and sometimes I behave in such a manner as to create it (I do this with D__ [boyfriend]). I have to deal with these issues, or I will continue to feel rejection. But underneath the rejection is frustrated desire, someone is not behaving as I would like them to. - I think my strongest feelings of judgment and criticism are for myself. I judge and criticize myself a lot, which then leads back to the guilt we talked about la st week These feelings hurt me more than anyone else. As long as I am holding on to the feelings, I cannot feel at peace mentally or emotionally, and physically the feelings are putting my body in a state of fight or flight, which will wear it down and prevent it from using it's energy to fight my cancer. *I am coming to understand that everything t hat I do in this life is important and has consequences to the big picture. I feel now (and I didn't before) that smiling instead of frowning or pressing this button rather than that one, or letting som eone in front of me in traffic affects the energy in this universe. I never understood that before. I didn' t think I had any effect on the world. After all, I was no Mother Teresa or Bill Gates. But that doesn't matter. Lots of little ripples can have big effects. 56 EXERCISES 1. Our habits of judgem ent/criticism/resentment : (a) Think of one or more people whom you some times resent. List some of the things about them - their behaviours, attitudes or qualities - that you resent or judge as unworthy, unlikeable, frustrating, or irritating to yourself. (b) Make a list of all the \"hassles\" of everyd ay life that you can think of. How do these inconveniences affect your mental and physical state? (c) Watch your thoughts as you go about your daily routine. Try to catch yourself \"judging\", which includes critic ising others, but also the c onstant process of wanting things to be different from the way they happen to be. List some of these thoughts. To consolidate what you have learned, it is important to write about it, and to keep this within a journal, to which you add regularly (a ring binder is convenient). Your notes can be in point form or narrative, handwritten or typed, long or short; but if you don't write it down your insights will often be lost. 2. Competition: (a) Consider how profoundly our western lifes tyle is based on competition. In what areas can you identify it: competition for jobs and promotion, fo r money, in sport, business, the arts, mass m edia .... what else? (b) Taking sport or games as a prototype, w hat is the effect on you if you compete with someone else and \"beat\" him/her? (c) Is there any suggestion that you are somehow the \"better\" person? (d) What about if you lose; how do you feel (examine or remember relevant instances and write about their effect on you)? (e) In what areas of your life do you compete? (f) Do you compete with y ourself in any way? (g) Why do you compete? (For acceptance, recognition, survival, self-glorification, affection, to survive, because everyone does ......). (h) Is there any need to compete/achieve on the spiritual path? (More than a simple Y/N is needed!). (i) How is this topic related to judgement of other s (and of oneself)? 573. Cancer as \"opportunity\": It is sometimes said that problems, ev en severe challenges like cancer, are \"gifts\" \"lessons\" or \"opportuni ties\". (For example, the I Ching defines crisis as \"danger plus opportunity\"). What is your reaction to that? Do you see potential benefits in your cancer or other life crises, mixed in with t he pain? Are there examples (of which this may be one) in your life where an initial entirely negative judgement gives way to an assessment that a situation contains both unwanted and beneficial aspects? Mind watching: This exercise, as described in chapter 3, should be repeated until you form the habit of continuously monitori ng your stream of thoughts. Sitting and watching the mind, coupled with tr ying to keep it still, or at least not allowing a train of associations to develop from any thought, is itself a form of meditation (\"mindfulness\"). The hope is to transfer this mindful state to our daily activities, so that we \"just do things\" without the constant round of vague resentments, regrets, and irritations that normally accompanies many of them (you will need to check this out for yourself). A modern aut hor who has written a truly excellent book about this is Eckhart Tolle (\"The Power of Now\"). As he poi nts out, by keeping the mind focussed and relatively still we remain \"in the present mo ment\" or \"in the now\". Again, confirm for yourself that much of the time we are ru minating about past events (usually with regrets of various kinds) or anticipated future event s (with attendant anxiety ), rather than being firmly in the present moment. Journalling: To reiterate, what happens in our minds can affect the pr ogress of physical disease. We try to change mental attitudes using relaxation and meditation to drop stressful thoughts, and using imagery to insert positive \"blueprints\" for change. We also try to become increasingly more aware of what thoughts and feelings pass through our minds, in order to be able to choose whether to retain them or not. An important technique for improving this awareness is keepi ng a daily journal of significant events. The process is quite simple. At the end of the day (or at some other regular time), review the things that have happened and wr ite a brief account of the main things that had an impact on you - thes e will often be interactions wit h others. In particular, record events that aroused emotions in you - anger, joy, fear, sadness, irritation, etc. Try to recreate the scene in your mind and to discover what you were telling yourself that induced the emotional reaction. Can you think of alternative ways of thinking/behaving that, in retrospect, would have been healthier? Meditation and journal keeping complement each other; the meditation gives you more access to formerly unconscious reac tions, and the journa lling clarifies and 58captures these, promoting an awareness that permits change. We can also use a journal for catharsis - pouring out bottled-up emotions in a safe way. We can write letters (not for sending) to people we have res ented. We can include, in our journal, drawings, plans, notes from lectures or boo ks, press clippings (especially of positive events), and records of dreams. You will need a special notebook: a ring binder is convenient, as you can then file various papers in it. It is helpful to review the contents, and make a summary each month. Sometimes, if you are living with others, there is concern about ensuring priva cy for the frank descriptions of one's actions and thoughts; indeed, if this does not cause concern it may be that you are not expressing things that are important. The journal can be locked away, or you can use a code for sensitive disclosures. Also, put a note on the cove r requesting that others do not read the contents. Reliving a Recent Event Here is a useful exercise to provide ma terial for your jour nal. After a brief relaxation, bring to mind an event from the last day or days which generated an emotional reaction in you. Tr y to relive it in your imagina tion: it will be like rerunning a movie, or video, which you can stop and start at will. What thoughts were going through your mind? What feelings did you experie nce? Did the situation or people involved remind you of any previous events? After these explorations, write down what you have learned; this is much more valuable than simply musing . Were you able to \"observe\" yourself, from the outside, as it were, interacting with others in your daily activities? Could y ou capture thoughts and fee lings associated with the events you remembered? This detached observation of yourself becomes easier with practice - you'll soon find yourself doing it during the events themselves - and it is an indispensable preliminary to changing habi ts. Without self-observation and self- awareness we are like sleep-walk ers, caught up in our habits without realizing what we are doing. Self-awareness: watching your mental and physical habits You can extend this exercise of watching yourself to all aspects of your life, whether stressful or not - and be pleasantly surprised at what you will learn. Try to identify \"feelings\" associated with events: these are mu ch more important than intellectual ideas. For example, you might be interested in watching yourself as you meet and talk to people. Ask yourself: \"Do I feel nervous? Is my body reacting? Can I remember names, and if not, wh y not? Am I worrying about w hat he/she thinks of me?\" After a while, this is like having a benevolent inner observer or witness of your thoughts and actions. 59 Meditation: For this week the technique is: \"Hamsa - Soham\" : this is a mantra used in synchrony with the breath. Soham means \"I am He\", and Saham, \"I am She\" . As you breathe in, through the nose if possible, silently repeat \"Ham\"; as you breath out repeat \"So\" or \"Sa\". Alternatively, you can say \"Hamsa\" as you breathe in, and \"Soha m\" as you breathe out (I like this better myself). In using this mantra we are asserting our identity as part of God or the Divine Ground. Another translation I have seen is: \"I am That; T hat I am\". Bear in mind the sense of the mantra as you repeat it, but as in all medi tation, don't allow the mind to \"run away\" with it, to editorialise, or analyse or \"embroider\". 60 Chapter 5: Forgiveness Forgiving others is almost universally recognised as a noble human capacity. Here are some excerpts from the wr itings of Paramahansa Yogananda, in his commentary on a major Indian spiritual te xt, the Bhagavad Gita (\"God Talks With Arjuna\"): \"Forgiveness in the man of God consists of not inflicting, or wishing to inflict, punishment on those who harm or wrong him. He knows the cosmic law will see to it that all injustices are rectified; it is unnecessary and presumptuous to attempt to hasten its workings or to deter mine their form........ This is not to say that wrongdoers should have no curtailment .. .....(but) those whose duty it is to enforce just laws ..... should mete out (justice) without malice or a spirit of revenge\" (p967). He goes on to say that \"one should forgiv e under any injury\", a quote from another Indian text (the Mahabharata) that reminds us of the biblical injuncti on to \"turn the other cheek\". Dr Gerald Jampolsky, in his book \"Goodbye to Guilt\", probes even deeper. He points out that \"forgiveness\", as usually understood, often has overtones of condescension, or even of repressed aggression.: \"The ego would have us practise 'pseudo-forgiveness'. In effect it says: 'I can forgive you because I am superior to you. Therefore I will sit on my anger and repress it, rather than be consciously aware of my desire to kill you, which is what you really deserve'. This pseudo-forgiveness only reinforces guilt, because it is a double message that continues to emphasise the unhealed separation between the 'innocent' and the 'guilty'\" (p 34). What, then, is true forgiveness? The convent ional view is that when we forgive, we first make a judgement of another, then are sufficiently magnanimous to overlook their \"sins\"! In fact, true forgiveness m eans recognising that the problem is within ourselves; it arises from our willingness, ev en eagerness, to judge, and to claim that the source of all our problems lies outside of ourselves, usually at the feet of someone else. Our aim must be to identify this tendency, and cut it off \"at the r oot\", so to speak, that is, to recognise when we are j udging and try to stop doing so. Choosing only love : 61Learning to drop such emoti onally-charged, self-serving judgement is the central task of the spiritual journey. You may not believe this at fi rst - you may not be aware of how prevalent your judging is. Remember, the first requirement for pr ogress in this kind of work is not to reject automatically anything we don't immediately see. Keep an open mind, in other words, and test out the idea in your own life. The first step is to learn to recognise what we are doing. As we i dentify our judgemental thoughts we will try to replace them with thoughts of forgiveness, affection, tolerance. You can use the mantra \"choose only love\" to help with this. \"Love\" in this sense is not the romantic love of worldly affairs, but a sense of caring, compassion and connection that asks nothing of the object of our concern (di scussed further in chapter 8). What are the spiritual effect s of forgiving others, and ultimately ourselves? It allows us to experience love, for others, for ourselves, and for t he Divine. We cannot really love while we are blaming. Even a small amount of progress will leave space for unconditional love that may never have been there befor e. The Bible puts it around the other way: \"Perfect love cast eth out fear\", but from the po int of view of the struggling seeker, it is the practical work of \"cas ting out fear\", and anger and judgement that is needed to enjoy \"perfect love\". To achieve this is to remove the s eparation from God. Gerald Jampolsky expresses it this way: \"The healed mind does not know the meani ng of separateness. Because it contains only God's loving thoughts, it is peaceful and devoid of guilt, pain and conflict. Its identity is its perfect harm ony with the wholeness of love\" (\"Goodbye to Guilt\", p 83). 62 WHAT OUR PATIENTS HAVE WRITTEN *When I see people with love, I think they are more likely to see me with love also. My loving channel is definitely open for business. I've really not iced a difference in my life. People seem to like me more, want to be with me. It feels good, it feels ri ght, it's tough work, but mostly, it's so liberating, because I'm not wasting all my energy passing judgement on things, formulating opinions and trying to get others to agree with my opinions. I am still touched by negative emotions (hard habit to break), mainly because in my past I have been very jealous of other people. Jealousy is not a good channel. It's really exhausting!!! *A person in my family causes problems for me by making it difficult to see my son and grandchildren. She tried different things such as pr etending to be sick, or pili ng up tasks that could have been done earlier and creating chaos. I chose to see this person only with love. I see now that she is a person who fears that ther e is only a limited amount of love for her available coming from my son. And she needs it for herself. I am now able to separate her actions from her as a person. I choose only love and I do not feel angry and resentful any more. I also do not make any demands on my son or on her. This leaves the other person free, to seek cont act when they are ready. *Recently a bank teller worked at a snail's pace, I had to wait a long time before my turn came. I was irritated and about to say something when I remembered 'choose only love'. I could see she was nervous and scared. So I asked if she was new at t he branch and smiled. She said yes, and everything proceeded better. So I opened a good channel in myself. *I only wish it were as easy to love everybody else as if they were our children. Gradually I start to see that love is the key to forgiveness. I usually felt that forgiving somebody who hurt me meant that what they did was OK, and that stopped me from forgivi ng them. Now I am starting to realize that if they were my children, although I may not approve of what they did, I could still love and forgive them. *When feeling centered I project feelings of love, appreciation, approval and acceptance. In taking ownership of my feelings I move out of bl ame and shame and find less resentment within my relationships. In reviewing my memories of pas t confrontations, I became aware of how I was being affected by the unwillingness to let go of the emotions of these issues. This understanding of myself helps me to acknowledge the innocence in each of us. We are doing the best we can and as we open to our Higher Selves we will do better. Viewing difficu lt people as innocent children helps me to center myself and look beyond the behaviour and stimulates my proactive response in a loving way...... When I open the love channel in my relationships there is less competition and more sharing involved in the interaction. I am more aware of t heir need to talk and me to listen without jumping ahead and mentally forming a response. In this channel I am able to deflect the negative emotions because I recognize they do not belong to me. 63 EXERCISES 1. Separating a person from his behaviour . Taking an individual from the exercise in the last chapter, or some other whom you resent and have personal cont act with, try considering th e essence of the person as separate from his or her behaviour. Think about them, then think about what they do that has annoyed you as if they were a sm all child, or a robot, and had no control over their actions. Does this make a difference to how you view them? 2. Replaying an emotional incident . Recall a recent instance where som eone criticised, made demands upon, or otherwise inconvenienced you. It need not be a dram atic example, and might best be a situation with someone you know well. Now \"play through\" the incident in your mind, as if through a videotape. Note carefully what you thought and felt at each point, in particular, your reactions to the alleged injustice of it! Then go through it again, but this time, before you begin, fill yourself with light, as in the \"Divine Light\" ex ercise below. Repeat to yourself: \"I choose to see this person only with love\", or some sim ilar affirmation. Holding on to this feeling, let the other do his/her thing (on the vi deo), and note any changes in your reaction. You could do this a number of times, with different examples, in your imagination, and, as the opportunities arise, try it out in \"real life\". 3. Using the \"love channel\"! Interacting with other people is a complex business; as we all know, there is \"a lot going on\" during the conversation. We c an think of having a nu mber of \"channels\" connecting us with the other - a judging channel, an angry one, a controlling one, a delighted, pleased and loving one, and so on. We can choose which of these channels we keep open or shut. So when you are talki ng to someone, try consciously to think of just holding the \"loving channel\" open. Note how this feels. Since there is only this \"good\" channel available, can the other person touch you wit h any negative emotions? Mind watching and thought stopping: Please don't neglect the basic process of learning to watch the mind: repeat it until you have constant, ready acce ss to your stream of thoughts. If the mind won't be still, either while trying to meditate or at times of anxiety (for many, that period of lying awake worrying in the early hours of the morning!), there are a number of things you can try: 64Writing down your problems to \"take them off the mind\". Practising relaxation first of ten makes meditating easier. Experiment with different times of the day for your meditati ons; it may prove easier to concentrate early in the morning. A worry period: Set yourself a period when y ou are \"allowed\" to worry as much as you want, for example, between 8 and 8.15 am each day. Then whenever you find anxious thoughts surfacing, tell yourself that you will deal wit h them during your \"worry time\". Alternativel y you can set a timer for a few minutes, allow yourself to ruminate until it rings, then snap your fingers, shout \"Stop\" and do so! \"Worry fast\": a related tec hnique is to set, in advance, a day when you will not allow worries! Meditation: The Divine Light Mantra: This mantra meditation comes through the late Swami Sivananda Radha, with whom my wife and I had the great good fortune to study at intervals over many years. The first 4 lines are a traditional mantra; the last was added by Swami Radha. The invocation is recited, silently or aloud, wh ile invoking or imagining light streaming down from above, flowing into the body thr ough the head, and filling the entire being. I am created by Divine Light I am sustained by Divine Light I am protected by Divine Light I am surrounded by Divine Light I am ever growing into Divine Light. The full practice has been described by Sw ami Radha in a booklet called \"The Divine Light Invocation\" (1987), or alternativel y in her monumental work on spiritual development: \"Kundalini Yoga for the West\"(1978 - both from Timeless Books, Spokane). Here I de scribe an adaptation: Sit or stand with the eyes closed; relax and repeat the mantra slowly, twice, the first time through trying to see light filling you, and the second time feeling it. Think to yourself that every cell of your body, every level of consciousness, is filled with light, and see yourself as well, healthy and whole. Then share this light by imagining someone in need standing before you and receiving light that you send from the area of your heart. See this person fill ed with light also. If you prefer , you could substitute \"the love of God\" for \"Divine Light\", although it helps most people to visualise light, whatever the affirmation they are using. 65Try this practice daily, thinking of it as a means of forgiving others, and yourself. Additional meditation An extremely useful and relatively simple way of meditating is to chant aloud, using a simple prayer of mantra as the tex t. This method is commo nly used in various spiritual traditions, including Hinduism, Buddhi sm and Christianity. An advantage of expressing the sound audibly com pared with sub-vocal repetition is that it seems to dissipate some of the restlessness that we often experience in atte mpting to meditate - it gives the body something to do, as it were. We can't reproduce the music of chants fo r copyright reasons. However, there are a number of tapes and books on the market now. If possi ble, accompany yourself on an instrument, or have a tape playing along wit h you. Three tapes that we use in our classes are put out by the Wings of Song group: \"Sri Ram, Jai Ram\" (Hail to the Lord, in the form of Rama), \"Om Nama Siva\" (honour ing another form of the deity, Siva), and \"Gloria\" (from the Christian Catholic tradition) . Note that chants should be very simple and repetitive; the mind should not be distracted by trying to remember what to do next. The simplest method of all is to chant \"Om\" in a monotone; this is said by some to be the \"root syllable of the Universe!\". It has certainly been used for chanting by millions of people over millenia. Inhale through your nose if possible. Try chanting for 20 minutes or so daily for a while, and as always, write about your experiences. *The greatest influence I have on my moods is meditation. When I can concentrate and meditate, I have found that I can still everything and co ncentrate on reaching another level of awareness. Lately, combining together the lesson s in the Course in Miracles and the qi gong physical exercises I am learning has been the most effective way of sealing ideals into my body -- a rather odd concept the works with me. I used to depend on smells to bring back memories; now I realize that rhythmic chanting + rhythmic movements can help set ideas in my mind (now that I think about it, something that has probably been around in all religions for thousands of years). As usual I have to discover it myself before recognizing its universality, and realizing why it is so effective 66 Chapter 6: Guilt, self criticism and self acceptance One way of describing the sp iritual journey is to say that it is a quest for one's true nature or identity. We almost always have a fals e idea of who we are, and the most harmful of our views ar e the judgements and criticisms that we make of ourselves. This self-condemnation makes us feel guilt y and inadequate. It often engenders a deep sense of shame and personal unworthiness. We may not immediately recognise this: (\"Who me? I'm not guilty of anything; I'm quite content with myself thanks very much!\"). This sort of obliviousness to what is going on in the deeper reaches of mind is caused, as Freud pointed out, by the \"layers\" of def ensiveness that we construct, to conceal from ourselves our true thoughts and feelings. We need first of all to \"find\" or identify these suppressed ideas, bring them out into the open, as it were, after which we will have the choice, previously unavailable, to let them go. \"Guilt\" is one of those words, like \"love\" or \"God\" that have multiple meanings, and signify different things to different people. Conventional psychology has a fairly narrow definition, essentially the regret and self criticism we feel about actions in the past. Christian theology adds other elements which can be confusing, for example, the idea of \"sin\", meaning actions of which it is assumed a deity would not approve. For the kind of psychospiritual work we are engaged in here, we want to understand how we regard ourselves at the deepest possible level, then examine this self image and see how much of it is true and what effect it has on our relationship to the Divine. So I will adopt the very broad definition used by Ken W apnick, perhaps the foremost interpreter of A Course in Miracles (ACIM): \"Guilt is really the sum total of all the negative feelings, beliefs, and experiences that we have ever had about ourselves. So guilt can be any form of self-hatred or self-rejection; feelings of incompetence, failure, empt iness, or feelings that there are things in us that are lacking, missing or incomplete\" (quoted from Wapnick's \"A Talk given on A Course in Miracles\", p 40). Where do these self-judgmental attitudes come from? It may se em that the only significant criticisms arrive from outside, from other people, whereas in fact the important critical voices are internal. O ften they echo old voices from the past: the remarks of parents, teachers, family, peers, that have \"settl ed\" firmly in our minds, and influenced our own reflections on our self wort h. This may cause a distorted, usually poor, self concept that limits us greatly. Conventional psychology recognises this, and strives to help people reclaim a better opinion of themselves. In spiritual psychology we want to begin with a healthy self-respect, and then go far beyond this to an understanding of our true nat ure, which is, as the mystics of all traditions tell us, that we are each part of a larger Order or Intelligence or Mind. Our sense of guilt keeps us 67from knowing this one-ness with the Divine. ACIM puts this very directly; as Wapnick points out: \"The ultimate source of all (our) guilt is the belief that we have sinned against God by separating ourselves from Him. As a result of that, then, we see ourselves as separate from everybody el se and from our (Higher) Self\" (Wapnick, p 41). A further consequence of feeling guilty, w hether or not we realise it consciously, is that we expect punishment, which generates fear. We feel then that we have to do something to ward off this punishment. For this purpose we use various strategies, one of which is suppressing or repressing (a dee per \"burying\" of the ideas than suppressing) our guilt and fear. Two other st rategies are: first, to \"attack\" or \"punish\" ourselves, in a kind of \"pre-emptive strike\" aimed at deflecting outsi de intervention; and second, \"projecting\" our guilt on to others, ie, attributing our motives to other people (a mechanism we will examine further in the next chapter). Dr Ge rald Jampolsky points out some of these consequences of feeling guilty in his book \"Good-bye to Guilt\": \"It is a psychological fact that if we hol d on to guilt, we will attempt to handle it either by attacking ourselves (frequently expressed as symptoms of depression or physical illness), or pr ojecting the guilt on to someone else\" (p 32). In other words, as well as keeping us s eparate from the Divine, our self-condemnation may cause illness, fear, and problems with our relationships. We seem to have parachuted directly into what may be a fundamental cause of our problems! Our work now is to try to identify self criticism or condemnation in ourselves, so that we will be able to counter it, because it is unfort unately true that thes e ways of defending ourselves against buried guilt, while bringing short-term comfort, gr eatly distort our view of ourselves and our relationship to our world. 68 WHAT OUR PATIENTS HAVE WRITTEN *Recognizing that the reason I feel rejection by ot hers so painfully is that it mirrors the rejection that I have done to myself is definitely a new way of looking at myself and at others. I guess it is one small step towards self-knowledge. How can I honestly harbor ill feelings towards the people who have rejected me, when their rejection of me is so much less than my rejection of myself? The problem isn't with them, it is with how I have treated myself. The solution isn't going to come through others, I have to learn to love myself. *With the beautiful quote from Diane Berke's book The Gentle Smile in mind (see \"Exercises\" below), I broke my life down into various time fram es and for each period listed all my feelings of inadequacy and all actions or thoughts which cause me to feel guilt. My list is 4 pages long, single spaced. I'm not sure whether I'm being too hard on my self or just too thorough but I felt a real need to devote a lot of energy and honesty to this exercise. I hadn't thought of many of the things on my list for years. Some made me cry and all made me aware th at I have used every strategy mentioned in the notes to deal with my guilt and fear of punishment. As I reflected on my lis t I realized that I have been taught that these failings are sins against God and that they keep me from being close to Him. Forgiveness through self-forgiveness is new to me and because I have used all means to push my sins or errors away from my consciousness I have never fe lt the peace of forgiveness. I have experienced sadness, sorrow, avoidance, denial and depression at va rious times in my life over some of the things on my list. An example, my mother's sudden death left me in shock. I felt guilty about not having been supportive enough as she coped with life's problems. And I couldn't do anything about it after she died. I'm certain that it was guilt that caused a reactive depression. *I surrounded myself with God's light and knowin g that he has forgiven me and that I am part of God, I reviewed my long list of errors. Some of t hem made me feel very sad and brought me to tears again, but I continued to focus on \"choose only love\". It is healing. I felt a sense of relief and even joy at having confronted these issu es that have kept me from forgivi ng myself and others. Self-forgiveness reminds me that the past is gone and that I am free to choose love today. I believe that for me, true and lasting forgiveness will take time. I will continue to practice self-forgiveness. *In looking over the lists I realize that the guilt inducing words, thoughts and deeds came from my lack of self-knowledge, mindfulness and clarity. The motivations were fear, ignorance, desire, lack of love etc. - those feelings we are trying to understand in The Healing Journey - rather than a conscious desire to harm. Even though I have forgiven myself because I know that I acted in those moments with all that I was at that moment, I still remember the physical pain of suffering guilt. I try to look at those events in my life with compassion, understanding and forgiveness. *I honestly have trouble \"feeling a light\" and self-for giveness (and forgive me, again, I feel guilty about this too!?)...Alas, I only shift to new sources of guilt. What I have bee n able to realize is that in the grand scheme of things, my guilt is almost laughable....how trivial, rea lly....but I still recognize that it is MINE, I own it, it influences just about everything I do and it runs VERY DEEP within me! Perhaps I need more than one week on this chapter! (I am chuckling now at this understatement!) I am also chipping away at my inclination to seek constant improvement and perfection and vacillate between feeling anxious at \"easing up\" and mo re peaceful at being able to let go of some of my deeply ingrained habits. \"That's good enough\" is a phrase that makes me shudder in dismay and wrestle with my conscience, but perhaps it will help me heal my life! ) 69 *I was finding it difficult to let go the long habit of not forgiving. It was an almost comforting rut; however, along with the harsh judgement of others we re equally harsh judgments of myself. As I began to understand this, I was able to see myself as the small child that needed as much compassion as those whom I could not forgive. 70 EXERCISES As Diane Berke says, in her lovely book \"the Gentle Smile\", \"the healing process is one of bringing the darkness in our minds to the gentle light of awareness\"(p 57). So approach this process of digging up the self- crit ical voices in a spirit of compassion for yourself - much as if you were trying to find and remove a number of painful thorns. 1. Investigating guilt : (a) List any areas of your life in which y ou feel, or have felt, inadequate, or incompetent, or where you have felt like a failure or incomplete in some way. (b) Likewise, list anything you do, or can remember having done, about which you experience guilt, self-condemnation, self-hatred or judgement. (If you are sharing your ideas with others you may need to use a code to list some of these things, and/or to keep part of it private). (c) Can you sense this guilt as an \"attack\" on yourself? What does it feel like in your body? The above lists should occupy at least a page, and probably more. When I did the exercise I found it helpful to break my life up into sections (\"early school\", \"high school\", \"early married life\", etc), and list the self-criticisms dominant at each time. To counter any feelings of frustr ation or depression the exercise may have left you with, do the following: (d) Look at the list, reading thr ough slowly, and tell yourself that this is all in the past; that these things all had a r eason, they were errors and pec uliarities for which you now forgive yourself completely, and that they ar e already forgiven by the Divine. Affirm that, in thinking about yourself and your pas t, you will \"choose only love\". See yourself surrounded by light as you do this. Imagine this light as God's presence all around and within you. (e) If you like, make a copy of the list which you can burn while practising self- forgiveness. Write about any shift in feelings that may have accompanied this. 2. Forgiveness of oneself : - See yourself in light; then see a religious figure, like Jesus, the Buddha, or Divine 71Mother or your Inner Healer (below) embrac ing you. Imagine as you do this that you are giving up the habit of constantly wanting things to be different. - Now how do you feel about yourself; has th e judgement and guilt abated? Is it easier to accept yourself? - Is this a passive (apathetic) process (ie gi ving up), or an active one, requiring effort? - Does it bring peace of mind? The Inner Healer: There is a great deal of evidence that t he deeper or unconscious mind has both detailed \"knowledge\" or record of events in the body and great potential ability to control them. For example, with biofeedback apparatus, people can learn to control blood pressure, heart rate, brain wave patterns, smooth muscle contractions, and even the firing of certain single nerve cells. Placebo (iner t) medications, or suggestions under hypnosis, can lead to cures or healing changes in a vari ety of conditions, e.g., peptic ulcer, pain, various skin diseases, asthma, a nd arthritis. We attempt to use some of this potential control in our exercises with imagery. One way of contacti ng this inner wisdom is to imagine a figure or \"healer\" within, who may not only embody t he potential of our deeper minds, but also serve as a route to contact our spiritual dimension. Inner Healer Exercise First relax deeply, and then imagine yourse lf on a path leading into the woods. There, as you wait in a clearing, imagi ne your are approached by an animal \"guide\". Talk to this animal, noticing your feelings toward it. The guide can then lead you deeper into the forest to a second clearing, in whic h there is a dwelling of some kind, inhabited by the Inner Healer. Knock on the door and wait for the Inner Healer to come out. This may be a wise old person, a religious figure, somebody from your past, another animal, a ball of light, a voice without a body, or one of many other symbols. You can have a dialogue with this figure, asking for informa tion and help, and responding with gratitude. At the end of the conversati on, have the original guide take you back to the first clearing, from which you can return to your normal \"reality\". The experience of an Inner Healer Some people immediately get powerfu l images and \"messages\" from an Inner Healer; others experience very little at first. You may simp ly get a sense of \"presence\", without images; that's fine. If not much is happening for you, it is likely that you are blocking the experience with skepticism or pr ejudgments as to what should happen. We know that there is a great deal of unconscious wisdom in everyone, expressed, for example, in dreams: we all dream, although not all of us normally remember dreams. 72So don't despair if nothing happens on the firs t few attempts, but c ontinue to work away at the process patiently. A concern expressed by many of our patient s is that they are \"just making it all up\". This need not be a problem. Where imagery is sluggish, it is legitimate to help it along with conscious thought. The real meas ure of usefulness in all of the \"Inner Healer\" kind of work is how unexpected or novel the \"me ssages\" are. If you already consciously know all that you are experiencing, then there has been no learning; if you have had new insights and experiences, it does n't much matter how you arrived at them. We do the work to uncover hidden potential. Sometimes frightening images come up. If you are working alone, you may prefer to drop them and come back to conc entration on the breathing. If you wish to confront and master these images or thoughts, which is therapeutically valuable, this is best done with the help of an accredited psychotherapist. *Whenever I imagine myself struggling against this disease, I am joined and comforted by my inner healer. He is a Jesus like figure. I am able to gain immediate comfort whenever I feel the need to \"summon\" my inner healer since this image comes to me at some level very easily. Cancer appears to me as spots with a black core, surrounded by purple, surrounded by yellow. My inner healer brings light to my body and when I feel completely filled with light, I see the cells or spots gradually melt away. I believe that I can co-exist with this disease. I am comforted that my inner healer will always be with me, sending in light a nd melting away cancer cells as they grow. Meditation: The technique to try for this week is \"mindfulness\", commonly associated with Buddhism, but used in many spiritual traditions. The process can be very like the \"mind-watching\" you have been doing, i.e. si mply watching the mind, noticing thoughts as they pass through, but not fo llowing them up in any way. If you find that a sensation or a sound or an idea comes to your attention, just \"watch\" it and let it go. A device that help you keep on track is to repeat over and over to yourself a word or phrase describing what you are currently focusing on: e.g. \"back pain, back pain\".... or \"when can I stop, when can I stop .....\", until the mi nd shifts to something else. You can think of this process as slowi ng down the m ental videotape. For background reading, try any of the books by Thich Nhat Hanh, such as \"The Miracle of Mindfulness\"; or read one of the books by Jon Kabat-Zinn (Reading List), or by Eckhart Tolle. * In general I found \"mindfulness meditation\" easier to do than other forms that I have tried. A thought would come into my mind and I would choose one word to describe it and say it over and over. Sometimes I said it only 3 or 4 times before another thought came into play and other times I would say it 10 or more times before I would think of something else. I found that I would say the word over in my 73mind quickly at first but as the thoughts came and went I was gradually thinking the word to describe the thought much more slowly, as if the act of medita ting was slowing my thinking process down as I got more into it. 74Chapter 7: Judging as a projection of our guilt and frustration Now we come to a f unction of the mind that is rather tricky, but very important. We have a number of ways of avoiding unpleasant ideas and emotions. Freud called these \"defenses\". One we will readily recognise is denial; refusing to look at or acknowledge what is actually taking place. A second is \"projection\", which me ans the shifting of blame and responsibility to someone else for qua lities or ideas that really arise within ourselves. For example, if I have the desire to control someone else's behaviour, I may reject this possibility in myself, and instead attribute controlli ng desires to others. This shift typically takes place without our being awar e of it. Or I may feel very angry, but being unwilling to let myself feel this, point to angry behaviour in ot hers. In a slightly wider sense, if I feel angry or frustrated about something that is making me unhappy, I may blame others for it, rather than myself. For example, if I am suffering from a diagnosis of cancer, I may look around fo r someone or something that I can hold responsible for my distress: doc tors, the health care system, Go d, anyone. It is a kind of unloading of the responsibilit y for misery and guilt. The \"r eal\" problem is my self-talk, my fears about what may happen, but instead of looking at this I lash out at the external situation, blaming that. Projection is a \"spin off\" from se lf criticism. You can check this out for yourself by imagining (in a relaxed state) that you are absolutely free of any self criticism; then you would not blame anyone el se for anything (see exercise 2, below). Ken Wapnick, in his \"Talk Given on A Course in Miracles\" (p 73) which I have already cited, has an excellent metaphor for understanding projection. He suggests we think of projection as a movie projector. Imagine that you are the movie projector and that you have your own film of guilt (self cr iticism) that you are al ways playing through. You project the guilt from this film on to the screens of these people and then see your own negative thoughts about yourself as coming fr om them. The ego, or separate self, reasons this is the way to get rid of one's guilt; it is too devastating a thought to deal with otherwise. This can be a difficult concept to grasp at first, so let's have another look at it, and relate it to what we have done in the earlier chapters. We like to think that all of our problems and distress are caus ed by agents or situations outside ourselves. Karen Horney ( a famous psychoanalyst) called this pr ocess \"externalisation\". We do it to feel more comfortable (in the shor t term). It is a blanket te rm, within which we can put several common types of perception: \"Judgement\" means that we c onsider a person/thing/situation is not as it should be (remember, we are concerned here with the kind of judgement that has an emotional \"charge\" to it, not wit h dispassionate discrimination). \"Blame\" is similar to emotionally-c harged judgement, but her e we are usually emphasising the unpleasant effect so meone or something is having on 75ourselves. \"Projection\" is a term fr om Freud, meaning essentially that we blame others for our problems, but don't know we are doing it (ie, it's an unconscious \"defense\" mechanism). It includes the action of criticising in others qualities that we unknowingly deplore in ourselves. Why do we use these distorted ways of thinking? Basically, to avoid looking into ourselves. To remove the apparent responsibil ity for our distress away from self, and from our guilty deeper knowledge that it is we who are c ausing this distress (by our reaction to events, and our self talk). A Course in Miracles probes this process to its depths, pointing out that the ultimate cause of our guilt - of all negative self appraisal - is our separation from the Divine or God. We feel alienated, vu lnerable, and at some level we know we have done this to oursel ves. So we lash out at others. What is needed? All of the great wisdom traditions tell us that we need to take responsibility for our own thought processes. This means honestly looking at all of our opinions and judgements. Does this mean we are responsible for our illnesses? No (at least not the levels of awareness that most of us have), but we are, as Stephen Levine (author of \"Who Dies\" and other books) puts it, responsible to our illnesses, ie, to do all we can to understand and help ourselves, using illness as a motivator; and more generally, we are responsible for using this life as a way of learning who we really are. Projection is one of the ways in which we create our own worlds, our own reality. An important part of t he early work in spiritual growth is coming to understand this, and consequently accepting responsibility for our per sonal world. On encountering this idea for the first time a common reaction is: \"I didn't cause those earthquakes/wars/examples of poverty and injustice, my cancer, etc\". My suggestion would be: don't turn to major and apocalyptic world events in your haste to deny this possibility. After all, if it has any validity, it might provide you with a handle on your world. For the present, test it out on relatively small scale events in your ow n surroundings, and in particular, look for evidence that, by your mental actions and attitudes, you are creating conflict between yourself and other people. Because, of course , if we judge others, they know it, and will react in kind. 76 WHAT OUR PATIENTS HAVE WRITTEN *Indeed, this has been a difficult concept to grasp. It helped me to first look back at some of the people in my life that I have blamed for past and present events and situations. I analyzed a few of them carefully and in each case I found that I was judging a nother because of the guilt I was experiencing at having done or not done something. *Our neighbour is a very inquisitive person. S he is very direct and asks for information with no hesitation whatsoever. She needs to know what goe s on in people's lives. Upon reflection I am also inquisitive but I try to get information indirectly. I am guilty of the same habit. I tell our friends about the 'busy lady' next door. I now see that I am projecting my guilt to her - I need to change my attitude. *When I feel sorry for myself because my s pouse isn't paying attention to my fears and frustrations, I really am projecting my own sense of gu ilt at not being as attentive to her as I should be. This is very often at the root of our disagreements. Very recently I have made a deliberate effort to check this reaction. Arguments and bad feelings that hav e been often associated with these disagreements do not occur, which seems to confirm t he existence of my projection problem. It's also interesting that in managing the reactions, not only is the interaction calmer and positive, the result is I feel more reasonable, more responsible and a lot less guilt. *In the process of watching my thoughts for judg ments, it has become clear to me that my judging activity is often directly related to my state of mind at the time. The judgments, in fact, appear to be a reflection of my own state (more often than not) ra ther than an actual asse ssment of what others are doing and saying. The classic \"People are just getting in my way\" or \"they're too slow\" or even the fairly benign \"where have they all come from?, is just a re flection of the fact that I may simply have not left sufficient time for myself to get somewhere and I co ver my own guilt feelings by blaming others...... I've found that some of the small judgments I' ve leveled at situations or other people have stemmed from some perception of inadequacy, fear or doubt that is present in my own mind and the judged person is only acting as a mirror to what's in myself. Most of the other judgments I make are a reflection of habit or behaviours, \"the way I was t aught to do things\". When people or situations fall outside of these limits small judgments occur e.g. so mething that might go against my sense of fairness or equality. *I can see now that my anger against those who don't push and fight and strive to be the best they can be is a frustrated desire within myself to so metimes \"let go\" and not have to always strive for perfection....connected to this is my sense of responsibility.....and sufferi ng with my first serious cold in over four years, I realize that until I had a seri ous sounding cough, weakened voice, and could barely think straight....I could not give myself permission to slow down....I realize that I had been letting work take over my life again and replace the healthier, lifestyle habits I had been incorporating into my behaviours (e.g. meditation, regular ex ercise, leaving work earlier, not taking work home, adding \"play\" to my life). I also see that I am jealous of people w ho can relax and have fun and not feel guilty about not meeting (my expectations?!!) of their responsibilities. *Caring/Showing affection: I get upset with people wh o do not show that they care. I believe that 77their actions should speak for themselves. Yet, I myself do not tell people often enough how much I care for them. I tend to reflect, what I judge as unacce ptable behaviour towards me, back in my behaviour towards them, or worse, distance myself from t hem before I get hurt. I do have difficulty showing kindness, caring and compassion sometimes, because I feel it will make me vulnerable to being hurt. I have been bumped and bruised so many times in the past that I keep ever on guard to put up walls when I feel insecure. Rather than being tr ue to myself by showing how I care for them in my own way, I modify my attitude. So I can see that I do proj ect my own qualities in how I view others. 78 EXERCISES (1) Finding what we resent in others in ourselves : (a) Think of some qualities or attitudes in one or more other people that you resent (borrow from previous sessions' exercises if you like). Now try to find some evidence of these qualities in yourself. If you find yourself detesting or \"attacking\" some quality in another person, try to sense how you may be atta cking it in yourself: \"Part of me detests what another part is doing\". (b) If this is difficult, think ra ther of qualities or habits in ot hers that irritate or frustrate you. Focus on the way these things make your life more uncomfortable. Now note whether or not you are to some extent blaming your discomfor t on them. This is a form of projection: saying that you are the cause of my discomfort or inconvenience. Can you see how you could \"take back\" the responsibility for your own mental state by \"owning\" your reaction, and changing it? (c) Think of (and write about) examples where you tell yourself: \"I'm not getting what I need from this person or situat ion\". Is this a projection of your own frustration with yourself, or with part of yourself? 2. Imagining yourself secure. - After relaxing deeply, imagine that you feel to tally secure and fulfilled, universally liked and respected by other people, and by God. How does that feel inside? - Now, continuing to be aware of this fee ling, look back at one of the persons or situation that you resented. Do they bother you now? This is potentially a very powerful exercise, which should be diligently explored: it can show us quite convincingly that our frustration with others depends on our dissatisf action with ourselves. More than that, it can show us how our proj ection creates our world! 3. Attempting to stop judging others . This is a further version of exercises fr om the preceding chapt ers. Pick someone with whom you interact daily, and towards whom y ou cherish some resentment. Resolve to try and drop this feeling: practise in your imagination seeing them surrounded by light. Tell yourself that when you meet them you will have only one of many possible \"channels\" open - the one that allows love a nd understanding to flow between you. (The other channels, for hate, anger, fear and other unpleasant emotions, remain closed). Observe what your interactions are lik e over the week. Since there is only this 79\"good\" channel available, can the other person touch you with any negative emotions? 80Meditation: The practice for this chapter is the silent repetition of a prayer , over a daily period of 20 - 30 minutes. A full description of this process can be found in many of the books by Eknath Easwaran, as part of his \"8- point program\". Easwaran has published a collection of poems suitable for this kind of meditation in \"God Makes the Rivers to Flow\" (Nilgiri Press, 1994). One that he recommends is the St Francis Prayer, below. He suggests going through it very slowly, with a pause after each line, to allow it to \"sink in\". Don't follow any associat ion of ideas or try to think about the passage. If you can commit it to memory first, the process is even more effective. Or you can use it as a \"writing meditation\", that is writing it repeatedly with the mind calm and focused. Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love; Where there is injury, pardon; Where there is doubt, faith; Where there is despair, hope; Where there is darkness, light; Where there is sadness, joy. O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek To be consoled as to console, To be understood as to understand, To be loved as to love; For it is in giving that we receive; It is in pardoning that we are pardoned; It is in dying to self that we are born to eternal life. Remember, Easwaran says, that we are not \"addressing so me extraterrestrial being outside. The kingdom of heaven is within us, and the Lord is enshrined in the depths of our own consciousness\" (Easwaran, in \"The Undiscovered Country\", p125). * I used the familiar St. Francis Prayer. I can feel my appreciation for meditation growing as I practice it more often. Now instead of spending time during th e session wondering \"how much longer\" I am actually surprised when the timer goes off to signal half an hour has passed. I also find myself looking forward to the peace and quiet of my meditation session rather than bu sying myself with other things just to put it off as I did in the beginning. Each time it seems that it is about half way through the session that my mind really quietens down. 81Chapter 8: Extending Love \"And did you get what you want ed from this life, even so? I did. And what did you want? To call myself beloved, to feel myself beloved on the earth.\" Raymond Carver We all want to love and be loved; the above is a poem written by a well known poet shortly before his death. Yet there ar e few things about which more confusion exists than love. The word is used for m any behaviours and states of mind that have little to do with love. So our first task, as always, is to clarify what we mean. The exercises below are an important step towa rds this end, listing why we love some specific person. It can be painful to do this , if we are honest, because we will find that a lot of what we assumed was love for another is in fact dependency (for comfort, security, status, sex, entertainment and so on). That is, to put it bluntly, we tend to love others because of what we can get from them, which is not love but exploitation. The mystics of all persuasions tell us that love is not about getting at all; it is only about giving. Love is blissful communion wi thout any personal agenda; \"love without an object\", i.e., unconditional love. It can be felt for all living things, for God, for oneself, and perhaps is most often experienced in reasonably pure form between a parent and small child, or even towards a pet. It is the absence of separation between ourselves and the loved object. Love and joy are closely related: \"Whenever you are not wholly joyous, it is because you have reacted with a lack of love to one of God's creations\" (A Course in Miracles, ACIM, Text ch5;VII.5.1) In fact, love is the very core of our being, and is what we must extend to everyone else: \"Teach only love, for that is what you are.\" (ACIM, Text ch6;I.13.1). \"Unless love's meaning is restored to you, you cannot know yourself who share its meaning.\" (ACIM, Text ch16; V.15.2). How can we learn to love unconditionally ? It is the same question as asking 82\"how can I know my true nature?\" or \"how can I know God?\" You will recall the four main paths we outlined in the Introduction to this course: the path of understandi ng; in this context, understanding what keeps us from love the path of meditation; removing all negative (and other) t houghts, so that we can be completely with another the path of devotion; delib erately cultivating lovi ng feelings (for God). the path of selfless service; giving up the focus on self in order to express love for others through service. As I've said earlier, we are focusing pr imarily on the path of understanding in this course, in order to progress as quickly as possible. We have discussed judgement of others, and seen that this is the projecti on outwards of our own self criticism and frustration. Clearly a first step towards learning to love is to stop this, and to accept responsibility for our own emot ions and situations, rather t han blaming others. Then we can turn to projecting positive emotions instead, even if it feels artificial. ACIM speaks of \"extending\", meaning letting love flow from ourselves towards all, abolishing the separation. Sending light to others, as in t he Divine Light Mantra ex ercise of chapter 5, is an example of extending, as is the exerci se we did earlier on trying to see the person independent of his or her behaviour. Ultimately, we can only love others fully if we learn to love ourselves. We have to pursue what Easwaran calls \" healing our own hearts and minds\". This is a large task, and everything in this course and in all spir itual systems, is ultimately about this healing of the self. Our true self-l ove will grow as we apply the techniques we have learned so far; understanding how we have been operati ng, then withdrawing the judgement, and undoing the guilt. As we have se en, it is not so much a pr ocess of learning something new as of removing the obstacles to the expression of what is already there: \"Your task is not to seek for love, but me rely to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built agains t it\" (ACIM, Text, ch 16; IV.6.1). Learning to love is necessary if we are to feel true compassi on for others. What the world feels for those in trouble tends to be, if anything, pity, which is a condescending sense of difference from them, tinged with fear and relief that \"it's not my problem\". Sympathy is another ambiguo us word, meaning, literally, feeling along with another; this, too can bec ome self-serving, an indulgence in one's own emotional needs. Compassion is, by contrast, more em otionally detached; so meone is in trouble, we feel only love for them, based on equality, and extend to them the healing love we would ourselves receive. Ultimately, according to the spiritual mast ers, all true love is for the Divine; it spills over on to other peopl e however. We are engaged in developing a \"love affair\" 83with God or the Divine! We need to foster this with all our available energies, to engage in what is more conventionally called \"w orship\", not because God needs our adulation, but because we need to learn to express it. The path of devotion emphasizes this process; finding an avatar or person who has fully realised the Divine (such as Jesus, Krishna, Divine Mother or the Buddha) or other symbols of the Divine, setting up an altar, transmuting our emotional forces into spiritual energy. This path is common in India, where there are very many symbols - gods and goddesses - representing the underlying Divine Mind. It can mesh well with the practice of seeking understanding. If you are attracted to the path of devotion, then you may need to find a human figure, often Jesus, or one of the Indian avatars to a nd for whom you can express this love. Or you may find that you can worship God as liv ing spirit. There is a longstanding debate in eastern spiritual writings, on whether God \"has form\" or is \"without form.\" It is not a question we can answer, from our limited human understanding. In practical terms, I would suggest we imagine God or the Divine in whatever way works for us. 84 WHAT OUR PATIENTS HAVE WRITTEN (Exercise 1a) *Love is acceptance of anot her person and I think unconditional love is total acceptance. I believe that the only way you can accept someone else is to accept yourself. Love is something you share with the world. I feel loved when I feel tota lly accepted. I have sisters and I know they love me unconditionally. They don't care what I look like or what I do, they love me. Love also means wanting to take burdens away from others and shouldering them yourself. That's the love that I have for my children and others in my family. Conditional love is a power trip. It assumes that love is finite and that you have to get yours at the expense of someone else. Unconditional love has no bounds or limits. There's enough to go ar ound and it's self producing. The more we express unconditional love the more of it there is in this world. (Exercise 1b) I love you because: You provide for me You are honourable You stand by me during all my physical trials You give me space to follow my path You're easygoing You're a loving father You're understanding You're funny You're undemanding You're happy You like to have fun You keep me company I recognize that a lot of the things above are my own personal agenda, things I want or need from the relationship. Believe it or not, I fi nd it harder to unconditionally love my closest relationships which is odd because these are the people I love the most. I don't have an agenda when it comes to my neighbour, but I do when it comes to my husband or kids. *Unconditional love, is, I think, a lot of what I feel for my children. I don't mean to say that I've never been angry with them, but that I always love them, even when they behave in ways that might be considered annoying, or not very nice. I'm always clear on the fact that first and foremost I love them. I think that part of the reason that I can feel this way about them is that my love for them is not dependent on getting something back from them, which is not to say that getting something back isn't wonderful. It's just that my love doesn't depend on that. My love for them doesn't come from the relationship, but from deep inside me. 85 *What is Love? giving - overflowing, expression of vitality power which produces love caring - active concern for the life that we love responsibility - able an d ready to respond respectful - aware of unique individuality knowledgeable - \"know thyself\" Spiritual Love Right action as described in the Buddhist \"Noble Eightfold Path\" \"Choose only love Non-attachment to the outcome It would be wonderful to be able to love every creat ure in this way. The expansiveness and freedom in the acceptance of \"what is\" in ourselves and others. 86EXERCISES 1. Investigating love: (a) What is love? Write dow n your thoughts generally; if it's difficult, think of all the behaviours you associate with loving. (b) Considering your most important love relationship (likely to be your spouse, or partner, but could be a child or very good friend) , set up a series of questions to yourself in the form: - \"I love you because ...\" (you accept, look afte r, entertain ....me, et c). Then list all the reasons you can think of. (c) How does \"spiritual\" or \" unconditional\" love differ from worldly love? What would be the effects of loving others in this way? On them? On yourself? 2. Creating a \"sacred space\" . If you have not already done so, make yourse lf a space at home that is dedicated to your regular meditation or prayer. It should include some kind of small table on which you can put any objects that would help you focus on the spiritual work as you sit in front of it. These might include statues of spiritual figures, pictures (in stand-alone frames), flowers, incense, c andles, any other meaningful objec ts. Ideally this will stand in a room dedicated to spiritual practice, but if this is not possible, find some way of closing it off when not in use, fo r example, with movable screens. What do you think about the possibility and relevance of making your mind a \"sacred space\" or receptacle for the Divin e? Can you invoke, during your prayer of meditation, a sense of intense love or devotion towards the Divine, or a symbol of it like Christ or Divine Mother? What are the problems or resistances you encounter within yourself to these ideas? Do you encounter scorn or other negative reactions from important others? 3. Prayer. Prayer is an important part of worship. In its most elementary form, it can be seen as asking for what we want, yet most of us would have some unease about this, and might want to consider more ca refully what our prayer should be. As a supplement to ACIM, two fu rther small books were \"channelled\": \"Psychotherapy; Purpose, Process and Practi ce\", and \"The Song of Prayer; Prayer Forgiveness and Healing\" (both published by the Foundation for Inner Peace, 1976/1996). Consider this extrac t from the Song of Prayer: \"Prayer is a stepping aside; a letting go, a quiet time of listening and loving. It 87should not be confused with s upplication of any kind, because it is a way of remembering your holiness. Why should holiness entreat, being fully entitled to everything Love has to offer? And it is to love you go in prayer. Prayer is an offering; a giving up of yourself to be at one with Love. There is nothing to ask because there is nothing left to want. That nothingness becomes the altar of God. It disappears in Him.\" (Song of Prayer, ch1,I.5). How does this compare with your own id eas about prayer? What do you think prayer is? If you are asking for someth ing, who are you asking, and why? \"The Practice of the Presence of God\" is a delightful and classic little work written mainly by Brother Lawrence, a seventeenth c entury monk, whose simple discipline (!) it was to try to think always of the Divine (i.e., to pray). It is well worthwhile to read this book (it is readily available at, for exam ple, Christian bookst ores). How do his recommendations compare with thos e in \"The Song of Prayer\"? For the next week or so, as well as your meditation, you might like to include prayer in your daily practice. Write so me notes on your experience, and consider whether you want to include prayer as par t of your regular sp iritual healing work. 88Chapter 9: Self Preoccupation, Self Will and Surrender We look around and see other people and things as if from a central point of observation. We seem to be t he centre of our world, much as the Earth seemed, before Galileo, to be the centre of the Universe. As we grow from childhood we learn some limits to our self importance, but the privat e impression of self-centredness remains, at some level. As a dying patient once said to me: \"I can't imagine the world without me in it!\". This self preoccupation or sense of personal \"specialness\" generates various problems. For example, it s eems to confer entitlement to all kinds of privileges: to health, long life, a degree of prosperity and comfort, and so on, with variations according to our cultural upbringing. Inevit ably, some of these desires are frustrated, giving rise to the inner conflict that we call unhappiness. To counter this, we try to change things around ourselves, but as sages east and west have long pointed out, this is difficult, and in the end, irrelevant: we c an't change the world to any great extent, we can only change ourselves, our reaction to events. An even more fundamental problem with livi ng life as a special being is that it obscures our true identity. In fact, what we identify with can be seen as the main issue in spiritual growth and healin g. The choice is between being a separate entity locked in a struggle to get what one want s from the world, or an id entity as a small part of something infinitely larger, a Cosmic Mind perhaps. As Easwaran puts it, in \"Original Goodness\": \"In the end, the goal of all spiritual seek ing is to live in this state of self- forgetfulness permanently. This continuous awareness of God is to be achieved not after death, but here and now; that is what brings heaven on earth........ \"The Lord's Prayer says plainly, 'Thy will be done.' But before His will can be done, our will - self will - has to go. William Law put it precisely: 'To sum up all in a word: nothing hath separated us from God but our own will, or rather our own will is our separation from God'. \"Here again we must remember that words like 'Lord' a nd 'God' do not refer to some higher being in another gal axy. We are talking about a barrier that separates us from our own deepest self, the very source and ground of what makes us human and gives meaning to our lives.\" ( p 63-4). The prospect of such a shift in identification can be profoundly unsettling to our egos; our minds turn immediately to what we would have to \"give up\" Our whole western culture is based on the idea that our individuality is somehow special and sacred. Yet what if we could \"look down\" at ourselves from a detached viewpoint, much 89as an adult might look at small children throwi ng tantrums in a schoolyard. Or if we saw ourselves (as beings from another galaxy might), as small fish in a school of millions of the same species. Might not our insi stence on our individua l importance look ridiculous? Here is an another excerpt from A Course in Miracles (ACIM): \"This fragment of your mind is such a tiny part of it that, could you but appreciate the whole, you would see instantly that it is like the smallest sunbea m to the sun, or like the faintest ripple on the surface of the oc ean. In its amazing arrogance, this tiny sunbeam has decided it is the sun; this almost imperceptible ripple hails itself as the ocean. Think how alone and frightened is this little thought, this infinitesimal illusion, holding itself apart against the universe. \" ...... Do not accept this little, fenced-o ff aspect as yourself. The sun and ocean are as nothing beside what you are.\" (ACIM Text ch18.VIII.3.3) In other words, we are advised to submer ge ourselves in the larger whole, or God, and give up the childish insistence on co mplete autonomy. This is the often misunderstood concept of spiritual \"surrender\", which can sound supine, but which, as anyone who has made the slightest effort in th is direction will attest, is an intensely active process and perhaps the toughest challe nge we can ever face. The promise is, that as we learn to \"let go and let God\", to allow ourselves to be guided rather than insisting on control, we will begin to ex perience the peace and healing that comes with an awareness of our true identity. Far from losing ourselv es, we will find we are much more than we imagined. Our lives will begin to take directions that benefit ourselves and those around us. There is no suggestion t hat we should abandon activity; instead, we are asked to give up our emotional investment in or attachment to our different roles, placing ourselves at the service of the Div ine. A better word than \"surrender\" may be \"non-attachment\", since the essence of the process is to continue to act, but without emotional investment in the outcomes of our actions; that is left to God. You will find this concept everywhere in wh atever spiritual tradition you read. It needs careful, slow turning over in one's mind , and experimentation in our own lives. In chapter 6 we briefly explored the negative face of self image - our tendency to guilt. In this session we are beginning to look at the self in an alternative, and intensely positive, way: as a small part of a magnificent whole. Please note that none of this means we are not important, or that we don't matter to the Divine; again, the spiritual traditions all emphasise that we each have our part to play. We could visualise ourselves as pieces of a giant jig-saw puzzle, a whole that would be spoiled by the absence of even one piece. Note also that this is not a mo ral question we are discussing, but a matter of ultimate identity. Of course it is important to be considerate to others, to \"do as we would be done by\", but underlying that is the much more fu ndamental issue of how we view ourselves in relationship to others, and to the world. Highly \"moral\" behaviour can be very selfish, as when we do good works to look good or boos t a flagging self esteem. 90Some religions, such as Christianity, emphasis e the importance of the individual; others, like Buddhism, say there is no separate \"self\". I don't thin k these views are as opposite as they may at first appear . We can reconcile them by concentrating on how our experience shifts, with spiritual practice, from a sense of total separateness to at least occasional flashes of being part of something much more grand. Figure 9.1 is a diagram drawn up as a result of discussions in one of our classes, showing some of the conseque nces of an insistence on our personal importance, and a route to returning to communion with the Divine through forgiveness. 91 WHAT OUR PATIENTS HAVE WRITTEN *Roles have different purposes. Some are for growth, some are for fun, some are for others. Can I perform a role like mothering without being emot ionally attached to the outcome? That's pretty hard. Perhaps I should just be trying to do my best and l eave the rest to God. I try to do that, but it is difficult. *Exercise 1: Giving up our roles My roles in priority from most important: Spiritual questor - being not doing: This is my life's focus now and my other roles have faded into the background. If I were an Indian man I would now be on my spiritual \"walkabout\" having completed my obligations to my family. Mother: My children are grown, self-sufficient, l eading their own lives and my relationship with them is loving. I am available to give help or advice if asked just as they are available to me. Friend: Closeness without neediness Cancer patient : Has become less and less of a role - just is a statement about what is Unemployed: My job was \"out-sourced\" about four months before I was diagnosed which event stopped all plans for finding another similar position. I am gr ateful for those four months of \"doing nothing\" and thank providence for providing that downtime. My life is quite simple now and I can't think of any other roles that I play although I know that I can enter into roles if I choose to. It is rather like playing a character in a play - but I am always aware that I am playing a part. I look on this type of role playing as a means of functioning and getting things done in this society. Once again, I don't think that the i ssue is giving up roles but rather being unattached to them. *Exercise 2: Practicing silence Last night I practiced 3 hours of silence with (partner and daughter). They both felt very uncomfortable with me being silent. (He) felt that he had to be silent too, and (she) felt very insecure with me not talking. By the end of the 3 hours, she was in tears because I couldn't talk to her. I found it quite freeing. I felt as though I was there, but I was also very detached from what was going on. My silence allowed me to give up two roles that I usually play, t hat of the pleaser and that of the mediator. Being unable to talk, I wasn't able to cater to anyone, because I couldn't ask the two of them what they wanted. They had to fare for themselves. (She) is quite em otional, and she usually gets upset with (him) for one reason or another when they are playing. I usually step in and talk to her about it and try to resolve the dispute. When she got upset last night, I couldn't ta lk to her, so I just gave her a hug, and let her come around in her own time to being friends with (him) again. Without my help, she settled her disputes with him quite easily. I realized that they don't need me to play that role, they are quite capable of doing it themselves. When I think about this, I realize how contro lling I am. In my effort to make sure everyone is happy, I try to control their actions, instead of just le tting them flow. I always thought of this as trying to please, but it really is an attempt to control. *I see myself as a tiny part of a vast web of life that is connected to a higher power. Now I realize that at times my sense of who I am in this web is greatly inflated - when I'm absorbed in my own worries and anxieties I tend to lose my sense of myself in relation to the larger universe. It' s as if my existence is 92composed of many many layers, including the collecti on of memories of moments in my life, events, feelings, dramas, fears, etc. When I notice this and am able to strip away or discard these layers, I can begin to picture myself as just a tiny particle, co nnected to this vast web of life on earth, and I can imagine, in a very crude way, how this web of life is just a tiny speck in an infinite universe. When I \"fix\" my sense of self to the many things that make up my sense of identity, then this sense of self takes up much more of my consciousness. For example, when I think of myself as a wife, mother, daughter, sister, etc. then I have all kinds of thoughts related to my life with the people I love. Sometimes these thoughts (memories, hopes, worries, etc.) consume my aw areness and I become swept away by feelings of sadness, and fear of loss related to these people. When I am able to transcend this sense of identity and picture myself as just a minute part of a vast unive rse, then I can be more detached as I look down at myself in daily life, and am less swept away by my usual worries. 93 EXERCISES 1. Giving up our roles: Get a number of small pieces of paper of equal size (for example, by tearing standard sheets into 8 or 12), and on each piece, write one of the role s you play in life, eg, wife, mother, part-time volunteer, acc ountant, student, teacher ...... Include words describing parts that you play as a result of your personality: author ity figure, life of the party, wet blanket .......... Have you included any that descr ibe your spiritual seeking? Now lay these out and assign a priority to each. Then stack them in order. Then start discarding, from the botto m of the order (the least-val ued role), pausing to reflect as you think that you are giving up that function. As the pile shrinks, and you reach the last few attributes or roles, watch your mind carefully, i.e. consider what you think would be the impact of dropping these on the m eaningfulness and pleasure of your life. Write about this. What was most difficu lt to \"give up\" and why? Can you continue to act in your various ro les with less attachment to them? 2: Practice of Silence: Mahatma Gandhi observed a period of s ilence every day, which he would not break for anyone, not even the most important of visiting statesmen. When we are voluntarily silent for a time we begin to understand a number of important things: for example, how we use energy in speaking; how others may relate to our words rather than to who we are; how our self image depends on being able to justify ourselves. For this exercise, choose a period when you wo uld normally be interacting with others, explain to them what you are doing, and ma intain silence for a time ranging from 3 hours to 24 hours or more. Wr ite about what you learn. 3. Imagery of subpersonalities: We can think of our personalities as bei ng made up of a number of \"individuals\" each with its own particular qualities. Thus we might have an \"inner child\" (thought patterns that were active in childhood), an \"inner critic\" (t hat part of ourselves, perhaps an \"internalised parent\", that constantly judges what we do, a \"bold explorer\", a \"romantic, sensitive artist\", a \"hard worker\", and a \"wimp\". After relaxing deeply, allow an image to co me up that seems to represent a part of yourself. See if you can give it a name. Perhaps you can even talk to it, as you may have done in the past with the \"Inner Healer\" (who is also a part of us). If you do get a reasonably clear image, draw i t, and write a description. Visit this image again next week and in subsequent weeks, and note changes. If this seems to work for you, you ma y be able to generate/identify a number of 94such subpersonalities. Are ther e one or more that seem to hav e a \"spiritual\" flavour? If ideas and images are slow in coming, help t hem along with your conscious ideas; ie. think about your main activities and how yo u tend to behave while performing them, and see if a picture, however vague and fanciful, come s to mind. For exampl e, if you tend to be a controlling person in your environmen t, you might summon up an image of an authoritarian figure, perhaps exaggerated. (As background for this work it would be helpful to read about a kind of therapy called \"Psychosynthesis\", as described, for ex ample, in the book of that name by R. Assagioli, and/or the books by Alice Epstein or Robert Elliott, listed in the bi bliography). 4. Our sense of being cared for: Read the well-known \"Footprints\" story (bel ow). Then, in a deeply relaxed state, imagine yourself as being carried by the Lord through a difficult per iod of your life, perhaps through the experience of cancer. You can vary the imagery by imagining walking across a desert plain until you reach a huge statue of the Buddha, which you enter through a side door, and, climbing up many steps, emerge into the \"cradle\" formed by his hands held in front of his body. Lie th ere, imagining yourself held in total love and security. Write about either experience. ........................................ Footprints One night a man had a dream. He dreamed he was walking along the beach with the Lord. Across the sky fl ashed scenes from his life. For each scene he noticed two sets of footprin ts in the sand----one belonging to him and the other to the Lord. When the last scene of his life flashe d before him, he looked back at the footprints in the sand. He noticed that many times along the path of his life there was only one set of footpr ints. He also no ticed that this happened during the lowest an d saddest times in his life. This really bothered him and he que stioned the Lord about it. \"Lord, you said that once I decided to follow you, you would walk with me all the way. But I noticed that during the mo st troublesome times in my life, there is only one set of footprints. I don' t understand why, when I needed you most, you deserted me.\" The Lord replied, \"My precious, pr ecious child, I love you and I would never leave you. During your times of trial and suffering when you see only one set of footprints, it was then that I carried you.\" 95 Author unknown Meditation: If you haven't already done so, choose one of the methods you have learned for continuing daily practice. It will also be va luable for you to continue the mind-watching from time to time, until it becomes a regular habit to monitor your thoughts. 96Chapter 10: Desire and Acceptance We are largely driven by our desires: for comfort, first of all, meaning freedom from pain, a full belly, warmth, shelter, se curity, sex; then with these basic \"needs\" satisfied, for a degree of contro l over events, and for stimulation or diversion. We take this for granted - what else would we do? And is there something \"wrong\" with this? Such a central assumption in our lives needs investigation, if we are serious about the spiritual path. The list above coul d be equally well applied to the motivation of an intelligent animal like a dog. The question we need to ask ourselves is: \" Is that all? Is there something more?\" The problem with being completely desire-driven is that it will keep us at the \"animal\" le vel of development. There is a famous passage from the Upanishads, an ancient Indian text: \"You are what your deep, driving desire is. As your deep, driving desire is, so is your will. As your will is, so is your deed. As your deed is, so is your destiny.\" In other words, we become what we desire. If it's food, we may become obese. If money, we may become rich, and if power, then we are likely to gain control over others. All of these ac complishments have a cost. And the desire is frequently frustrated, leading to unhappiness. The spiritual traditions all propose an opposite course to the pursuit of satisfaction of our desires, namely, to try to free ourselves from desire. They point out that attachments of any kind are imprisoning - we can all see, in the modern world, how our super-abundance of possessions can become a trap, and in a similar way, how an obsession with some kind of personal acco mplishment can stunt our lives, e.g., the drive to make money. It is not that there is any thing wrong with pleasure, they point out, simply that it is irrelevant, and its pursuit distract s us from the spiritual goal of finding meaning in relationship to a larger whole. This sounds very foreign, at first, to the modern western person, who has probably been conditioned since early childhood to strive towards the related goals of becoming special (chapter 9) and accomplis hing a series of self-determined and societally-sanctioned objectives. \"If I'm not f eeding my desires, what fun would there be in life?\" The answer of the scriptures is that true joy will not be known until personal desire is mastered. 97 \"I sought for many things, and found despair. Now do I seek but one, for in that one is all I need, and only what I need. All that I sought before I needed not, and did not even want. My only need I did not recognise. But now I see that I need only truth. In that all needs are satisfied, all cravings end, all hopes are finally fulfilled and dreams are gone. Now I have everything I could need. Now I have everything that I could want. And now at last I find myself at peace.\" (A Course in Miracles Workbook, lesson 251) As usual, the goal seems lofty and impossi bly distant. What can we ordinary people do as a first step? Think back to chapter 4, on judgement, and recall how busy our minds are, most of the time, judging other people and si tuations. We always seem to want something different from what we are currently experiencing - if you still don't believe it, you will need to do more work checking this out by close attention to the mind. This constant wanting, naturally, breeds discontent. The Buddhist texts, in particular are very clear on the misery this generates. So this suggests our first step: can we become aware of the clamour of our desires, and tr y to suspend them? Can we replace the constant dissatisfaction with events or people by an acceptance of what is, of whatever set of circumstances we find our selves in? Or what amounts to the same thing: can we focus precisely on the present moment, rather than the past or the future? The Tao Te Ching, a central text of t he Taoist religion, has this to say: \"There is no greater sin than desire, No greater curse than discontent, No greater misfort une than wanting something for oneself. Therefore he who knows that enough is enough will always have enough.\" (Tao Te Ching, chapter 46) 98WHAT OUR PATIENTS HAVE WRITTEN Wants What would be lost by giving it up What would be gained To be more efficient at work very little- it is an illusion that I need to be? Less stress To give up work basic living expenses : boredom less stress: explore other interests To give up playing computer games none really (stress reliever) more time to do more meaningful things Good Income simple pleasure pressure decreased to conform to expected lifestyle work on educational projects opportunity to share expertise time for other pursuits more money, less debt Nothing would be lost by giving up this desire Less stress over my financial situation *I don't see that desire is the trap (negative) but that it is (1) being unable to distinguish need from want. When I can recognize wanting it becomes part of the spiritual journey. It's (2) to detach from the gaol of wanti ng and is far more humanly attainable than detaching from desire. It means I don't have to get what I want. I'm not attached to the outcome. I just watch the wanting mind and practise. I see my needs. I see my wants. I can or don't let them move me (3) It's my choice. *Perhaps acceptance is to live with our desires , needs and wants, just as they are. They do not have to be attached to behaviours. It's our choice. 99EXERCISES 1. Distinguishing \"wants\" from \"needs\": It is easy to confuse these two, and we are all very skilled at rationalising our wants. So to put ourselves on the spot, try an exercise like the following. List your wants, in all aspects of life, in a column, then check in an adjacent column which of them is, in fact, a need. You might use as system like \"2\" means definite need, \"1\" a small need, and \"0\" means not really needed. It should be quite easy to find 30 or more. This process of analysis could then be extended by listing the pros and cons of giving up those want s that are not needed: Wants Needs What would be lost by giving it up What would be gained Basic nutrition 2 (not applicable) High fat deserts 0 Immediate satisf action slimmer, healthier body Accomplishing more at work 1 very little in fact Stress would be eased, and more time freed up, with less emphasis on work and so on....... 2. Our cherished ideals: As an adjunct to exercise 1, make a list of your most cherished ideals about yourself, how you must look and act, what y ou must accomplish; e.g.\"I must always be smartly dressed when seen in pu blic\"; \"I must earn the re spect of my colleagues at work\"; \"I must keep my husband/wife happy\". This list could also be very long, if you do it conscientiously. Then against each item, write a modifying comment, after reflection, e.g.: \"I aim to please my s pouse, but his happiness is his ow n responsibility\", and so on. 3. Fasting: One area where the power of desire is exposed rather starkly is in eating and drinking. We have all had to make choices between what tastes good and what we believe is nutritious for ourselves. It would be fair to say that we have some degree of \"addiction\" to food, meaning t hat we are preoccupied with the pleasure of eating beyond that necessary to sustain life. This is a habit we learned early, and develop further during life as we associate eating with t he delights of a varied and tasty diet. 100 As with all our habits we need to investi gate this one. Fasting is one way to do this; it sharpens our awareness of why we seek sensations from food, over and above supporting our bodies. A simple version of th is exercise is to forgo an evening meal: notice how the body reacts to missing the ex pected food; more important, notice your thoughts and feelings before, dur ing and after this; heighten the experience, if you wish, by observing others eat while you do not. A more demanding level of the exercise is to fast for 24 hours or more, taking only water or perhaps fruit juices, and reco rding the same observations. Write about your own urge to eat: how much of it is habit and desire for .... . taste sensations, diversion, a feeling of fullness in the stom ach (ie comfort), social interaction, other ends? What would be, for you, an optim al degree of control over what you eat? Meditation. I hope that by now you are continuing y our meditation as a routine. Its an excellent idea to read some of the many books about it, to give you some perspective, but nothing can substitute for the actual practice! 101Chapter 11: Living a More Spiritual Life It is time to put together what we hav e learned and consider how we want to conduct our lives from here on. Reading about spirituality is important, but in the end it is action that matters, action that takes place primarily in the mind. How can I live a more spiritual life? What is it important that I do? The first decision is about priorities . To heal spiritually, and hence psychologically and physically, this must be the top priority in life, in the same way as making money would need to be the top priority of someone who w anted to get rich quickly. We tend to think immediately of what this would require us to \"give up\", which weakens resolve. So if you are pers uaded that spiritual growth and healing is important, start by affirming frequent ly that this is your top concern, at least for the next couple of years (after which you will not have any ambivalence about it). Swami Radha used to point out that people readily accept the need to s pend five to ten years or more training for a career; why not put the same amount of effort into something even more important, finding our true nature? Another way of defining your priorities is to ask: \"with what do I want to identify?\" Is our identity simply that of a biological animal, liv ing a basically pointless life on this earth, then disappearing foreve r, or can we discover our identity as an eternal, non- material being, part of an immensely larger framework or Intelligence? In other words, do our lives have meaning? Is the point of our lives simply to have as much pleasure or comfort as possible, or is it to find this meaning? Having decided to \"go for it\", what then? In the most general terms, our task is to become as aware as possible. When the Buddha wa s asked what he was, was he a saint, a god, and so on, he is reputed to have r eplied: \"I am awake\" . What does being \"awake\" or aware mean? It means, initially, tr ying to know what is going on in our minds at all times. You will be aware by now of the stream of judgem ent and commentary on oneself and others that constitute s most mental life. Being aware gives us the option of changing this self talk. We can then replac e it with a degree of qui et, and/or with more helpful ideas, such as \"choosing only love\". This can extend into the most mundane areas; for example, rather t han feeling bored with our daily functions and tasks, with our environment, friends and colleagues, we can cu ltivate gratitude and in terest, awareness of all that has gone into providing us with food, for example, interest in the ever- changing patterns of weather, gratitude that our bowels are working! The next attribute to consider, having decided to make spiritual development a priority and to cultivate awareness, might be dedication . This lies a little \"downstream\", as it were, from setting priorities, and refers to the actions we take, clearing a space for the task. It helps, and is probably essential, to simplify life as much as possible to leave room for spiritual exercises. While the point is , ultimately, to \"spiritu alise\" everything we 102do, so that outward actions need not differ at all from the ordinary, most of us need plenty of time dedicated to meditation, readi ng, and reflection, separate from the routine events of life. So consider how you can si mplify, meaning, what can go? TV, and other media? Some of the pointless socialising that takes so much time and energy? Some of the excess time spent at work? Having \"set the scene\" with an appropriate attitude to the spiritual healing journey, we then ask ourselves what specific techniques we will employ. Here schools of thought differ somewhat, but the methods we use may not matter as much as the dedication with which we pursue them. Easter n systems of spiritual education are often far more demanding that anything we are accu stomed to in the Wes t. However, other teachers have come from India and adapted these methods to the western mind (making them less severe!). An example is the \"8-point\" program of Eknath Easwaran, which you will find in m any of his books. We can list some basic processes that ar e common to most systems of spiritual evolution. Most of this repeats w hat has been said earlier in this book: 1. Developing understanding: This comes from reading and discussion, and particularly from conscientiously examining the application of sp iritual insights to our own lives. This course has attempt ed to convey the most important ideas. 2. Quietening the mind: Having explored our obstacles with reason, we then need to drop the compulsive thinking, and listen , meaning be aware, through the senses, of what our physical organism is doing, and even more important, trying to be aware of the Divine within. Meditati on in its various forms is the classical discipline for cultivating this listening faculty. 3. Affirmation: Putting into our minds what we want to become. Easwaran recommends this strongly (see the additi onal reading) and his preferred method of meditation is to repeat the lines of inspirational passages and prayers, without \"editorialising\". I have suggested here that we can say to ourselves, in all situations, \"(I will) choose only love\". Y ou may have seen, if you have consulted A course in Miracles, that it includes 365 daily exercises which are essentially affirmations to seed into our minds; this could become a course of continuing self study for graduates of the present course. 4. Attending to relationships: Other people and events are opportunities to practise the attitudes of non-judgemental acceptance, and eventua lly to understand that we are not separate, but at one with all living things. 5. A continuing dialogue with the Divine? This is what the great sages tell us is possible, and desirable. Gary Zukav, in his excellent and forthright book \"The Seat of the Soul\" says we need to \"ent er into a partnersh ip with the Divine Intelligence\". At some stage we do need to go beyond exploration and quietening the mind, and make a decision, involving an act of faith, that there is a larger Intelligence or God, and that our task is to find out what we are meant to do according to this Divine Order, while dropping our separate personal agendas. 103 This is a place to comment on two further, related \"techniques\" advocated within many spiritual and religious traditions. The fi rst is \"listening to an inner voice\" or to God's \"Voice\". It is the experience of many sincere s eekers (myself included) that \"messages\" will come from a transcendent source if we are open to receiving them. The difficulty is to distinguish this genuine \"higher\" communication from the self-serving voice of the ego. It is probably rare for communication to be in a form like human speech, although this does happen. More commonly, answers to questions and problems we may have are provided through other means - what other people say, our dreams, symbolic answers in the form of ev ents around us. Which leads to the second and related point about communication with the tr anscendent order. If we are spiritually sincere, events in our lives come to hav e meaning, to answer questions and to provide direction and teaching. A simple exampl e would be a headache, which can teach the sufferer to slow down and pay a ttention to his or her behaviour s. It is not that some divine parent manipulates things such that we are provided with salutary difficulties in life; rather that our perc eptions of and projections upon the world create, usually unconsciously, what we need to further our growth. We can choose to examine, and indeed construct, the symbolic meaning of ever ything that happens to us. But it is not all \"our\" own creation; at some point we will experience the Universe \"reaching down\" to help us. One of the benefits of life-threat ening disease is that we may be much more open to receiving this kind of help and support than at other times. If you are serious about your spiritual work, your interests and attitudes may change considerably. While this will often im prove your relationships with other people, some, especially those close to you, ma y not like these changes. They may, for example, feel guilty or inadequat e if you are doing what they se cretly feel they \"ought\" to do; you may be less interested in some former joint activities, such as watching movies or media generally; you will bec ome much more sensitive to the motives underlying the actions of others, and when they realise this, it can provoke discomfort, even anger. It has to be said that if one partner becomes dedicated to sp iritual work while the other does not, this can place a strain on the marri age. I can only suggest being very alert for the impact your study may be hav ing on your relationships. Ex plain to your family what you are doing, and how important it is to you. Don't hold fo rth about what you are doing to others - your work and experiences, your enthusiasm for it even, should be kept relatively private. Talking about it a lot, or wo rse, trying to convert them, is irritating to most people. Practise forgiveness of t hem for their old, perhaps previously unobjectionable habits! 104 WHAT OUR PATIENTS HAVE WRITTEN *Today, I work 15 hours a week [instead of 60], and I do a number of activities that are centered only on me. I have very little pressure in my life, and what pressure I do have, I now have techniques for releasing. I think about my feelings, I worry about me, I am grateful for everyday, and I have dev eloped a wonderful spiritual connection. I am at peace with myself and t he life that I now have. To a great extent, I have been able to put my past behind me. I am more loving, compassionate and tolerant than I ever knew I could be. I am a lucky lady! *Cancer has accelerated the process of looking at the meaning of life. Exploring our individual role as part of the whole is something I don't think I would have pursued with such determination. Cancer has also taught me much about peace and that lovely safe place within. *At the current point in my life the adventure of self discovery as well as discovering all the new avenues to which I am being exposed fills me with awe, and I have an extremely strong desire to c ontinue in this direction......... the techniques I am currently incorporati ng into my lifestyle fill me with joy and contentment. *I feel certain that I will continue this heal ing work, at deeper levels, for the rest of my life, regardless of the state of my health or external variables. This healing work has helped me to experience life in a deeper and mo re fulfilling way, and it is clear to me that there is no limit to this depth as long as I stay involved in the process, ie. as a lifelong process. I'm very grateful to hav e been able to find more meaning in my life - the healing work has been a motivator and a vehicle for me to do this. My spiritual development has become a prim ary focus in my life. I don't see it as a separate category, but someth ing integral to my life and part of everything I do. The more deeply I've become involved in spiritual practice, the more effortless it seems to lead a spiritual life. I don't mean \"effortless\" in the sense that it isn't hard work, but rather that a spiritual focus or outlook come s to me more naturally now than in the past. My spiritual development is the most important thing now in my life, because it affects so strongly how I am living each day, and al so because it prepares me to accept my own death when the time comes. 105 EXERCISES Since this is the last \"working session\" of the book, I have listed a number of exercises which could, if necessary, be spread over a prolonged period. Some version of the \"Action Plan\" (#3) should, however , be done in a thorough fashion in the near future, if you are serious about moving on with your self healing. 1. \"Mechanical\" behavior: List the things that you do during the day in a mechanical or unaware fashion, starting with getting up in the morning, bat hroom, breakfast, and continuing through the day. Against some of these, write down affi rmations or ideas that you could encourage in your mind as aids to appreciating and fully experiencing these ev ents. (Thich Nhat Hanh's books contain wonderful advice on how to be more \"mindful\" in our daily lives). Then list some of the mechanical or automatic reactions that you have to common situations; there are hundreds of these, examples: - \"I hate it when the weather is .......\" - \"I always feel tired at the end of the day\" - \"I am always afraid of ............\" - \"I can't stand to be bored .....\" - \"I don't like people who .......\" - \"I need to eat whenever .....\" - \"If I don't get my x hours of sleep I......\" - \"It's not fair to ask someone to .......\" What have you learned from this ? What can you do about it? 2. Goals revisited: Carry out the imaginary exercise, in a re laxed state, of looking back at your younger self at a number of different stages in your life, eg 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 years ago (depending on your pres ent age). If you could give th is younger self advice, today, what would you tell him or her ? What should she make the direction of her life? Can you move in this direction now? 1063. Setting out an action plan : There are many ways to do this, and you ma y prefer to develop your own, but the important thing is to translate new understandi ngs into action. One possible way is to go through the 5 \"levels\" of a person that we have described in chapter 2: body, conscious mind, deeper mind, social and sp iritual, and set down the changes you need to make at each level, according to a scheme like the one below: Current habits: what I do each day. What is it about this pattern that is not-ideal? What keeps me stuck in this? What would be an ideal, although realistic, practice for me daily? What benefits do I expect from this? What is the first step towards the changes I want to make? How will I counteract the obstacles (resistances, old habits) that I encounter? Review also the things you have learned in this course and in any others that you may have taken, as you set out an action plan for yourself for the coming months. Be sure to include the \"staples\" in it: regular writing (in a journal), daily reflection and meditation, mind watching, and at least one of the \"body awareness\" disciplines; e.g. deep relaxation, hatha yoga, tai chi or chi gong. 1074: Attending a spiritual service : Attend some community spiritual activities. These could be church services (if you are not in the habit of going to church), a meditation group, or group meetings to study scriptural writings. Pick something t hat you think may challenge and extend your ideas. Write about the experience. 5. Dream analysis : Dreams provide a \"window\" into parts of the mind that are not normally accessible to us. We all dream, and can learn to catch our dreams. Tell yourself before you go to sleep that you intend to wake afte r a dream and record it , and have paper and pen, plus a suitable light, readily availabl e by the bed. When you wake, keep your movements to a minimum and immediately writ e down as much as you can remember. The feelings aroused are important, and need to be noted. Put down any impressions about the meaning of the dr eam at that time. Then return to sleep. In the morning, you can analyse your dream by going through it and underlining all the words and phrases that seem signific ant, and noting especially all the symbols in the dream; the individuals, setting, objects, and events all symbolise something. Then consider each of these in turn, letting any a ssociations that you have to the word come to your awareness. Write these down. When this listing is finished, go through the whole account, when you may find that some of the alternative meanings of the words or symbols you have used provide an expla nation of the dream-play that was not originally obvious. For the keen student, dream analysis can become part of the repertoire of techniques for self understanding. You will probably need to read one of the many available books on the subject. There are various systems: you might explore several approaches and find what suits you best. 6. Your expectations and goals from this work: Have a look back at what you wrote about your expectations in chapter 3 (a) Did you get what you expected/ hoped from the work in this book? (b) How do you currently see your goals for your spiritual journey? Do they differ from what you laid out in chapter 3? Meditation Review your experiences with meditation over this course. Did you experience greater \"depth\" in your meditation when you concentrated on one technique for several weeks? What problems did you encounter (eg, maintaining regular practice)? What benefits did you gain? What is the next step for you? 108 Part III: Release from Suffering 109Chapter 12: Release from suffering I've given this last chapter a rather dr amatic title, echoing the teachings of the Buddha, and other spiritual leaders: what we are all seeking, in the end, is release from the various kinds of conflict associated with living, suffering that presents itself in extreme form when a serious disease is di agnosed. Our first thought when told we have cancer may be \"I just want it to disappear; to have my life back as it was\", but as time passes we may identify an even more fundamental wish: for peace of mind. The spiritual search is for peace, love, experience of meaning, a state of mind that may bring physical healing, although it is not guaranteed to do so. O ne of our patients expressed it in the following way: *I think one of the most positive effects of my spiritual work is that it has broadened my view of what heal ing means, to one that goes beyond physical healing. Because the course of my illness is quite unc ertain, I find that having a goal of physical recovery isn't enough. Certainly I hope for physi cal recovery, but realize that the extent and time span of this recovery are unknown, and may be less than I would ideally like..... I find I am beginning to be able to let go of my sadness and anger about the uncertainty of my future when I am able to think of healing in a broader sense, which includes emotional and spiritual healing. What we find as we undertake psychospiritual work Let us look back now over the work we have done in chapters 3 - 11, and try to fit it into a general scheme of psycho-spiritual healing. You will have noticed how much of our work has been psychological in nature: we examined our pervasive habits of judging or condemning other people, and our usual dissatisfaction with conditions around us generally. Then we looked at self-judgement, which leads to guilt, although this is often unconscious. To protect ourselves against the pain of self criticism, and to absolve ourselves from responsibility for creating our own experience, we us e various defenses: blaming and projection, developing an exaggerated sense of self im portance, and a preoccupation with personal desires. To see the validity of this rather grim picture, it is quite essential to do our own self-study; I have found, in myself and in t herapeutic work with hundreds of people, that most of us are only dimly awar e of these mental processes at first. Many would claim, on first contact with these ideas, that they do not judge or doubt th emselves, and that their problems are all the result of events beyond their control. We become familiar with our minds only when we go through a process of disciplined introspection. Orthodox psychotherapy deals, of course, with most of these habits and 110perceptions, the usual aim being to help peopl e strengthen their sense of self worth, and to guide them towards healthier interacti ons with others. The spiritual journey has an additional, and much deeper, ultimate purpose: to discover, or uncover, the real self behind these habitual psychological patterns. If spiritual grow th is our aim, however, it is not enough simply to meditate, or read spiritual texts. We need to do the psychological work first, because when we are locked into self interest and self protection we cannot connect spiritually; ther e is little \"room\" for apprehending the more subtle divine order, which is drowned out by our internal chatter (we are familiar with an analogous phenomenon at t he social level - some people are so wrapped up in their own affairs, or their own thinking, that they have little ability to attend to what others want or say!). How do the Psychological and Spiritual Tasks Fit Together? The map in fig 12.1 is a simple picture of the whole process. According to the spiritual view, our core problem arises from our separation fr om the Divine Source. This has led to the distorted self image and defens ive patterns that we have been examining, and these habits in turn reinforce the separat ion. As supposedly separate beings, each the assumed centre of his or her own univers e, conflict with others is inevitable. The right-hand side of the diagram shows this process of separation and subsequent disharmony. I have described those events abov e the horizontal mid-line as \"spiritual\" because conventional psychology does not recognise separation from the divine as a primary cause of dysfunction. The left side of the diagram shows the proc ess of healing, first in psychological and then spiritual terms. We aim to regain connectedness. We practise first in areas familiar to conventional psychology: forgiv eness or acceptance of other people, leading to the central task of accepting ourselves. The path becomes specifically spiritual when we begin to focus on fostering an ever stronger connection with the Divine, through gradual diminishing of self will, seeking guidance, and trying to be a \"channel\" for or witness to the unconditional love that grows in strength within us. Eventually, we need to adjust our lives according to our growi ng understanding of what we are meant to be and do. As we learn that we are a part of a larger whole, we see that we can choose to direct that part of it which we access to wards helping or healing, rather than towards protecting our separateness, and competing with or exploiting others. All phases of this work demand attention and effort: there is no escaping this fact, and any system of psychological or spiritual healing that pr ofesses to offer an easy way is inauthentic and misleading. In particular, the concept of surrender or non-attachment, alluded to in chapter 9, is difficult for t he western person, who has been trained from birth to assert his or her individual will. The concept is often misunderstood. To reiterate, it is not a passive or resigned acceptance, but a willingness to downplay our egocentric desires in favour of conformity with a much greater wisdom; to \"hand over\" our care to the Divine. Another way to pr actise surrender or acceptance, as explained 111by Eckhart Tolle in his wonderful book \"The Po wer of Now\", is to attend fully to the present moment, instead of thinking constantly of past or future events. It does not mean being inactive. On the contrary, we need to be intensely active in our self management, and we may choose to live very active lives, not for self gratification, but in a spirit of service to the Divine and to others. Trust is required: *I think that I have developed a stronger trus t in God in the past year....... Initially I felt overwhelmed by the news (of metastatic spread, but).... by the time I was ready to go to bed I was able to calm down, and I did this by reminding myself that I could accept whatever happened, that it is God's will, and I could pray for strength and peace of mind. As I've intensified my daily prayer, I ha ve felt relief from thes e initial feelings of panic. Metaphors can aid understanding. The state of mind commended by spiritual masters could be likened to that of an em ployee dedicated to the service of his company or institution. The good employee learns to listen closely to what she is meant to do, and seeks guidance, rather than pushing a privat e agenda. Or another image: getting connected spiritually is like tuning our mental radio, av oiding the static, and centering in on the beautiful music that is available on certain st ations. We find out what the Universe wants of us by paying close attention, using the practices we have learned: meditation, prayer, devotion to a spiritual symbol like Ch rist, Krishna or the Buddha, practising non-judgement, releas ing guilt, reading and reflecting on the writings of the sp iritual masters. What is \"mind\"? As the requirements of the spiritual jour ney become clearer to us, a number of questions may arise. \"Will I lose my identity if I 'return to the Divin e Source'?\" \"What must I give up?\" \"Will this work heal my body?\" \"If not, is it all worth the effort?\" \"Does some part of me survive the death of the bo dy?\" \"What is my mind, and (eventually), who am I anyway?\" In this section, we will discuss \"mind\", and then in the following sections we will ask how concepts of mind inform the question of possible effects of mind on body. The nature of mind and its relationship to brain and body are issues that have been debated by philosophers for millenia. While this is not the place to enter that debate, we may note that t here have been two main streams of thinking in the discourse. The first is realism, as exemplified by current sci entific materialism: the idea that mind is simply a by-product of brain func tion. The kidneys produce urine, the brain produces sensations and thoughts. This seems to have validity - after a ll, it is clear that when the body dies, the brain stops functioni ng, and presumably thinking also stops. The second stream in this area of ph ilosophy is idealism, roughly speaking the view that all we ever know, and can know, ar e ideas in our minds; our concepts of the 112assumed external world are of our own devis ing. Eastern spiritual philosophies often appear to take this line of thought to an ultimate point, asserting that there is, in fact, no separate self (Buddhism), and that all we seem to experience in the material world is maya or illusion (Hinduism). This is difficult for most of us to a ccept - we wonder, for example, if other people are suppos edly figments of our imagination. Various efforts have been made to reconcile the different viewpoints that have grown up around these major themes, as philosophically-oriented readers will know. Our task here is not to choose sides, but to find a way of thinking about our minds and about ourselves that allows for possible he aling effects of mi nd on body, and explains the range of experiences that people pursuing a spiritual path have described. In his book \"The Self-Aware Universe\", physicist Amit Goswami attempts to reconcile the findings of modern quantum physics, which al so contradict common sense ideas, with the major schools of philosophy and western psychology. To paraphrase and simplify his argument, he proposes (as have others) t hat we have a \"small mind\", which does depend on brain function, and is largely condit ioned by accumulated experiences to respond in ways that appear to obey the laws of classical physics. Then we also have a larger mind, or perhaps many levels of mind, that are not restrict ed to such Newtonian behaviour. A simple diagram (fig 12.2) may help us consider this. I have shown the small, individual mind as, indeed, an emanation from the brain. Extending beyond the body there may be further levels or shells of \"mind\". Although any definite subdivisions are likely to reflect simply our need to organise and control, we might propose a level of mind that extends across a species, embrac ing the minds of all humans, which could correspond to Jung's \"collective unconscious\" . Beyond that, ther e may be still larger \"minds\" that include all living things, and eventually, the Universe. The purpose of this simplistic model is to provide one way of organising our experience as we pursue our meditation and strive to go beyond the restricted individual mind of brain-dependent thoughts. What effects does \"mind\" have on body? Now we can return to this pressing question with a broader perspective. First, let's consider the individual mind, product of the brain, whose existence is accepted by all, even the most materialisti cally oriented. It has significant effects on the body: apart from the obvious control we have over our movements, we can also readily detect the impact of our thoughts and emotions on many functions that normally proceed unnoticed, such as blood pressure regulation, gastro-intestinal functioning, patterns of breathing, and so on. These effects extend to influence over systems of the body that may be important in regulating some cancers, such as the immune system, that in the past were thought to be entirely beyond mental influence. Research in biofeedback, hypnosis and psychosomatic medicine also shows that voluntary control can be achieved over other apparently independent f unctions of the body. For example, some 113individuals have the ability to arrest bleedi ng at will; wound healing, and recovery from surgery, can be accelerated by mental imaging and related techniques; the experience of physical pain can be dramatically modi fied by mental techniques, as can the emotional pain of anxiety and depression. T hus without proposing any thing esoteric we are aware that there is at our disposal an immensely powerful tool for improving life and health. It is tragic that our health care system, reflecting t he wishes of our society, has barely begun to incorporate well-researched mental self-control strategies into management of disease. If the abilities of this everyday mind ar e not enough to satisfy us, we can draw on the expanded model in fig 12.2 to forecast mind-body potentials that lie beyond the realms of Newtonian (classical) physics, and take on some of the aura and mystery of the quantum realm, where particles are mo lded by the process of observing them, causally related events occur instantaneously , and time is no longer the reliable linear arrow we have come to depend on in our ordinary lives. I would suggest that these unusual potentials may become actualised w hen we make contact with, become aware of, or otherwise activate the higher, more all-encompassing levels of mind. I would further speculate that enhanced healing is po ssible with such contact. The ordinary rules by which material objects, including our bodies, seem to operate may be overridden under some circumstances by contac t with these higher levels of mind. Currently we don't know how to measure such events, but any unbiased person who has looked at the evidence will acknowledge effects that are inexplicable by classical physical laws. For example, extensive and ri gorous research has shown the capacity of mind to influence the proportion of pluses and minuses produced by a random number generator (see the account by Jahn and Dunne, referred to in \"Suggested Reading\"). I have personally experienced undeniable episodes of precognition and telepathy, and many patients have related to me \"out-of-body\" episodes. Various authors have collected accounts of \"near death experiences\" which s how many similarities to one another (see, for example, \"A Farther Shore\", by Yvonne Kason, a physician who had her own remarkable instance of rescue fr om an apparently fatal accident, and who has collected and classified \"spiritually transformati ve experiences\" related to her by patients in her clinical practice). We might also ask how to comprehend intense experiences of loving unconditionally and being loved, s udden feelings of connect edness, the \"scales dropping from the eyes\", as well as unexpect ed recoveries from serious disease that appear to contradict what we understand to be possible in our normal world. How can we access our spiritual potential? If these potentials exist, why are they not regularly available to us? Because we are so preoccupied with the chaos of our indivi dual, \"small mind\" thinking. This is also why, as all of the great spiritual traditions tell us, we are seldom in contact with the divine order - our thinking, our egocentricity , gets in the way. A typical attitude, expressed clearly and honestly: 114 *\"I'm not going to be a new person .... I don' t have any faith in the process. I am far from unhappy with my current balance of mind and spirit, so why change what works quite well Our true nature is not primarily material; we are part of God or the Divine or the Tao. We are, in our essence, mind, not \"s mall mind\" but infinite mind. Our task is to experience this identity. It is here that the healing and spir itual journeys coincide. The route to healing lies through quietening our e go-chatter, and intensely seeking this connection with our \"higher self \". Perhaps, following Goswam i and the idealist tradition, it may be that by the very act of seeking, we create form out of formless potential. God has been conceived of as having form or being without form. The choi ce would seem to be ours. Perhaps the intensity of our l onging for connection, and our surrender (of the ego), draws out of the formless domain visions, angels, long-dead avatars, and sometimes changes in the material worl d, such as remarkable healings. It is arrogant to suppose that our current ideas about reality, ideas peculiar to a particular biology and culture, have any absolut e validity. We can, however, focus on our experience, and in practical terms, this is what matters. M odels or theories about the nature of mind are simply aids to obt aining experience that will help us. My suggestion to people contemplati ng spiritual practice as a route to healing would be: read widely, find a spiritual tradition that su its you, an enlightened te acher if possible, and a way of conceptualising the Divine t hat appeals; then having gained some control over your thinking, pursue meditation, prayer, or related techniques with all the intensity that you can muster. If you can find a suppo rtive group of people with similar interests, that can be enormously helpful. If you feel devotion to an avatar like Christ or the Buddha, and like to see that figure in physical form, by all m eans use that route. If, on the other hand, you are deterr ed by some of the trappings of religion, think instead of the Divine as a formless intellige nce or pervasive order to wh ich you can \"tune in\". Or use both or many ways of thinking about it. It will Should we seek \"meaning\" in cancer? The \"meaning\" of cancer, or of any even t, is far more than what is usually intended by the word, which is cause or cons equence. It is, rather , the relationship of that event to everything else. The meani ng we attribute to events depends on our understanding and awareness of the interconnectedness of things. The broader our understanding, the more c onnection we will find. Healing is closely related to finding of meaning. Li ke understanding, healing can be at multiple levels, thus providing many potential points of control. If we are engaged in seeking meaning in our lives through the spiritual search, then we will address the possible meaning of our disease in these te rms, and may be able to invoke a degree of healing through this level, which in no wa y denies the fact that the disease has biological determinants as well. We find, as we search, that cancer is connected to 115everything else in our lives, and that it may be affected by what we do in all other domains, particularly the spiritual. We come to understand that the healing journey is, in fact, a search for our true nature, our ident ity. It is very sad to note the prevalent societal view that \"fighting\" a disease si mply means denying its likely effects, when the crisis offers such an incentive to probe more deeply into existential questions. For many people, there is an excitem ent in becoming engaged in no less a task than uncovering our identity, who we are in relation to everything else in our world. It is the bold claim of the mystics that we can actually learn this through spiritual practice. In more mundane terms, as we progress spir itually we enjoy much more loving relationships with others, feel more secure, fu lfilled, and more in tune with our world. * I now don't have any doubts whatsoever, it's almost like I've been given a new brain, I have never felt so strongly about so mething before. No matter what I think about or read about, I always (most times) find something positive about the situation, usually relating to God's plan. I am truly thankful for my strong faith. A patient initially said: *I can't see myself moving into a spir itual path per se... people are just imagining these things. After some months in a therapy group emphas ising spirituality, however she told us that: A presence is entering my meditations and is giving me a stillness I've not had before... and it is very clear to me that I am part of God. I have heard or read similar statements from m any patients: that as a result of their psychological and spiritual work they have attained a peacefulness, joy and sense of meaning greater than they have ever known, even in the face of dire medical predictions. Good experiences like this help us to keep going, but at every stage of our journey we are faced with the decision w hether to push ahead or stop trying to grow, and either remain on a \"plateau\" or relapse into our previous habits. The dilemma becomes particularly acute if, despite our efforts, we have a disease that keeps progressing; people may become disillusioned and stop working under such conditions (they also frequently stop when their diseas e goes into remission!). We are more inclined to continue as we learn to focus on personal and spiritual development for its own sake, leaving the physical outcome to the Divine. A word to health care professionals Professionals sometimes argue that it is unfair to suggest that mind, let alone spirit, might affect something as concrete as a cancer. I think t he reverse argument can be made with even more justification, that it is unfair, disempow ering, to rule out possible mind-body effects, and thus deny peopl e the opportunity to help themselves. 116However, we avoid this polaris ing debate if we recognise that our potential to use our various dimensions in the service of hea ling depends directly on our awareness of and connection with these levels of our being. To the degree that we are connected spiritually, we will be able to in voke healing at this level. We cannot expect to relate our spiritual state to either m ental or physical health until we have awareness of such a connection. Once we know it, from personal experience, then we can use it. It is not a matter of adopting a belief uncritically, but of seeking our own understanding and experience, and using this to guide our actions. From this viewpoint, the clinical task is largely an educational one. Understanding brings responsibility (\"re sponse-ability\") for our own health. We have the obligation, I would submit, to take res ponsibility for maintaining our spiritual and mental state in accordance wi th our understanding. This is a sensitive issue. It is obviously not fair, or helpful, to blame ourselves or other people for failing to change what we see no rationale for changing; the appropriate course of action is to educate ourselves. However, there is a gradual growth of awareness in our culture of the many factors contributing to health and illness, and this awareness is improving our ability to respond at levels other than the physical. For example, almost everyone now understands that smoking promotes lung cancer and other diseases, which was not the case fifty years ago. Thus we now have a responsibility to discourage smoking, which we could not assume in an earlier time. More recently, there is a developing understanding of more subtle relationshi ps between patterns of thought, such as continued judgementalism and res entment, and heart disease. In time, we may come to see management of thoughts as being even more fundamental to maintaining health than good physical habits. A final word to people with cancer One might ask, why struggle to stay aliv e as a separate being if there is an all- encompassing realm to which we will ultima tely return? This question becomes particularly poignant in the la te stages of disease, when patients may ask \"should I continue to fight, or should I accept dying now?\" There does come a time when it is appropriate to stop striving, and to allow the body to die. Meanwhile, while we are alive and able to act, is the spiritual search worth the effort? Well, I hope that what has been said in this book, and particularly the words of our patients that I've reported here, will convince you of the power of spiritual search ing to bring peace. In terms of effects on physical healing you have read t he view that, in the same way as for psychological and social dimensions (fig 2.2), making changes at the spiritual level will have the power to normalise biological processes, acting at leas t in part through the mind. We have the clinical observations of many therapists that people with canc er who become very involved with their psychological and spiritual work tend to liv e longer than predicted. Our own experiment, described in chapter 1, is a systematic study of this phenomenon in a rigorous way; it requires confirmation by others, however. Also, it is difficult to separate the spiritual from the psychological work in such observations. 117 To relate some of my personal experience: after surgery for a serious colon cancer in 1987, my spiritual teacher, Swam i Radha wrote: \"Don't do what you want; do what you ought\"! This made perfect sense to me, and I intensified my spiritual seeking as a result. I went to an as hram (a centre for psychologic al and spiritual growth), where I worked on my psychological problems and spiritual development, all day and every day, for three months. I was in a group with individuals training to be teachers of yoga, and our teachers were more advanced spiritua l seekers. My spiritual work at the ashram, and subsequently, included wonderfu l instances of loving guidance, which continue to this day whenever I remember to \"tune in\". Thus I have personally no doubt about the constant availability of help from a transcendent or divine source. Such a course might sound like an investment of time and money beyond what most can contemplate, but I believe something similar could be undertaken by many people, if they had sufficient belief in the power of such relatively intensive study to help them. The theatre of action for self help in heal ing is your own mind. Determination and work are required: I hope I haven't discouraged you by harping on this theme, but it would be irresponsible to say otherwise, however appealing a message of simple, magical cures might be. Don't become locked into a \"victim\" role by endlessly reviewing the horror story of your experience of cancer. Instead, resolve to take an active course, doing whatever you understand as having healing potential. Healing needs to become the top priority in your life, which means letting go of some other agendas. Once we have accepted the possibility t hat there is a transcendent dimension or Divine Power with the ability to help us, the work is, as we've discussed, mainly finding and diminishing our blocks to experience of this dimension. If we ask for help in the spiritual realm, meaning that we open ourselves to t he higher dimensions of our own minds, we will find that help and support are abundantly available. Then having done what we can, we accept the outcome. Whatever it may be, biological ly speaking, this course of action brings peace. I wish you all understanding, jo y, and healing on your path. 118Table 12.1: Main elements in the process of healing Starting state Process of healing Healed state 1 What is reality, and how do I fit in?

My gratitude extends first to the Divine Source, for my continuing health, energy and motivation. Clos ely related is my debt to my wife, Margaret, for her constant support and wise c ounsel, and to our spiritual teacher, the late Swami Sivananda Radha, of Yasodhara Ashram, Brit ish Columbia. The emphasis in this book on personal effort and responsib ility derives mainly from Swami Radha's patient teaching and example. Other important sources of growth for me have been attending Self Realization Fellowship m eetings (Yogananda), Tor onto, and studying A Course in Miracles (Foundation for Inner Peace, USA). My thanks go to colleagues in our small \"Healing Journey\" research program at the Ontario Cancer Institute/University Heal th Network, in Toronto. Dr Claire Edmonds and Dr Cathy Phillips have been excellent associates in clinical and research endeavours, and Ms Jan Ferguson has been a dedicated coordinator of our courses for patients. Among other colleagues of recent years I would especially like to thank Joanne Stephen, Judy Gould, Krista Soots, Sybil Carnell, Helen Williamson, Leanne Ferreira, Dr David Hedley, Cavell Tyrrell, Dorothy Williams, Kim Watson, Kathy Feher, Rachel Kampf, my secretar y, Amy Lee, and Hayman Buwaneswaran, who has set up and maintained our website: www.healingjourney.ca. . My daughter, Anne Cunningham, and her husband, Rev. Dr. Barry Moore, kindly read the w hole manuscript. Scientific colleagues and superiors, and the medical staff at the Onta rio Cancer Institute have maintained their benevolent acceptance of my activities t here. Many professionals at the institute have referred patients to our program, and a large number of oncologists have provided assistance with our res earch on survival. The media have been scrupulously fair in their frequent accounts of our work. And our many patients have shared intimate aspects of their lives as t hey have struggled to master the crisis of cancer, and to learn what life is truly about. This has been a joint venture - we have all been learning together, and continue to do so. My hope is that many readers, whether or not they have a diagnosis of c ancer, will also embark on the journey. 120 Further materials on the \"Healing Journey\" The website, www.healingjourney.ca describes our classes in Toronto and other publications.
