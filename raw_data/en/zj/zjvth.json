INTRODUCTION.'.., And truth beauty. That is_all ye Know on earth(r-4and all ye need to know.' If we can remain detached from the =1-.excitement of this romantic aspiration, we may notesan ,,..;, 0implicit claim, to aesthetic knowledge. To Keats it wouldhaveeemed absurd to suggest that man did not know whatwas beauti al and what was not. Sir Thomas More was obligedto deny the, validity of King Henry's Act of Supremacy;sto.have offended against, what his conscience told him was amoral truth was too great a price to pay for his head.At less cost, Galileoisrr44.4ited with the final wordin his disagreements with the Inquisition about 'the mobilityof the earth, 'And yet it moves'. Martin Luther 6d nooption bgt to accept his experience of God and assert, 'HereI stand.I can do no other.'Each is a claim to knowledge. Each is a claim to haveapprehe-nded a truth. The types 0 nowleggp apparentlydiffer; their customary differeaiiating lia4ls would bdaesthetic, moral, scientific, and religious. At varioustimes through various means, philosaph,bas denied thevalie.'ty of each of these kinds of knoWledge and hasallowed only logic'to have truths'which are sacrosanct .and_incontrovertible and those invariably .by definitionand occasionally With-reluctance. It is of course truethat when bhosc other types of knoWledge are evaluated'against th\" criteria appropriate tq checking truths oflogic, they fail to meet these, again by definition.It might have been more sensible to evaluate any claimmade through the application of measures appropriate tothat kind ofknAledge.Chemistry performs tests unlikethose used by,literary critics to check its claims.Moral judgements can be defended as true without recourseto prayer.There are no publicly demonstrabli; experimentsto check whether Jesus was the Son of God. When the',Quaker George Fox described his religious conviction with (i) ;.-.the claim 'ind this I, knew ,experiTentally', he was hopingthat others might also search and achieve authenticexperience of God, but he was,not suggesting that controlledlaboratory demonstrations would be relevant to conversion:Ong.of the great tragedigs of man has been his failure todistinguish between types of knowledge. He has failed tosee that the most appropriate and feasible means ofacquisition necessarily vary with the kind of knowledge andthat the sensibleness of tests of its adequacy must alsodiffer.A related tragedy has lain in the lengths'to whichcultures have gone to prevent their members froM acquiring, .knowledge.In a different context T omas Paine expbstulated,7'every age and generation must be as ree to act for itself,all cases, as the ages and generations which 'preceded. it.The vanity and presumption of governin beyond the grave isthe most ridiculous and'insolent of all tyrannies' (1791;Penguin, 1969, p.63). He failed to see that we can in factnever do better than educate children within the limitations.of our own knowledge and beliefs, but he is .right that, inthe long run, there is little to be gained by forcing_children to sa& that they believe things they do,nbt. Theimperative 'Believe!' cannot be obeyed, Whatever kind ofknowledge is in cluestion.-v.One paradox from which we suffer is that we wish toeducate our children as efficiently and honestly asFpossible, but at the same time we seem to he frightened that,if we do not exact a strong measure of conformity, the childrenwill suffer.This presumes that our own beliefs and .conductare only validated, supported, and held in check by thepossible sanctions others Would inflict uPon'us if we wereto doubt or to deviate. Do we really believe this?Fortunately each generation of children at least begins itslife uncontaminated and asks why the kings it encounters arenot wearing clothes. Another paradox;, sometimes used to justify indecisive-.ness, is that we believe we have to guess what knowledge .will be useful when the children grow up, although clearlysuch .tar- gazing can not be validated !efore the fact.Whejier thesfirst paradox might be resolved by findingthat demands for'insincere conformity/4re unnecessary andeventually.counter-productive is an empirical question yetto be tested. ifl''Piaget's (1930) views about the developmentof moral reasoning and behaviour of children are correct, itmight be beneficial and instructive to start to take the risk.'The second,geems to be based on a false premise. Itmay be true that computer technology and aerodynamics datefast.It is not true that allscience changes that quickly.7.1It is not true that theuaderlying logics date. It is nottrue that what is right and beautiful necessarily changes.Religious claims extant, are eternally true or false.The belief that we db not know, what to teach childrenin school is based on a/narrow conception of the role ofeducation.- The occupational structure of adult societychanges; new jobs %requiring new skills emerge; occupants 2- ..3 of old jobs need to aceiiiire new knowledge to functioneffectively, old skills becoMOme redundant.4So much is true.If we identify education' closely with the function offitting%trained people into particular. jobs, then our .ignorance of the extent and 'nature of changes will indeedpreclude accurate prediction even if we accept that mostjobs can he learned much 'more quickly than We are wontto pretend.But we should presumably prefer to argue formore functions to education than recruitment tc theoccupational structure, and if we do so, we may find itless difficult to decide what it.is desirable to learn.One recent proposal is to solve problems of the functionsof education br focusing on processes of knowledge acquisitionrather than upon content and to argue that education shouldequip people to become 'independent general problem-solvers.' 11 Childrenshould learn hqw to acquire knowledge. Confronted .by the problematic, the vague or the confusing, tney shouldbe able to extract, definel.and classify the hidden problems;they should be able to think up ideal and feasible ways0of collecting evidence that will help the decision making;Athey should he able to evaluate and decide upon sensiblecourses of Iction that they can justify. They should alsoof course h enabled to act effectively upon their decisions.It is not uncommon for 'problem-solving' to be.interpreted narrowly as intellectual exercises, but therange intended here, is very much wider. All decisionsthat we take are attempted solutions to problems. Knowinghow to kick a football into a goal or how to cook spaghettiare as much part of knowledge as knowing that Julius Caesarwas a Roman Emperor or that the angles of.a triangle sumto one hundred and eighty degrees. Knowing that 'I.heverdone nothing' functions as the grammatically acceptedrealization of a statemont in certain sub-cultrual groupsis equivalent to knowing that 'I did not do it' is theaccepted realization in others.We: must distinguish between knowledge and the value 0.placed upun it. 'What is to count as valuable knowledge issocially contingent. People dPfine whit is worth knowing.There ;leas to be such definition, but it should be seento be subject to change from place -to place, time to time,and situation to situation.Our immediate concern is the relative emphasis to beplaced upon40'knowing that\"4and 'knowing how to find out'.It is asserted that British primary schools have switchedtheir emphasis from the former to the latter to sucll-an extentthat children Lo longPr master useful skills and knowledge-such as multiplication tables andeSpelling. Doubtless thechange can be substantiated; it is to be .regretted thatattempts at in.Lovation are as likely to be excessively .espoused as they Are to be ignored or otherwise misunderstood. (iv) 12 xt. A recently completed research project (Robinson,1974) *gave no grounds for assuming that children generally knewmuch about finding out or valued such skills. The generalcheer of the Plowden report is perhaps grounded on theobservations,of a deviant minority by an over-optimisticset of well-wishers.'If the model of man presented in chapter 1 is .viable,we human beings are designedto find out about finding out.We are naturally curious scientists. To facilitate thisdevelopment th6 educational system has only to guide andtrain the growth of skills which it is a child's innate. .disposition to acquire. It has also to find Out what ,canbest be learned in what order.This -is not is say that this model of man represE_ s thewhole of his nature nor that 'knowing' is the only valuablerelationship to the world that Children need acquire. Butthese are what .are of most concern her'e. We furtherrecognize that although question posing in some form maybe central to all deliberate learning, asking questions ofother peop'e is only one means of attempting to obtainanswers (see chapter 3). Further, it is absurd to look atquestioning independently of answering. We treat the twotogether.The study of questioning and answering is played outat two,levelsCthere is a play ,within a play, spelt out in..more detall in the Appendix.i kt one level we were psychologists and teacherscooperating to generate knowledge about the questioning,and answering? capacities and preferenees of children. Wehoped that the pooled knowledge of teachers and psychologistswould provide.a higher success rate in worthwhile experi-mentation than either-group acting alone would have done.But at another level we were hoping to encourage theteachers to adopt a more systemal?ally experimental'attitude to their teaching. .We were trying to persuade 0. 13\"et ahem that both the methodology and content of psychologycould be exploited to find out about the learning of realchildren in real classrooms. Training courses for teachersare not widely renowned for their provision of knowledgeabout child development in particular or heuristic skillsin general.Teachers have not themselves been educated tobe independent general, problem-solvers. 'And if the-blind shall lead the blind, shall not they both...?'Hence we hoped that the account of child developmentoffered to teachers in lectures and reading, along with the ,experiments conducted*reported, and evaluated, would beginto equip them with skills for finding out-about teaching.With the advent of the James' Report, it seems to havebecome generally recognized that teaching, as any otherprofession, is based on changing knowledge, values, andfashions.Consequently teachers need to be provided withtime for 'research and development' as well as for'production';:When this time 'is whatwill fill it?Therd are, and will be many-candidates fOr'inclusion, but we hope our instance has several generaltharacteristics-that will be commonly included.Firstly, in trying to answer our-questions aboutchildren's behaviour we have observed their behaviour.We have not simply asked experts -what they thought wasbest for the children, except as an initial source ofideas.As.we later remark, it is commonly cite the exper-0fence of the designer of a scheme or the favourablejudgements of educational worthies as evkdence fororagainst tilt, value of some scheme or project. 'Argumentfrom 'authority' is irrelevant to the ultimate efficacyfor the learning of the children; that/is an empirical matterto be decided by experimentation and riot by appeal toexpert opinion.Secondly, the structure and content of the course wasa collaborative venture. Most of the'initiative came fromthe side of the organizers, as is to be expected. We had 14 objectives; we tried to specify these and to discuss themeans of achieving them with the teachers. However we were,in fact, more diffident than perhaps we should have been,and in any future enterprise would seek to be more definite .\\. and explicit about ow goals while at the same time\\consult-ing the teachers more - and being happily prepared to bemoved by 'group consensus. To have had quite definite goalsthat were not made. explicit and agreed upon was to beregretted.To.have had no goals, but to have hoped thatthey would have emerged, would have been worse.Thirdly, but very weakly, we attempted to evaluate theefficacy of the Course itself. In what ways was it a successand in what ways a failure? Here our diffidence wasinexcusable.We prepared-p-re- and post-tests of variouskinds, but were frightened that they would frighten theteachers away. On any future occasion we would deVize testswhich would show the participants that their attendance wasof measurable benefit to them. 15 CHAPTER 1.MAN AS AN ACQUIRER OF KNOWLEDGE: MODELS AND FACTSTHE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN: A DIVERSITY OF VIEWS: Before we are to be able to\" desc ibe and explain the-changes that occur as children groW unto adults, we mustfirst be able to offer adequate desc ipdons of human,beings at single points in time; to iscuss how and whychange occurs presupposes a knowledg of what it is thatis examination cf one' memories of writings,religious, philosophical, psychologicaland fictionalwill serve to remind us of the diverSity rather than theunit of views about man and how he works. We lack,anagreed anu substantiated picture, and yet without some I valid snapshot we cannot proceed to expose the eine-film,extensiOn of it. This thorny issue midst and will begrasped, and to sound a note of optmi\\sm,we may find that' oour presumed ignorance stems not so mulchfrom a lack ofdata as from an inadequate processing nd organizationof these.First, let us prune the problem do n to asking aboutman as an acquirer Of knowledge, rather Ilan as an eater,sleeper, devotee of Pop music, foothalle5, postman,president or God's representative on earth. How does heacquire knowledg-? Is he active or passive in the process?Does he discover, invent or construct his knowledge? Itwould be an interesting diversionary exercise to see howathe various ancieri philosophical traditions reappear innew guises in the a proaches to the study of behaviouradopted by contempor ry psychologists, but we shall,content ourselves pit a brief mention of three contrastingviews'and a slightly e tended treatment of two of them.One main view' is t e empiricist tradition that off.ersan 'empty black box' pic ure of man. This endows himwith a susceptibility to h ve his behaviour modified andhis knowledge extended by 16,arning associations. A' 2..particularly influential sub-set of believers in the valueof this approach 'emphasises the role of rewards aftdpunishments as factors affecting which associations arelearned and acted upon. By contrast, there are views which---_stress pre - programming. Either knowledge is already thereat birth or-there-are inborn mechanisms so designed that abut minimal amount of experience will render thisdispositional knowledge manifest. The Freudian story ofpsycho-sexual development posited pre-programmed stages ofdevelopment, each defined relation 'specific cathected objects.Biologically based determinism has faded recently, butthe rationalist philosophical tradition has been resurrectedin linguistics. Psycholillguists have provided us with aLanguage Acquisition Device (LAD) that requires only a littleencouragement tciachieve grammatical competencein-language (e.g. Lenneberg, philosophical family tree of the cognitive develop-mental approach, initiated and developed by Piaget has Kantin its ancestryi Piaget emphasise6 neither the environmentnor the pre-programming, but the interaction between the two.The acquisitiOn of knowledge is a process,whose products areneither the result of a passive reception of whateverassociations the environment forces upon us nor are theysimply waiting to unfold. We are designed to be active,and it is through processing information derived from theconsequences of our actions that we acquire knowledge.If we are to decide whether the cognitive developmentalapproach contains more or., ss truth. about human-beings thanthe associationist and reinforcement theozyof learning, weneed to look more closely at what can only be a caricatureof the main points of their respective arguments.Pavlov (1927) demonstrated classical conditioning.Hungry-dogs salivate at the sight of meat powder. If otherstimuli, such as the ringing of a bell were regularly 17 13.presented in temporal contiguity with the sight of the meatpowder, the dogs would learn to salivate when the bell alonewas rung.From this basic Paradigm a wealth of knowledgewas acquired about such learning. In a separate andmainly American tradition the 'instrumental conditioning'paradigm has relied upon administering rewards orpunishments as soon as possible after particular piecesof behaviour have occurred for demonstrating how behaviour\"can be 'shaped'. The occasion, frequency, timing and natureof the Sequences of rewards and punishments '(sche'dules ofreinforcement) Can be shown to be major determinents bothof what is learned and\" when this learning will be \"revealedin performance (see Honig, 1966). Debates continue as towhether classical and instrumental .conditioning are two,types of learning or ,one and- whether learning occirs purelythrough association and without reinforcements. 'Rewards'and 'punishment' allegedly still evade definition. Butit is quite clear that we can manipulate biological statesof animals and the environment in which they .can then beplaced in\"ways which will enable them toaearn.Provided that the actions and discriminations requiredare within an animal's repertoire (or can be built up),we can manipulate him and his environment to modify hisbehaviour.An 'almost empty black box' which can berewarded or punished can have hispehaviour changed.It would be ostrich-like'to deny the facts and someof the interpretations accumulated in this learning theorytradition.There is a mass of solid evidence consistentwith explanations offered. What worries some psychologistsare the attempts to extend the generalizations. For example,without a single empirical study quoted in support'of thestory, Skinner (1957) sought to embrace the development ofAV-verbal behaviour in children within his reinforcementframework.Although he judiciously entitled his book, .'Verbal Behaviour' rather than 'Acquisition of Mastery 18 04. .over Language', he did attempt to push his explanations totheir limits, and Chomsky (1959) was able to specify enoughweaknesses in the analysis to show that the limits were wellexceeded.Similarly, Berlyne (1960) has made Herculean effortsto incorporate Piaget's facts into his sophisticatedelaboration of an S-R view of human behaviour, but thedomination of the organism by external stimuli leaves ussolely as passive victims rather than as active agents aswell, a view assumed to be less plausible then the oneadopted here (see Figure 1).While Piaget can escape charges of both excessivenativism and crass empiriCism, he would find it harder to de-,fend himself against the accusation that his ideas aredifficult to understand. There are simplified accountsr .'which are easy to follow, but these are liable to distortthe essence of the theory and diminish its pretendedstature.The elementary accounts can of course serve togain a foothold before one plunges into the complexitiesof-an authentic. version (Piaget 1970). The technical termsof the system are many. They are f-requentIY-butnecessarily___defined in relation to each other - as well as to thethinking they -are intended to explain-. Their meanings areless explicit than will eventually be required. One longsfor a,large chart setting out the essence of the account,but none is available. Prose must suffice.The human organism is active in its adaptation toits environment - it is designed in such a Way that itaccumulates and organizes knowledge of the environment asbest it can, within the limits of its intellectual machineryand its opportunities for learning. 'Knowledge' is used ,in a wide and general sense to refer to a,process and notjust a s-Eiti;--Hince Fufthis (1969, p.2Y-trefin1 tkon-ofPiaget's concept as 'the structuring of behaviour as inter-change between organism and environment. Knowledge is 19 TS,5.acclutred,by the processes of assimilation and accommodation.Assimilation is defined as:'integration of external elements into orcompleted structures of an organism': (Piaget 1970,p. 706)Accommodation is:'any modification by the elements it assimilates' (op.cit.,p.708)The relative importance of each in any situation canvary, so that symbolic play is almost wholly assimilation,whereas imitation is almost entirely accommodation: Normal'intelligent' action involves them both in relative 'equilibrium..The definition of each process has included they. critical words 'scheme' and 'structure^. 'Sdhemes' can mosteasily be construed as rules for organizing actions,instructions on how to proceed, computer programmes forprocessing the data, whether these be generated internallyor externally. Beginning with but a few inbuilt reflexesand a general disposition to be active, the, neonate builds.up many more schemes, thatare progressively, but not verysystematically, organized into higher-order schemes. For _._the first two years or sof the schemes are developed-and-realized only through overt action, but the appearance ofsymbolic functioning brings this wholly sezispry-motor stageto an end.Symbolic functioning means that problems can beworked out in the head prior to overt action occurring.A succeeding three or four year period of 'intuitive'thinking becomes stabilized_as a stage of 'concrdteoperational thinking', which lasts until about eleven.For this stage the schemes at the highest level are__relabelled as '_opera\"tiOns!, whose own co-ordination andorganization are referred to as a 'structure' or 'system'.It is these deep structures about which Piaget has written 20, 6.most, sinc_e_they-knve ve operations that underpin thelogic of our thinking which itself pervades all oursymbolically represented knowledge. In 'concreteoperational thinking' we- can handle problems of identityand reversibility, in classificatory systems bothcategorical and relational, but the thinking is stilllimited to the 'real' as opposed to the'possible'and to the concrete and particular as opposed to theabstract and the general. This latter emancipation occursonly in the 'formal operational stage' (see Inhelder the idea of 'stages' to 'refer torelatively stable periods where the schemes or structuressuffice to maintain a balance between assimilation and'accommodation within the limits of the organism's developedintellectual capncity. But why should stages break up?Why should there be development?tiPiaget (1970, pp 719 - 726) argues that, neither .singly nor in combination, are maturation, experience andthe influence' of the social environment sufficient to accountfor the changes that occur -in development, and he invokes<:the concept of asolUtion.Equilibration has tne advantage that,it willalso account for the co-ordination oS knowledge derived fromthe other three sources. But what is 'equilibration'?6 It'is a set of active reactions of the subject to externaldisturbances' (pp.cit.p.725). It 'has explanatory valuebecause it is founded on a process,with increasing sequentialprobabilities' (loc.cit.). Such quotations are not the readet or to denigrate Piaget, butthey do seem to be so uninformative that it 'bay be easier',.to ignore them and to think of ourselves as 'self-organizingsystems,' wh o acquire the knowledge we do because the wor'dis as it is and we are as we are. That we arrive at thesame logico-mathematical knowl?dge as each other at theformal operational stage is allegedly because a, - Bortyne's Analysis ofC a7.actively processing the environment we have would be forcedto construct the same underlying principles. These principlescannot be discovered' because they arp not 'out there'',but then aeither are they invented in arbitrary fa'shion;they are a 'forceid invention.' The empiricist's mistakeis to assume the answers are waiting to be discovered.The rationalidt's mistake is to assume that we know theanswers before we start. The phenomenologist's dangeris to assume that what We experience is arbitrary andidiosyncratic. Piaget sees our knowledge as 'increasinglycorresponding to an adaptive construction of reality. 'Initially knowledge is knowledge because it works; atmaturity knowledge is knowledge because it works'andis true.If we find it is false or inadequate we changeit. _Popper poinl(s out that the same principles operateip the progress of science (Popper, 1968).It is in the inadequacy and falsity that the possibilityof development resides. Do one's schemes specify a singlecourse'of action in a situntion? If they conflict or areambiguous, accommodation is required. Piaget does not usethe word -'conflici' often, but this,is the easist termto conveying theessence of his message. Vieresolution of'conflict evolves new schemes and ultimatelyeW operations that integrate previous knowledge andp ovide.better adaptations to present and future problems.For example, the child watching balls of plasticenerolled into a sausage eventually has trouble when he real-izes he is saying both that there is more after-rollingAbecause it's longer)' and less (because it's not as tall),and that these cannot both be true. This conflict isbest resolved by. constructing the hypothesis that 'Itis the samd amount because nothing has been added ortaken away' - and then testing its validity. This.is notin fact how Piaget- explains th- acquisition of conservationof amount (see Piaget 1970, p.725),_but it does provide 1,4, 8,anillustration of what might happen. .To summarize. For Piaget intellectual growth is active,cumulative and sequential, with periods'of inconsistencyand areothemselves broken iii-, re-developed and re-organized. 3.-3., constructions the wo care progresbively more .liowerful tn.generality and abstractness. At maturity notonly are .capable symbolic loge ,ewe are. ----, capable ofsolvingany problem sensikly. We can anyse itsygtematically and can work out contingenties and theirinterpretations. Our knowledge about empirical and moralmatters will have limitations not affecting our logico-mathematical knokedge, but.we will know how to, fine outmore.As with learning theory,,so with Piaget; a mass ofinternational data attests to the validity of his ownobservations.What children can and cannot do at successivestages of development -can tie described and interpreted;the mechanisms, of development are less well4 understood.What distinguishes the Piagetian story from others is thatit/could be valid. In_brincible at least it is a Comprehensiveand testable story about the intellectual development ofhuman beings in ways which no ot4cr ones are.'This is' not to say that there are no holes or C----,weaknesses.`One obvious hole is the exclusion of inter,st I . in all the superficial but nonetheless aseful knowledge weacquire; no pretence is' made that the system is intended .. . to do deal with anything o,aer than the fundamentals ofintellectoal development. Piaget has been more interestedin basic; logical competence than in empirical performance.He has tried to expose the underpinning 's tructure of thfnkingunder optimal conditions with simplified materials.

Thisbegins to give substance'to Piaget's.processes and locatesthem in a more complete being.Stimuli arising in the outside world are classifiedinto, four types of which two are immediately related to theacquisition of knowledge. Assimilable stimuli are thosefor which Currently held schemes will suffice to yieldcoping actions. They _provide -further knowledge becausethey can include new instances of classes already coped with;this is knowledge extension by generalization. Ambiguous,surprising, incongruous3 complex and novel stimuli are thosecited by Berlyne (1960) as productive'of uncertainty.Whilethe five categories may require refinement and regrouping,they do help to give substance to Piaget's more abstractnotion of features requiring accommodation. All are assumedto give rise to uncertainty. Curiosity is one kind ofuncertainty.In fact it is the only one mentioned, althdugh'anxiety' or 'worry' might also be candidates for inclusion.CuridSity leads to attention. It may be that a dose of'''-..activeexposure will in itself enable the person to29 13.assimilate the stimuli to a scheme or set of schemes.Otherwise he will have to-reason, observe or Consult,to eliminate the uncertainty and to render the stimulirendered assimilable. He may fail because he is distractedbefore a solution is reached or because the stimuli becomemonotonous.A profound absence and an excessive bombardmentof Stimulation or an excess of repetition will result inboredom and diversive exploration. Distracting stimuli areany that, switch the person away from the problems in hand.All stimuli can only be defined-relative to the presentknowledge and state, of the person receiving them.The two sets of internally arising stimuli areinserted into the diagram to Complete the picture. Bio-chemical/physiological changes cover all those diurnal andother metabolic cycles and their associated signallingsystems that regulRte our biological well-being. Theyembrace those factors that give intensity to emotionalexperience and which interact,with interpretations ofoutside stimuli to result in pain, anger and 'compassion.'Internal stimuli of unknown origin' are the stuff thatdreams are made one the fantasies created out of boredom,and the deliberately chosen problems and their solutions -where no external influences appear to have. relevance tothem. ,,Uncertainty presupposes ignorance, and understandingpresup oses knowledge. Both knowledge and the mechanismsof knowle ge acquisition are omitted from the diagram.if'Wewereo inciude unpack 'knowledge' it wouldhave eachmanner possible, Sensory-motor Coordinations, the capacityto draW maps of towns and countries, the realization ofthe ability to defe d the z:Idgment that what is morallyv . , wrong-can never be po itically right, all multiplied toeverything we can manag - this gives the framework foruncertaintys,S understand ng to occur. 30\\ r. I14.The schemes, operations and structures are the mechanismsof knowledge acquisition: Traditionally this would bereferred to as SECOND FIRST ORDER-__knowledge comprises both 'knowing that' and 'knowing how'where these are directly related to the substance of theenvironment and ourselves. SECOND ORDER knowledgecomprises the machinery for acquiring and processingnew first order knowledge - knowing how to find out.But Piaget has argued and shown that this machinery notonly acquires flrst-order knowledgelit changes anddevelops its characteristics and capacities - it isacquiring knowledge about how to acquire and processknowledge.Such an important device deserves a name, andfollowing the linguistic precedent of LAD for LanguageAcquisition Device but rejecting the type of content'envisaged, KAD for Knowledge Acquisition Device is theobvious first choice. It is the growth of the operatingprinciples of KAD that Piaget's concepts are applied to.The rise of skills in posing questions and the capacity toevaluate answers is one realization of its activities.We have raised the possibility that the developmentof KAD can be interfered with by a manipulation of boththe structureand the'content of the environment, and bythe human use of sanctions. It is time to give substanceto this argument and to,transfOrm the imaginary examplesinto a realistic portrait of the development of childrenand the socialization procedures to which they are exposed.Se do so through a review of social class differences inchild rearing with especial reference to training in theuse of language.. Language is chosen rather than cognitivefunctioning in general because this area has attractedmuch attention and because we have eventually to returnto the acquisition and transmission of verbally.mediatedknowledge expressed in questions and answers. 31 0 15,How is language used by whom?Schatzman andStrauas.(1955) interviewed MC' and WCrespondents about a tornado which had struck their toThe undocumented conclusions were that WC speakers weremore likely to retail events only from their personalperspective they did not accommodate to the fact thatthe interviewer had not been present during the tornado,theyxeferred to 'We', 'they' and 'persons' withoutidentifying these individuals or further.; concrete particular; the stories werenarratives that digressed unsystematidally. The neatmetaphorical image used to sum up the WC speaker is ofsomeone who has shot a cine-film whifh is replayed `'andcommented upon - with- no awareness that the audience cannotsee the film.-By contrast MC speakers shifted perspective from theirown to those of other individuals and groups; attemptswere made to set the account in terms that would be-meaninejful to the listener; references were made explicit;information\\transcended the particular and concrete toinclude roles and organizations; stories were coherent, andsub-plots introduced did not result in a loss of the theme.One cavalier interpretation would suggest that the MCobserver has behaved as a self-organizing acquisitor o'fknowledge, processing events in situ, and gaining anobjective view of reality which he has represented atvarious levels of- abstraction. At arty later point in time heis able to cut'through the coordinate store of knowledgein one or more of many ways to select relevant, informationand communicate this to listeneraof varied knowledge.TheWC obperver has been passive, his' perceptions influencedmainly by the of impinging (distracting?) stimuli,the information left in ikonic foim.When he tries to *MC will be used to refer to Middle Class, WC for WorkingClass, L,for the lower and U for upper subdivisions ofeach.UWg-refers to skilled working class. 32. 16.meet a demand for the retrieval of this knowledge, harelives snippets.The indignant defender of the working classesbreaks silence to point out that the MC speaker does notknow how to tell a story. The ordered dullness wreaks of abureaucratic administrator. The WC account is vivid,dramatic and its unordered vigour can arouse what itis like to be in a tornado.These initial polarizations are not intended to bedogmatic assertions of final truths about-either the factsor their best interpretations. If we take the factsat theirface value, we can see that several interpretations are,consistent with them. The differences found could be but.artefacts of the problem posed and of other features of theinterview situation. Perhaps the same differences would befound across a variety of situations, but still reflectnothing more than different preferences for,ways_ofe relaying information'or differen% assutptions about theknowledge already held by listeners. There are otherpossibilities; The differences could reflect genuine .differences in verbal skills. Perhaps WC observersprocessed events in the same way as MC observers, but'did not have the verbal resources for expressing theirknowledge.Their retrievable knowledge may have been lessbecause they did not happen to have processed events'as thoroughly as MC observers, but could have done ifthey had chosen to do so.Perhaps they could not haveprocessed the information in the same way.Hence the difference could have arisen frompsychologically trivial matters of differentialinterpretations of the task; from differences inin verbal fapility or from differences in'knowledgeacquiring skills.The study of Schatzman and Strauss does not allow usto decide which of these possibilities is most likely to betrue, and the last decade has witnessed much argumentation' 33 17,as to the most sensible answers to such questions (seeGinsburg, 1972; Williams, 1970); Let it be'stated at theoutset that the answers are not known and that, like'muchacademic wrangling, the disputes have been based on mutualmisunderstandings of what others are trying to say, anabsence of both hard data and adequate theory, and anintrus ion of,personal and political values.Values mist intrude into diScussions of educationalpractice and it may be as well to, state our basic premise.Any educational system should be designed to maximise thechances of as many children as possible becoming ascabable as possible of acquiring and evaluating forthemselves that knowledge necessary for being a fullmember of their society. If 'society' is taken to mean'mankind'', so much.the better. In eduPating children wecan choose what kind of mistake we wish, to make; we maybelieve they can learn when they cannot; we may believethey cannot learn when they can. If we accept the moralprinciple suggested, we are obliged tc try to find ways of'teaching children what we think it is important for themto know rather than to write them off as too stupid orfeckless to learn - which is not to say we should persistinto cruelty.As a matter of educational practice we may-attempt .toimprovec.the performance of WC children by thinking about, andchanging contextual variables to render verbal communicationsensible from the child's point of view. If we fail to deviseways of,improving performance by switching contexts, we maydecide to teach the verbal skills. If this appears to bedifficult because of a lack of underlying cognitivestructures we may have to provide experience for thestructures to develop. In short, we can take the teachingproblem, down from the superficial to the deep, frompreference: to 'competence, from speech to cognition as andwhen this is proved necessary by failures to teach. Theproduction of programmes that could have enabled theadoption of such a policy might have been more useful34 15.than the arguments about differences and deficits alreadyreferred to.We shall not become bogged down in debates aboutgeietically based differences in general intellectualcapcity.The interactional view of child developmentadopted ere has to argue that the sums used to propoundproportions of heredity and environment are a 'wrong-headedapproach to problems of intelligence, but allows for thepossibility of genetically based'individual or class-linked differences in intellectual potential. Itfocuses rather on what this child may be able to learngiven an optimal arrangement of the environment ratherthan upon how he differs from some other child.Neither shhll' we pursue the hoary old problem of therelationship between language and thinking. Alas, thisproblem is often Posed at such an abstract and generallevel that answers given are either platitudes or over:generalizations.. Weshall'merely point out that it is..as absurd to think of a child as educated, if he achievesPiage 'tian formal operations without being able to speak,as it is to contemplate. the same conclusion for the conversecase.The relevarice of a mastery. of units and structuresof language to problems will vary from problem to problem,for some they will be irrelevant, for others vital (seeRobinsbh, 1968). Itvery likely that for efficientlearning of much knowledge \"there can, be facilitativeinteraction between linguistic and non-linguisticrepresentations.But it is 'about only-one function of language thatwe shall be particularly concerned. In the instancereported by Schatzman and Strauss we have pointed out thatthe WC speech could have tae effect of being more moving -it could affect the emotional state and perhaps the behaviourof the audience. But the MC account is more efficient as arepresentation of what happened. This representationalfunction of language is that which enables theextra-35 19.linguistic world to be represented symbolically.When_________language_is used to make statements whose truth or falsitycan he calledinto question and evaluated, it is being usedrepresentationally. The MC speakers were transmitting theirknowledge about the world to someone else who could gainknowledge he had not experienced directly.The effective'use of this function is somqthing to which all developinghuman beings might reasonably aspire. If members of the,working classes are less proficient in this use than membersof the middle class, this is their loss as human-beings.To educate Children into this use is' not to make themmiddle-class, but into educated adults.In several ways the WC speech as described by SchatzmallandiStrauss is reminiscent of the language use and thinkingof young children - egocentric speech for oneself used asprivate comentary upon action, concrete, particular,inexplicit, lacking coherence. These are all aspects ofspeech noted by Piaget (1926) as symptomatic of the,thinkingof children between three and eight years old.A favoured explanation for the characteristics of WCspeech is that the demands made upon speakers by theenvironment do not require verbal explicitness. Talkingtakes place in a context, of such heavily shared and validassumptions that there is no need for explicitness, orderor abstraction. This may be true but it will not suffice.It does not explain why interest should be confined tomatters that can be talked about in this way. Games offootball can be discus-add-Fi-igiTractly-as games theory.Matters of empirical fact, problems of right and wrong,matters of religion, aesthetics or politics are (or should be)finally independent of the 'social class' of the discussants.This is not to suggest that members of middle classes areparticularly proficient in handling knowledge verbally(we are all woefully inept), but they are perhaps somewhatmore so than thOse of the working classes. 36 20.The question of, the links between social class andlanguage use were taken up with .vigour and dash byBerstein (see Bernstein; 1972 for collected papers andLawton, 1968 for a-pritique of the developmerit of.the ideas).His thesis that.members of working to a 'restricted code' of language use,while member's of the middle classes have access lo an'elaborated code' as well ignited the debates already re-.ferred to.While recognizing the v alue of his conceptionof 'codes' and their sociological relevence, it may he easierto understand the problems if they are posed at apsycholOgicai'level, significance. Children's verbal behaviourwill be affected by their genetically endowed capacitiesand disrositions interacting with their opportunities forlearning.What the environment makes available to thechild will affect his learning. Mothers often haveconsiclerable control over what is made available. Whatthey choose to make available or are able to will beconstrained by their resources. If we pursue this step-wise succession we shall arrive at some stage at 'socialclais' and this can then serve to locate gener?al differencesin what is made available for children to learn and why.But in itself it causes nothing.It has proved to be a useful concept for sociologistsdiscussing broad similarities and differences between sectionsof the population; it can be very use ul to psychologistsas a primary source of contrast. Ife can find importantdifferences in children that are linked o class and ift we are able to associate these empikica y and theoreticallywith differences in opportunities an0 t eatments affordedby mothers of different social classes,lwe may be able totranscend class itself and offer 'more general explanations.of associations between the behaviour of children and theira7 6 21.mothers.This does not mean that\\social class' is ofno more interest than as a useful starting point for'-showing whe're differences might be. It may also be ofrelevance to educational practice.However it is to the mother's behaviour we look as apossible source of explanation for children'm-behavi-our,-,not_because-shci&-iii-important but beruse in our societyshe is normally the major immediate controller of resourcesfor the learning of young children. There is much we shallomit -.what is provided physically, what_\\is and motivator. Whilethe validity of this separation has limits in practice,it may be conceptually helpful. As prescriber the motherdefines what is and what is not appropriate behaviour.As informer she makes knowledge available for learning.As-someone who.punishes and rewards she may be able toinfluence the intrinsic and extrinsic motivationaldharacteristics of the child. All tactivities may .involve the use of language. First,ever, it may beinstrUdtive to view her apparently playing all threeroles at once - as a teacher.Mothers as Teachers.Hess and Shipman (1967) had negro mothers of differentsocial class groups, teach their four year old childrenhow to sort blocks on two of four dimensions at once andhow to cooperate in the etching of five patterns on an'Etch-a-Sketch' machine. The analysis reveals a \"ertainlooseness in methodology. In several calculations variablesof different kinds are bundled together with littleconsideration as to how they might'operate to facilitatechildren's learning. There is no explicit plea that,since this was one of the first attempts to relate'maternaland child behaviour directly, we should perhaps be agreeably'surprised that any associations were foundiratSer than ,disappointed that tne entire variance had not been locatedand explained. Ginsburg's (1972) attacks on.the data and 'ttheir significance gain undutItified strength from.these .and other weaknesses.,A first point to make is that mgternal activities relateboth backwards to social class and forwards to the children'sbehaviour.Control strategies appealing to authority)(because I say so) were relatively acre frequen'tly used by 391 . e.23.WC mothers, while those to feeling if.nd reasoning were more-common among the middle class.

'Hess 3 Shipman concluded (p.79)The lack of meaning in the communication system between,mother and child is clearly exemplified in the behaviourof many of the mothers on this task. 'Consider theplight of the child whose mother is low on thesethree measures: During the practice period, hismother demands that he turn his knob, but shefails to explain why or to relate it to the lineson the screen. During the task she doesn't showhim the models and fails to give specific turningdirections.For such children, the effects arethese, (a) The child is'not given a goal to makehis individual responses meaningful (thatis,he is not shown the model). (b) The mother is notspecific in her directions; each new responseis essentially a guess. (c) The sequence and 4'1.I\\ ,5 425. ., .pattern of response is not explined.

(d) Nevertheless,his responses are being rewarded or punished,usually with maternal praise or disapproval,which provides belated feedback for a particuJarresponse if the mother is not givingecifirdirections.In either case, rewaT. niSh-ment performs a motivating.function.As a result of the interaction of these fact rs,the child is being made to produce responses tfrom his point of view are not related to anyvisible goal, are unrewarding in themselves,and do not bring corrective feedback that willenable him to avoid punishment.Neverthelessireinforcement continues, andpunishments are usually more frequent and intensethan rewardsrThe parallel between this state ofaffairs and the experimental designs used byMaier (1949) deliberately' to produce frustrationin subhuman organisms \"can sympathise with Ginsburg's protest that thedata are not strong enough to allow the conclusion that'many of the mothers', especially those in the lowerworking class, offer blue-prints for the development ofchronic frustration. It is true that the numbers in thecolumns of the tables hardly capture the atmosphere ofpurposeless meandering that is immediately conveyed in afilm presentation of one of their working class mothers'teaching' her child; the Child did look very puzzledat the vague chaos. But under (d) above it is suggestedthat mothers are rewarding and/or-punishing strongly. 42 c.), -.,26.The account gives an impression of maternal involvemspilling over into smackings and snarlings, which isnot what one would normally associate with their examplesof negative reinforcement, e.g. 'That's not right4 and'No, this is a tall block.'While their interpretation would fit the storyadvancedhere of a LWC emphasis on response-based learning mediatedby punishment, the results do not warrant this extension. ,.We need to see when and how real-punishments and rewardsare used in such situations before we can make claims aboutthat issue.On the other hand, we can point to the absenceof structure for LWC children; tasks not defined and modelsnot shown, should make learning for them more difficult.-Opportunities afforded for learning are fewer in the LWC,and the 'Etch-a-Sketch' data in particular imply thatprovision of assimilable knowledge is what is importantfor success by the children. Mothers making efficient use.of,the representational (as well as the controlling)function of-language have children who are not only moreefficient perforiers, but ale more articulate in justifyingtheir\" performance as well. These motives are more likelyto be found among the ,middle 'Theyare providingfirst ork:er from developing.Mothers as Prescribers.'Mothers define what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviourin their children. These definitions can differ in theirexplicitness and basis of justification. There are many waysin which this problem can he broken up (see Hess, 1970,for a review), but our brief exegesis will rely mainlyon the analysis by Cook-Gumperz.(1973) of the responses offive yell- old children and their mothers in Bernstein'sLondon sample.Mdthers can reward or punish children directly, withno verbal explication of what for or why. These sanctions 43 ?7.may be non-verbal (material rewards, smiles a kisses;smacks, scowls, forcible removal into and outsituations), they may be verbal (well done! good' oy!stop that! shut up!), There may bean explicit balor non-verbal reference to what has occasioned the 'other's,behaviour (smile + 'what a clean plate'; 'stop that14+pointing at unacceptable behaviour.) A direct sancti n may.be substituted for by s promise or threat. Such interventions state no rules; specific actions and non-actionof the child are contiguous with pleasant and unpleasantactions and threats of action by the mother. Noreasons)are given.The mother's verbal behaviouris used to controlbehaviour directly or-to define contingencies.If we think about what is made available foi. the childto learn through these events, we can see he can-be in rkuchthe same position as one, of Pavlov's dogs or Skinner'spigeons.;He has to work out what rules axe operative -if any are.This might be easy, but it may also bedifficult or impossible. In.terms of Gagne's analysis,he learning is signal S-R learning; the child is noten .uraged to analyse the contingencies nor to york out 'con-ceptsand 'principles' underlying regards and 'punishments'.Buspecific actions may be given more general andprecise la ening, 'Don't spit - not on buses anyway!' Notonly the acts ns, but who should or should not performthem !ray be men Toned: 'Children should be seen and notheard'.Cook-Gumz's coding frame,emphaiises the rulesof this kind which a e generalised to broad status-basedcategories of persons: ex, age, familik roles, etc.,but she does not elaborat about the generality orlimitations of the actions emselves.They are called'positional appeals/ - because they are made relevant toindividuals only as occupants of positions in the socialstructure. 4. ,- 28.Such appeals are necessarily mediated verbally and the ...function of the language used is to define role appropriatebehaviour.The definition of roles and the previouslymentioned attempts to control behaviour directly are theprominent functional aspects of Bernstein's 'restrictedcode'.'The major funCticn of this code is to reinforcethe form of the social%relationship (warm andinclusive relationship) by serve as guides for properconduct.They can be learned and provided that they do notgive rise to experiented contradition, can serve as concreteprescriptions for behaviour. They link concepts associatedwith broad status-based categories to particular behaviours.)40 In dagne's terminology principle learning is involved,although we should prefer to'say it is rule learning. (Itis more common, to use 'principle' as a higher order concept 1than 'rule'; i.e. rules can be further explained or justifiedby reference to principles.) The 'rules' here are notjustified at a succession of higher levels. These rulescan be generalized to ._new problems by noting similaritiesto old ones - they give rise to case law based on precedent.They do not explicitly encourage thinking about disciplineproblems., .Reasons for rules can be given. These appear in the'Personal appeals' of Cook-Gumperz. They differ frompositional appeals in two ways. Firstly, there is a switchin the nature of the persons to whom reference is made;individuals are substituted for positiond. Appeals can bedirected to mother, father, child or Mr. Jones - 'You shouldnot spit!'Secondly, the basis of the appeal can, be stated -'You should not spit because it spreads diseases', 'Youshould not spit, because it makes me angry'. Reasons canrefer to consequences of different kinds. Cook-Gumperz 1.,c001-, N29.mentions those that identify emotional states of specifiedpersons and behavioural consequences for them - 'Someonewill have to come and clean that up'..Once an appeal contains reasons, there is'the heginnfngof a deductive potential for the recipient. It happens tobe tae case that some reasons used are of considerablegenerality leaping to a universal morality' independentof persons, 24E. 'Because you should never hurt otherpeople'.It is logically possible for such ideas to beincorporated in positional appeals, but whether they areor not has yet to be examined.'Personal appeals',-as defined by Cook-Gumperz alsobegin to incorporate empirical matters into moral problems.Facts are given to justify dethansds. Complicated personala-Teals can be short lectures on social psychology or physics.The giving of such reasons might serve to encourage the childto think analytically about appropriate behaviour in newsituations rather, than to, search his memory for a relevantrule.They should encourage him to integrate moral and.empirical knowledge.Rewards and,punishments are-not mentioned in eitherpositional or personal appeals. In the former, rules areannounced, while in the latter they are given somejustification as well.Such appeals represent problems mainly of principlelea'rning and problem- solvjng,\\ anchored howevef to particularinstances.No doubt these occasions may often involvepunishment (and/or reward }' as well.Withopt knowing howappeals are combined with response-based learning factorsin actual situations we-cannot comment on how appeals might'be relevant to children's learning. .Personal appeals,e<in combination with effective sanctions could give rise toa peculiarly strong rational morality backed with'emotionalforce. -Personal appeals used relatively independently ofgsanctions might Give rise to the emotionless intellectuallycompulsive morality of a child Kant. 3Q.This unscholarly snapshot must suffice to illustratethe problems, which, in spite of many years of allegedprofessional interest in maternal disaPItme-T-have_still-,.. not been accorded thoroughlysystematic analysis.Most report,ofsocial class differences emphasisethe relative prevalence of direct control of behaviour andthe relative absence of personal appeals. in the workingclasses. (Hess, 1970).' Cook-Gumperz (1973) collapses hercoding frame in an 'Undeciferable manner, but it is clear thatfor the London mothersof the five year olds she examines,several kinds of personal,appeal were more common amongMC mothers.MC mothers reported using more child-orientedpersonal appeals and they alone usedthe complex behavioural,affective appeals. By contrast, LWC mothers more often used.'imperative' methods of control, which correspond roughlyto the first category mentioned.The classes did notdiffer in the incidence of positional appeals. The similarsocial class differences reported by Hess and Shipman working-with Negro mothers of slightly younger children in Chicagohave already been mentioned.Initial conclusions might be that LWC mothers areprescribers who do not use language to justify theirprescriptions and controllers who try to achieve theirends with sanctions, while MC mothers are using languagerepresentationally, not only to set up rules and reasons, butalso to individuate, generalise and abstract these rules;they are provAding the-child with data that should _help himto generate his own moral theory.This may well be so, butlimitations to this idea need to be mentioned. Both studiesmentioned were only concerned with the negative side of control,All Cook's problems involved naughtiness and punishment ratherthan goodness and rewards. As we shall see in the sectionon sanctions, the working class have no monopoly of controlthrough their use.The content of Prescriptions has been ignored. Whilesuch a lack of substance may make it easier to appreciate the 47 31.consequences for the general intellectual development of thechild, it precludes a thorough understanding of what is .happening. -For the foci of interest here it,would beprticularly helpful to know what mothers of different socialclasses prescribe about findihg out and talking in generaland about question-asking in particular. If question-askingor finding things out themselves proscribed effectivelythen KAD should ceasa to develop- 0-,present we just do notknow what mothers (or teachers) do.Cook7Gumperz did proceed from a consideration of social ,class differences in maternal control strategies to anexamination of social class differences in children'sperceptions of adult control strategies. She tried tb linkboth to her operationalized definitions of 'elaboratea' and'restricted,' codes. While this analysis is pursued in greatdetail, crucial methodological flaws preclude useful inter--.pretations.Sheer verbal output of mothers correlated sohighly with varied indices of code'and strategies, that therest of the analysis isrendered void. The consequentfailure to find evidence of the existence of 'restrictedcode' mothers may do Bernstein's original thesis unwarrantqdharm. ,Although Turner (1972) did not look at maternal speech,his careful linguistic analysis of children's spontaneousdescriptions of control strategies to adults in a story-telling activity did reveal social class differences likethose found between mothers. The simplest hypdthesis'wouldclaim that, within the\"limiiations of their intellectualdevelopment, children had assimilated what had been madeavailable for them to learn.Mothers as Informers.Although maternal prescriptions are irformation of a kind,particul4rly about the social world, it is helpful tocontrast knowledge about proper behaviour with knowledgeof fact.Many remarks made by mothers to their children,or in their presence, assert propositions whose truth 48 32.or falsity can be questioned. Does the utterance correspondor fail to correspond to a feature of the extra-linguisticworld?Is the cat sitting.on the mat? There are rules forevalUating the truth or falsity of empirical statements.We looked at the answers mothers said they would give tocertain questions supposedly asked by their five year oldchildren (Robinson and Rackstraw, 1972; Robinson 197).Relatilie to MC mothers, LWC mothers were less likely toanswer questions asked, their answers contained more-inaccuracies of fact and they were less likely to stress thatthey thought what is said should be true. MC mothers werenot so likely to give answers irrelevant (contextualinappropriateness) to the question posed and their answersWere organized into sentences that did not have, messyadditions to the main content. They gave more information(contextual completeness) in their answers. They were morelikely to point out similaritie's and differences between thetopic in hand and other topics. In answer to 'why'' questionstheir explanations were more likely to refer to analogies,causes consequences and classification, whereas the LWCmothers showed a relatively higher incidence of appealsto simple regularity (they alwa'yth do) and repetitionsof the question as a statement (because they do.) What arethe differentes in'iearning opportunities, for the MC and LWCchildren?First of all, more knowledge and more accurate knowledgeis being transmitted for MC children. The representationalfunction of language is being exploited, not only with atightness of correspondence between what is said and what it isabout, but also with an attempt to order the extra-linguisticworld.Categdries'and relationships are made explicit, bothfor classificatory systems generally and for causal analyses.If we recall Piaget's description of the intellectualdtvelopment of children froM five to eight, the MC mothersare making available just the kind of knowledge which thechild is then supposed to be acquiring. Incidentally of49 33.course the child is also learning about the skills of .questioning.He has the opportunity of observing how hisdifferent questions are differentially treated. TheLWC mothers are not so Piagetian. The correspondencebetween speech and its extra-linguistic subject matteris not so emphasised either -by precept or example, lessfull answers are being provided less often. The heavieruse of 'focus on proposition' modes could discouragefurther questioning. If all 'why' questions get thesame answer there is .little poin:, in asking them.Theabsence of empirically relevant ntent will not eitherencourage'inquiry or add to knowledge.Here no interest was shown in the extent to whichlearning in this context might be response-based ratherthan intrinsically motivated. Punishments and/or rewardsfor asking questions might be given, and these could bedifferentially distributed by social class; the problemshould be investigated. In our data it was the differentialconsequences for -intrinsically motivated learning that .seem,A to be most evident.But are these opportunities exploited by the children?We went on to look at seven year old children's answersto '1h' questions and found social class differences thatere most simply described by saying i,hat they reflectedthe differences revealed by'their mother- if one allowsfor the difference in age and situation. For example,seven year olds gave less information in answer to certainquestions .itan did their mothers: Their answers weregenerany rare immature and egocentric (in the Piagetiansense of the word.) The mothers had been thrust by theinterviev.,,r in,:o the role of 'informer', the childrenwere simply telling interviewers what they knew.Itmay not therefore be surprising that children gavefewer 'Because I say so' or 'Because it is so' responsesthan their mothers. ,50 34.While these data are quite consistent with the simplest-hypothesiS that children's knowledge reflects what has beenmade available for them to learn, some tighter analysiswould leave fewer other possibilities viable. It wasopossible to extract a limited number of mother-daughterpairs from the original sample and to pursue a furtheranalysis within class. Categories of responses of mothers,were re-grouped to give a small number of higher-ordercategories of which four are immediately relevant. Thefirst, which counted and combined' the presehce of aninsistence that answers should be true with offerings ofsimilarities and differences, the absence of admissionsof ignorance of what. to say, answers irrelevant to questions,and inaccuracies of fact, is emphasising the representationaluse of language, its correspondence to the extra-linguisticworld.While MC mothers made substantially higher scoresthan LWC mothers, it was only among the LWC children thatthere Was a positive association between maternal and child,answering.In fact the MC girls gave so few irrelevantor contextually inappropriate answers that there was no withinClass variance to explain within the group! There was apositive association between amounts of information given,bymothrs and children within the lbwer working class.Within the middle class there was a strong hint of anegative association which'could be used to suggest thatmothers may provide so much information that their childrenbecome 'overloaded' - and learn less. In both socialclasses, mothers using relatively higher numbers of 'focuson proposition' modes of answering had daughters who behavedsimilarly;The use'of modes focusing upon matters of factby mothers had no predictiVe value for the behaviour of .their daughters in the middle class and predicted a highuse of 'focus on'proposition' modes in the working class. Withthe exception of this anomaly, the results give furtherencourangement to the idea that availability predictslearning. 51 35.The final investigation in the series (Robinson andArnold, 1972)-moved into direct observation of mothers andchildren interacting. While Hess and Shipman set upmothers'as teachers, we tried to set up children asinterrogators. A variety of familiar and unfamiliarobjects served as conversation` pieces. It we ignore thesocial class differences; that were in fact generally asone would expect, the data showed identical mother-childassociations within class.The amount of knowledge children proferred correlatedstrongly with a summary index of maternal behaviour. Forthe total sample the correlation was 0.67 (p 4.001, N = 40)4 was similar in both social classes (rMG = 0.54,pN 20; rWC = 0.66,,p 4.001, pf, items- the provision ofrelevant answers, answers' whiel were related to the child's'previous experience, answers which went beyond the question,asked; the pointing out and correction of errors in what- ,children said; and' the affirmation of the correctness ofstatements by the child deemed to be correct.This index did not relate only to the knowledge of thechildren, but to their questioning as well. The number ofsyntactically complex questions asked by childrencorrelated 0.43 (p 4.01) with the index, the number ofquestions overall'0.69 (p 4.001). For the two socialclass groups of association was similar(rMC 4.001; rWC = 0.76, were providing clear structuring, making materialsrelevant assimilable and challenging, had children whowere curious and proficient in the verbal expressionof their curiosity as well as knowledgeable. Both firstand second-order knowledge was greater; KAD was more activeand more developed.Interestingly enough, direct maternal attempts tofocus attention or to arouse curiosity through posingquestions bore no relationship to the children's behaviour. 52 36.Children would ,feed on food provided, but appeared tobe uninfluenced by the chef's recommendations.We took these results to be strong evidence for the oimportance of the provision of structured knowledge,as adeterminant of children's knowledge (and curiosity aswell).That mothers' attempts to motivate children had:no relevance to questioning or answering is contistentwith the finding of Hess r..:A Shipman that thee was no !association between the motivating efforts of mothersand children's success in placing orustifying theplact,ing of blocks in t&ir Block Sorting task or theirscores on the Binet IQ test. .Both Hess ani Shipman andRobinson and Arnold found that MC mothers were more likelythan WC mothers to try to motivate. In afield of .enquiry remarkable, for the dreariness with which onehas to report that WC mothers are 'getting it wrong',it is almost a relief to find a MC propensity that'-apparently has no value.It, does look as though at last we are beginning to beable to specify some of the maternal-(or teacher) behavioursrelevant to the intellectual development of children.Our data were not intended to probe the general depthsof intellectual functioning. We were not concerned withthe fundamental operations, of Piaget. But we were concernedwith general knowledge of the world and its verbalrepresentation, both in terms of its acquisition throughquestioning others and its retrievability both forothers and presumably for the children themselves. Whileit is true that MC mothers were generally employingtechniques more condUcive to the intellectual developmentof their children, variance within class cduld be locatedand exposed.Structuring and presenting an almost assimil'able environment and mediating this through a disciplineduse of the representatiorial function of language,appeared to be re.evant for children's growth of knowledge. 53 o37.Mothers as Rewarding and Punishing Agents.We have encountered evidenqe todink differences inknowledge mtnifeated and questions asked by children todifferences in knowledge made alvailablt. by motherg. '\"hecorrelations were sufficiently fat to make us think wehad Oogressed beyond statistical significance-Itopsychological Importance. 'The emphasis in the studieswas on intrinsic rather than extrinsic motivation. Wegenerally ignored rewarding and punishing and theirconsequences.Can we really separate intrinsic and egtrinsicmotivation?If the argument being advanced here is tobe sustained, we shall even have to distinguish between'That's right!' and 'Well done!' and between 'That'srightP,said with a smile and a cheering inflection and'That's right!' uttered in a dull monotone. 'Well done!'will often presuppose correct performance and a flat 'That'sright!' may give its receiver cause to pause, ,but thetheoretical distinction will be, vital. Perhaps, the commoncoincidence of the two makes it easier for children tobe 1-reduced away from learning right ,answers to learning.pleasing answer's. .Is this not being academrcally 'petty? Two kinds of.study -show that it is not.- There arc those which show howthe int /oduction of external incentives, such as money,into a situation obliterates differences in performance.attributable to intrinsic motivation. There are studieswhich show that there is differential responsiieness towords like 'Good'. as opposed to''Right' - and that thisvaries with social class.Can the extrinsic incentives .lead children away from.4the pursuit of knowledge for its own, sake? Tt seems tohave been .so obvious that they can, that nobody hasbothered to examineethe problem, but we'can note twoapproaches to the matter.*R. ... e ...t38.Over the last two decades there has been much interestand effort expended in the investigation of 'the achievementmotive'.This is defined'in terms of a concern to pei-formwell in relation to a standard; this standard is normallyassumed to be independent of the judgements of otherS..Satisfaction derives from doing well, and if goals areachieved, new and more difficult goals are then set. Thismotive may be seen as an effective relation to the cognitiveconflict Model of development; 'doing well' substitutingfor 'knowing'. Individuzu differences in achievement motivehave been shown to relate to differences in standards ofperfoimance adopted in many tasks '- provided that externalincentives are not introduced (see Chapman & Hill, 1971 for) an extensive bibliography). Once they are, performance:.is affected by them. These investigations show qUite clearlyhow external and intrinsic factors can be made to havedifferential influence- according to how the situation ismanipulated.While we can. readily conceive of behaviours beingencouraged and discouraged by the manipulation of rewardsand punishment, a case of especial interest is that ofinquiry behaviour themselves. Only one study could be found:Deci (1970) found that the interest of students inperforming intrinsically rewarding tasks, such as solvingmechanical puzzles and writing headlines for collegenewspapers, fell off after money was introduced for doingthem.What pric, capitalism if the introduction of the`notion of monetary value destroys the intrinsic satisfactionassociated with performances? And yet if we think aboutIt, this is almost certainly true. The professionalperformer on the Violin, tennis court, or stage has aninterest in more than simply doing well. How can he beinvolved in the performance night after night, week afterweek?The conclusion is not necessarily to the effectthat performers should not be paid, but to note that 55 39.professionalism may exact its price. That one may loseinterest because one is paid is an hypothesis that urgentlyrequires investigation in our society. It'is, of course,consistent with the tenor of the argument advanced here,that external incentives can usurp control over intrinsic :motivation.Neither of the two discoverable experiments linkingsocial class to differential sensitivity to words of praiseor confirmation are strong enough to prove anything,,,butthey do show that there is a problem to be investigated.Zigler and Kanzer (1962) had seven year old children dropmarbles into either of two holes. They established thenatural bias or .each child and then watched to see howthis changed as a result of the\".experimenter showed twice asmuch shift in response to 'Fine' as they did to 'Right'MC children were much more responsible to 'Right' and'Correct'.All utterances were allegedly made with an'equal amount .f enthusiasm', but Brooks, Brandt andWiener (1969) doubted this, repeated the investigation,and failed to obtain the same results. Their childrenshowed no discrimination between praise and confirmation.Instead of checking the reasons for this, the authorswent ahead with studying the effects of variations inwords and their inflections, all spoken by a LanguageMaster.The marble dropping became a 'Space Game'.As one reads of the elaborations and refineniinti, an.uneasy sense of unreality begins to grow; it is all tooscientific and removed from breathing children trying todo something they see to be sensible. However, the resultsaro provocative. MC children showed no 'learning' whenthe inflction contradicted the word (21g. 'right'said as though 'wrong' were intended.) WC childrenlearned nothing when the tone of voice was neutral (non-inflected.)MC children modified their preferences most i6 40.ed 'bad' or and roughlyted words and uninflectedswitched choicesnext most towhen presented within it children are most responsive to thethey experience least frequently?It may be safer not to interpret theseuntil further studies along similar lines hayresultsbegunto give some stability to the findings. Both eare odd in that words like 'right! or 'wrong' werused in a context where the child had no independenevidence of their validity. There were no differenticonsequences of placing a marble in one hole ratherthan the other. With nothing but an arbitrary (andperson-based) definition of 'right' and 'wrong', it isperhaps not surprising to find children not respondingdifferentially to 'sanctions' and 'knowledge' of results.At least, however, there is evidence to point to theneed to search further. Both studies agree that WC andMC children react differently to identical stimuli. Whatwe need to know is how differently to which stimuli, andwhether or not it would be advisable to try to eliminatethis difference. The results are compatible with theidea that MC children are relatively more concerned thanWC children with getting answers right, and are sufficiently.accustomed to doing so, that they are extremely responsiveto being told they are wrong in a negatively reinforcingway.To begin to answer substantive questions about whatsanctions of mothers (and teachers) do achieve will requirebetter evidence than is currently available. We cannotjust assess whether mothers are generally punitive orgenerally rewarding. We have yet to specify types andstrengths of rewards and punishments, and when we do, 57e riments 1 I+;1(we shall find complexities arising because these willhave to be defined relative to receivers and notabsolutely - at least within limits. We shall need to knownot only justithatis rewarded and punished, but also thetotal schedule of rewards and punishments to which eachaspect of behaviour is subjected.At present we can cite studies to show that LWCfamilies are more directly punitive than MC familiesfor LWC mothers and fathers beingsomewhat haphazardly punitive when their children getin their way.A generally laissez-faire attitude totheir children's intellectual development combines withunexplained punishments and idle threats associated withstatus-inappropriate behaviour. If this mixture ofapparent indifference and negative sanctions does corresnondto reality,-it should not be taken to mean that LWCmothers are in fact more generally indifferent,to thedevelopment of their children. They may well 'love'them, but implicitly subscribe to faulty theories aboutchild development and mistakenly fail to provide them withlearning opportunities. They may not be aware that thereare more efficient ways of- controlling behaviour than delayedhaphazard unexplained punishment. It would, however, befoolish to assume that all punishment ,is administered -forthe benefit of the children. Not all mothers even wantall the children they have, and it is very likely thatthis ismore common in the lower-working than in themiddle class.Cases referred to governmental and voluntary'agencies concerned with child welfare are_numeroUs, and theworking classes are' overrepresented. At the extreme endof the distribution, seven hundred babies are batteredto death each year in Britain.Just as the receipt of negative sanctions may tendto be the lotof the LWC child at home, so failure mayJ8 . 42.be the Modal experience at school - and failure is oneform of punishment. While numerous government sponsoredor supported projects list the under-achievements ofLWC children (see Husen, 1971 for an international review)the heavy incidence of associated boredom is as readilydemonstrated (Morton-Williams & Finch 1968; Robinson,1974).In any competitive system where Only a smallminority are defined as 'successful', the remainder aredefined as unsuccessful, In so far as those successfulat age five remain successful until the statutory leavingage, it means that a majority of children are treated asrelative failures for ten or so years. These childrenare heavily'over represented in the working class,particularly the lower working class. Somehow our societylacks the wit or the humanity to ask itself what it islike for a child to be required to enter a Situationday after day, year after year, where he is defined asincompetent.That such children are only bored is atestimony to the human being's capacity to endure.While data to give real strength to this sad 'viewthat LWC children are general victims of punitive schedulesof reinforcement both at home and at school still haveto be collected, a pvima facie case for such a contentionis easy to draw up.The general fate of MC children is not, however, whollyenviable.Both home and school may be operating rewardrather than punishment schedules, but the price of contin-uing rewards is continuing success - and punishment isavailable if needed. Evidence on the development of thehigh achievement motive in children associates this..withheavy rewarding and punishing by mothers. Mothers of boyswith high achievement motive in fact punished them morefor failure than did mothers of low boys, but this tookplace in a much more rewarding context (Rosen andD'Andrade, 1959). The caricature of the influential mothee 59 v '43.that can be extracted from Berkowitz (1963) is of anemotional dynamo, switching /love' on and off strictlyin relation to whether her child meets the standards -she sets for it. Her friends would represent her asutterly devoted to her childrem's success; ,her enemies wouldcall her a vicious domineering blackmailer.The MC child can console himself that the reinforcementschedules do enable him to acquire large quantities ofinformation in the course of his educational careers. If`he is fortunate, he will also he given the opportunity toprocess this information, analyse and organize it.Ifhe is very fortvaate, he will not be so sick of response - f based learning that his intrinsic motivation fortknowledge acquisition will have atrophied. Casualobservation of the elite at university does not serve toreassure; there appears to,be more similarity betweenSkinrgr's pigeons pecking for food and,students learningright answers for degrees than popular myth would have usbelieve.Their KAD's have not been destroyed, but, theyhave not been systematically developed either. They areapt to complain, and with justification, that there is notime to use their KAD's except for vacuum cleaning writingsfrom set books and lectures.This brief evaluation of reinforcement schedules inlearning is intentionally contentious. It is not beingsuggested that attempts should be made to eliminate response-based learning from hOmeand school. It is being suggestedthat we should be aware of the consequences of using therewards and punishments we do and that these consequencesbe carefully examined and evaluated, especially in so faras they may result in a stunting of the development of anindependent general problem-solver.Limitations of the Analysis of Maternal BehavioAr.We have arbitrarily divided the role of mother iito fouraspects, each of potential relevance to the intellectualdevelopment of her child. They are by no means exclusive 0 or exhaustive.With the category of Informer we emphasize her roleas a passive source of verbally mediated experientiallybased knowledge. With that of Teacher we emphasise thatshe is an active source. With that of Prescriber weemphasize her role as a definer of what is proper and' appropriate rather than what is. true or false. With thecategory of Rewarder and Punisher we note her power as acontroller of behaviour rather than as a provider ofknowledge. tut any particular situation may well compoundall four.We have omitted to discuss the extent to which herprovision or withholding of objects may be relevant to ddevelopment.By buying some toys rather than others, sheaffects the chances of some skills rather than othersdeveloping.By her arrangement of the furniture, sheaffects the chances of accidents and conflicts occurring.By her watchfulness and her insight 'she can affectwhether 'punishments' are administered before, during orafter events.By encouraging some friendships anddiscouraging others, she can affect the learning oppor-tunities of her child.We have totally ignored affective development and thenecessary integration of intellect and affect in growth.Summary.,The evidence brbught forward and the mini-theoriesreported combine to substantiate the theoretical frameworkoutlined in these two chapters. It is fruitful to assumethe basic validity of a cognitive developmental approachto intellectual development and ask how factors outsidechild may interfere with this growth. We have not citedin any.detail the extensive, studies of the effectsOfreinforcement on behaviour.' Such evidence as we havementioned is consistent with the view that what currentlyhappens in homes, schools and society generally frequentlyinvolves a heavy reliance on motivation supported by external 61 45.incentiveWe do reward what is defined as good and wepunish what\\is defined as bad. To the extent.to which we doso, we riskdiminishing the power and value of intrinsicallymotivated learning. It has been argued that this can effectthe acquisition\\of both first-order and second-orderknowledge and that it may depress the vigour of the operationof KAD.We' hnve suggested that the dominant modes of incentivesmay diffe: for LWC and MC children. We have raised thesuggestion that MC children are exposed to predominantlyreward-based schedules of reinforcement both at home andat school, but that the threat of punishment for failurehangs ready in the background. Persistent general failureat school for inadequate academic performance and punishmentsat home as a means of establishing proper behaviour emerge ,as more likelyexperiences of the LWC child.The relevance of the structuring of the environment tothe development in children of knowledge, knowledge acquis-skills and the frequency of their utilisation is morehighly associates with empirical evidence.We are able toslecify conditions-associated with high rates of questioning,complexity of questioning, and high amounts of verballyexpressed knowledge by children. Not only can we show thatmaternal behaviours are relevant, we can understand why theyshould be.There are social class differences in thebehaviour of both mothers and children consistent with theideas of Piaget's view of cognitive development and Bern-stein's views about the differential use of language.WHAT IS TO BE DONE.We have tb find out more about the intellectualdevelopment of children. We hope that the story toldin these chapters may prove to be a morff constructiveframework for posing problems than more starkly partisanalternatives.But having made due obeisance to the godsof more research,we,may also note how little society doesto transmit the fruits of research back to those whose roles 62 1 46.require them to possess such knowledge. A cynic might addthat what we do manage is usually expressed as an insultingcriticism.to some sector of the population and a demandfor more governmentAl intervention!It is perhaps surprising and distressing that humanbeings are so uninterested in themselves. Our lives seemto have become arranged so that we have neither the timenor the -interest to find out more about ourselves. Moreparticularly we are surprised that people are so un-interested in child development. Parents have such prolongedopportunities to observe their children, it is extra-.ordinary that more is not generally known.We in the specialised institutions do our researchand write research reports that may be misreported bythe mass media, while the mothers, fathers and teacherswho ultimately pay for the research are left ignorantof the fruits of their taxes. In one sense it is theirown fault.There are limits to what we can do. If theychoose not to read the paperback books we write, weneither can nor would try to make them.On the other hand government, both central and local,could promote an interest in knowledge rather than Complainof the expense of providing resources to 'compensate' fortie inadequacy of home backgrounds. The preferred solutionto problems is more frequently in terms of means that depriveparents ,of responsibility rather than equip them to shoulderand enjoy the responsibility. There is virtually noencouragement given to parents to teach their children;there is evidence rather of the reverse, particularly inworking class areas. One strong class difference betweenmothers in Bernstein's sample was/the perceived divisionof responsibility for promoting 61e development of the child.MC mothers saw the child as a unit and thought teachersand parents should cooperate to help the child; WC motherswere more likely to say discipline and nurturarce weretheir problems and education the teachers' (Jones, 1966) 47.Perhaps the nursery schools euvi:wIred would be moresuccessful if mothers came to see what can he and needsto,be taught to children. Perhaps courses in childdevelopment mii,:ht boost morale and the thirst for knowledgein many a 'classroom in secondary schools. Perhaps wecould try to d;troy the pernicious stereotype that definesan active interest in his children's intellectual de%lopmentas an unmanly concern for a father.Our society has so far been hopelessly unimaginativeand unenterprising in its approach to helping parentsto help their children.We confined our attention to teacher3. We concentratedon teachers concerned with mainly working class childrenbecause if one passes a social class-related judgement,these children lose out more - their knowledge and KAD'sare more likely to be less developed than possible, theirverbal skills in questioning and answering an obvioustarget for improvement. But first we need to know moreabout the development of questioning skills, the processesand problems.And we also need to be convinced that LWCchildren have special difficulties before suggesting anyspecial teaching efforts directed towards them. 644.\\X 48.CHAPTER 3.QUESTIONING, ANSWERING AND SOCIAL CLASSABOUT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERSGrowth In the Mastery of Interrogative Forms.Two recent accounts of the questioning,behaviour ofchildren are more remarkable for their differences thansimilarities.Cazden (1972) writes clearly and simplyabout the growing child's attainment of mastery over/the production of the various,interrogative forms of theEnglish language. She selects and summarizes the casestudies recorded by Brown's group at Harvard. Thedescription is in the terminology of transformational-generative grammar. Robinson and Rackstraw (1972, pp.2-6)and chapters 2 and 3) fill many more pages with a taxonomicschema for the classification of questiOns, answers, andthe relationships between the two. . -This account takes itsterminology from descriptive linguivtics, mainly fromHalliday (see Turner and Mohan, 1972). While it liststhe conventions of adult English usage and locates anddefines possible sources of choice, error and confusionat grammatical, lexical and semantic levels of analysis,Cazden concentrates on stages of growth and attempts toextract .e'rules' that might be used by children togenerate the various intermediate interrogative structuresthey produce.The reasons for these differences are easy tounderstand.One records the growth of the picture, theother is intended to prsse'nt an idealised finished portrait.Together they provide the history and the geography.History is perhaps the better starting point, but itselfneeds to be prefaced by a brief synopsis of how thetransformational tradition construes the problem.Interrogative forms are treated as derivatives froman implicit declarative base structure. The transflrMations 1+9.are achieved by a number of separable operations. We haveto move from the declarative 'The boy can drive a car'with its posited structure of (Noun, Phrase, Auxiliary,Verb Phrase) to the interrogative 'Can the boy drive acar?'.This i, achieved by preposinr, the auxiliary. Ifno auxiliary had been present, it would h;:ve been necessary._to propose-the appropriate exponent of the-verb 'do'.Interrogative structures introduced by the specialinterrogative 'wh' words (what, which, who, where, when,.why, hon and their elaborations) are treated -as derivativesof declaratives like 'He is going somewhere'. To arrive at'Where is he going?' two operations are necessary. Preposingwith a deletion of 'some' yields 'Where he understand, he?' are described asneeding pronominaliiation (does he not) he?)of the icnitial statement. When such as 'Iwonder whero....', the inversion rule door; not have to beapplied.Doubts might arise about a number of features of thistype of analysis. Certainly there are rules to be learned.The assumption that they have to involve changes from adeclarative base may be desirable in linguistics butunnecessary in psychology, especially if interrogativesare found to occur as early as declaratives in therepertoire of the first verbal endeaVours of children.Ono aspect played down in what is mainly a syntacticstory is the relevance of prosodi. 'Prosody' is thelinguistic term used to embrace the whole range of themelodic aspects of speech rate, pitch, loudness, duration,hesitations etc. Sometimes ono suspects that trans-formational grammarians i,:nooe pr000dic featuresbecause the written transcripts they work with omit 50.them - and what is not seen is then forgotten. Europeanlingdists have not fallen.into this trap (e.g. Crystal,1969; Uhlenbelk, 1972). They have argued fort the necessityoof including melodic features in any comprehensive analysisof speech.In his classic text on phonetics, Jones (1956)described the basic tunes of English sentences and labelledthe typical interrogative intonation pattern 'Tune 2'(see Fig.2)He had noted that declarative as well asinterrogative forms could be uttered with a sustained useof pitch at their ends and that these serval as questionsand not statements, 'You see what I mean?! Perhaps becauseof her concern with syntax, Cazden's account omits thedevelopment of this form of question. It may be for similarreasons that she does not mention that imporative forms suchas 'Tell me why you forgot!' appropriai...1y. She work by Menyuk and Bernholtz (1969) on one-wordutterances of one very young child which illustrates thesignificance of prosody. They examined a number of instancesof utteranceo of the same single word Spectographically.They report three distinguishable pitch and duration patterns.Each pattern was treated as having a beginning, middle andend.The pitch of the longest type rose in the middle andfell away sharply at the end. The second longest typeshared the same pattern but hd a wear rise Lo the middleand tae seqwtno was pitch..dlower throughout.

There were 'differencesin the durations for which intermediate forms were retainedin each sample child's speech. Each of the three childrenstudied constructed temporary idiosyncratic forms - itappeared that these set formular. could either disappearabruptly after intensive use or serve as a foundation fora next development. The order in which later forms appearedwas not constant from child to child.This element of disorderliness is now recognized to bea more likely feature than the universal sequence belovedby and believed in at one time (see McNeill, 1970 for thebelief and Bloom, 1970 for the disorderliness). rJ.o'53.TABLE 1.STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF QUESTION FORMS.Ages for Adam Yes -No Que-stionsPeriod A(28 MOS.)

A new feature is taken into therepertoire.Its initial use is not perfectly appropriate,but is widened, narrowed and redeployed until it stabilizes.The most likely source of information for improvement inaccuracy in the use of features is the responding of otherpeople.Is the child's utterance corrected or ignored?Is it-responded fo in a way that confirms or corrects the '..,c,, use made of it? One might expect.that the particular stepstaken, will be a joint function of 'easiness' in terms ofpresent knowledge, pressure of demands of self and others,and opportunities for learning through testing.The stumbling incremental approach can be illustratedwith Cazden's citations that transposition entered intoYes/No interrogatiie structures before entered into thoseintroduced by '00-words, and by Bellugi's isolateddemonstration that transposition in a 'wh' question was s.- lost when the child was encouraged to incorporate a negationinto the question as well.Generally, the results testify to the value of.atransformational-generative approach for structural analyses,just as do those that focused on the development of pivot-open classes, negations and passives the child's activities with language are notunlike his other efforts at organizing himself in relationto the world and may yet be subsumed as a special case withinPiaget's theory of development. Children are active. Theyimitate, but they also invent 'rules' and try them out.Their development is messy, but not chaotic. They buildcumulatively, incrementally, and uncertainly on theircurrent knowledge. In the case of questioning, adultsrespond or do not respond to their questions; they correctand they ask questions of the child and require responses.Perhaps onreason why children do not make faster progresswith questioning is that adults are relatively unhelpfulto them.71.II 55. -.....Bro n and Hanlon (1970, p.44) present a table showing that, undehalf of the three children's 4wh' questions evokedreplies that could be labelled as 'sequiturs.'In s ite of such hazards, Brown's children wereproducing a 1 the basic syntactic varieties of questionforms and all the.'wh' words by the age offour and a half(Brown, 1968). Their beginnings with 'Sit chair?' repetitive 'at dat?' had proceeded 'how' and a hint of 'when.'The plausibilit of the proposed psychological comple-ment\"-to_the linguistic tory is enhanced by Brown'sillustration of the entry of 'why' into Adam's repertoire.The first fifteen rec rding sessions next thr \\four. This 'fanatical maintained over and then fall&away rather rapidly.Initially Ynost 'why's' arose directly from the mother'sspeech, but subsequently an increasing roportion seemedto arise from his own actions and though Why theincrease in usage and then the decline? Whis the mother'sspeech initially used as a springboard? More informationthan Brown makes available would be necessary t allowinterpretation with conviction. We are not told haccuracy of.asage changes during the period, althoug theexamples given show that meaningless questions did occu .We might guess that at the time the ability to utter\\\\the noise 'why' was acquired, Adam had some understanding \\that this was a question word and an inchoate notion thatits meaning was different from 'what', 'who', or 'where'.Heavy use directed at mother's speech should maximize thechances of finding out the meaning of 'why', if herresponses provide knowledge of results. Whether such astrategy were conscious or not, it would be an obviousway to attempt to establish the underlying concept. Doesthe end of the period of heavy use coincide with asufficient grasp of the concept of 'why' for the word to 'r 2 56.be used with a high degree of appropriateness in questions? ...If sc, then the subsequent lower rate would reflect thechild using the word to find out answers to questions, butthe earlier higher rate was to find out what the worditself meant.Is there not a similarity to the infant'smastery of fitting shapes into holes or his thumb intohis mouth?That the basic interrogative markers and structures canbe mastered by four and a half is confirmed by the studiesmade by Ervin-Tripp (1970) of a substantially larger sampleof children, twenty four in all. (but see p.79 for aqualification) Brown's data were spontaneous productionsin the home.Ervin-Tripp's record of naturally occurringquestions was supplemented with deliberate attempts to elicitquestions from the children by having them ask someonesomething.She found that comprehension measured as a capacity\\_,, to respond witti se anti-appropriate -appropriate answers precededproduction by several months. She noted that Carol madereplies to 'who' questions which would have been moreappropriate to 'what' and 'where'. Laura gave locationanswers to 'what do' questions. These are mentioned toinsinuate once more that the development is not the cleanand neat unfolding of a preprogrammed intellectual giant.Like Cazden, Ervin Tripp mentioned complications and depart-ures from norm', but emerges with a satisfactory similarorder theapproaches of Ervin-Tripp and Brown that cannot be discussedhere, it is reassuring to find the considerable similarityin their results. If we are tempted to be disparaging aboutthe roughness of either the data or the conclusions, weshould do well,to remind ourselves that tl-ese were pioneeringefforts into new areas with untried analytic tools. It mayalso be that refinemeSt of methods of observat5on and testingwill not lead to the uncovering of different information 73 57.about sequence in development. If categories of descriptionare made sufficiently abstract, then some universality wouldbe expected, but the more detailed and particular thedescriptions are the more likely there is to be variationfrom child to child. Questioning is only one aspect oflanguage.Learning to master language is only one aspectof cognitive growth. Cognition is not the only system thatis developing. This not only makes it more difficult totease out changes in any particular features and to findout why they occur, it also opens up greater possibilitiesfor variation in the order of mastery - provided that thesedo not presume accumulative growth. We .nay well expectthat environments which make available equally difficultindependent problems in different orders will lead todifferent orders of learning in children. We shall needto look at learning opportunities more closely. However,we may well think of good reasons why intonationallybased one-word questions should come before 'wh' questions,why the temporal is so much later than the spatial'where', why preposing precedes transposing. At present,in the absence of explanations for the ordering found, wehave no justification for assuming cross-cultural universal7ity.But language development is a growth area (see Fergusonand Slobin, 1973), and subsequent studies should be able tobuild on the framework now available for pinning down boththe what and how of the development of questioning.If our main interests are in children at school, in whattheir problems are and what we might reasonably expect themeither to know or to be capable of larning quickly aboutquestioning and answering, then the behaviour of thechildren so'far reported suggests that the starkest'elementalaspect of the questioning game has been solved round abodt theage of two.By this age the child is using some utterancesto elicit specific types of verbally represented knowledgefrom other people, and heis responding differentially and 74 s-1 58verbally to questions posed to him.We should therefore expect children of five to havemastered the fundamentals of questioning and answering!We can further expect that the majority of children enteringInfant School should be able to use and understand thewhole range of interrogative words and structures. Thosewho cannot are most likely not to have yet learned howto handle 'when' and 'how'.This generalisation is unfortunately, too superficial.We must look beyond identity on the surface to differencein the depth; the 'what' of 'what dat?' does ,hot 'what' 'what,-rs a dog?' coding,, discriminates between the 'what' of identificationand the 'what' of definition, but we would not pretend thatwe haveexhausted the --meanings of 'wh' words in thereferential categories we have used (see Robinson andRacks-tram, 1972, cap.2) Similarly, within a band ofmeaning, the sort of causal answer to a 'why' question thatwould-be acceptable to a five year old might not satisfythe examiners of a doctoral thesis. Hence, to assume thatfive year olds know all they need to know ab.xt interrogativewords would be wrong. They may have all the necessarylexical units in their vocabulary and have some acceptablemeanings associated with them., but the full conceptualrange of those units will be beyond their current srasp.That apart it remains true that unless the children studiedso far have been abnormally well-endowed intellectually andexceptionally blessed with proficient teachers, their peersentering Infant Schools should generally be able to pose allforms of open and closed questions properly. If they cannot,there appears to be no good reason why an immediate effortshould not be made to teach them hem to do so.But what is it they will require to be taught? So farwe have concentrated on the development of mastery over thevarious syntactic structures, with a passing reference tothe role of intonation. We have seen that some general 75 59.assertions can be made about the sequence of developmentof forms, and we have offered some interpretations aboutthe manner in which the meanings of the various forms aremastered.We have still to become acquainted with thetaxonomy of questions and answers, but perhaps we oughtfirst to consider just, what we mean by 'a question.'The Definition of a Question.Brown and his co-workers and Miller and Ervin-Tripppresuppose that we adults 'share a sufficient understandingof what a 'question' is for its definition to be unnecessary.Most people looking at the questions studied would agreethat the utterances examined were indeed questions, but othersmight wonder whether some were in. fact commands -1 requests foraction.Does it in fact matter how we define 'question'?We can remind ourselves that definitions are not trueor false; they are recommendations. They are useful becausethey help to prevent unnecessary misunderstanding. They helpto emphasise similarities and differences. Our previouslypublished specification of the prerequisites of questioningcited two such: a gap in a framework of knowledge or beliefand the availability of alternatives to fill that gap. Thesewere elaborated (Robinson and Rackstraw, 1972, 1615.16-17):'Regardless of whether the answer is already knownto the questioner or not, the possibility ofquestioning requires that he has a framework ofknowledge and belief and either has a gap in this .or can conceive of one.The second prerequisite of questioning is thatof holding a -set of possible ideas as answers,not all of which ethrirically are, or evenlogically could be, true. A question is posedsignifying a gap which may be filled by one ormore frolli a set of possible entries. If thequestioning person could not conceive of thepossibility of an entry different from thatpresently given, there could not be 'a question. 6o.This is not to say that the alternative canbe specified, but only that any present entryis capable of being denied... OThe reader might have been left in less uncertaintyabout the nature of questions if we had omitted to readthese conditions, they look a little as though a lawyerhas had a hand in their drafting. Unfortunately, nothingsimpler could be devized.Many children's (and adults')'questions' wil] not meetthese criteria. One critical word is 'true' in the secondprerequisite.Many of the earliest 'questions' ofchildren are requests for action, dietary and other demandsfiguring prominently in early speech. These requests areeither met or not, the implicit commaNeare obeyed or notobeyed.The answers are not to be evaluated as true orfalse, except in a devious and perhaps unhelpful way.The virtue of the distinction lies in the difference betweenfunction and form. We need to separate the'functions ofstating, questioning, and commanding from their 'primitive'linguistic realizations in detlarative, interrogative andimperative forms. If we assume one-to-one correspondence,we shall not be able to explain how forms and functionscome to acquire the loose linkage hetween the two whichspeakers eventually manage to master. The appropriateresponse to a command is an action. 'Would you pass thebread, please?' is not functioning effectively if it evokesonly the reply 'Yes'. Hence, the mysterious heading to thefirst section with its apparently pedantic references to'interrogative form' rather than 'question'. In thatsection we were only Prepared to use 'question' when theinterrogative forms were serving that function.We wish to maintain this distinction partly because thecakd's earliest 'questions' and those addressed to him,particularly those treated as Yes/Po questions are oftenaction oriented. They are requests for goolis-and services; 77 61.attempts to control and not attempts to' gain knowledge.Unfortunately, because analyses conducted so far haveconcentrated on the development of mastery over formallinguistic featur,,s, they have excluded this functional'distinction.Additionally, Weir (1962) has remarked,and the data referred to above suggest, children are alsousing questions with metalinguistic consequences. Theyare finding out how to ask questions which 'wh'words meanwhat,although they may not be aware that this is what theyare doing.Whether or not verbal questioning in our more restrictedsense begins simultaneously with the use of. interrogativeforms for controlling the behaviour of others or whetherit grows out of it, we do not know. It would be worthfinding out.In the meantime we think the distinctionbetween surface form and meaning is worth maintaining. Wewould prefer that studies that are simply looking at'interrogative ferns' should use that phrase to refer to`- theobjects of their attention. That said, it is true thatthe 'wh' words studied have occurred in utterances thatmeet our criteria.Do we wish to allow non-verbal implicit questionsto exist?Is the rat at a choice point posing himself animplicit question? Our representation of question typesaccording to form does allow this, but anyone attributingsuch questions to rats or monkeys might feel obliged to talkabout implicit rather than 'explicit' questions, and incontext, misqndestandiiig is not likely to' develop.To provide a framework for subsequent studies we canproceed from process to content and let our definition stand.Types of Questions.It has already been suggested that questions fallinto two broad, contrasting types:ape 1. 'Olen' knowledge seeking. This type of questionmost clearly exemplifies the first prerequisite, since itfunctions to discover information relevant to filling gaps 62.in a framework of knowledge. One linguistic expressionof such a question is 'What is X?'. An assumption ismade that 'X' is something characterizable by the relativepronoun 'what', i.e. an object, substance, position, orprocess which can be referred to by a substantive. Thedemand is for a specification of its nature.Of course,, the presumed truth-value of the informationalready .given in the question can be rejected, e.g. 'Whotook that?\"Nobody'. It could be argued that theassumption of the question being invalid should have beenanticipated by a prior investigatory type 2 question, e.g.'Did anybody take that?'Type 2. 'Closed', confirmation/denial-seeking. The second.prerequisite involves the conception of a set of statementsat least one of which may be false. This type of questiondemands that a truth value be assigned to a statement. Aclosed set binary decision is required, as opposed to themore open set of choices offered by a Type 1 question. Ifthe question consists of a series of statements or offers morethan one alternative, a'succession of binary decisions maybe required.The linguistic expression of such a questionmight take the .form: 'Is X Y?'Once the existence ormeaningfulness of 'X' is presumed, then the predicittionof it as 'Y' may be either confirmed or denied.These two types of questioning do not imply differentsubject-matters of interest. It could be argued that theyare polar extremes along a dimension of minimal to maximalconstraint.Questions like 'You would agree that the blueone is prettier, wouldn't you?' appear to offer a somewhatbiased binary choice, while husbands advising their wiveswhen out shopping might not feel that they are being givenany discretion in the form and content of their reply. Atthe other extreme, 'why'' questions allow a very wide rangeof choice.Perhaps each type should also be viewed as re- .,ucible to the other. The confirmation/denial question 63.type can be made redundant by reducing the prior assumptionsof the questior., e.g. 'Who took the book? might obtain thesafte information as 'Did X take the book?'; her-16e the openversion could serve an equivalent function. Similarly, theknowledge - seeking Type 1 question could be rendered redundantif all alternative possible answers and their potentialtruth values could be conveniently specified and convertedto binary decisions. If all possible answ6ls to 'What isX?' were listed, a succession of 'Is X Y?' questions, where'Y' takes all possible values', should lead to an eventualsolution.The choice of form will be multiply determined, but,all else being equal, the probability of obtaining a quick,useful closure of the knowledge gap is greater, it would seem,the nearer to the open end of the dimension the question canbe formulated. Closed questions yield high information ifthey are answered to support the suggestion they contain,but almost no information if they fail to gain such support.Conventionally, respondents will often follow a denial of theuestioner's hypothesis with the 'right' answer.It might also be argued that there is an intermediatelevel of constraint which offers a multiple choice from adefined set of possibilities. Such alternatives may beexclusive, but not through being empirically or logicallyopposite.The assumption is that at least one will. be givena truth -value different from the others, e.g. 'Did you walkto work this morning or did you come by bus?' These can_be__generalized, 'How did you come to work this morning?' orreduced to a succession of binary decisions, 'Did you walkto work this morning?'It may seem odd to elect fo a typology when a continuous..-,./(dimension can be conceived and p rhaps realized. Our decisionto do so can make an appealto what people actually do;'wh' questions are frequently 'not reduced to a finite setof binary choices and confirmation/denial questions are notnecessarily posed in a more general manner.. For empirical ti61+.purposes, it is therefore a reasonable decision to usethe two types rather than the continuum; a variable fromwhich two values take up most of the cases may be bettertreated as discontinuous; at least for the purposes ofsocial science..The linguistic forms of questions.The two types of question have each what might be calledtheir normal form of linguistic expression in interrogativeclauses.Under some circumstances, it might be sensibleto include expressions representing features central tothe concept of question, viz. to obtain information or toConfirm or deny, but which are not expressed in theinterrogative form, e.g. 'Let's see how X works', 'Tellme whether X is true'. These imperative demands can beconstrued as demands for answers to questions whoseinterrogative forms are readily made overt: 'Let's'seethe answer to the question, 'How do you work X?' and 'Tellme the answer to the question, 'Is X true?'.Certain declarative forms of statements can also functionas questions, e.g. 'I should like to know the meaning ofthis':'I wonder if it has any meaning'. These examplesmanifest the two prerequisites of questioning cited above.They are normally labelled 'indirect questions.'Independent 'of context, however, they may be better treatedas statements of'which the major theme is the speakersuncertainty.The normal forms of the two types have both'siMilarit-ies and differences. r 81o. ......................., t65.Similarities and Differences in Form for Open and Closeduestions.

Types of Open Questions.Open questions may be divided into typos on the basis of thedifferent interrogative markers used, and we nay different-iate between 'who', 'which', 'where,\"wh n', 'what','how', and 'why' questions. This division of open ouestionsenables a specification of the particular linguistic,constraints that a given question type exercises on potentialanswers.'How' questions are more *complicated than others in thatthey appear to divide into four distinct types or 'modes'which have linguistic markers, /in their associated answers. /Mode 1 of 'how' is conceropsfwfth the wall?'. Mode 2 anadverbial group, 'How did it go?, 'How well d, youski ?'MOde 3 asks for a specification of a process ormethod which may be supplied by a series'of free cp.ausesor by an adverbial group introduced by an agentiv markerlike 'ty' or 'with', e.g. 'How do you ride a bicycle ?'Mode 4 is the theme predicated type which asks fOr anexplanation that may take many forms e.g. 'Ho., is itthat John always gets here first?'Referential categories forunautatiags.It may be possible to regard the different subcategoriesof questions defined by their interrogative words or groupsas normally representing referential categories withinwhich information illy he sought. A small set bfinterrogatives appears to have a specifying furictionwithin the referential categories normally represented byother words or groups..We have so ght to reduce thl number of referential Icategories to a minimum by making each afsinclusive aspossible.The (list which emerges is as follows:Category Subcategories groups.1. Identification (a) interrogative to specify andclassify are 'what' and 'which'. They caa act within theother categories to specify the sort of answer required,'At what time did he come?' This asks for the same sortof answer as that. required by a 'when' time-placingquestion prescribing the ma-e---ef answer. There are alsoinstances of groups operating within other groups, e.g.'How long ago was the war?' Time-placing is the backgroundcategory, degree the surface concern. This specifiesthe mode of answer (for a 'when' question), just as theformer example does.Closed confirmation/denial questions can operatewithin any of the groups, e.g. (Identification) 'Isthis a knife?' (Explanation) 'Did you do it for mysake?'.For completeness this classification will need afurther functional underpinning. We have already referredto three general function's of utterances: stating, ,:commanding and questioning. We have noted the structural'.features of questioning and argued that it serves to fillgaps in knowledge. But we have also pointed out tillat thereis di sociation b6tween form and function. One source ofdisso iation has stemmed from the failure to incorporatethe p osodic features (or in writing '?') into thelingu stic analysis. When this is done we can distinguishquestions from statements and commands. At the nextlevel of decision where we have to identify whetheror not 'questions' are serving primarily to fill gapsiniknowledge, we run into difficulties. 11Fu ctions of Questions.With that slightly insincere claim to tentativeness thatacademics use to disclaim their efforts, one of usproduced a table listing fourteen - functions of language(Robinson, 19721)13.50,51). Examples of the fourteen arelisted originally for declarative rather than forinterrogative forms - except for the Inquiry Function 13,that is.84 68.This table is reproduced to show how interrogative formscould fit into that scheme (see Table 2).The original accompanying text pursued a numberof problems raised by the list, - its arbitrariness, itsneed for expansion or contraction in the context of'particular investigations, its failure to hold levelsconstant, e.g.none may conform to a norm in order tocontrol someone's behaviour and one may controlsomeone's behaviour in order to conform to a norm! Onthe positive side, the text drew distinctions betweenpurposes and functions, pointed out that utterancescan be, and often areoulti-functional, and offeredsuggestions for means of identifying functions, whilerecognizing that observation of behaviour alone may notbe able to provide this information.Here, the object of providing the list is toillustrate that interrogative forms can serve manyfunctions.It is important to distinguish betweenappearance and reality. A question from the back of aclassroom first thing on a Monday 4orning does nonecessarily announce a new era of curiosity unbou may be just 'another relude tp a lark. list will at least erve as a checking frameworkfor diagnosing the intention of 'questions', even if itis less than perfectly helpful as a means of identifyingfunctions.As we have seen, children may be using que tions: to find out how to ask questions properly (Func ion 14),but of course they may remember the answers as well,and in leading to this acquisition of knowledge peraccidens, such questions may be serving function 11 aswell.But which of the fourteen should be labelled as'questions' proper. We might perhaps separate out attemptsto control the states and behaviour of self and others(2b, 6 and 7) as 'requests' rather than questions, but we 69.TABLE. 1.FUNCTIONS OF SPEECH ACHIEVED WITH INTEPROGATIVE FORMS.Function.1.Escape don't we talk about yourproblems?

Youngchildren sometimes like to hold conversations with adults.They cane somewhat short of the opinions and knowledgealnecessy to maintain a balanced interaction, but theycan ask questions. It is an excellent strategy, requiringminimal knowledge and effort. So-risible, irritatingchildren can exploit this.Rather than delve into the problems of whetherrhetorical questions and teachers' probing are bestlabelled 'questions' or not, we shall hope that nomisunderStandingswill-occur if we use 'question' bothin its everyday senses and, more frequently, in ournarrower gap-filling capacity.Neither will we elaborate the reverse side of question-ing, that is no questionj.ng. There are norms regulatingwhere, when and of whom questions may not be asked. Itis alleged that well-bred subjects do not ask questions 1 ol the Queen.Questionare not often directed atpreachers in pulpits, 1 cturers in formal settings, orschool teachers in clas rooms. Patients and intervieweesare not expected to ask as many questions as they expect toreceive.Little children..., Certainly, the stereotypeof the norm for earlier points in our history evaluatedchildren asking questions of adults as impolite andimpertinent, and the children would be told this in situ.This still happen. Children are told that it is rude toask people questions, butnow frequently, by whom, whereand when we do not know. For present purposes we donot need to know.Answering Questions.To have separated questions from answers as we have donecould be misleading. Answers can be defined only inrelation to questions. The concept 'answer' is rationalnot categorjcal. To write about mastery of interrogative '87 o 71.forms is to presuppose a mastery of the question-answerrelationship.We use questions to find out answers. Webegin with a problem, and posing questions is one meansof attempting to solve it. We can only pose the mostefficient and appropriate if we know the type of answerwe require.However, the actual learning of'questioning skills and ofthe roles of the various interrogative devices has,initially, to take place without having a'clear knowledgeof what the devices do. It is only by seeing theanswers he receives and the rejections of questions asnonsense that a child can learn the rules of the question-answer exchange. It may be advisable to remember thiswhen examining the behaviour of children rather thanadults.In our earlier work we constructed criteria forseparating answers from non-answers.Behaviourally, an answer must(1)follow in time an interrogatively posed question;(2)be given bya person who has received the question;(3)be expressed in language.Formally, an answer must(1)consist of at least one declarative clause;(2)have lexical continuity with the question.Contextually, an answer must(1)convey a statement,(2)'not consist of a refusal to answer,and (probably)(3)be able to function within the 'damereferentialcategory as the question.Where responses did not meet these specifications, theycould be classified as irrelevances of various kinds,statements of ignorance, refusals, or failures toobserve that a question had been asked. Once a responsecould be classified' as an answer, we then described itin terms of appropriateness, completeness and what it 88 72.presupposed under each of three headings: context, modeand form.Form divides-into grammar and lexis.Appropriateness means something like 'correct',either in terms of correspondence with the real world(contextual) or of grammatical and lexical acceptability(formal) or of the suitability of the 'type' ofinformation content that is given (mode).Completeness is the aspect concerned with how muchis given or omitted in a reply. This may be in termsof information items (contextual), of grammatical elementsand lexical precision (formal), or of the number of differentmodes used (mode).Presupposition is releve.nt to what.s given or notgiven in the answer in the light of what is being, will be,' or has already been given elsewhere. This may be in termsof the information that is presumed to Je known (contextual).It may be'in terms of 'necessary' elements of grammaticalstructure not given in the answer'because they are in thequestion, or in terms of expouiided lexical identification6of objects or actions not given in the answer becausereference is made back to the specific identifications withinthe question by the use of substitute wo ds,.e.g. pronounsI (formal).Presupposition of mode assume that a certaintype of information is required or not required in a givensituation. GContext was treated at some length in our previous-account (Robinson and Rackstraw, 1972, pp.26-35), but if 1we are prepared t sacrifice a measure of complexity andprecision in the nterests of simplicity, we!can state thatit refers to the relationship between the linguistic andthe extra-linguistic, between what is said and what isbeing talked about.Mode ..'eferS to the variability in the type of answer thatistheoretically acceptable. In a given instance theremay be contextual reasons which predispose towards the useof one mode rather than another, and frequently linguistic 89 73.markers separate modes from one'another. Hence whenjudgments are made about the mode of answer selected,context should be taken into, account, and when judgementsare made about its form, mode will be relevant. Separatemodes of answer are applicable to intra-question modechoices, so that a 'how' Mode 3question offers differentanswer modes according to manner and process. Differentempirical situations, may continue to show up new modes ofanswering for the various queditiontypes.In any givenanalysis of answering behaviour, modes may be subcate-gcrized according to further areas of interest.Example:Q.Why shouldn't anyone steal?A.1.Because they get found out and ,punished.A.2.Because the people will miss theirbelongings. 4-We consider that both of these answers are appeals toconsequence, which is,a mode. They may be further subcate-gorized according to whether they are oriented towards:(1)the actor, in this case the subject (of the questio iviz. 'anyone', or (2) some.,other These subcategorizationswithin mode are related to the specific type of contentin the questijon. Here the content is concerned with a moral,justification.An example showing how a question allows answeringacross a range of'modes will probably hEilpto clarify.theidea yards from here.A.3.Next to 'The George and,Dragon'.We call these Modes (1) absolute place, (2) place relativeto present location, (3) place relative to some cther namedpoint.Mode 1 is not in fact absolute, but is a more y0 ...... ....-.Nur.rskeria I.AM i 74.'objective' indication than the other two, and perhapsModes 1 and 3 should be regarded as approximating to theopposite ends of a continuum of objectivity, while Mode 2always relates to the present place.Jr 'Why' offers the widest range of choice. It is possibleto make a primary division of modes into those which focus2141212_proposition and those which focus on substance.Originally this was labelled 'focus on empirical data'.This implies an unintended exclusion of questions aboutlogic, aesthetics or morality. 'Substance' hopefully embracesall knowledge. Focus on proposition modes do not require therespondent to know anything about the substance of the topic.Answers like 'Because they do!' (Restatement of question),'Because do' (Appeal to authority), 'Because theyalways do' (Appeal to regularity or tradition), 'Because that'sthe nature of them' (Appeal to essence) can be used with onlyminimal regard to the content of the question.

Grammarthas beendefined as 'that ...art of the study of language which dealswith forms and the etructure of wards (Morphology), andwith their customary arrangements in phrases and sentences(Syntax)(Pei,- 1966).It is basically concerned with rulesgoverning the selection ofaitems from paradigms offering alimited set of possibilitieu, and the combination of such 91J 0 75.selected items into larger wholes (syntagmes). Whereasgrammar is concerned with the selection of an item from alimited set, lexis invotves selection from sets with verylarge numbers of members. This may be illustrated withinthe verbal group:Example:The boy was hit.If we assume one interpretation of the meaning of thissentence, the verbal group is 'was hit'. The grammatical,systemic choices involved in the choice of verbinc ud -e oneiiv thin number, where the singularrather than the plural form is selected; one within voice,where the passive rather than active is selected; onewithin tense, where the simple past perfect is selected.The lexical choice involves verbs.According to Sinclair (1966) a lexical item is 'aformal item (at least one morpheme long) whose'patternof occurrence can be described in terms of a uniquelyor ered series If other lexi al items occurring in ironment' (p.412) . This could make t4he study ofle is a statistical study. A theory of lexis might be saidto thesaurus', a distinct groupof frequently associating collocates which 'presumablycould be given a single giouping label (op.cit., p.427)Collocation seeks to specify the probability fora given lexical item of other items occurring next toit or next but one to it and so on, or else within acertain 'span' of items on either side of a given 'nodal'item.When specifying our formal criteria for judging whethera given response should be called an answer, we includedO or vuorrorrerurrrommormiiir1 -ft76.lexical continuity. We are not interested in obtainingexact probabilities of given items occurring, but withassessing the relevance 'of the response- to the questionasked.Example:Q.Why do the leaves fall off the trees?A'.1. The bag is standing by the door.A.2. The Hedgehog hibernates in winter.A.3. The sap goes down and the leavesshrivel and die.A.1.seems to have no lexical continuity with thequestion.A.2. is marginal since the two events mightbe linked by the item 'winter', which collocates withthe 'leaves falling off trees'. The third A.3.,has continuity, both in terms of collocation andthrough the repetition of the item 'leaves'.Comment.'It is not until we begin to write out what we adultspeakers know about questioning and answering that wesee how much we ha4ellearned and how much there is for thedeveloping child to learn! Our analysis has, we hope,exposed the main structure of the problem, but of coursethe matter could be complicated much further, if we wishedto do so and as we have done previously (op.cit.,chapter 3).The abbreviated treatment here and itsextended version elsewhere help to define the ultimaterange of competence that the adult question-asker can achievewith the interrogative devices of the English language.The American work on developmental features helps tospecify a route and enables us to make suggestions as tohow new forms are incorporated and mastered.Once we leave the abstract and begin to wrestlewith actual answers to actual questions, we immediatelyencounter the problem of substantive and substantialknowledge., When we test children's knowledge ofquestion-answer relationships, we might choose situations Q93 77.and materials that obscure the trutn. If children giv'eirrelevant, inappropriate and relatively incompleteanswers to questions it may be because they do not knowthe,answers rather than that they do not know the rulesof -the. questionanswer game. Further, it may be that theydo,7t know or are unwilling to comply with the conventionsof the test situation.How these are re/eVant to particular pieces of research weshall have to examine en route.Meanwhile it is necessary to see whether or not thereare social class differences in the development of question-ing,and answering other than the general points alreadymentioned in the accounts of relationships between thebehaviour of mothers and children.SOCIAL,CLASS, ANSWERS AND QUESTIONS.Explanations for general social class differences in theanswering and questioning behaviour of children have beengiven in chapter 1 and there they were set in a widertheoretical analysis of the intellectual development ofchildren.Here wesumn4rizewhat appear to be I.Le facts;Why 'social class' and what we hope to capture withthis categorization we have indicated in the previouschapter.The labels are based on parental occupations,and/or the duration of their education., In our work wewere frequently able to define Lower Working Class strongly,with neither parent having done other than an unskilled orsemi-skilled job and neither, having stayed on beyond thestatutory minimal schoolkaVingage. Middle class meant--both parents had more than basic secondary education and at,least.orie currently employed in more than a routine white-collar job.Sometimes, however, we had to rely solely onthe father's occupation.ipitial investigation with five year olds who wereobliged to explain how a toy elephant worked, how to playHide and Seek, and to dhoose what to call three paintings oti 78.showed up class differences with IQ scores controlled,(Robinson and Rackstraw, 1972, chapter 5.) _Althoughthere were no differences in modes chosen for 'hbw'questions and no differences in the contextual completenesSof the accounts of Hide and Seek, MC childiten used moreimpersonal structures for explaining the workings of theelephant (By pressing...) and referred to fewer particulartimes, places, and persons (especially 'I') in describinghow to play Hide and Seek. They included a summary ofthe game ani chose titles for the pictures that caught thetheme.LWC,Otldren were more likely to chobse an itetdepicted;We would wish to say that the speech of MCchildren was less concrete and particular, and more - de-centered, but this ddes not lobk to be specificallyelated to any inadequacy with questions.However; a more, extended study of even year olds(Robinson and Rackstraw 1972, chapter 7) did provide..evidence*of a large number of social class differeAces inanswering.With, nineteen questions, both grammatical and lexical inappropriatiess waslow, 11WC lexiial likely extualiy inappropriate and incomplete. With both/'where'_ and 'when', MC children were likely to use themore generally objective modes of reference, when thiswas appropriate To ten 'why' questions, the more oftsaid they did' t know the answers, but less often gave,replies irrelev nt to the question's asked. Appeals toregularity, ecified authority, along with'avoidanceof punishment to self were more common in LWC yeplies,explanations in terms of categorization, cause and effectmore common in MC replies. These generalizationi were morefirmly grounded for girls than for boys.As-a complement to this type of task Rackstraw (Rackrstraw, 1970'unpub. provided ten year olds with answers 9 5ti N. II79..to questions, and having established that they understoodwhat to do, had them devize questions that wouldfit theanswers.While there were class differences on a numberof features,the important difference was in misquestioning.That is, LWC children were more often using an inappropriate-'wh' word for the referential. category of the answer.Five WC boys gave 'acceptable' questions to fewer thanseven of the thirty six items; only two gave more thantwenty five.The MC numbers were none and ten. There were -fifteen boys in each group. Definition questions gaveparticular difficulty. A follow-up study where :a choiceof two previously prepared questions'was required for each.answer showed eight year old WC children to differ from theirMC peers in their preference for human-centred explanationsfor a 'why', and definitional- 'what' questions. A finalstudy, with ten year olds, again requiring questions to bedevizewhen only the type of answer was defir.ed, move on from answers and the question-answerrelationship to questions themselves, Heber J1974)collected questions of seven year olds bout trees, spaceelectricity and other topics. LWC., childr n gave a higherincidence of statements and not questio s, their questionshad a greater tendency' to stereotype (Does it swim?, Dcesit run?, Does it hop ?), Does it fly?) more deviationsfrom standard or dialect English, and a higher proportionof open, simple, and perceptually based questions,as opposedto closed, complex and conceptually based ones.Bruck (1972) incluaed Bellugi's test of competence at .4 asking questions among the tests of encoding and decodinglinguistic and communicative skills in her study of socialclass differences through time among Canadian kindergartenchildren.This test requires the child to sptak to a doll,e.g. ask the doll when she will perform some action, and 96 t at o , 80.4the items require a variety of transformations, . transpositions, of auxiliaries, and verbs. While the errorrates appear\\to be generally high, averaging nine for only.fourteen items, this is misleading, since errors includedthe whole range of problems r erred to above. The only '4substantial class difference wa. that WC children were.more likely to repeat the item- as statements. The MC_rate of doing this was negligib e, both on entry to .kindergarten' and aftkr six months re; WC children main-tained a rate of overtwo per child. suspects that,as with Heber's seudy,\\the average is samewhdt misleading,being derived perhaps from a combination of a nearperfect majority and an\\incompetent,minority.In a semi - natural c\\ildt-mother interaction situationin which the child was i:, eri3sposed towards question-asking,MC six year olds asked -mo e how (degree)f 'why' and fewerwhat' questions than UWC children (Robinson and Arnold,1972).Their'queVions we e more likely to be grammaticallycomplex.There were no cla s differences in the rate ofquestioning.This.last result is not supported by the finding's of\\ Wootton (1974). Four year olda talking-naturally with something mothz'r rather than from some ongoing activity. -Tough (unpub.) writes about 'favpured' and 'unfavoured'homes and not about social class, but if we assume a9consideiable measure of overlap in the categoriek, we 'shallnot be in danger of great error. Her data on three yearolds show interrogative forms used to fill gaps in knowledgerelatively infrequent overall, but making up a higherproportion of all questions in the favoured (6.2 per cent)than in the unfavoured group (0.9 per cent).

What, there ispoints to A higher rate of questioning in the MC children.- -That this leads to a greater amount of knowledge 'beingacquired is consistent with the higher scores fOrcontextual colileteness,in their answers found byRobinson and Rackstraw.

Williams and Naremore (1969), however,found that class differences in initial responsiveness---7 to questions disappeared under probing. LWC children-ansWt\":60--thiF-questionasked and no more, were MC childrenwould elaborate their responses. Asked whether they'tadwatched TV the previous night MC children would launchoff into a description of programmes seen, whb:eas WCchildren would say 'Yes'. Robinson and Rackstraw didprobe each 'why' question three times, but clearly thereare methodological pitfalls which can lead investigatorsinto false inferences.Sparcity is not the same as absence, and the resultsobtained are much as would be expected if the develbpmental 82.story told in chapter 2 is sound. They point to a relative'deficiency in questioning and answering of lowerworking class child fen. Whether this deficiency marks a lagor'a difference ie orientation to knowledge and knowledge-Seeking, we cannot adjudge on the evidence. Whether thedifference lies in unimportant linguistic details, importantlingUistic features, or deep cognitive structures we-- cannotsay. ,To,begin to answer such questions would require muchmore intensive observation and experimentation, that wouldinclude analyses of sanctions employed relation to andrules governing the judged appropriateness of inquiry .behaviours in children.

In-relation to,the rules of StandardEnglish, LWC children were more prone than their MCpeers to make mistakes of both omission and commission.Their answers were more often irrelevant to thequestiOns poSed,They,gave more egocentrically elrelative answers to 'where' and more objectiyemodes would have been likelyto beirformitive\\oa wider rage of interrogator's. Inanswer- to 'why' questions, they used a highei'proportion .,of 'focus on proposition' as opposed to 'focus on substance'modes.Problems of irrelevance in the linkage betwe6nquestions and answers are examined in chapters 8 and 9.Here 1p delve a little into the,last.issue-of choice of'mode for .,;.,Were the responses we .obtaiqed4jreflection Alll'.41,i,ts-:: rather competence, ability? is possible t,b4VAWQ:',Ichildren had causalanswers available, chose to'MaXe:Appeals to regularity.,That we probed each answer 'three timer,, and still failedto evoke such causal answers can be used to argueagainst this being likely. (The children,did notweep bitterly subsequently.) Children had ample 0..opportunity to produce more than one,made to each'question.If could be,however, that the 'focus onsubstance' answers are most difficult to construct evenif a child' knows the relevant /content. We think we gavethemenou' h time to think about their answers before theyby gave thembut' we cannot be sure:' Another possibility isthat the children were ignorant of the substance needed. 1010 85.Perhaps they would have recognised a better answer ifthey had met one, but were themselves short Of thespecific, information. To check whether their comprehensionand evaluation are.indeed effdctil.e for handling 'focus ondubstance! modes, we decided to provide our eight'and nineyear old WC children with various modes of answer to'Why' questions and have them evaluate them. ,We did notin fact find out what the children thdught about 'focuson prOposition' modes, although .this could be an interestingmatter, especially for social and moral'questions.. Weignored appeals to analogies and Contrasted appeals to-imm-,ediate functton:and.categorization.Children and :slid; children should be'able.to 'bsee that objects can be grouped into various sets accordingto different-.attrEbutestoe.c. colour, shipelfunction, etc.Do they see the assignment of an event or process to asuper-ordinate generalisation as a valid'answer to a'whyl..,.question?How do they view appeals to immediate anddistal causes?to they still prefer functional explanation?At yoUnger.ages children show a preference for human-antredor even self-centred functional explanations of naturalphenomena,,e.g*. tha sea-has .waves so I can swim in if(Piaget, 1930, Robinson, 1973.)If the attitudes which children 'express towards thesevarious explanations differ, there may be implications foreducational practice. In so far as children learn fromother people's answers to their 'why' questions, answersframed in unacceptable modes will be of little educationalvalue, if this unacceptability results in no learning.Favourable evaluations of 'focus on substance' explanationswould, if valid, imply the,suitability of their use.Although one might find certain modes of explanationpreferre d by children of this age, the amount of information 102 Or& '86..it&w,Or-\\%0 4\\ they can absorb will also be limited. -They may prefershort snappy answers to longer ones. To gain some idea'oaf the amountcof information preferred, we decided to offerwimples of longer and shorter'answers to each question.We ignored difficulty defined in terms of abstraction or,generality and concentrated on complexity of syntax andnumbersof words. But what standards were we to use?At the easy end we opted for one main clause of a length 'that'thildren.of this age themselves generate. w TemAin(1957) provides some indication of utterance lengthsiri children's speech. She found monotonic increasesin length from ages three through to eight. Some eightyear olds were typically using 7.6 words per sentence,it seemed reaspiable to select eight,or nine wordsas a suitable span at the lower .limit for our eight ant.nine year olds.For 'the upper limit the problem was more difficult'.Templin found 14.15words as an average for the fivelongest utterances of eight year olds. Twenty-eight per .cent of sentences were compound andhcomplex,orelaborated.We thought it appropiqate.to have a main,1a co-ordinate and a subordinate clauil-and-we-raised_ t.he'sentence length to about 19 words,'roughly double thatof the shorter answers.;Materials constructed with these characteristicsin mind were tried out on a small pilot sample ofchildren and found to be appropriate to the purposesin mind. Our pafticular reasons for. using length and amountof information were based on an interest in seeing whetheror not children would prefer tomake the extra effortof understanding for the reward of gaining moreinformation.Or would, the extra loan overwhelm them?In-a previous study (Robinson, 1975), it wasfound that 1. 0,,`') ..! 87.MC mothers characteristically provided more information's ..- . . in answer to their children's questions than di d tWC. - .'mothers).The MC Children knew more than the tne same and same positive association 2)'betweemother's provision and child's knowledge was D q's in the working class, but a reverse trend appeared1within:thd-middle class; mothers giving-more informationd childrenirwho gave less.

It might be expectedthat these investigations would be the empirical:heart of our concerns, but this is not so.. Our main interesthas been, and for most of the, pvestigations reported, willremain, inAhe questioning skills necessary for satisfyingcuriosity - the ability to pose appropriate questions andto generate and evaluate answers. We recognise however,that the problems' \"f' arousing and maintaining curiosityare crucial to pr- 'tending prescription for an_educationthat is,to rely on tht encouragement of intrinsicallymotivated learning as ell as upon the carrot and the stick.T6 omit any-investigati.n in this area would rook Hieeither--;ignorance or cowardice.We set ourselves one very limited.,problem on thissubject of arousing curiosity. Given a topic, could wevary its form'oepresentati to affect the incidence andtypes-of questions asked abou it?If this specific problemcan beshown.to have sensible nswers, then it is reasonable , to expect that a whole-host of ,csociated issues could beanswered with similar.expe'rimenta designs.Enquiries,made of teachers in other and earlier studygroups and encounters for generaliz tions about ways ofarousing curiosit.c).'disclaimers that 'It all depends:.-a-drsMal successionThe consensus'was--- that children were wholly unpredictable What would arousethe curiosity of one set of pupils in oncontext on one daywould have no predictive power for other\\i\"upils,othercontekts, or other days. That everyinstarieis unique in ,\\\\\\1,5, 99.so many ways is improbable, to say the least. But itcould be true, and it can be checked. And it is 'of course T:,against the behaviour Of children, and not against theopinions of teachers, university research workers or anyoneelse, that the checking must be done. These opinions ar=invaluable as a source of ideas about likely determinaritsoof curiosity, ;but they are not evidence for or against -\"answers to tliepe questions. Informed personal opinion isno substitute for empirical results. If we accept, andfinally we ha.:Veto.do so, that opinion and ritual must bereplaced by faith founded on explicit evidence, we can askwhat] type of generalizntion this evidence might yield.We woulAnot expect universally valid generalizationsto emerge.'It `is unlikely that A's evoke more questionsthan B's for 'all .children in all situations45 But the resultsfrom asuccessionof individual and diverse studies should\\ lead to the accuftlitlation of a body of qualified general- --;/Nizations.And, as, these generalizations proliferate, it..is to \"be expected that the creative imaginatPon of someonesomewhpre will interpret the generalizations in terms ofprinciple:;.This picture of inductive-accumuiation issomewhat misleading. We already have concepts and theirconfliction in principles. In Chapter 1(Fig.1) we set outa model of man with concepts linked together, e.g. otherthings being quiet, incongruous stimuli will .generate ,uncertainty that will be expressed as one or morec.ofseveral epistemic behaviours, which in'some specifiablecircumstances will relevant -stimuli are relational notcategorical.They can Only be defined'ifiwe know whatthe person perceiving already knows. But what we needto do is to translate these concepts into their empiricalrealizations, so that theory and, evidence can guide andrefine each other. It isearlydays as yet, and we haveonly begun to scratch the surface in the search for 116 0'0 100.determinants of curiosity (see Duffy 1974 for a review.)Possible sources of influence can be quickly listed.Not only the present knowledge of children, but also theirattitudes and dispositions; general-and specific, chronicand acute, will severally be relevant. So will the pastexperience of the class, the skills of the teachers, and thenature of the learning problem. We shall ignore all theseand look only at materials.We chose materials and just one aspect of these becauseeyare a curr3nt focal point of interest in educationalresearch.The Schools Council has many projects busilydevizing and constructing materials. The manufacturersof autlip..visua,1,,...,t_e,ctnitiuda ''-hame'\\not,--..been----dtbw to proliferateexpensive gadgetry and schemes for the education market.oot\\Muchnof this is intended to be more interesting thanearlier materials.

That manufacturei-s do not\"feel obliged to have their products empirically tested andpublicly attested is presumably only because they can sellthem without, purchasers makingsuch demands of thqm. Ifpurchasers of equipment in the educational sector refusedto buy *hen there was inadequate evidence for the utility*the equipment, some systematic evaluation might beginI'to appear.The buyers only have to behave as they would'whenthey .buy themselves a car or razor. Why then is suchunvalidated equipment bought? There will be many reasons,1- O101.some dnvolving misguided good intentions, no doubtacca'Sionally associated with en!ianced status, fashion,and:OMe-totisms. Unfortunately, these are not simplyinsttiiib-es of 'caveat emptor'.

If those whoare responsible for dispensing edUcltional 'cures' couldcome to see. the parallels between their behaviour and what',would happen to children's health if doctors issued'4prescriptions fort.untisted medicine with the same abandon,perhaps they would become a little more circumspect in theirenthusiasm fOr the technical panaceas. As successive'cures'fail, it is alsonoteworthy that it is ,the intellects of\\ the children. aftd their hoe backgrounds 'that are blamedrather than what happens- in'the schools, or what societydemands of the schools.This diatribe is occasioned by the fear that thechildren, the *Imes, and the psychelogits will again beblamed when 'guided discovery learning' and Piagetian theoryare shown not to be of use in improving educa.ir.nal standards. 118 102.Its more likely that thetie wiYl fail'because'they.are\u00b0understood and their range of application has been over-esti;ated and not checked. Add it maybe concluded thatarousing curiosity is not a useful aspect of educationalpractice.' The reasons vested interest incuriosityhave been given in Chapter 1.: Our concern that it maynot be properly exploited is exemplified in the picturebfthe response -based learning that may come to substitute or it.But all.is not gloom. The Schools Council project onScience 5 - 13 (Schools Council- 1971) is a distinct rayof hope.' This project is 'linked to a theory of childdevelopment.. The objectives of the materials are statedin detail.That the underlying theory may be'inadequateand incomplete-lerelatively unimportant. That the valueof achieving the objectives mentioned can be disputed, andthat, although iletailed,, they are somewhat vagUe are bothrecommendations.' There are possibilities ofAmendments to the underlying eheoky, changes.of orthe precision of the objectives can te11With suitable evaluation and studied use thegibath.in 'the natureincorpdrated.enterprisecan.have that organic quality which goalless curriculacannot possess (Harlen, 1973).If-the materials and their use do not encourage thea interests and attitudes required of them or if other materialsdo better, they will presumably be repladed. When other .. aspects of the curriculum innovation are treated with thesame fhoroughneis, then evaluations of effectiveness canthemselves begin to be systematic.Meanwhile we can at least demonstrate an example of howsuch an ontluation might bi made within a very limited coo.. -- text.In a second exploratory study we look to seewhether the questions children themselves produce arerelated to those they think are good., There is a .difference between producing questions which are weak when 103.one knows they are weak and producing these questions butbeIngdeluded that they-,are good.

We may note th4cit thePlatypus ascends to top position among the ,Animal.'Why'questions tended to be about physical attributes.The profusion and complexity of the results obtainedrequires some attempt at simplification. The freqUentintervention of Sex and School both as main effects and asmembers of significant interactions raises the questionof whether or not there is any general consistency in theresults relatedto School and Sex,.: This was examined byasking whether or not there is significant agreement acrosscategories of questions in the rank-orderihg, of sex andschool grdups, with the underlying assumption that i'there is, it arty be conatlatd with general intellectualmaturity.Accordi,igly, lix citeg.orie of question wePeselected and a Coefficient of Concordance calculated todetermine the degree of association ol.erall. This coefficientis like a general correlation coefficient: it shows t'ieaverage measure of association among several, and not justtwo, variables. Locational and 'How' Questions wereomitted: 'How' questions because the very strong sex dif-ference suggested this was a produce of sex roles and notdifferential materials, Locational questions because theymight well he judged developmehtally irrelevant. The rank<order of 'Obvious' questions was inverted.Total number of questions and the proportions of'Closed,non-Obvious, Physical Attribute, Behavioural Attrioute and'why' questions orderings =64, p .01).The actual order being School (B2), School Al Girls (.$2),School Al Boys (B1),School A2 Boys (B1), School A3 Boys School A3 GirlsA (B2) .The -average rank.; of t't.as groups cross the sixcategories were: 1.8, 2.5, 3.0, 3.1, 5.0, 5.5. This, puts ,c1 131 1.114.the girls of School A2 and Al ahead of the boys, with SchoolA3 at the bottom.An incidental observation was that it tppeared that .children who asked many questions Arith one form ofpresentation tended to ask many with the other two forms.We checked this for School Al where the rank ordercorrelations were high and significsint(r there were consis tentindividual differences across conditions.Discussion.The abundance of significant differences became a. causeof emba;trg.ssment rather than joy.in that each served as arepetitious reminder of the weakness in the originalexperimental design. As indicated in the Method section,. we would have had to use twenty seven groups of childrento examine all the varied factors and their interactions.We would have needed nine groups to look at'lioth Schoolsand Types of Animal. With,only three groups readily available,we chose to assume that Type of Animal would be lessinfluential factor than School and then we confounded itsoperation with ordinal position of presentation.Only by good fortune and a careful examination of thediagrams representing the interaction effects werelwe ableto extricate ourselves from the muddle which we ourselveshad' generated. Our good fortune lay in placing the Wombatin the second position and, in the concordance of the Schoolx Sexgeoups across the'six variables. It might be arguedthat the middle task was most successful in elicitingquestions because children, did not quite know what to doin the first task and became bored with the third, but-we preferred to rely on the general finding that firstand lasetasks are characterised by higher scores and toattribute the differetces found to the potency of the Wombatas a question provoker. Why it should have achieved this 132 ai. 115.0 eminence we do not know. We would have expected thePlatypus and Anteater to be the mote evocative creaturesboth because of their shape and their conjunction of oddattribute's, but perhaps' more* children had actually heard oof and seen pictures or T.V. pr6gtammes about theseanomalies of nature. The Wombat is less known, (?)and perhaps unfamiliarity evoked more'curiosity questions perhaps the Platypus ,'is not incongruous for nine---Fear-olds. One needs to havesome knowledge of normally coexistent in differentcategories of creatures for the incongruities to re ter.For-example, to see a Platypus as anomalous one needs toknow that webbed feet and flat horny bills are attributesof birds, while four feet and fur are common attributes ofmammals.The conoordinceobetween the six measures of questioningwas examined to see whether the effects of School and Sexseparately and in interaction with each other and the otherfactors might be accounted for in terms of some generalinfluence.Its highly significant value suggests.thatthis may be so. If, at this age, higher intellectual maturityis reflected in writing being an easier skill and questiongeneration a more likely or easier activity, then this maywell be the underlying reason for many of the relationshipsfound.The higher proportion of hypothesis- testing closedquestions, the absence of questionsoand by default,the absence of or materials-centred questions,all point in the same direction.The compl!.zations arising from such an influence havea double import. Methodologically, they point to the valueof using homogeneous rather than hcterogeneous samples, sothat one's results stand out clearly. They also are attribute-to the efficiency of analysis of variance as a statisticaltool; it is able to partition variance to isolate effectswhich are far from obvious to the naked eye. G4. 133 116.That individual differences in questioning r tesacross Forms of Presentation were consistent is not very /- surprising, given the similarity of the three tasks and theircontiguity within,a single session. However, this consistencytakes it reasonable to suggest that Forms of Presentation havegeneral rather than differential effects across individuals;it was not the case, for example, that Verbal Descriptionswere particularly stimulating for :ertain individualchildren while Photographs stimulated others. Hence, atpresent, the generalizations dd not have to be limited byany complications of this kind.The three toms of Presentation did influence thequestioning of the children. The analyses of the different-ial proportions of types of question suggest that each formhas Its merife. Verbal descriptions were less,likely.tbevoke a high proportion of 'obvious' or 'locational'(or materials - centred), questions, but more powerful in,eliciting questions about physical attributes and 'why'questions.Likewise, Photographs did not evoke 'obvious'(or dat7ials-centred) questions, but were proportionatelystrong in eliciting questions about attributesand locati .This latter may have been stimulated'by thefact that thstuffed animals were in a perspex case andmounted on woo en plinths, whereas the photographs backgr .While Objects evoked proportionatelymore 'obvious' (and terials-centred) questions and.fewerquestions about physical attributes, they evoked more aboutbehavioural attributes, more hypothesis-testing closed questionsand more questions. overall.In terms of general teaching aims,..'Objects' won. However,one can imagine situations where questions about physicalattributes would be what is being sought by a tePzher.Presumably it is because Photographs and Objects make thistype of information'clearly available, thaiNchildren see nopaint in asking such questions. The 'why' questions evoked ... 1 41. 117.by the Verbal Descriptions were, it will be remembered,mainly about physical attributes. One general principlethat can be suggested is that it is as important to selectmaterials that will discourage certain types of questions fromarising as it is to encourage others. We are all familiarwith the problem of asking pupils or students to posequestions (or give answers) and then they give the 'wrong ones'However these questions may be sensible and valid; 'theyjust happen not to correspond to the ones we have in mind.-..What do we then do? We may ignore, we may smile andmouth a slow 'Yes?' with a tentative rising intonation andquickly pass on If we fail to recognise the sense andvalidity of the pupil's questions and responses, we are -,. emp.tasising the response-based learning mentioned in\\ chapters 1 and 2. If we do this the problem for the pupilhas been 'Guess what question-or answer I am thinking of',which hopefully not the prdblem Sctualliintended. Tie . . . successful selection of materialsIcan help to ensure thatteacher's preferred questions and \\ answers are also the onesmost likely to be stimulated by the materials.4If we choose to present actual stufred animals, we aremore likely to be asked about taxidermy, who did Ihe'stuffingand who owns the creatures, but we are, additionally, on ourevidence, likely to elicit more questions. It is perhapsnot a shattering conclusion to reach, that the 'real' thingsparks off more questions than do verbal presentations andphotogrdphs, but we do not observe this principle in practiceas often as we might. We are perhaps especially tempted tojump in at the more abstract symbolic levels than are justified.In psychology at university this temptation runs rampant.It is very common to miss out the stage of observing the actualphenomena to be described amd explained. How many studentsof psychology have never se..-:n a rat or a monkey or anauthoritarian personality ur a group taking a decision?(How many lecturers in child development have observes thenatural_ ehaviour of the age groups about which they talk_I._a_L as118. . t,and write?)But the same mistake can be made (and it'sreierse) with young children.

They arenot questions you have to answer. You have to choose4the questions you would most like to know the answerto.Bbme people'like to knolfm one thing, other peoplelike to now something else.

'Has.everybody got a number in the first box? If you reallycan't decide which you find more interesting, try to -but if you still can't, put a '0' in the''box'..Checks were made that each child had completed thefirst, box and then the twelve pairs were read out allowingtime between each for children to fill in the boxes.Children were to be discouraged from thinking some guesseswere better than others and:that they had to guess whichthese were.Rather, it was a question of what they wouldlike to know.Children were encouraged to make their ownchoices.They were promised and subsequently given answersto all the questions.Free Choice Condition.On the second afternoon the teacher' announced he would begiving each child a sheet of paper.'This is so you can write down any questions about ant'sand hohey ants that you would like to know the answer 1423 4, 125.to. First of all I shall read this to you again.'The children were shown the sheet,again, the statements'were re &d out and the children then wrote down their'questions for ,the next tens minutes. They were told thesewould be answered and this was done. The teacher helpedchildren with any difficulties.TABLE 7 ..Ruestion Preferences for Fixed binomial Results.Fixed'Alternative Condition. Question priferences wereanalyzed by category with binomiall_tests (see Table 7.) Only 143 1126.pair F of the perceptual- conceptual chdkces 'gave a preferencein favour of the perceptual (z = 2.27, p =<.023)% Pair E ofthe specific-general gave a preference for the specific :(z = 3.25, p-c.0014). The not immediately inferrable memberof pair C was chosen (z = 3.59, p < .001).and the objectivequestion of pair J was preferred (z = 3.25, p 4- .0014).While all but F were significant for each sex.on its own,girls alao shcwed preferences the specific question of H,(p= -.058) and, the human-related question of G (p.=,.012).Comment.With no baseline fdr comparison it is difficult to makeobaervations about the results. In so far as the contrastsreflect dimensions of intellectual maturity, the girlsappear to be' a little less mature than the boys and overallthere is no marked preference for the mature choices. Thisis, of course, a hazardous inference which needsto beexamined more thoroughly and systematically than this'exploratory study allows.Free Choice Con:Ation. (see Table 8) Three children producedonly statements and,one boy's questions were all irrelevant.The average number of questions was 3.26 per child of which0.81 were closed Yes /No questions and 2.45 Open 'wh' question's.Closed Questions. Of the twenty five closed questions askedfour of those from boys had already been answered in thetext.Almost all began with Six asked about diet,two about'stjnging capacities, six about the honey and itstaste, two about whether honey ants were insects or animals.The other six were about specific pieces of behaviour, egg.a'Do ants see-you?' Hence the majority were abouc, behaviourwith an emphasis .on feeding.Open Questions. The seventy six open questions were heavilydominated with 'why' questions (see Table 8) leavened in Condition.

Only a few.were improper, e.g.'What do some ants call the other ants?' or very vague,e.g. 'What do the honey ants do?'Ten children related to diet, eight about the name'coney ant'.Six asked why the honey was collected, fivey/h4, the ants grew bigger and five where the ants came from.The remainder were labelled miscellaneous. 1.Perceptual - Conceptual.\"Ashton's 'Typical Question Category' analysis was appliedto this dimension. This nine-point scale from 1 to 9 gave .a-mean of 4.05 for the boys and 3.86 for the girls. Whilean attempt.at precise interpretation of these figures wouldbe meaningless, they'dosshow a lea ning towards the perceptual .1 A 128,rather than the conceptual end, but'it could be argued thatthis would normally be the case in the early stages ofinquiry about a new object.' 2.Descriptive - Explanatbry.Five children sought only descriptive information, sevenexploratory, and thirteen some of each. 3.Specific - General.Fifteen children confined their questions to hone:* ants,two to ants in general, and eight referred to both.4.Human-related - Other-related.'Only four caildrs.r referred to human-beings at all.. Twoquestions were-about honey as a food, three, about bitingor stinging and one boy wondered 'Do the ants see you?'.(He also asked 'Do the ants make different honey from bees?'.)5.Inferrable - Non- Inferrable from Text.If we ignore altogether questions which ask for a repeat ofihformation that was directly given in the text (rather thaninferrable from it) we find that two children asked only for :Iinferrable Information, nine af,Aced for only non - inferrableand fourteen for both kinds. However, it iv Worth mentioAingthat there were ten children who asked at :feast one questionwhich was to a great extent directly answered in the textand two of these asked only such questions.6.Subjective T Objective.Only three questions'Were-marginal.q.subjective;7.Labelling - Other.Apart from two girls asking whethe'r honey ants were insectsor animals, there were no other requests for labels.Comment.Just-over three questions per* child does not appear torepresent a high incidence of curiosity, and it also meant-that there were not many quegtions to examine.Originally, thirty three children sat down to write 129.questions, but two, produced scripts so illegible as tobe unanalysable. Three produced only statements, oneonly irrelevant questions. Two further children askedonly questions whose answers could be directly inferredfrom thetext. .While they may have forgotten or wanted..to check what was there, we might be tempted to ask whether.these also might still not see and. be able to use questionsas a way of findifig out new information. If this is fair,over twenty per cent of the children were not up tomeeting the task's requirements. Even if the trueproportion of normal nine year holds incompetent to askquestions -to find out knowledge is, as, lbw as ten per cent,this is more than sufficient to merit attention.That .the incompetence is not an artefact of the testing procedureswould be supported by the reports of similar results byBruck and by Heber (see chapter 3.) With most of the restof theequestions being expressed in one simple clause ofsix or seven words, there are no grounds for complacencyabout any aspect, of the results.Relationships between Fixed Altetnative and Free ChoiceQuestions...The data do no't admit of close comparisonsbetween the two conditions. It is probably easier to defendan assertion of similarity of results rather one of difference.If we ignore the minority of free questions that wereirrelevant, already.aribwered, or not even-questions, we cansay that many of the remainder related to specific, particularand perceptible features of honey,ants and their behaviour,With an emphasis on their biological, especially their eatingmake-up.These questions focused on the 'what' and 'why'of the behaviour. There was little concern with ptocessesand little interest in the similarities and differencesthat enter into the classificatory systems human beings create.One suspects that the bulk of the 'Orhy' questions would,havebeen satisfied by functional rather than causal answers; butthis we do not know. 147 130.Although the free questions revealed an interest incontent areas more narrow than these covered in the fixedalternative condition, thecIntellectual level of questioningwas similar.We'might have expected the free' questions tobe more immature, as we have noted children and adults can.often comprehend beyond their productive capacities:Possibly they produced questions which were more 'immature'but not very much so. This failure to find a differencewould be worrying if it meant that such children willcontinue just to collect little facts and not prtssand' organize them:While the investigation shows that children are capableof writing down reasonable and relevant questions about a4s topic, the questions were simple and short, closely hugging'the specific content given. It would :seem they ha-veto beencouraged to begin to in'chapters 2 and 3 summarised our presentstate-of knowledge about the development of question-asking. .in children.If we ask about the growth of ccmfetenceib askindividual.'wh' questions, Ervin-Tripp's study (1970) provides 'a useful framework: her small samplW of children hadmastered the production of the units'and structures nedessaryfor foming questions by the time they. were six years old.One would not expect that children with specific didabilitieslikeplindness or deafness or with general malfunctioning)associated with{ various types of subnormality would progiess'at the same rate. But we might also enquire about particularsubcultural, groups. Although neither her sampling nor thatof Rackstraw (1970, unpub.) or Heber (1974) enables us tosay what is normative, the evidence on the questioning .behaviour of LWC children suggests at best 'a lag, at worst I . what may amount to a-qualitative difference between them.t and 1...,.their !IC peers.,. .-P oducti on, however, is not comprehension. It may bethat s ch children are more adept at distinguishing betweenwell- and ill-formed questions than they are at producing Ithe well-formed variants. While we could have investigatedgrammaticalgrammatical knowledge by asking children to discriMinatebetw err syntactically acceptable and unacceptable questions, ,.we preferred to open up the semantic side.

The absence of any samplingcontrols does not,preclude the possibility of making useful,estimates..The distinction between 'silly' and 'sensible' is notcategorical in the sense that one can draw up lists to beallotted to one set or the other. What is a sensible questionin one context may be silly in another. Whatris a sensiblequestion from one erson may be billy from another. However,although we may recognise that the sense-of a question willbe a function of the context of utterance, th does notprevent us from claiming that certain questions wld=many be silly. There is no implication that silly'questions are uselets; Philosopi4rs,-shientists and otherseekers after truth can spend much .time-trying to find outwherein the absurdity Of a certain question might inhereand, may eventually decide the question was not absurd atall.One of, the articles or'faithin the,game.-4,Pursuingknowledge would state that coming to ask the right qUestionis the main obstacle in problem-solving and would thenadd a rider that one of the hallmarks of geniva is to'produce a sensible answer to a silly question.

The literatureon attitudg change is persuasive in its arguments 'thatchanges \"in opinion and belief are more likely is occur whenthese are advocated by liked and respected experts (seeKarlins & Abelson (1970) for a review). This is particularlyso when receivers of communications are unconfident in theirjudgments.While these' facts and those about other relevantvariables have been accorded prominence in the studies of thediffusion of propaganda and knowledge through tit mass-media(see Katz & Lazarsfield, 1955), they have not been used instudies of the primary socialization of children. Childrenare inducted intomembership of their society, and come tosubscribe in-some-measure to its laws, mores and folkways.En route they ask questions about both the phibiCal'andsocial aspects of their world. They ask questions abouttradition and custom as well as about biology and teleYision.When they ask 'Why-do people get married ?' Was Jesus Christreally a ssperstar?', one style of parrying is to define .the question as 'Silly'. Questions can also be defined as'rude, blitsphemous or cheeky. In earlier work we have lookedat types of explanation, their differential useby mothersand associated behaviour in children,(Robinson and Rackstraw,1972; Robinson, 1973) and we haye argued a theoretical caselinking the behaviour of mothers and children. Can chiidreribe influenced to say that questions are silly or sensiblewhen they are not? It may be obvious that this is so, butcan a mildly delivered afterthought of a remark by their+ 1514 L34.teachers inflence their judgments? And if so, is thi \"s re-.lated in any systematic way to the type of question whosesense is to be assessed?To this end we introduced our task requiring childrento pass judgments of 'silly' or .'sensible' or 'don't know'upon a series of questions introduced by differentinstructions., from the teachers for different groups,Method.Subjects.The subjects werethe eight and nine year oldchildren fromthree classes in comparable schools inCouncil Estate catchment areas: 35 under ..nstructionswith, a bias towards expecting many silly questions (Group US),.35 With a bias towards 'sensible' .(Group OK) ; and 29 withno bias (Group DK).Materials.T4irtyinvented questions were PrOvisionallyintended to exemplify twelve categories, whose separationwas arrived at by armchair reflection and discussion. Asthe evidence and further deliberation were to reveal,, theitems themselves and their groupings were ?.ess satisfactorythan they might have been. Each question was followed by thethree words - 'sensible', 'don't know,' and 'silly', andchildren, had to ring theword they thought appropriate. Theseparticular words were selected in the light of the teachers'advice: 'silly' was considered preferable to 'odd', 'deviant'or 'impioper.'.. To avoid the' influence of response sets,the'sequence of the three response words was randomised.The order of questions was only roughly randomised, butsimple questions were put early and three of the simple,;Sensible ones were placed in the first five.

There is'evidence that children below about five yearsof age are liable to treat the name of anobject as an integral part of itj its name isas much a part of it as its criterial attributes.The arbitrariness of the conventional relation-ship between sign and significate is generallyappreciated by the time children are atinfant school, but we guessed that our eightyear olds might not be that firmly emancipatedfrom the effect, especially if we had anadditional element of'group consensus justifying .change.23.If everyone. agreed the moon couldbe Called the sun and the sun themoon.we could change the wordsround couldn't we?27.If we wanted we could invest a newcolour called 'bleen' and say thesky and trees are both 'bleen'couldn't we?(v)Colloquially acceptable anomalous questions.Assured tLat Q.6 was no less colloquial thanQ.3,,we included them both just to see howthe children reacted to them.3.When is Basil Brush?6.Why is Christmas?(vi)Questions interrogative /topic discord.The most elementary forms of 'silliness' thatwe could think were those where this type ofmismatch occurred, e.g.. 'who' with an inanimatenon-human object or 'where' with an objectthat could not be located in space.. 1 5 41 ! 137.2.Who is the radio?7., Where is Daddy's birthday?(vii)Questions presupposing anthropocentric view ofnatural phenomena. One characteristic of thepreoperational intuitive child is his ego-centrism,one aspect of which is his self-centredutilitarian view of'the world. This''eventuallyshifts from anthropocentric views which seenature in terms of its use'to man (a not altogetherrare view implicit in the behaviour of many adults)to an acceptance of the view that nature just is.Both the questions could be quickly amended toachieve sense, 21E. -What are trees used for?,but as they stand, trees juat are, they are notfor anything.Have eight and nine year olds madethis transition?9.What'are rivers for?13.What are trees for?(vii)Tautologous\\ and self-contradictory questions. ft'c,n be argued that it is impossible to offer ameaningful definition of 'stealing' that doesnot involve an ascription of wrongdoing, and thatit would be impossible to conceive of a societywhere truth-telling was not considered a moralissue and where lying, was positively recommended.Discussionsout occasions where 'stealing' and'lying' would not be wrong are liable to renderthe above points unclear in two mr4n ways.'Stealing', can ,become confused with the questionof who iG taking what from whom. under whatcircumstances and why. 'It can't be wrong to '=steal from millionaires because no one has a\u00b0right to acquire so much wealth' is a misuseof the word 'steal'. S'econdly, philosophersoften pose moral dilemmas which 'lying', dilemmas%hich may expose prioritied and' complexitiesand conclusion nf 'It would beless evil to lie'. They only encourage answerslike 'It would be right to lie' if people insiston assuming ,(falsely) that any moral dilemma hasat least one outcome that is right.

'4 ,Children were issued with sheets of thirty questiois andwere required to ring 'sensible', 'silly', or 'don't know'for each question. The questions were read out individually.Three words were written on the blackboard 'sensible', .'don't know', 'silly'. Their meanings were discussed andthen the teacher gave the following' instructions:'Children ask questions. Sometimes they ask theirparents, sometimes their teachers, sometimes.otherpeople.When children are very young, their questionscan be all right, but they can be funny, senseleSs ordaft, becaube they don't know how to ask questionsproperly.We've got thirty questions some six year old childrenasked their mothers. I wonder how many of-them youthink are sensible and how many silly. I will readout the list and you show what you think by puttinga ring round one of the three words: sensible, .dgn'tknow or silly.': From this point on, the instructions differed for thethree treatment groups. Group OK instructions suggesteda high incidence of sensible questions, those for Group US 1574. 140.a high incidence\\of silly questions, while those'for GroupDK (Don't Know) wire non - committal:Group OK'I'll give out the sheets now.Remember thateven ckildren who are only six are prettygood at being sensible, so don't be surprisedif you think a lot of the questions aresensible.'Group US'I'll give out the sheets now.Rememberthat even children who are only six stillknow very little abput how to ask questions,so don't, be surprised if you think a 1.0t.-,9f..the questions are silly.'Group DK'I'll give out the sheets now.'Finally children were asked if they had any questionsabout the activity, and these were answered.Treatment of Results.The provisional classification adopted might need to beamended for several reasons.We might think of other waysof categorising types of oddity, but we might also find thetothers.do not agree with the judgements of 'silly' and 'sensible'that we have made. To ask for judgements out of context doesencourage a respondent to demand further information9-to askan 'odd' question might normally evoke a 'What\\do you mean?'reply, making an implicit assumption that sensemight bemade of the questiv. Subsequent inquiries of friends madeit clear that we we're in a small minority for one\\or twoquestions, while others were more disputable than we hadimagined.As well as a lack of adult consensus, there mayof course be general developmental trends.'Where is God?' .might at first make sense and then cpme to be thought of asimproper:'Why is iron heaier.than water?' might besensible, then silly, then sensible again at successive .stakes of development, it depends what knowledge underlies,the question. 0158 141.With these hazards about us, we accountof the children's opinions. Sayl.for example, 80% ofchildren were to think each of the six items in the sensiblesample category was sensible, then the category could beleft as 'it stands. Should one item be judged 'silly' by 80%it would be dropped. That is, only where items in a categoryare relatively homogeneous in terms of the proportions ofjudgemerits of particular types will they be retained inthe original group.Where responses by individual items were contrasted, X 2was used,;for the sake of simplicity, calculations were-.restricted. to the comparison of the 'US' and 'OK' groups.Where summed items were used, X 2was-pgain employed withthcut-off points being decided in such a way as to bestexpress the nature of the distributions.Results.(i)Simple sensible questions. (Q's 1,4,5,16,17,21) (Table 9)There was a consensus of opinion about the sensibleness of thesequestions;However, 43% thought at least one item was silly,and as Table 9 shows, more of these were in the US Group, thenin the OK Group, while OK and DK Groups were more likely toconfess to uncertainty.TABLE 2. -Incidence of Judgements of Sense of Questions byGroups with Different Instructions for-Simple,Sensible Questions (Sum of giving response in heading, e.g. 22children out-of 35 (n) said that at least one of these sixquestions was silly; X means the number not giving thatresponse. 159 14-2. (ii)Relational Questions (Q.8) (Table 10)Children distributed their judgements about this item, butrelative to Group US, Group OK were more likely to-say thatit was sensible or that they were unsure.TABLE 10.Judgement of Sense of (Q's 24, 26, 28)71571711)The three questions in this group did not give similardistributions. Question 24 about lying if we could readother people's -minds was judged silly by 59% of the children.Group US (66%) was very similar to Group OK (54%). By contrast,only 40% of the children thought Q's 26 and 28 silly. Group'OK was less likely than Group US to think both questionswere silly, and more likely to assume one was sensible orwere uncertain about one.TABLE 11.Judgements of spite of Q.27 being potentially more difficult that Q.23both were judged-similarly, although the majority ofchildren thought that each was silly. However, Group,USwere more prone to judge both silly anti less likely toconfess to uncertainty on either.TABLE 12.Judgements cf 3,6)(Table 13)More children in Group OK than in Group US judged these assilbr or were uncertain.TABLE 'Who is the radio?',silly andalthough the trend for Q.7 was in the expected direction,the 88% judgement. of silliness was high enough to make anygroup differences improbable. 161 144.(vii)Questions presupposing anthropocentric view ofnatural' phenomena (Q's 9, 13) (Table 14)Although there was some divergence between the items; withY. more children thinking Q.13 judgement's of silly,(X fewer of = 4.79. p <.05) thanGroup OK on Q.19, the for the two items combinedare consistent withother .There were no significant differences. among the groups,,with-items separate or combined.TABLE 15.Per,centages of Judgements of 145.(ix)Questions based on erroneous tmlisf(9,1E12,L8,'20, 22) the four questions in this categoFy, one (Q.18) wasgenerally endorsed as sensible, while'another wasconsidered by a high proportion of children to be 'silly' I, (Q.20)The other two provoked more vaFilAstion of response,but with the category cdmMonlyendorsed.' = 3.99, rejected: by the Achildren with 82% say4grt was .sensible to ask who first- invented musical instruments.- The vast majority thoughtthe other two questions silly, but there were no differences :1of significance 'between the groLps.atEuz.Incidence of Judgements of 'ask the price of two apples was :not consideredoverwhelmingly; silly when given the price ofOne'oratie.., 'TABLE 18.Incidence of Judgements of held to be groupedifferences, but'&'tendency for Group US1 IPI :re .. 147. ..to claim both questions were relative to Group OK'(X2= the categories used, the'responses ofthe` Children showed significant,diffeAncese'ttributable'tothe instructional set presented eight of the twelve ,tcategories gave differences. Of the. four which did not,the interrogative/topic anomaly pair (Q's 2, 7) and theincomprehensible questions (Q's 14 30) were distinguishedby receiving very high proportions of judgements of 'silly'vit. 100%, 88%, 80% and 92%. It would appear that so many .children were confident in their opinions about these items`that the instructions were ineffectual. However, it isworthy of note.that a comparably high incidence of acceptanceof tho-sense of the single, sensible questions (78%) didnot prevent group differences from emerging. Whether such .asymmetry is worth pursuing isnot clear. Are children moresure of what is silly than they are of what is sensible? Orcould the asymmetry be explained by the instructions suggesting. .a high.incidence\" of silliness being more powerful than,thosefavouring sense; some evidence for this latter view is givenbelow.The failure to find differences on the other two.categories is less amenable to this interpretation. Thetautologously true and self-contradictory items were thought 165 148.silly by a large majority of the children (67% and 80%)-but one wonders whether they arrived at these judgementsby the same reasoning processes as the.experimenters. Withthe evidence to hand we cannot say. Neither can we say whynearly 35% thought it was sensible to inquire about the priceof oranges, when only the price,of apples given.It istempting to suggest that they based their judgements on thegeneral reasonableness of the question and'simply ignoredthe conventionally acceptable constraints of mathematicsquestions; it was after all, fiche only question of thiltype inhe set.Two other categories.deserve special mention. The foUrquestions predicated on erroneous beliefs failed to form ahomogeneous set. Q.20 yielded a-high proportion of 'silly'judgements (78%) and its failure to yield differences may beexplained in terms of this high confidence. The responsesto Q.18 suggest that more children thought fir trees losttheir needles in the autumn than were unsure or disagreed.The US group in particular were likely to think it a sensiblequestion (53%),and the one simple interpretation wouldattribute the distributions mainly to the ignorance of thisgroup.Or, of course, we could say it was a bad question,since, as it is worded, it is in fact sensible, butmisleading.'Who first thought of making musical instruments?' wasdistinguished from its potential stable-mates by beinggenerally judged as sensible. Subsequent inquiries ofcolleagues supported the children's opinions against theexperimenter's earlier presumptions.Overall, the results point with general consistency tothe sensitivity of children's judgements to the instructionalsets given, with a reservation that high levels of initialconfidence will be less susceptible than lower ones.to suchinfluences. 166 l49.But did the children really underAtand and accept theconstraints of the taek? One index is the no-response ratewhich, at 1.5%'is sufficiently low to warrant a measure offaith in,the responses given. The teachers anticipatedand reported that the children understood the task. Theresults themselves were not random. An original worry thatthe children would tend to tick 'Don't know' if they did notknow the answer to a question seems to have been withoutfoundation.We have no direct information about the reliabilityof the responses, and although the technique clearly worked,intelligent interviewing might have revealed more aboutsuch aspects as the degree of confidence children had inthe judgements they made and their reasons for makingthem, the circumstances when thef-question offered mighthave______,have- -been even though it might- usually the children's ways of categorising :types of oddity..Would they zee similarities and differences correspondingto those invented?However, with wha't we have, we need to ascertainwhat kind of shifting occurred and for which items inparticular this happened. It has already been suggestedthat where precentage agreement of judgement is high,confidence will be high enough for children to remain inde-pendent of This would be necessarily true ifpercentage agreement were taken across all groups for extremevalues only: if 100% agree, there is no variance to explaih.But we might expect that it would be among items which showedminority proportions of each response rather than those with70-80% agreement within a group, that judgements would bemost readily influenced. Inspection of the data shows thisto be untrue.For example, although the simple, sensiblequestions were judged to be so by 79% of the sample, theyyielded between group differences, whereas the presumedhuman - centred explanations for natural phenomena with 45% 167 150.as the la gest measure of response agreement gave nodifference.In certain, methodological, respects, thisis encouragin . One type of situation in which instructionscan be peculiar y effective is where most people do noknow.The instru tions can then give a bias in onedirection or anothe ,so that all one does is pull a_lumber of respondents out of uncertainty. That we foundshifts where group agre ment in a positive category wasas high as 80% would help to refute such an interpretation;-s so does the low incidence o'Don't know.From whatcan be seen, to shift or not p shift does not seem to besystematically related to the p oportion of judgementsin any simple way.-If we ask which categoris-sho dshifts, we see thatwhat were intended to be sensible que ions shifted asreadily as those which were intended to e silly, althoughthe simplest silly did not shift in the sa e way as thesimplest sensible. While statistical compar Bons were notmade between the amount of shift in simple as .posed tocomplex questions the supposedly difficult counte factualhypothetical sensible questions did appear to yield orepronounced differences than the simple sensible ones. With the'silly' questions it is not possible tc\\talk about suchdegrees of difficulty. It was somewhat surprisineto find68%of the responses of eight and nine year olds stillapparently subscribing to some form of nominal realism.Both involved group consensus as a basis for the meaningof symbols as well as re-naming, while Q.27 additionallyincluded reclassifying with the elimination of a commondistinction.Thbre were slightly fewer responses (10%vs. 15%) in favour of the sense of Q.27, but the drop isnot dramatic.Similarly the incidence (45%) of the acceptabilityof 'What are X's for?' seemed to be higher than expectationfor eight and nine year olds. However, a defence of theinappropriateness of human-centred explanations fornatural phenomena was alleged to be pedantic and 168 151.puritannic;i1 rather than precise and proper in subsequentassorted dialogues With adults. The remaining items haveeither been mentioned already or are not particularlynoteworthy.Apart from the examples mentioned, theredo not appear to be any categories of question thatoccasioned peculiar difficulty, nor is there any systematicviriability in sensitivity to persuasive instructions amongthe categories of 'silly' questions.Given the shifts of judgement occur which fromresponse categories gain or lose cell entries. The totalpercentages of judgements for each group (see Table 20)is most simply interpreted by pointing'to the similaritiesfor 'sensible' across the three g ups and the differencebetween Group US and the others for 'silly' and 'don't know'and then arguing that the instructional bias for 'silty'shifts judgements from uncertainty into the silly category.TABLE 20.' Percentages of Silly, Uncertain and SensibleJudgements for all for each TreatmentGroup.% having any strongeffect overall is weaker, although Group OK has a non-significantly lower percentage o. silly and a higher one ofsensible judgements than Group DK.This positive pattern is similar if one looks atindividual and grouped questions; group OK being generallymore like group DK than group DK is like group US. However,the responses of group DK are fairly consistently intermediatebetween group US and OK. Hence, the simplehypothesis of Elle 'silly' bias being influential is clearlysupported; the 'sensible' his appears to have had someeffectoOse. 1U9 152.'It is perhaps unfortunate to have clouded the issue byhaving such a variety of questions in- the materials; theovershadowing effect of there being correct, incorrect.anddoubtful answers to the items may have clouded distinctionsthat might haveben made.On the other hand, separateanalyses to examine whether instructions had differenteiffects judged 'sensible' and 'silly' questions, revealed118 differential patterns.Without knowing more about the grounds upon whichchildren based their replies, we would be foolhardy toelaborate our interpretations further.While rememberingthe limitations of our techniques and sampling we can drawsome conclusions which have implications for both researchand teaching.On the research side it would be instructive to findout how it comes about that a substantial minority (in thiscase 20%) or nine year olds are not able to recognise thatthe simplest sensible 'wh' questions are sensible and withinthe set'of 'wh' questions, the development of anunderstanding collacates of 'hqw' and'why' have made wayis which children come to accept'appeals to regularityand tradition as Jegitimakte answers to We have\" the statement of a credible authority figure can affectjudgements of sense. How far is primary socialisation but amassive extension of this operation of such authority,producing acceptance without understanding.Why ate children so loathe to say they do not knowwhether a question makes sense or not?While various formsof conflict among schemers and between schemes and theresults of actions are a basis for development and learningand there is nothing untoward about children having 170n`' 153. -hypotheses which are later found wanting it is importantto-distinguish between ignorance based on some kind ofcognitive limitation and that based on misiriforMation.To know that it is Paris and not Berlin that is the capitalof France does not require greater cognitive capacity ofthe child in the same way that knowing there must be moreflowers than tulips in a bunch of mixed blooms requiresmore capacity than if you have two apples and are thengiven two more, you will havenfour.To rely.on limitedrule's which often work but occasionally generate ronganswers is different from believing statemen'ES that youen do not even understand.

Andif the teacher is wrong, so will the children be. ,Theteachers in the group were surprised that what seemed tobe only a mino manipulation of instructions, a casual-afterthought, should produce such significant effects. Wecan but repeat the dull but trUe'injunction that teachersshould realise that whatever they say may influence whatchildren come to believe. OSWe still have no idea how frequently sensible questionsof children are dismissed in this way. Neither do we knowwhether such dismissals would suppress overt behaviour,but leave the curiosity unaffected. At least the succeedinggenerations will continue to probe the status quo of society,reminding us 'hat institutions need to be justified andoccasionally expose adult hypocrisy. 171 154. CHAPTER 7.QUESTIONS AS Al AID TO LEARNING.Classroom proceedings- remain something of a mystery inspite of extensive reviews of the literature on classroominteraction.There are many reports which contain countsand classifications of the utterances of teachers andpupils, and from these it is safe to say that teachers aska lot of questions. For example, Bellak ,Kliebard, Hymanand Smith (1969) found that approximately threequartersof their teachers' utterances were questions. What arethese questions intended to achieve? Are they in facteffective?Would some other tactics be more so?Teachers are testing pupils' knowledge with questions,they are checking whether the pupils Rre attending. Theimminence of questions may help to maintain attention andconcentration. 'Although we do make reference to thesefunctions, we are concerned mainly with questions aspossible stimula-tions-to-Lea_maimg-________Lecturers as well as teachers employ the question toinspire enthusiasm. As we strut and fret our hour uponthe stage - and then are heard again next week - many of usassume that, underneath the normative mask of-indifference,the apparently bored hordes are excited.Bligh (1972)has reviewed studies of lectures and rinds that they donot.inspire students to read, think, or eyen ask questions.He concludes that '... they can be used to teach information,including the framework of a subject, but an expository approachis unsuitable to stimulate th6Ught or change attitudes' (p.223).While lecturers will continue to believe otherwise, withouttesting their beliefs against their students' behaviour, we needto consiier what 'Bligh says seriously. One common tacticto give fire to lectures is to pose questions, hopefullyto arouse curiosity. Perhaps the questions are of no use. 172 I.-oyl........ .,,. 155./'e,-,t. .....-,- Our representation of epistemic man 1contained the sequence 'curiosity questions' as a linkin a longer chain, and we vent on. to argue that learningwas proted by questions arousing curiosity. Two problemsarise.Can we dispense with the curiosity and startwith questions? Can 'questions' be given .a littlefeedback loop to curiosity, so that questions from outsideoneself can arouse curiosity, become one's own questionsand lead to learning? ..'We designed two experiments to look into these possib-ilities and we shall reserve fuAher discussion until thesehave been reported.Which Posters are Noticed?Introduction.Nationalised industries, marketing boards, public companiesand other bodies prepare w_11-charts for use in schools andcolleges.These differ considerably in the amount of pictorialand wri' en information presented. Some are diagrammatic,others photographic. Almost all are in colour. Some areaccompanied by explanatory booklets for teachers to use.-Some are 'stated to be particularly suitable for childrenof particular ages. ...We were initially interested only to evaluate therelative efficacy for learning of three different ways of\\--presenting the written material, but as our collection of'charts grew and we examined them, we were.. forced to asksome more general questions. Of what educational value arewall charts?What are their objectives? Are the meansemployed efficient to these ends?We were not favourably impressed and passed a.tentativejudgement that many charts would have\"no educational value.Some presented scattered snippets of information unconnectedwith each other and only loosely associated with the apparenttheme.We thought there was a negative correlation betweenartisti.c.merit and educational worth. Designers, had 1.73 256. seemingly sacrificed utility to their pictorial muse. Suchposters could have served as exemplars of good design in artlessons, but that was all. Other charts had more small printthan the.conditions on insurance policiestSome just failedto mike sense; the manufacturing process portrayed wasimpossible, invisible or incomprehensible (at least to us).Yet others showed little artistic sense, with minimalappreciation of'problems of balance, colour or shape. Theyfailed to allow the'important to stand out from the trivial.We had no wish to arrive at These harsh judgements.We make them in regret not anger and must, of course,concede that our impressions are worth no more than thoseof other individuals. The only sensible way of answeringquestions about the design of wall-charts is to try variousforms out on the consumer! If they are intended to catchthe eye, what is eye-catching? If they are intended tofacilitate learning about some problem, which featuresfacilitate or which impair learning? What motivateschildrenfind out more than is on the chart?Thesealre all empirical problems, where finally satisfactoryanswers can be obtained only by defining the objectives ofthe chart, and then evaluating variants of it used in avariety of ways.It is therefore a matter for regret that the good intentionsof chart producers are not translated into demonstrableeffectiveness, especially since the expense of preliminaryevaLuations would presumably be small, relative to theexpenditure involved in the production of the wall-chartsthemselves.It should also be relatively easy to accumulatesome tested principles of design, along with tested 'rulesof thumb', that, could be made available both to otherdesigners and to teachers. What public comianies do withtheir money is their responsibility, but the keepers of .nationalized industries might feel obliged to ask,whethertheir investments are in the public interest.As far as our purpcses were concerned we were happy touse some charts of the National Dairy Council. These had 1 74 157. advantage that they could be readily adapted to theexperimental design; there were three charts; comparablein topic, amount and level of information. Further, thegroup of teachers agreed both that they were the bestfor the eight and nine year olds and that they were good.Additionally there- were useful teachers' notes whichcontained more detailed information than the chartsthemselves.Under normal circumstances the teachers in the groupwould have used wallcharts differently. They would haveexploited them as one visual aid among others in thedevelopment of a small project. There were two reasonswhy we did not create this normal situation. The firstwe's that to have asked the teachers to mount a whole projectwould have been an unwarranted imposition. Additionally,there would have been inter-teacher variation betweenprojects, and this we had to reduce to a minimum if wewere to isolate the effects of the variations to be intro-duced on the charts themselves. The departure from normalpractice allowed us to answer questions about the powerof tnecha:ts themselves. Were they able to attractchildren to look at them? Were they able to lure children .'into studying them?Tests were devised tMind out what children hadlearned from the posters in just under a fortnight. Threevariations in presentation were used. For the first week,one set of posters, had ten numbered statements superimposed,a second set had-blank pieces of paper, the third hadquestions, questions that the. subsequent statements wouldanswer.Or the next three days all posters carried theten st 1nts.The double statement variant had nopreter ,ions to be curiosity arousing, the other two did.The Y.ank spaces should have aroused a general curiosity,but in the absence of any structure, this might wellhave dissipated. The questions should have aroused 175 198: curiosity specific'to the topics mentioned in them.Thequestions should have provided a framework of knowledgewith explicitgaps in it.This form of presentationshould therefore have been most likely to arouse andmaintain curiosity specific to the problems posed and this in turn shouldhave led to-greater learning when theanswers were provided. The test questions eventuallyset required the ten statements asanswers.Method.Desi n.Three comparable classes of eight and, nine year olds in council estate schoolswere used.Each schooldisplayed the three posters at a set height in a left toright setsequence at the rear of the classroom. Eachposter appeared in three different forms for the firstweek (ten statements, ten questions,ten blank slips),each classroomhaving one of each. For the second week,all posters contained ten statements. After school on theWednesday the posters were removed, and the children were given a test of three sets of ten items each of whichcovered the sets of ten facts displayed. While thisdesign enabledus to extract variance associated with the form of presentation of the facts, it did not allowany isolation of other factors, e.g.sequence of displayversus final test order.Subjects.The subjectswere the children of each class present on theliay of testing.Children who had been absent for several days of the preceding fortnight wouldhave been eliminated had they., existed.Materials.The three posters were:1.Milk through the Ages and in Modern Times, referredto hence as 'Cows and Milk'.2.How Cream is made; How Butter inmade.3.The Story of cheese. 176 os O O11 159. .The first had eight main drawings, the second fivefor ee...:h topic and the third nine.

During the administration of the practicepage, the teacher will be asking various children what theyhave written down. The children chosen 'should represent'different ability levels, so that the teacher has an ideahow most of the class is coping. Hopefully they will givedifferent answers so that the teacher can make it clear 178e f61.that two different answers may both be right. If there arewrong answers, she can snow why they are wrong.

This certainly needs morethan one word.'(The teacher asks about five children what they have written.If some children fail to write anything it does not matteras long as there are not too many, e.g. if a quarter of the .class or more,''the teacher should spend some time explainingwhy some of the,,ri2ht answers are right, and the wrong,ones wrong.)'Let's go on to some different ones now.

The first impulse was to allowonly the answers actually displayed, but since childrenjust might have been inspired to do a little research andfind out other correct answers, we scored any right answeras correct.This meant that past knowledge and intellicmtguessing may have boosted scores as well as any researchinspired by the posters.No statistical tests needed to be applied to the data.ResUlts and Discussion.As Table 2r shows, the posters did not function to attractmuch attention or learning. The teachers repo Itedthot thevast majority of the children paid no attentioito theoriginal or modified posters. Over the .,whole pupil population 1.the aVeragenumber o1 correct answers was four out of apossi lethirty perchild.With six multiple choicequestions and a measure of previous knowledge this does notrepresent an orgy of learning.The data show what looks to be a strong order effect,either from testing or from the left-right sequence of theposter arraj.If the to' .ee whether ornit formsof presentation had any effect.

There would appear to be a differencebetween schools, one school being particularly prone to 'havea go'.Discussion.nil^ we realised that'the decision not to integrate the chartsinto lessons \"might limit their power, we did-not-anticipatetheir almost total impotence to facilitate learning. Theteachers were not overly surprised.Before we make comme-nt----about that result, we needto_make-not-e-of the very highinctdanCe-of-.-wYs3ng answers.Such behaviour became a minor ,8 3 166.theme of an oarlier report (Robinson, 1.g70%, There itarose in the guise of guesses, the convergent one-answer:-only menttlity (but see chapter 4), the desi-e to getitems right even when this involved cheating (Robinsonchapter 7), the distress at only knowing,how to findout (ibid., loc.cit.) without knowing the 'ic.tual answer.There is something strange about an educatioualsystemthat encourages children to produce as much uninYormative1 nonsense as they did here. They must .have known that mostof their answers were wrong? That they should behave insuch a way is consistent with the comments about theprevalence of response-centred learning made in chapterWe aro wholly unable to answer the original questionsposed about the effectiveness of'qUestions as opposedOto blanks and statements as facilitators of learning.All were .equally irrelevant!To attribute the general impotence to the wall-chartscould be misleading. As far as we could see they were goodcharts.We could attribute the failure to the naivetyof the experiMenters. An unrepresentative sample ofcas allyquestionecrteachers gave replies consistent withthiinterpretation. Since we are stubborn however, westi 1 find it unpleasantly 4rprisingthat 'children canbe po unobservant so unirterested in their surrounclings,Many of the classrooms one' enters show evidence of muchpreparation of materials by teachers. 4,Alas, if childrenare not encouraged to keep their eyes and ears open, suchefforts may yield but scant reward.

The absenceof any response to wall-charts precludes thepossibility,of investigating any differential responseto varied forms of presentation.Where Should the questions Go?Introduction.The investigation of the role that questions might playin attracting children to posters and directing theirthinking was riot a success, but it served as a vehiclefor illustrating that decisions about the linguisticstructure of meaningful verbal materials. need validationagainst the performance of the learners. Any sentence inEnglish can take only one of four. forms: declarative; IV+interrogative,\"imperative or vocative. These are roughlycorrelated with the four functions of stating, questioning,commandingnd exclaiming. W1 shand look at declhrative and inter1 .gnore latter twogaltive structures intexts where they are closely correlated with stating and.questioning.Any prose passage of more than one sentencecan be made up of a large array of combinations ofdeclaratives and interrogatives, and it is the relevanceof various ways of mixing these to the amount of.learningin which we are interested. The only variation examinedisin sequence. We can put all the questionsfirstfollowed__by all the statements.

All teaching materials withverbally expressed information makebCertain assump4ionsabout the role of questions in learning. One traditional,asiumption in that questions should appear as exercisesat the end of material to be learned. Anothen_one is thatintermittent questions in the text itself are useful. Wewished to see whether either or both ware true.To this end we constructed three prose passagesof comparable length and difficulty about thi-ee different,but similar, topics. With some fifteen declarative sentencesih each, we could preserve some measure of naturalness whenwe inserted five questions into each passage. This alsoalio,led the asking of questions about other sentences in thep ssage.With thefiJquestions coming before, Within, orafter the passage, we could give children a subsequ nttest on information alr ady associated with a questions) andon infor ation not so asgociated (i plicitquestions.)MethodDesiEachofthree comparable groups of chil ren wasexpoSed on three successive days to three prose pa sagesabort three different topics. ach passage containedfif een sentences. Each passe e had three forms, one in whichit'was preceded by five questions, one in which it wasfollowed by the same five questions and one in which. the'five questions were embedded in the text immediately befOretheir answers. Each-class experienced topics in the same orderand position but in different forms. This design confoundsposition with both school and topic, but separates out the 1'G. 0169.influence of the diff &'ent locations of the questions.Since the schools were believed to be comparable, weconfounded= school and position, so that we could isolateany effects due to topic.

All questions occurredin the same order as the answers were given in the prose.Subjects:All the eight and nine year, old children from'three comparable council estate middle schools took part.Materials.Both texts and questions were carefully scrut-inised by teachers and ourselves. Attempts were made toensure that the basic lexical units and sentence _structurewere within the grasp of the children. Differences, . between passages were eliminated in terms of length (allbetween 180 - 190'words long) and sentence structure; wehoped they were comparable in other respects.

Can,these children be readilytaught about thig? ( tA direct approach was made to change the level ofperformance of children set to recognise appropnia.te answersto questions.We decided to use a hand puppet. The Childrenwereasked which animal, they thoughtlr-waS'te cleverest.They were able to agree, an!d a papier masse monkey was made.for manipulation by the class! teacher.* Tne.monkey`was to bewaked questions would would be grammatically aroPriate and informative,sometimes not. Every statement: made by the monkey was true'.It was not thetruth, but the relevance and informativeness .that were to be in doubt. The monkey was represented as .,. really knowing the differences between more appropriate and ,, less appropriate answering, but also as being prone to try,.:.:., to,triek,the children with some of his answers. All inter- .)1action vas oral. The activities took place in normal ccl ssroom conditions. The children in the class were. tofaobjif they thought the answer the monkey gav wasinadequate, in some way. They would, then be expe tee tomake more explicit why they thOught th?answer i adequate.The monkey would eventually give an appropriate informative'answer.,By using a puppet rather than the class teacher togive. answers we hoped to depersonalize the potential'competition between pupils and teacher. We hoped they mightbe willing to pit their wi against a clever but humorous,.monkey puppet. Footnote:We must make special mention of Mrs.. Rita Timlinwho hot only played the role of puppeteer, but conductedthe Whole experimental intervention with full efficiencyand enthusiasm..206 188.Method.Design.Experimental and control groups were both testedbefore and after the experimental group was exposed to atreatment designed to improve discernment about the appropr-,iateness of various statements as answers to questions. Thecontrol group received no special treatment.4Subjects.The subjects were two classes of eight and nineyear old children from two local authority schools ,on ;s,neighbouring urban area council estates. One class wasthe experimental group, the other the control group.Thenumbers of subjects present in the different groups for twotests (before and after the experimental manipulatioid.areshown in Table 24. All children-present in class on the daysof the tests took part.TABLE 244Number of Subjects taking pait by Sex andExperimental Condition and post-test each consisted ofthree -page forms containing twenty test items preceded by twoexamples.An item was a question followed by two possibleanswers of which the subjects were to select one to matchthe question.Both answers were always true, but one wasless suitable=as an answer to the particular question itfollowed.Below the answers was a half inch square for thesubjects to write their choice (1 or 2). 'More suitable'arid''less Suitable' answers were randomly allotted to firstand secondpogitions,except where pairs of items were verysimilar to one another. For these, positions were reversed. x.0 7I In the Most -test all positions were reversed relative tothe pre-test.Eight pre-test items were repeated in the post-test,twelve were different. The items repeated were mainlythose on which :.a high proportion of 'wrong'Ichoices hadbeen made by both experimental and control groups.Thepre-test items for which the.'more suitabll' answers werevirtually universally chosen were not repe ted.New itemsin the post-test were intended to show whether improvementin performance had generalised.-The items could be grouped into four bategories, In-each example that follows, the first answer is 'correct'.Grammatical Appropriateness Items.There were sixteen of theSe items in the pre-test (A, B, D, E,\"FIIIJIKILIN,O,P,Q,R,S8CVandtWelA in the post-test1 (A, B, C, D, G, I, L, M, P, R, S, T) of' which only four wererepetitions (B, P, R, T.) For these items the correct choice'answered the questions, while the incorrect\\ones had strong/lexical or semantic associations, but in fact answered otherquestions.-In most cases a different 'wh' ward woul/havehad to have been used to evoke the incorrect Choice,: Therewas no systematic variation of the types of incorrectness.e.g.Q.What is fiogspawn?Al.' A mass of jelly containing frogs' egg\\siA2.The jelly protcts and feeds the baby taapoles.Definition Items.There were two items in this set in the pre-test (C,M) and fourin the post-test (E, F, N) of which F and N were in thepre test.These items as ed for a definition of some,setofbjects in the form 'Whit is a The correct choiceoff red an appropriate definition, while the incorrect choicementioned a specific member r members of the set and wouldhave been an appropriate ans -r either to the question 'What-is a94 where the focus on that example as a memberof -a set _or to a request for examples of the superordinateset.X,2 0'8 7-190.e.g.Q.What is an insectjAn insect is A small animal with six legs andthree parts to its_A2.An ant, is an insect and so is a bee and all sortsof beetles.Part-Whole Items.Only-one- tem in the pre-test was of this kind (H).

The children inthe experimental group spent enough time in interaction with I 1-91.the 'monkey puppet_every school day far three weeks for himto answer upwards of ten questions a (Du.

For allbut one of the remaining days the designerssupg3A-ed---five_questions and answers, while the children asked an .average of eight questions per day. On one day the childrenasked all the questions. The teacher thought up suitablyappropriate or inappropriate answers to these. Altogetherthe children had practice with just under one hundredquestions and answers, of which over half were answered_wrongly in the first instance by the monkey. All questiontypes were included in the practiCe materials. These gesskonsdid not include anYTolueti-ons from either-the_RrLe= or Post-tests.ProCedure.The pre-test Was administered to both experimental andcontrol groups on a Tuesday morning in class time during...)I.\"3.7-,-------- the second half of the sgring, term. Three weeks and one daylater the subjects were given,the post-test. For bothtests, subjects were told to fill' in the forms for themselveswithout the help of anyone else. The instructions for thetwo tests differed sli'ghtly from one another in wording.-The Pre-Test.As the teacher gave out the forms, she told the childrenthat they contained questions and answers and that she wouldread each question and answer out to them. The children were,told to write their names at the tops of their forms. -\"Wheneach child had a form, the teacher gave the remainder ofthe instructions, which were the same for, both the pre-testand the post-test.The Post-Test.Before giving out the forms, the teacher said,Some of you will remember something we did -a- few__a 192.__weeks ago.We had, a list of qulstions which eachhad two answers. As I read each ono out to you,you followed and had to decide which answers youthought were best. We are going to do the samething again today. You may evenrecognizAomef thequestions because you had them last tide. Theresw11}6e new ones as well though.' le .74,`The forms\" Were then given out and the children wrotetheir names at the tops of their forms. The teacher said,'Some of you were Way---and--some___of- yrou may have forgottenwhat to do, so I will remind you and we can do twoexamples together.' 1The Pre-test and Post-testThe teacher said,'Different people often answer the same question indifferent Ways, and:sometimes we think some answersare Better than others. Do you see the little boxes; on the paper in front of you? These are for youto put a 111'or '2in depending whether you likeanswer '1' answer '2' to each question. BothA2 and A2 aretriO, but sometimes Al answers the laquestion bettereand sometimes A2 does. Let's alldo the ones at= the top under where it says 'EXAMPLE.The first question is (Teacher read out the firstexample question) and here are two answers.

Which do you thinkis a better answer to (first example question?)The teacher checked that everybody had somethingwritten in the box, '1', '2' or '0'.'Let's do therest of them now.' The teacher read each item, i.e.each question and both answers and then left a few--seconds for the children to decide on their choidebefore moving on to the next one:-Procedure for the use of the puppet.The Introduction.The !Abnkey puppet :vas introduced to the class. Theclass called him Mr. Bloggs. The children were told that heliked to ansWer-questions-but_he also liked to play tricks.'Although all the thingS he says are true, he doesn'talways answer questions properly, __Somstimes he seemsto be answering a different question, altogether andsometimes he just doesn't zeally tell you anythingwhen he answers the question.

Iexpect we shall soon learn to spot his tricks.Of course, he doesn't always try to trick us by notgiving proper answers. /Sometimes he answersbeautifully because he is really a very clever monkey. t-I shall ask him a few questions now. If you thinkhe is not answering properly just put your hand upand I shall ask you what You think is wrong.' 212,0\" 194.The Normal Daily Procedure:.,\"The teacher would go through the list of the day'squestions and answers. After each question the teacherasked several children who had their hands up, what theythought was wrong, what the monkey could have said if hewas really answering properly, and, if the answer wasinappropriate rather than uninformative, what questionhe was really answering. At the end of the discussionabout each question, the teacher told Mr. Bloggs thatthe children were not satisfied and he gave a proper3answer.If the monkey answered properly first time,the children could still discuss if they wanted to.The teacher was asked to attempt to get the children tounderstand that all the monkey's statements were_ truein themselves. -- ,Treatment of Results.Initial tabulations of the raw data gave no evidenceof sex differences, and so the results arc not reportedseparately for boys and girls.With both pre-and post-'test measures for bothexperimental and control groups, two main types of comparisonwere possible. Post-test scores of experimental and controlgroups could be contrasted and any differences attributedto training, provided that pre-test scores showed aninitial similarity' across the groups. All childreninclUded in these analyses. It was also possible to lookdirectly at changes by examining pre- and past-test scoresof the, experimental group and to compare them with changes ,in the control group. Only subjects pfesent on bathoccasions could be included in these comparisons.All contrasts could be made for the items as a wholes,categories of items, repeated and new items, and individualitems. -Results.Pre-;est scores. of Ex enmental and Control Groups: The 195. 0results are summarized in Tables 25 and 26. Overall thechildren achieved a success rate of sixty six per cent.Eight items, all in the Appropriateness category (A, B, E,F, 0, P, S & T), were Answered correctly by over seventyper cent of the children.. These gave little room for showingsignificant improvements resmltant frOM training and weretherefore dropped from the Post-test. Five of the remainingseven Appropriateness items (D, Q, 0, N & R) gave significant.differences in favour of the Experimental Group. While theimmediate temptation was to drop all these from the Post-test,two were retained (D & Q) to check that the high level ofsuccess in the Experimental group was not an unstable artefact. -TABLE 25'.Mean Pre-Test Scores of Correct Answers remaining two Appropriateness item; (I & L) and allfour in the other categories had error rates exceeding fifty'per cent and,did not favour either group. These were retainedfol.: the Post-test, and it can be seen from Table 29 thatthe initial differences between the groups was neutralized bythe pruning.Post-test scores of Experimental and Control,groups.

In the comparison of thepost-test scores.of experimental and control groups,thirteen items gave no discrimination. Of-those, six wereanswared_correct4 by over seventy per cent of the,children.All but one (T) of these were/new items for the Post=tettand ea:1'1)e discounted perhaps as being too easy. 'One of theremainder (Q) was close to ach..eving significance in faVourof the experimental group. The other six were all in the fGrammatical Appropriateness category.An examination of the change scores shows one dramaticincrease in ecro-r-rt-ro-1g-roup(-1-tem_ WIE1.At,ve do) not know.It is possible that thit -class had been told what an insectwas during the intervening period. Within the experimentalgroup, it was again the Grammatical Appropriateness itemswhich were least responsible to training.The simplest explanation of this variability would pointto a major difference between this category and the otherthree.,Each of the other three required a specificdiscrimination: the incorrect answer differed froM the correctone in a single constant manner. Theoretically childrencould have as well learned to reject the incorrect answeras to bhoose the correct. This was not true for GrammaticalApproptiateness, where incorrect answers took on differentguises.Learning to reject a specific type of answer wouldnot have gdneralized to all other instances. Hence, tolearn what was correct required more complicated and`varieddiscriminations. In this context it is noteworthy thatgeneralization to nev: items occurred for the other threeetcategories,.but not for grammatical appropriateness.,The conclusion that would follow from this argumentis that, initially, training has to focus on specific typesof questiob and the particular discriminations associatedKith each.This is not of course surprising, although it 2.46 '1 203.could have bO'en the case that the experimental childrenwould have become sensitized to problems of grammaticalappropriateness as a whole and they might have decic7.ed to'Master each contrast and the system as a system.Thislast might bpoveroptimistic for nine year olds, but/ onerair,ht have expected them to learn the rules governinigeach type of question. They did fiot and ther.efore needto be taught the question - one byone , -how each di ff-zrs-from _all_ the .It also 12,e true that -some type s-of question aremore difficult toiUnderstand than others, so that for anyparticular child at' a particular time there maybe limitsto what he can learn about question-answer relationships.However, all types of item `achieved substantial majoritiesof correct scores .for at least one example, often whatappeared to be the simplest, e.g. 'What is a fish?'.That most children were able to answ,er't,his-ques-ti-dh\"doWSeet-ly strongly suggests, but does not entail, that they have.some understanding of a definition demanding questiion.The- conclusion is not obligatory because the children mayhave learned a number of specific instances but not yetconstructed and understood the general ruie. If allcategories did achieve at least one high- set of scores becausethe children understood the question correctly, it may befair to suggest \"both that other instances of the categorycould be taught and the general rule learned and that suchunderstanding is unlikely to be beyond the intellectualcapacity of the ignorant minority. Whether this view hasany weight is examined in the next chapter.The difficulties were not wholly in understanding of thequestion types. That- this is so is supported by a brief studyof some of the post-test items on which the experimental-group failed to excel. One (I) was the longest item forwhich the correct choice had two sentences, one of fourteenand the other of eighteen words. The incorrect choice had ,IN rr.* 204:three sentences and also included all the relevant.answer information it was incorrect beclusd'it containedsome irrelevant information L had a strangequestion and a correct choice that might have been seen asalmost uninformative. The same point could be made aboutItem A.Item P had a correct answer that added superfluousand therefore irrelevant information, whereas the incorrect \u00b0choice was wholly irrelevant., Such weaknesses in'deaign couldbe overcome in subsequent training investigations.While these sources of confusion might have been avoided,*it is more difficult to see 41.13W controls could be introducedto cope with differential- familiarity -with materials. Thisoperates to give false impressions of,competence when'childrenjust happen to,know the correct answer to specific questions.Itoperates in the other diifection where the complexity ofor unfamiliarity with the content and form obscure a basiccompetence.Henle (1942) showed.long ago that adultsappreciation of,the validity of arguments was affected bymuch more than their logical structure. Wason and Johnson-Laird (1972) shOwed ineffectual problem-solving with one setof materials transformed into success by changing the materialswhile the formal: problem remained identical. Distractionsof various sorts may have acted to reduce levels of performance;and although there is no reason why they should have acteddifferentially on experimental and control groups,thenetresult could be to obscure differences that were reallythere!Ultimately it is desirable for people to be able 1to dissociate form and content and be able to pass judgementon form without interference from content. It is also usefulfor people to re-organise problems into forms which they findeasier to solve. One often suspects that children find iteasier to solve numerical problems when these are posed innumerical form than when they are expressed in words andgiven substance.Another design feature that *wild need to be consideredin any future investigation would draw a distinction between 2z8 *r. 205.3,1 two kinds of item: those where very young children wouldbe expected to choose the 'wrong' answer all the time andthen eventually reverse this and those where younger-children would either say 'they do not know or chooserandomly.A fifty-fifty split in responses could mean thathalf the \"children have learned the 'right' answer or'itCould-mean no one is doing more than guessing, Not onlyare - different statistics needed to analyse the results in.the two cases, they are of different theoretical interest.StriAly speaking,, it would be betterto endourage childrento say that they do not know if they do not rather than toencourage them to make'a choice as we did here. This wouldease the problemof distinguishing between the two, althoughas we have seen elsewhere (chapters6 and 7) children of .,eight and nine are reluctant to admit their ignorance.These considerations do not make it likely that theimprovements in fact obthined are artefacts - quite thereverse. ,It is reasonable to conclude that teaching ofthe kind adopted here for what was after all a very briefamount of time could be used ,with a high degree of successto sharpen children's knowledge of question-answer relation- - ships..To be more successful, closer attention should be paidto iiich type of discrimination required forleach type ofquestion.By type of question, we \"mean the 'referentialcategories' mentioned in chapter 3, withall their exponents.Of types of discrimination we have looked only at grammaticalappropriateness which is orlyone cell in the Matrix formedby considering appropriateneis, completeness and presuppo6-ition for each of mode, grammar, lexis and content..If,however, skills in the question-answer exchange have thefundamental significance for learning that wethink theyhavethese are all important and should be taught as earlyas possible, - and preferably before that.What may betoo early, we turn to next. .1 OPre-Test.NAME:206.APPENDIX. 0O Here are some questions and some answers.

Theimmediate point of interest was that age related dhangesin competence might throw some light upon which kinds of ,question-answer links are most easily taught. In thetraining experiment of chapter 8, improvements in theexpeHmental group were not general 3a1aHquestion-answertypes.It could be that these are those which show agradual increase in percentage corrdtheSt with age. Onthe other hand, there might be dramatic age-linked changesonNparticular items: performance might be steady from ages,eight\\throilgh ten and show a dramatic improvement at eleven.Such'itesmight be less responsibe to training in nineyear olds than those which show a leap between nine. to ten.We have already seen how a small change in instructionscould alter the behaviour of eight and nine year olds(chapter 6), and we thought it worthwhile to use instruciions,-\\t.7214.CHAPTER 9.QUESTION ANSWER LINKS AND AGE., , contrasting preference and evaluation. Do children .discriminate between what is correct or right and what theylike?Are the two synonymous or independent? With thenumbers of children available it was possible to examinethe problem.It is important because we suspect that weadults are...rather careless in what we say to and demand ofchildren.In chapters 1 and 2 we have stressed the idea thatchildren are trying to make sense of the world within theirintellectual limits. *Footnote.We are pleased to record our debt to H. Probertfor his considerable help in the conduct of this study. 238- 0215.Do we make it easyjor them by being clear in thedistinction beiween'what one prefers and what is corrector does this not matter? Method.Design.Two conditions were involved in this investigation,one of the two classes in each of the four age groups ofsubjects being arbitrarily allocated to each condition.The two conditions varied only in the wording of instructionsfor the presentation of the task. One condition requiredthe subjects to indicate which of the two answers questionthey liked better, while the other condition asked whichanswer they thought better. Subjects.The subjects of this investigation were thepupils of both sexes in a council estate primary school.All the children present when the.investigation was carriedout,were included as subjects. There were four age groupsin the school (8+, 9+, 10+ and 14 year olds), with'twomixed ability.classes at each level.Since the investigationtook place in the Summer term most of the children wouldhave passed their next birthday, e.g. 8+ were mostly nine. Materials.Following the precedent set in the earlierinvestigation, it was considered unnecessary to use exactlythe same items employed earlier.Seven of the Appropriatenessitems and one Part-whole item devised for the earlier post-test gave no interesting results and were therefore replaced.Extra definitional and object versus human centred choiceswere included to increase their weighting. This gave eightappropriateness, five definj.cional, (a sixth was eliminatedsubsequently), three object versus human-centred and twopart-whole items and one oddment, combining appropriatenessand object- and humAn-centredness.Each subject was presented. with a three-page formon which were twenty main items preceded by two exampleitems.Each item consisted of one question followed by twopossible answers.

The former were thought. to he better answers.There was an additional item whichowes a composite of thetwo types., Appropriateness and Human verso's Object Centred.Procedure.The children's headmaster administered the.proceedings for each of the eight classes in turn. Childrencv,were instructed to work on their own and to write their names,ages, and sex in the appropriate places. The main instructions'took one of two forms:Condition 1: Preference.When each child had a form that had the initial detailscompleted the experimenter said,'Different people often answer the same question416in different ways,, and sometimes we like some answersbetter than others: Do you see the little boxes on thepaper in front of you? These are for you to put a245:... 221.'1' or '2' in, depending whether you like answeror answer,'?' to each question.Both.* andA2 are true, but sometimes you may like Al better'and sometimes you may like A2 better.Let,.1-,e all'Do the ones at the top under where it says 4_EXAMPLES.The first question-is 'Why does thesun look quite small to us?, and here aretwo answers: 1.

Has everybodygot something in the boX?',The experimenter checked that everybody had writtensomething in the box. z'Is there anybody who really cannot decide?Try.'and decide for each one which answer you like'better.If you really canlpt decide put ant in .the'box.Let's do the second example now. 'Whatis the name of the biggest town in'England:?'Hereare two answers, 1. 'London is the ram of the 'biggest town in England' and 2. 'Millions of -people'livq in the biggest town'in EnglEind.'Both thosethings are true. Which answer do you like betterto 'What is the name of the biggest town in England?' Condition 2: Evaluation.When each child had a form, the Experimenter-said:'Different people often answer the same questionin different ways, and sometimes we think some 9answers are better than others.Do you see the -little boxes on the paper in front of you?Thoseare for you toput a '1' or '2' in, dependingwhether you think answer :1' or answer '2' is th.better answer to each question. Both Aland A2 222.are 'rue but sometimes Al answers the questionbetter and sometimes A2 does.Let's all do theones at the top under where it says EXAMPLES. 1.The first question'is 'Why does the sun look quitesmall to and hefe are two answers: 1. 'It 'is re;illy much bigger than the earth, 2. 'It isbecause it is so far awW. If you think 1,that is the first one, is a better answer than thesecond one, to 'Why does the sun look quite smallto us?', put a '1' in the box, if you think thesecond one, 2, it better than the first one put a2 in the box.. Has everyt,ody got something in thebox?'The experimenter checked that everybody had written ;some thing in ,the box.'Is there anybody who really cannot decide? Tryand decide for each one, which answer is better.If you really cannot decide put a C in the box.'Let's-do the second example now. 'What is the nameof the biggest town in England?'Here are twoanswers, 1. 'London is the name of the biggest townr'in England' and 2. 'Millions of people live in thebiggest town in England'. Both these things aretrue.Which do you think is a better answer to'What is the name of the bikRest town in England'?'The experimenter then checked that everybody hadsomething written, 1, 2 or 0 in the box, and said, 'Let's.%.;do the rest of them now.' Each item was read, i.e.' cach1]:-questions and bcith answers, and a few seconds were left,2for the children to decide on their choice, before movingon to the next one. The written instructions at the beginningOf the form were not read out to the children.'Results end Discustion.The boys and girls did not appear to differ from each otherand were therefore grouped together.Tables 31a and 31bsummarise the results. 247,i TABLE 31a.223.Percentage of Correct Answers as aFunction of Age and Instructions.

By age eleven 2 5 0 226.this discrimination is effectively complete.'e couldexpress the apparent lack of difference is one of twoways.We could say that by eleven children like what iscorrect or we could argue that by this age they see itas absurd to prefer a wrong answer to a correct one -liking is independent of judgement and yet covaries withit.Age Changes..1Sixteen of the nineteen items showed significant improvementsin correctness for older children. Two appropriateness andone object-versus human-centred item did not give differences.Why not, we do not know but some reasons can perhaps besuggested.'Pairs of answers in items were usually matched,on length, linguistic structure and also content wherethese factors were independent of the werimentalvariables, i.e. appropriateness, definition, etc. In factthis was not done in every case, but thiS' failure may shedsome light on a particular likely source of difficulty. r The appropriateness item with the question 'What isfrog-spawn?''which occurs in the pre-test (I) and the post-.test (B) of the Intervention study and also in the Agestudy (Q), has as its appropriate answer one that involvesgrammatical presupposition (see chapter 3) of structures inthe question.The inappropriate answer requires nostructures of tle question to be presupposed. This itemobtained the second lowest level of correct choice of allpre-t ?st appropriateness items, a level which was in factbelow fifty per cent. Another item in the Age studysimilarly has an appropriate answer which presupposesstructures in the question while the inappropriate one doesnot.This is the item with the question 'Where does thebluebottle fly lay its: eggs ?' In .the Age study' these twoitems account for four out of the seven incidences of superioranswering following instructions to select the better asopposed to the preferred answer. Preference seems to draw 251 22'7.children away from selecting a grammatically dependentiepAplypkieven though it is more appropriate. It may bethat the low redundancy in such dependent answers,, makesthem difficult, and within a limited time it is harder toassociate them with their question and assess the validityof the connection.There is one item in which both appropriate andinappropriate answers involve grhmmatical presupposition.The item with the question 'What do toads go back into pondsfor?'was present in the Intervention post-test (C), whererelatively low scoring was obtained by both experimentaland control groups and th,,re was no significant differencebetween the two. It was also present in the Age studyand yielded no differences between the age groups. Thelevel under both presentation condition varied only betweenfifty and fifty seven Per cent of correct responses. Insuch an item both answers would pose a problem in matchinginformation given with information requested. There wouldnot be the possibility of making the correct choice throughthe easier elimination of the wrong answer as in the casewhere only the appropriate answer involves presupposition.,Where the content of items is very familiar, it would seemunlikely that the need:to presuppose would Cause difficulty.It is very common in normal conversation to make use ofthis economical device. Thus 'Eight o'clock' would he amore common reply, to''What is the time?' than would '.Thetime is eight o'clock'.Items undoubtedly varied among themselves in termsof their difficulty. Greater familiarity and simplicitywould seem likely to lead to a higher level of correctanswer selection. Evidence for the relevance of familiariof content to a task of this sort has been mentioned in anearlier discussion (chapter 8). The sort of unfamiliarityin the item with the question 'What do toads go back intoponds for?'is similar to that found in its 'pair' item 252 228.with the question 'When do'seals leave the sea?' in thatit might well not be known-that,toads go back to pondsfor any particular reason any more than that there is areason why seals leave the sea. TherAis a generally higherlevel of correct answering to the question about seals though,and some evidence of an age difference see Tables 31a and b).It would therefore seem likely that it is unfamiliaritycompounded with presupposition that makes the question ofthe toads difficult even for older children.It is the general pattern of increase in percentageof correct choices with age that-causes us to examine theexceptions as we did with tae item concerning the returnof the toads to discover particular sources of difficulty.One other item (B) with the question 'What are blackberrieson a bramble bush for?' in the Age study yielded-nosignificant age differences. This was alSo a-'What 'for ?'uestion, not designed however to test appropriateness ofanswer selection, but to examinehuman vs object-centredness of interest. In this case, there is aboutfifty per cent level of correct selection except in the 9+age group which makes sixty four per cent and seventy oneper cent correct choices in the 'better' and preferenceconditions respectively. This item could have proved ratherdifficult because the functional connection between thequestion and the object-centred answer may not be at allobvious.If the children were not aware of the value ofseed dispersal, the statement thgt this occurred when the\\ fruit was eaten might seem incidental. Moreover, theattracting function of blackberries is assumed rather thanmade explicit. The answer simply juxtaposes two facts,viz. that blackberries are the fruit with seeds in and thatthe seeds aro scattered by animals that take the fruit. Thehuman-centred answer is no more explicit in relatingfunction but the'human enjoyment likely to be associatedwith the consequences mentioned in that answer could'well 229.make it seem more recognizable and convincing as a desirableend.Thus, the mire obvious functional pont.ent,ili thehuMan-centred answ r may have conflicted with the valueofobject-centredne4, resulting in a failure to selectsimply on the basis o centredness,'but also on that ofapparent auropriateneu... The length of the answers islikely to have cuased e4ra difficulty, particularly forthe younger children. might hypothesise whilethe 7+ and 8+ groups found\\the item difficult tocomprehend, the 9+ class was beginning to recognize andchoose an object-centred interest. This is not shownto have increased in the 10+ class because they areworried by what they see as an unsatisfactory feature ofthe object-centred answer.This item obtained a very low level: of correctscoring on the post-test following training. (E group 37%correct; C group 17% correct.) The slightly higher scoringby the_trained group might indicate an increase in object-centredness as shown on a difficult item by children notyet in a position to be distracted by the seeminginappropriateness whiel think the eleven year olds ciaw.Such factors as familiarity and simplicity of formand content obviously affect the ability of children ofall the ages used to select correct answers. The improve-ment in selection which followed a short training programmeargues that success on the task is not dependent solelyon an increased language facility which comes only with anincrease in age. Whether the explanation for improvementin terms of heightened attention or whether something newhas been learned or realised, we are not in a position to say.These detailed analyses may also be relevant to anissue that should have received more prior attention. Allchildren generally answered all items. If we assume thatno children knew which choice was correct and that choices'were unbiased, this would mean that scores of fifty percent would be achieved by chance. It would appear that 230.for most items in the four categories 7+ children wereresponding close to chance level (Appropriateness = 54%Definitions = 53%, Part-whole = 51%, Object versus Human-Centred = 56%):But the comments on the three items also reveal that50% may not be the lower limit of ignorance. For example,we would expect younger children to show an initial markedpreference for human-centred rather than object-centredexplanations, i.e. we would expect the developmental trendfor the correct answer to move from zero through fiftyto one hundred per cent. This may be relevant for some typesof inappropriateness. For definitions we might expectcitation of instances to precede definition proper.With these reservations in mind weLban howeverrecord- that all four categories of item show steady improve-ment across the age range of children sampled.The Age and Intervention Studies Compared.Table 32 show$,fhow<tHe,cheices of_shildren-in-theAge study compared with those in the Intervention study forthose items which were-dbmmon to both. In the table thefigures for the Age groups are those of the children whowere instructed to choose the 'better' answer, since thiscorresponded more closely to the instructions given in theIntervention study. Figures'for the Interve'ntion studyare in each case based on the number of children presentfor that condition, although, of course pre- and post-testcomparisons necessarily ar- confined to children presenton both occasions.While certainty cannot be the level of convictionfor comment, the results do not appear to be random.Ifan item showed' improvement from pre- to post-test in theExperimental group in the Intervention study, then it gavea significant difference in the Age study.This was trueof four items.

THE P....CKONING. The Power of Teachers.INCIDENTALS Two of the experiments reported differences in the behaviourof children consequent upon their reception of different ,instructions from teachers. In the.first (chapter 6),children's judgements of the sense and nonsense of questionswere shown to be affected by the instructional set.If theteacher's remarks had suggested that many of the questionsmight be silly, then their pupils indeed found this to bethe case.While there were general effects from the r forbiasing, in this situation the. instruction to expect a highnumber of silly quiStriiigATpeated to have most effectwhen the children were ignorant of the meaning of the question;some very simple sensible questions were judged to be silly,but it was the assessment of the more complex and tortuousones that was more likely to be influenced. The differencesbetween groups were considerable - and wholly attributableto the utterance of but one casual remark by the teacher.We do not know how permanent the effects are. Neitherdo we know anything about the frequency with which teachersand parents address casual remarks to children that domislead or misrepresent. We suspect a high incidence of bothmisleading and misrepresentation. How else do children cometo possess so many inaccurate 'facts' about the world? Itis a frightening experience to hear a child imitate whatyou told it yesterday or last week, especially when you know/that what you said was not quite true! We have a suspicicnthat adults would do better to confess their ignorance whenthis is appropriate, and we also have a further suspicionthat we adults are generally very careless in what we say.Custom and norm require us to speak in many situations wherewe,have nothing to say, so we make up opinions and beliefsand utter them - and the children hear and learn. 262 236.Psychologists who have spent much effort trying to under-stand the mental dynamics of expressions of hostility to.other racial groups have neglected to see what proportionis maintained simply by the need to avoid embarrassingsilences.To ascertain whether or not this is nonsense,we need to observe just what we do say to children - andthink about its accuracy.Our second example of such influence showed howsubtle such influence can be. The distinction betweenliking an answer and thinking it better than another canbe made by children in the age range studied (seven to tenyear olds, chapter 9). At 10+, children treated 'like'as 'better', perhaps being shrewd enough to see thatanswers are oorrect or incorrect. Among the youngerchildren there was a confusion of the two that we did notinvestigate further.The result is reminiscent of the studies of Zigler andKanzer' (1962, see chapter 2) on the differential import Ofthe 'That's right!' and 'Well donei' for children ofdifferent social class. Of an unsystematically collectedsample of colleagues, teachers, and students, none thoughtthe distinction particularly worthy of note. No 'wonderchildren confuse response-based learning and intrinsicallymotivated learning if adults fail to see the distinctionbetween corroboration and praise. It is true that 'That'sright!' may usually be uttered in a praising tone and that 'Well done!' will be qualified if the answers are infact incorrect; our utterances often serve more than onefunction.But an ability to see the difference between thereactions of other people and the correctness of answers isvital to the emergence of an independent problem solver.The message is that a$ teachers of and models for the ,young we need to' be careful in what we say. Our words andsentences should be carefully chosen represent what we 9I 237.wish to say sim ly, clearly, precisely, and accurately -and what we wish o say should be carefully considered forits validity before we present it to children, or even toourselves and other a ults.The One-Answer-Onl -MenIt emerged as a minor thei of another series of studies offinding out, question- askin: and problem solving that childrenappeared to see education as owing the correct answers toquestions asked by teachers (Po nson, 1974).Knowing howto find qut was not valued in the ame war as knowing whatthe answer was. While answers coul be right or wrong,questionswere not good or bad. Knowg the answer wasall-important. In the next tection e one manifestationof this in children's reluctance to ay t -y,do not know,but the data from chapter 4 give grounds for hope. Whenasked to evaluate the quality of four differen answersto a number of 'why' questions,. the children pas edgenerally favourable judgements on types of answer offered.There was no child who showed a pattern of ore very =vourabierating and three rejections.Is it the case that children pick up the one-answeonly mentality from their school experience rather thanfrom their limited understanding, of the subject matter inhand?Do we mislead them about education? The Annual Brainof Britain belongs to someone with a prodigious store.ofdetailed information about some circumscribed topic. Allhis or her replies are one-answer-only to questions posedby someone else. The knowledge is expressed only in verbalform.It is we who judge such a brain intelligent, cleveror well - educated, when in fact we could describe it moreaccurately and precisely with different words.The Willingness to Confess Ignorance.,Incharacter' sketch of the good learner Postman andWeingartner (1959) mention the importance of not being upsetof afraid at hot knowing. Socrates had claimed that his e N238.wisdom lay in his awareness of his own ignorance. 4Our children were not very Socratic. The mostvigorous demonstration of ignorant guessing was in theinvestigation where children were asked questions aboutthree posters that had been hanging in their classroomsfor eight days. Here over twenty of the thirty questionsasked were answered wrongly, and often foolishly.Childrenseemed to be incapable of using the 'Don't know' option.The same phenomenon appeared in the question-answerlinkage study reported in chapter 8.With a choice of oneof two answers to fit each question and a success rate othe pre-test among the children of about fifty-nine percent,one is left ignorant but suspicious of the validity ofthe, children's correct answers. 'Don't know' accountedfor only 3.5 per cent of answers, leaving thirty-seven percent incorrect. On the post-test 'Don't know' had dropped s. .N\\ to- :under two per cent; the control group of twenty-ninechildren raised no more than one 'Don't know' out of 580answers, of which 239 were wrong.Does it matter that children guess at answers ratherthan confess their ignorance?It does seem to be pointlessat best, and pernicious at worst. If children know thatthey do not know and are merely maximizing scores onbadly designed attainment tests, our concern could focus'on why the test is being used rather than upon possibleharmful effects upon the children. But if they do notknow the difference between what they know and what they donot know, how will they 'be able to learn?If education is t..7made to consist of producing answers that other peopledefine as right, we are back to response-oased learning.Where there is a framework of knowledge and a surround ofignorance, gaps in the framework can appear and be filled.Although knowing what one does not know is not a necessarycondition of learning, it may be useful to treat it is suchfor childron at school. 239.The Model of Man as an Acquirer of Knowledge.We have so far noted, incidentally, three hazards facingthe developing child, all hazards created and maintainedby adults.Children are credulous and. will accept not onlywhat they are told by adults, but whatthey hear adults sayto each other.They are in danger of extracting ideasabout education in schools that may represent an accurateanalysis of faults in the system but are detrimental fortheir own intellectual progress. If they focus on producingresponses to adult demands that adults then applaud, theyare doomed to become passive receptors of knowledge forwhich they have no external criteria of validation. Theexperiments reported show all three effects in operation,but other studies were concerned with intrinsicallymotivated learning and its operation.The model of man proposed in chapter 1 had onesequence of events which ran: stimuli (ambiguous, surprising,incongruous, complex, novel) 40 uncertainty (curiosity)attention ---> epistemic behaviours (reasoning, The model did additionallink epistemic behaviour-- learning, which then eliminatesthe strangeness of the and the uncertainty derivedfrom this.Which particular epistemic behaviour willappear should be a joint function of the person's awarenessof choices and his assessment of the feasibility of eachreducing the uncertainty.Only two of our experiments bore directly on linksin this chain (see Duffy, 1974 for an extended review ofsuch work).The Arousal of Curiosity.In chapter 5 we reported upon the differences in thequantity and quality of questions provoked by verbaldescriptions, photographs, and stuffed versions of wombats,platypusses and anteaters. We would not presume to have donemore than demonstrate the need for some imaginative 240.experimentation. Stuffed animals provoked more 'obviousand silly' questions, but also more questions overall,more closed hypothesis- testing questions, and more aboutthe behaviour of the creatures. Each form of presentation,however, appeared to increase the chances of some type ofquestion emerging and reduce the chances of other kinds.A suitable selection of materials can both eliminateunwanted questions and encourage the production of thoserelevant to the purposes of the teacher.Suffice it to say that the actual results obtainedwith the Australian animals gave no reason to doubt thedescription of the first link in the chain proposed byBerlyne and checked in his empirical work.But where ithe volume of collated dies summariz-ing the substance of what has been fd to be ambiguous,complex etc. for children of di,erent ages and experipicet.And where is the book listing relationships found betweenmaterials used and,- uriosity aroused?Alas, like well- pedagogy, they remainunwritten.When education ceases to be purely prescriptivein its use of books and materials and begins to conductempirical studies comparing the efficacy of its technology,it will begin to raise itself from the plateau it has beenon since Plato opened hiscademy long long ago.-.'Questions as an Aid to Learning.Two experiments examined the role of provided questions forthe facilittion of learning. They' only appear to be concernedwith one variant of the last link in the chain: epistemicbehaviours (question asking)learning.In fact thequestions were intended to have a dualfunction. Firstthey should locate a gap in knowledge and play the roleof stimuli giving rise to uncertainty - certainty of ignorancebut uncertainty as to the correct answer. The question canthen be t''''en over by the child and be the epistemicbehaviour that if answered should encourage learning. 241.Since children learned virtually nothing from thewallcharts displayed (chapter 7), we could not ascertainwhether or not questions had any special power to arouseuncertainty and subsequent learning. The insertion ofquestions of before, within, and after texts did give riseto differences in learning. Questions within the text hada double effect: they increased the chances of theiranswers being lea 'rned and decreased the chances of otherknowledge being acquired. Whether some other device formaking that substance prominent would have had similareffects we do not know.This whole field of inquiry is of recent origin,but may eventually lead to a more intelligent use ofquestions by teachers (see Prosser, 1974 for a review of theliterature.)At present we have no grounds for accreditingquestions with motivation arousing properties. They doappear to act to focus attention,and to increase the chancesof immediately relevant material beiag-learned, but this`is at the expense of other matter.Skill in Questioning and Answerini.The arousal of curiosity, ways of finding out, and thedeterminants of high is',,es of substanti.ve learning have notbeen the main focus of attention. Our emphasis has beenupon knowing how to ask questions and knowing what kind ofanswers are appropriate to what kind of question.Answers to 'Why' Questions.The original point of departure for our enquiries was aninvestigation into social class differences in the way motherssaid they would answer 'wh' questions supposedly posed bytheir five year old children. Bernstein's thesis (see 1972for collected papers) about the differences in speech betweenmembers of the lower working class and middle class led usto predict that middle class mothers would provide a higherincidence of explanations in terms.of class membership,causes, functions, 242.-moEkersLower workingclastwere,expected to use more repetitionsof statements, denials of oddity, appeals toregularity and tradition{ lnd'appeals to essential attributes.Differences found were largely consistent with the predictionsmade (Robinsonand\u00b0Rackstraw, 1966). Children's answerswere sown to exhibit similar social. class differences(Robinson and Rackstraw, 1972), while subsequent workhas traced the relationship beyond social cla'ss into thequantity and quality of interaction between mother and child(Robinson, 1972; Robinson and Arnold, 1972).This work caused us to worry that some children mighthave so little experience of genuine attempts atexplanatiLnin answer to 'why' questions, that they might fail toappreciate that these modes are, in most contexts, superiorto modes that deny there is anything to be explained.The investigation reported in chapter 4 shows thesefears to be largely groundlessas far as nine year oldcouncil estate children were concerned.While thesechildren showed a preference for functional explanationsover causal and categorizing answers, they did not rejectany tyras invalid.They appeared not only to findscientific explanations acceptable,biit also to see thatthere can be more than one explanation for a phenomenon.They had not yet acquired the narrowness of perspective thatoccasionally constricts the vision of. adult scientists andphilosophers:to such an extent that they are unable to seethat there is not just one best kind of explanation for allphenomena for all occasions.Perhaps our earlier findings of a lesser use ofscientific explanations by LWC children stemmed more fromtheir ignorance of particular causes and classes than fromtheir general preference for app ais to regularity ortradition.It would be helpful to know whether or not socialclass differences in mode preferences for 'where', 'when', 269 2!+3.'who' and 'how' could become more adaptive to the needsof particular circumstances than the initial data weobtained implied that it was (Robinson and Rackstraw, 1972,chapter 7.)It would be useful to know much more abort thedevelopment of the competence to understand and thesatisfaction with different kinds of description andexplanation arising out of questions.The Sense of Questions.A number of the questions used in the investigation reportedin chapter 6 were odd because of he infelicity of therelationship between the particular interrogative markersand the rest of the question. The difficulty o,f somequestions resided in anomalies or contradictions thathad nothing to do with interrogatives as such, e.g. Q.24.If we could read other people's minds, how could we telllies? Q.12.Why don't people speak with their ears?While seventy-nine per cent of all responses judgedwhat we had classified as simple sensible questions,tobe sensible, this does leave twenty per cent misjudged bythe children.Although all children thought 'Who is per cent judged 'Whereis Daddy's birthday?' to be so.It might have been instructiveto have included more simple anomalies like 'Wheil i4 a book ?'and 'How is a sheep?'.Ever, at nine not all children appear to be confidentand proficient in neir understanding of 'wh' words.Sincethe understanding is within their grasp such an omission intheir education is not excusable.'Question- Answer Linkage.With a raggedness of performance in the answering ofseven year olds (Robinson, 1973) and a raggedness in theunderstanding of what makes questions sensible or silly amongeight and nine year olds, it is not surprising to find alowish level of understanding of the linkage between the twoeven in the older age group. In chapters 8 and 9 we OC.; 244.described investigations in which test items consisted of aseries of questions each of which had two answers, both truebut only one an answer to that question.When the children of the Age study (chapter 9) wereasked which of the two answers were better (condition 2)the percentages of correCt answers for all items (exceptthe unclassified item H) were: 56% for 7+ group, 59%for 8+ 9+ group and 79% for the10+ group.With a somewhat different set of twent items, thepre-training success rate of the eight.and nine year oldsin the Intervention study was the same as that of theequivalent age group in the Age study, viz. fifty-nineper cent.In neither of these investigations wis it n,.ceGs:tryto be familiar with facts about the topic under scrutiny;an accurate and informed analysis of the form of the answerwas suffici. ?nt to obtain a perfect score.The materials dealt with three particular discrim-inations (definition versus enumeration of examples;answers for the whole set covered by the question versusanswer for only a subset of the topic; answers foclisedon the human use of resources versus answers focused on theuse of the attribute to the organism itself) and one generalset (formal appropriateness ver,3us various mistakes.)Practice with about one hundred questions over a threeweek period raised the score of the Experimental Group sothat their final score on the eight critical items wasseventy two per cent. The similarity between this scoreand that of the 9+ children in the Age study should notbe treated as more than a coincidence, but certainly learningappears fi be faster if there is teaching! Awhat was:achieved for these particular question-answer 1s in those children, couli be ext.inded to a muchmore comprehonive children.These possibilities'are confined to the use ofsingle questions and single answers. We hive not consideredsequences of questions. We have not considered how one.learns which questions to pose to help in the solution ofparticular problems. We are therefore still a long wayfroth_the time when it should be possible to specify acomprehensive programme for education in the masteryand use of questions and answers.8But if we are to be serious in our professedconcern to educate children to become independent generalproblem-solvers who enjoy the Acquisition and utilizationof knowledge, it is time that we began to accumulate anddistribute the knowledge necessary for this. PerhapsINSTEP groups will come to play a major role' in our concern was to gain knowledge for theiMprovement of the education of all children, we wished'to ensure that, as faras possible, whatever we foundout would be of particular use to teachers educatingworking class children. But what should we do toguarantee that our research be of practical use as wellas theoreticalinterest?Complaints against research in education areseveral; it demonstrates the obvious or trivial, it maybe theoretically enlightening, butadaptable to theclassroom; it may lie gathering dust'in libraries andnever reach teachers. What we had to do was devise astrategy that would reduce the force of such criticisms.Some are better anticipated by argument than by action,and it may be helpful to engage in a preliminary dialectic 'about these points.The charge that research in education often goesto great pains to demonstrate the obvious may be.emptyor substantial. What is obvious abont'in aan behaviourand how do we justify claims 4hat'something is obvious?'Commonsense' is sometimes cited as the mysteriousrepository of this wisdom. We do not wish to denigratecommonsense, but would like to distinguish betweencommonsense based on accumulated experience rand common-sense not :3o founded. All of us already know-much abouthuman behaviour. It is as silly to unaerestImat thisknowledge as it is to overestimate it.What we know hasbeen built up by observing ourselves and others, bynoticing the consequences of actions, b/making guessesand checking then out by watching films and reading books -, -all over many years. We may have accumulated our knowledge 9r,.41vO 247. ,somewhat unsystematically, it may have been left fairlyunorganized, but this does not diminish its status. Wehave probably forgotten how and when we acquired it, butit is still useful. All we need to remind outselvesis that what we think we know has been based upon-experience and that it is mot 'innate'4\"introspective','intuitive' or oddly 'subjective'. Andjust as its, .acquisition has been founded upon past,experiencolsoit can be checked against future experience. This ,.knowledge, if questioned, is to be defended Ay an appeal'to present experience and evidence, and if this is whatwe mean by 'commonsense' there is no difficulty. -Similarly, 0when your commonsense agrees with mine and everyone else's,no difficulties arise. It is when we have conflict and-.disagree about matters of fact, this has'to be resolvedagainst the facts and not against .the pre-stige o'r agdnisticprowess of the contestants. ''Scientific methods' are nomore than partially explicit sets of rules generally acceptedas helpful prescriptions for collecting, and organizingempirical knowledge. They help to ressl., disputes betweencontesting beliefs in a way in which appeals to authoritydo not and can not.This view of 'commonsense' needs to be contrasted withthe notion that .implies that there is a great reserve oftruth in an unwritten book entitled 'Commonsense for Everyman'.Once we abstract commonsense from particular matters, we arein error.'Commonsense' does not exist eny more than does'yellowness'.When we explain behaviour with proverbs we I are playing a related game. If every proverb has itsopposite you cannot explain anything by reference to one -unless you can first specify conditions which discriminatebetween the appropriate application of each proverb and itsantithesis.To be proverbially wise may be to be foolish.'Spare the rod and spoil the child' might be an inspirationfor investigation, butte is n(6)an exploration of children'sbehaviour.To appeal to commonsense for authenticating ati 248.a belief is not an explanation either; it is to suggestthat no explanation is necessary.By all means then let us use what commonsense says togive us ideas, but let us also remember that disagreementsor denials about empirical matters can eventually be''answered only with systematically acquired, publiclydescribable and communicable evidence. (In teachingpsychology all requests so far made of students for the;commonsense' viewpoint on.a topic have so far yieldeda diversity of opinions from the audience.Try it!)There are several different long-standing traditionsabout the nature of children; and the conditions optimalfor their development, and while it is proper and sensiblefor us to retain our current beliefs pro tem, we must alwaysbe humble enough to remain open to evidence that contradictsthem,however obvious and well-founded our convictions mayappear to be.What is obvious at one place in one point0of time often has an inappropriate dogmatism associatedwith it.Such beliefs have a strange insularity. We forgetso quickly that what was revolutionary yesterday is obvioustoday.Fistorically, claims about the nature of the worldthat ran counter to some sociologically establishedorth dozy were suffic'ent grounds for ridicule, imprisonment,tort re and murder. his is of course still true today.11Tod y is but tomorrow's history. Similarly, we fare liablet,hink that tne groups E0 which we beligtg do everythingin just and sensible ways,and that no one else does (orvice versa).Other countries muddle about in a chaos ofinCompatence and injustice. By maintaining such ethnocentricattitudes and remaining isolated from other poSsibilities, wecan delude ourselves into the commonsense of what we are doingnow.What is so odd is that, whereas any ndrmal adult inour society is capable of understanding these points, so fewof us reveal this understanding and follow out itsimplications, the main one of which is simply to test thevalidy of idea? against empirical evidence. 249.There are also good reasons for collecting and writingdown 'commonsense'. Once it is duly expressed in scientificjargon; it can be integrated into the sciences. Thesedescriptive and explanatory systems of symbols arranged ata succession of levels of generality and abstractness arepArt of each generation's heritage from its predecessor.The more efficiently such knowledge can be transmittedthe greater is th.t potential of future. generations. Schoolsare, after all, intended as a means of rendering thistransmission more efficient. Hopefully,teachers too canbe taught both how to teach and what children are likewithout the pains of failing to find it all out throughunguided discovery learning. And we can render the taskfacing future teachers easier by acquir-ing and making suchknowledge available.Not only do we social scientists occasionally demonstratethe obvious unnecessarily, we are also liable to propound thetrivial.Sometimes the triviality derives from nothing morethan a lack of genuine interest in topics, or a need to doa little,piece of research to gain some certificate, degreeor higher salary. Sometimes we become so obsessed with thescientific status of our activities that we forget orsubstan ive problems and remain trapped in a sucessionof labo atory artefacts.bile it is always hazardous ta assert that a result !obtainmay have no practical consequence, it is less soto suggest that it is easier to see immediate applicationsof some activities than others. For example, a demonstrationof remarkably efficient learning achieved with expensiveequipment ia sound-deadened room with a one-to-oneteacher-pup'l ratio is less likely to invade, the classroomsof the coup ry in the immediate future than a similar success-achieved with cheap materials tested in.crowded, bustlingsettings.We need to realise, however, that research is bothshort-term and long-term. While r.,search that solves aknown and pressing problem may have an immediately observable 250.benefit, long-term, often more theoretically-oriented,activities may eventually lead to profounder changeseventually.It is inevitable for at least two reasonsthatwe cannot foresee what sort of long-term researchis going to be useful. \u00b0Firstly, what is deemed usefulin fifty years time may be different from what is currentlyvalued.Secondly, it is part of the essence of attemptsto dispel ignorance that one cannot prejudge the natureof the solutions that will be found. Leacly, for societyas a whole, one needs a balance in research programmesIn fact we have this, although.the climate of officialopinion in Britain is, currently stressing the demand forimmediate relevance a little more vigorously than in thepast.What is regrettable is that this diversity which isdesirable,,becomes a set of status hierarchies withinwhich each interested group is tempted to inflate \"*ts ownimportance by diminishing the activities of other groupsrather than by pursuing its own area of commitment asbest it can.Long-term geniral theoretical research is likelyto be prized by university academics and despised by pract-itioners faced with large lasses of unruly adolescents.(IThe development of effecti e rule-of-thu b techniquesfor enabling c ildren to understand some very limited but I ISimportant poin in mnthlmatics/unlikely to commenditselkto grand theoreticians.

But, alas, the author of such a bookwould not find himself promoted up the academic ladder. Hemight make a monetary fortune to console himself. 251.That all of us in the educational trade are ratherignorant is inevitable and needs no excusing. When, however,we justify our ignorance by pointing to bhe irrelevanceof inferiority of the activities of others, we are probablyguilty of false pride and doomed to learn but little.When the disparate groups of persons allegedly concernedto educate children begin to co-operate a little morewhole-heartedly in an atmosphere of mutual respect, they maybegin to make faster progress and be more satisfiea withtheir own roles in the enterprise.That potentially useful research can serve only tofill library archives raises the more geAeral problem ofinformation diffusion in education. We have short-circuitedthese issues 'by writing a book rather than an unpublishedresearch report, but it may be appropriate to mention twodifficulties they, need to be overcome if teachers are to be-actively concerned to learn more both about the educational__process and about the children enjoying the experience.At present the organization of education does not-%endOurage in-service education. The Government White Paperbased on the James Report promises changes. Teachers'Centres are a restructural changent invention and -mark one necessary .Teachers' Centres temain Ielativelyrare and small; they are used by only .114 minority of the 0profession.Melny courses and conftrenIces require voluntaryattendance during cut-of-school hours, often at the endof a.full teaching day. These are not optimal conditionsof learning.While many Centres may have loose or strongconnections with local colleges, universities, and advisersin LEA's, links to the Department cifEducationandIScifence,tc the National Foundation of Education Research, and perhapsmost important, to the'Schools Council are casual or absent.The Schools Council publishes wik.ely but the social structureof the educational system lacks organizations intermediatebetween itself anu the Teacher's Centres and schools.Per-haps we shall soon see changes. 252.Even if we\\do, it is unlikely that teachers will begiven the opportunities and be encouraged to attend worth-while courses simply L'o, improve their teaching knowledgeand skills.TheJameslReport clearly envisages a dramaticchange in the definition of a- teacher.Like many other jobs,teaching is to be seen as an activity requiring time outfrom production for re-training and development.Who wouldenter a dentist's surgery full of thirty year old equipmentwho would allow theirrdodtor to prescribe the, medicinesconte orary only to his period of initial training. Whenin- servic- training gets under way on an institutonalizedscale, it wil.robably consist mainly of new pills andrules for persona hygiene.That is, there will be an .-.emphasis on technolog new ways of teaching reading ormathematics, new ways of esenting materials. But materialicannot be more efficacious t the characteristics ofthe learner allow, and it is unl ely that there will be a'rush in the demand for or the provi on of courses aimedto illuminate teachers' understanding o the developmentand nature of the psychological processes relevance toeducation.At least the attitude has died which assumethatgraduates in a subject knew how. to; teach that subject.Who would haveby a doctor whothis absurdityllowed their child to be medically treatehad only read books on Teases? Althoughas faded, it remains true that educationcourses do very little to inform students about childdevelopment or about how to teach; these remain fringebenefits rather than, the core of courses.Psychologyican and ought to contribute much more to,education, but both psych logists and teachers will have tochange their attitudes to each other if there is toloe anysignificant progress.Not only are teachers generally ignorant about childdevelopment, they are normally not trained even to evaluatethe work that has been done in this area of study. 279 253.Investigations allegedly claiming that certain techniquesand materials ]ead to faster learning have to be criticizedwind not simply taken on trust. There are criteria thathave to be satisfied before it is sensible to take claimsabout findings seriously. Knowing which questions to askand what kind of answers are satisfactory ought to beweapons in the armoury of all adults in the society.Specifically, what is being suggested is that teachersVg'.9\" should be scientific about their teaching. In one sense,every act of a\"teacher designed to help childrep learn ispart of an experiment. The act selected is but one of-anarray that might have been chosen. Whether it was the onemost likely to have led to the children learning is anempirical question to be answered by experimentation.In our view, teachers should be competent experimenters intheir own right. They are expected to adopt innovatory0schemes.To do sowith conviction and commitment pre-supposes a favourable attitude towards the scheme.Whatbetter means of achieving conviction is there than tohave taken part in an experiment that showed the superiority0of the innovation? Perhaps if these processes of'persuasion' were used more often, there would be fewerpremature adoptions of fashionableandunevaluated!mat4ials.If teachers had been more forceful in their criticismsof newtechniques and schemes, how much better might these have ,,..eben.It would be unfair to single out a few schemes forcriticisms because the disease of non - evaluation isendemic.Reading schemes, science packs, and history kitsappear.What objectiveF have they? How do these differfrom their both the quantit and qualityof children's learning?Teachers' favourable comments are a useful confidencebooster to thec,innovators, but are no substitute forempirical demonstration of their efficacy with the children?This is the crucial issue and it has to be faced.It isabsurd and irresponsible to spend thousands of pounds on 280 254.construction and production and nothing on evaluation. Ifthe scheme does not pass evaluation. tests it should bewritten 'off as though it were a plane that cannot fly anda pill that does not cure. The teachers are the gatekeepersand they should riot let inadequate r-oducts through.The suggestion that teachers should be competentexperimenters should not be taken to mean that they oughtto become research workers, developing craftier and craftiermethods while children quietly turn into guinea pigs. Theyshould, however, be competent to test both their own ideasand those of others against evidence from the children.They should intermittently try out new ideas and probe them4to see if there are improvements in the children. Theyshould never be required to continue to use some new orold scheme about which they have doubts without an opportunity.for experimenting to.see if their doubts are justified.Head teachers and LEA's may assert a right to require teachersCto try new methods, but their subsequent authority should bevested in the success of these methods and not in theirpersonal whims and preferences.No doubt voices of objection will raise themselvesAabout experimenting: with children.We have already saidthat ever,(teachingact is in factexperimental and cannotbe otherwise until we know more about children and theirlearning than we do at present.trhe objection is an objecti nof frightened as opposed to responsible,ignorancP. Certain-ly if we knew much more than we do, it could easily becomeirresponsible to experiment. It is irresponsible ofdoctors to try new remedies when old ones are perfect, butwhen ignorance abeJunds, one has no alternativIt was the checking out of-- these views with teachers thatwas ourchallenge.We could not operate at anything but grassroots level, but that we could manage.We must admit thatwhat we had'in mind was grander in conception than enactment,but at least it got somewhere. 1255.The basic idea was to recruit between ten andfifteen teachers handling children of the same age fromsimilar catchment areas. This.group would meet weeklyfor a term and rurspe two kinds of activity. There wouldbe direct instruction and discussion about childdevelopment and there would be group conducted research.The main focus of the instructional sessions would bethe work of Piaget, set within the context of other theoriesof child development and/integrated into realms of sociol-ogy through the ideas of Bernstein in particular. Moregenerally, we were to ask how factors in the environmentmight act to slow down, halt, deflect, distort, reverseor preclude the child's acquisition of knowledge -w-ithspecialreference to the environments of working classchildren.The research was to achieve two aims. It was i tendedto influence the teachers both by encouraging them tothink experimentally and check out their beliefs againstreality and by providing them with the skills necessary forthis.It was also intended to-answer substantive questionsabout the questioning and answering behaviour of children.A meta-objective was to ev luate the course itselfand the quality of the research i produced.With thisstructure and content and the particular tactics adopted withinthese,we endeavoured to solve most of the problems mentioned.At least for the teachers participating ,r are able to br.ngto their own attention new knowledge and ideas aboutchildren's intellectual development. We'd conductexperiments and show how they could provide ways of disprovingthe obvious and how,they could resolve, disputes;betweencontradictory ver ions of/commonsense.Over and a ove this, a mixed g dup of teachers andresearch workers were able to collaborate with a maximallyefficient deployment of their respective skills-and resources. 282 tz) 256.The researchers could bring their general knowledgeof child development to bear. They had ideas for invest- .igations.They knew how to produce experimental designsthat would 'aIlew certain questions to be answered. Theyhad the time to construct materials and the skills toanalyse and interpret data. They had the opportunityand experience to write up what was dope.The teachers were able to criticise the ideas andinterpretations of the research workers, but their greatcontribution lay in their knowledge of what eighi and nineyear old children were like in terms of both capabilityand interest.They were able to save the rsearch fromhaving materials either _too simple or too difficult.They could say what was likely to be boring. They wereprepared to test out materials on particular children tocheck on their suitability. Finally, they were able toadminister the investigations In the course of theireveryday teaching activities.No stranger 'from theuniversity' hurried children into the medical room 'toplay a game.'No questions arose about the behaviour ofthe childr n being affected by the presence of the observer.Tohat ad antagthese features led may be seen inthe experimental result of the Instep group (In-ServiceTraining in Experiment and Psychology.)onvening INSTEPAfter a brief discussion of the proposal with the PriffiaryAdviser of Southampton LEA, his reactive:enthusiasm for theidea was translated into action with eacrity. Equippedwith the handout, reproduced below, he visited 'appropriateschools and persuaded fourteen teachers of eight to nineyear old children' in Middle Schools with predominantly 1council estate catchment areas to take part in the ventare. *The-children were all at least eight, while none willhave been nine in the Sep...ember of the school year, ourexperiments were conducted in the late autumn and throughthe winter.The average age of participating children wasjust over eight and three quarters.283 ?57.The HandoutPiaget and the Middle School Child. bb 'ec tives.1.To acquaint teachers with the current state ofknowledge about child development, in particularwith the contribution of Piaget to,our understandingof-eight to nine year o children.2.To carry out a serie f individual empirical studiesrelevant to the teaching of eight to nine year oldchildren.The results of these studies will becombined with other information to form aprogramme suitable for enhancing the effectivecuriosity of children.Procedure.1.With the co-operation of the Local Education AuthorityI will offer a course of 10/12 lectures/discussions(or mori, if desired) on Piaget. We will examine whathe says and tae relevant empirical evidence., Wewill discuss the strengths and weaknesses of hissystem and its implications for the educationalprocess.A number of well-o ganized short books on thissubject have appeared in recent months and ne ormore of these may serve as a focus for the course.We choose Piaget for a number of reasons. Hehas done and has inspired a considerable amount ofwork on child development, but much of it ispresented in a large number of books which aregenerally unsystematic and difficult.to understand.His private terminology is-daunting. However, hiswork is having a substantial influence on ediucationalpolicy and practice, with this likely to increaserather than wane.. A clear simple introduction tohis work might therefore be of use to teacher's. 258. 2.One of Piaget's points is that understanding comesthrough experience and experiment. For at leasttwo reasons I would propose that each participantcarry out at least one small investigation, involvingcomparisons of the efficacy of different materialsand techniques for teaching. This would involyeevaluating the relative usefulness of variousmaterials or tactics, a procedure all tooinfrequentin research projects as well as teaching.For my own part I would like to combine theresults of these investigations with other dataalready collected in order to design a programmethat might enhance the effective curiosity ofchildren. This programme would be run and e,,aluatedin the Spring Term. We shall of course be pleasedto report back the results toall people involvedin the course. Ioam very interested to see whetherthis type of combined operation is mutually beneficial.Research projects often have scant contact with thevery people whum they hope will eventually applythe results they obtain, and I have thought thatthis type of course might well overcome thisunfortunateseparatidn.Structure and Content of the Programme.At the first meeting we specified the objectives andstructure of the course, and an attempt was made to show howboth the theoretical and empirical aspects of psychologywere relevant tc a study of child development in generaland the teaching of children in particular.One tacticadopted for this purpose was to present the teachrwithtwenty six statements made by eminent philosophers anieducationists. ,These statements represented a varietyof views about the nature of children and:the efficiencyof various educational tactics.There were two points to this exercise. The firstwas to remind participants that the international experts 259.Q7/1The following statements are taken from the writingsof various Old Masters: Confucius, Aristotle, Plato,Plutarch,'Locke, Wesley, Rousseau, Froebel, Montessori,Pestalozzi, Robert Owen,c-,Isaac Watts, Russell and Tolstoy.-We would like to know which of the statements you agreewith or disagree with Could you circle your c1oice?Please treat each statement in its own right and' donqtry to fathom the,author.

Not only was there diversity of belief,there was also a fair incidence of 'Not knowing'. \\ The second pointWasargue that when this\\diversity concerned a matter of fact, empirical investigationscould be designed whose results could change opinions ordispel ignorance.It did seem to be hihly desirable to discuss andagree what were and what were not legitimate and acceptableways of handling disputes about matters of fact. Withoutsuch consensus there could have been a running cynicism-about all else that was to f011Ow.Following -this initial scene-setting a standard,but flexible, format was established with lecture/discussionsessions of three quarters of an hour, followed by discussionsof experiments and their results.As the topics show, the course was in fict extended tolast just over one and a half terms and the\\sy,Liabus widenedto cover language development. 2 41Topics of Sessions.4.1 263. 1 & 2Introduction to and Cognitive Developmental-approaches.Comparisons in terms,of of'interest and accorded to various as hLredity versus environment, pre-programminsversus environmental contingences, sources ofmotivation, operationsin reit- in development15Social? factors and language development4There were sufficient introductory texts on Piagetfor everyone to have one, and additional relevant bookswere inctorporated into a small library..This was notused-exte sively. -Handouts Were prepared which summarizedinformation on main points. Two films were shown.For the experiments, a different procedure was adopted.We told the teachers what our research was about outliningour results and beliefs about social clasa difference; irquestioning and answering behaviour (see chapter 1),Wewent on to say that what we wished to do wa:J find out alittle more about children's prefer'.nces for some types of 2D00 IiikOMMANNOW 264.4answer rather than others, but in the. mairl to find out howwe might encourage efficient questioning and answeringin eight and nine year olds from non-middle class backgrounds.We established which schools were comparable to ,?/hichin terms of catchment area and modernness of equipment andbuil,aings, so that we could group schools together\u00b0forexperimental design purposes. We presented brief handoutsfor,some six investigations and fumbled our semi-democraticway through to deciding which .schools would contain whichinvestigations. We would then prepare materials and have the-group discuss them. When there was agreement about thesuitabilitycfthese we went ahead, when there was not,a teacherfrom an uninvolved school would check out the materials andreport back.Once a design, procedure and materials wereagreed, the investigation would be run, and we would analysethe results and report back to the group.There was a measure of disorderliness about this. Thepsydhologists were diffident about pushing and imposing, butwhen we all got to know each other better, it was easier toachieve agreed decisions.Evaluation of the Course.Originally, we had prepared a massive set of questions aboutchild development to be given at the beginning and end of thecourse.The replies would have shown the teachers how muchthey had learned and us what the weaknesses and strengths'of the course had been. The Primary Adviser was asked toplay his eponymous rolo and cautioned against frighteningthe teachers with our questionnaires. Their subsequent..comments justified his caution. It should be possible,however, to test knowledge acquired on a weekly basis oncerapport and trust-are established.We did seek some guidance for future courses.bi0sending out a questionnaire a fortnight after the farewellparty.Of the fourteen teachers who had been preset t at thestart af the course, two had been forCeeto_abandon it by 4. 265.prolonged illness and one had found .the logistics of thejourney from'school too complex.

Any other comments (all welcome) The comments suggested the preceived worthwhileness,both of basically instructional courses and gettingexperimental research conducted in this manner. In answerto Q.12 everyone expressed'a willingness or volunteered withenthusiasm for collecting more data.Half the group felt that the level of presentation wastoo general and abstract, and in their answers to otherquestions; they pointed to ways of improvement. Repetitionwas mentioned as desirable by several. Since it was in fact 294 It 268.customary to summarise at the end of each sess.Loni.quicklyrun over the previous week's content, and most points wereprobably repeated at least once, this criticism emphasisesthe need for considerable revision and recapitulation.Demonstrations of concrete examples with materials wereMentioned as a useful aid. Normally we male do with whateverwas to hand, anethig was inadequate. It would be sensibleto invest in some simple special materials. We showed onlytwo films during the course, and most participants thoughtthat two or three more would have been useful. (They,,areavailable.)It is also true that the films could be botha useful relief, change and means of illugtrating with realconcrete examples. Since everyone thought it would havebeen sensible to hate tested more individual children onclassificatory and conservation tasks and generally saidthey thought they could have tested four or five children,a week, this would be worth bui]dinIT into any such operation.What emerges is hardly surprising. The criticismspoint to insufficient use of prepared materials, insuffiCientpractice opportunities to see ;f children in their classesreally were like the theory said they'should be, and someinadequacy of inexperience - on the part of-the psychologists.Improvements and Developments.Improvements.Improvements peculiar to our course are of only personal andparochial 'interest, but there are at least four aspects ofour activities that may have wider significance.The time of day at which such courses would be mostefficacious is an issue about which a majority of peoplewithin the educational system might, well agree. In principleat least :it would be better if the acquisition of newknowledge could occur earlier in the day and in the firm's-time.The latter view can be supported in so far as wevi.ev.the role of the teacher as one requiring the periodicexposure to new ide.as and techniques and one requiringt. 269. teachers themselves to be actively involved in theevaluation and dissemination of new knowledge. Earlinessin the day would be defended by appealing to the evidencechat it is particularly difficult to attend to, understandand learn new knowledge when one is fatigued. But principleido not necessarily help with decisions about priorities. Andwho is to watch the mice when the cat io away? Organisationdoes notpresenT-treaioult administrative problem in andof itself, but current staffing arrangements ensure admin- .istrative difficulties and discontent. An apprOpriatesolution will be found only after enough people with enoughpower create an atmosphere that will insist upon a changein the present conceptions of the teacher's role. ).A second leis general criticism of the course,thatmay be a simple indictment of the organisers' naivety, wouldsuggest a change i=the balance of the'content, less of thegeneral abstract anamore of the particular concrete. Wewere aware of the danger of witterin3 in technical jargonand made a strenuous effort to bridge the gap betweenidealised theoretical models of ,children's competence andthis six year old who thinks there are more tialips thanflowes in this vase. A personal guess is that academicsare likely, even after making,adjustments, to fail tomaintain a persistent anchoring to specific instances ofteaching problems. In practice this means a runningcheck on the perceived relevance and value of what is beingcommunicated.We should also-have evaluated the changes achieved.In what ways did participants benefit? Was only their moraleenhaxged?Did they learn how to conduct experiments withinthe domai. we were examining? Didthey change theirtheories of orl:ld development? Did they now see why someskills might have ...precede others in growing children?There does seem to be'a climate of opinion which sees testingas evaluation of the tested rather than as an evaluation ofthe material, the instructor or the interaction of the variables. .-/'e Q270.Not only does evaluation have this peculiar bias of focus,it also carries overtones of the blameworthiness orpraiseworthiness of the individuals learning.A change.n orientation, whereby evaluation took on theeaning ofknowledge of results, would be more helpful; if it wereseen as inforrnat 'Ion about progress made and next steps tobe taken, it would be easier to introduce what is animperative in any excursion' into learning. and teaching.Alas, we did not evaluate the teachers' learning in anysystematic way.Finally, we failed to follow through: Our coursewas yet another one-off job with loose ends left untied,so it died.We had intended to write up the venturequickly and repeat an improved version in the following,year and then use that as the cornerstone of an organicstructure, but this hope foundered. Staff leaving andother commitments and pribrities accumulated to render thescheme unviable, but dfters may repeat, improve and developsuch activiti6s.Development.Teachers' Centres are the obvious base of operations. Sixmonths of weekly sessions may have a natural viability. Agroup of between ten and fifteen working teachers with-acommon interest; one or more researcher, and preferatayan LEA representative may be about the right size.The common interest could be in the age of childrentaught, the subject of main concerA, or in a particularscheme or 'technique. The researcher should have theresponsibilityfor finding out all there is to know aboutthe topic, organising this into features for instruction,discussion and experimentation. What evidence is therethat the Bloggs Reading Scheme works? What is meant bythe claim of its producers that they have 'scientificallytested' it?Put it to the test and evaluate it. Onesuspects that toormany courses fail to pose the critical 297tr' 271. questions and then pursue the answers to these by systematicinvestigation. How can children be encouraged to find outif they see only motes of routine acceptance in the eyes ofteachers' and researchers?At the' end of the courses what is to be done with, the knowledge accumulated? There is nothing odd about writing,books.It is even less 'strange to write journal articles,but, what might be particuarly useful Would be to organisepublication regionally. 'D4y-conferences at which the teacherparticipants report thei-riactivities 'to teachers intheir LEA and neighbouring.areas are one possibility. Thesecould not only spread the information, but might motivateothers to join groups. It should boost morale to be actuallydoing something with result's found by oneself. Followingsuch an occasion,'papers could be written, gestetnered andcirculated to. other interested parties. The newlyconstituted LEA 's should be larie-enodgh to maintain bi-annualregional journa'As of education.There a-e many advantages to such activities, and theyrequire nothing but the will to start moving. 298 O 272,.REFERENCESa :Ashton, P.M.E.
