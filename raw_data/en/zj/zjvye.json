Well, there's only one vaccine that could possibly be a problem, and that's the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Now that they've changed the vaccine, it has fewer antigens, and that would make it a lot safer. But with the old version of the vaccine, I have not yet come across a study that looked at regressives \u2014 when a child had some speech but lost it. There has been a highly emotional battle between mothers of autistic children and the scientists who dispute their theories. I have talked to maybe five or six of those mothers, and that's the reason I don't pooh-pooh it. Those mothers have all described the same things. They all have the vaccine, and then they talk about fevers and the weird wailing that started in just a few days. When I brought this up to an expert and asked, \"Have you ever studied the regressive group separately?\" I got silence. Considering that you're an incredibly accomplished autistic woman, do you have any advice for parents of autistic children? I've seen too much coddling. Mother was always saying, \"You're going to have to learn how to go in the store and talk to the clerks yourself.\" And I was scared to death. I'm seeing too many kids who actually are a lot milder than I was who don't know how to walk into McDonald's and order a hamburger. You have used your ability to empathize with cattle to design humane slaughterhouses. Given that you're asked to imagine how they feel on the way to their deaths, I'm surprised you eat meat. Nature's very harsh. There is nothing about how nature kills things that is kind. When cattle are raised right, they have a really good life. When they go to the meat plant now, they just walk up the chute; it's no more stressful than going to the veterinary chute. I know you think in pictures. When you're looking at a steak you're about to eat, do you think about the cow in the slaughterhouse? Oh, yes. If I know where it comes from, then I see the plant, because I know all the plants. I'll go, \"That's Cargill,\" or, \"Oh, that's National,\" or, \"That's Tyson.\" And it doesn't spoil your appetite? No. I also think about the hyenas ripping the guts out of something, and that did not happen to that steak. The way the wolves kill things is not that nice. Cats will kill you first, but wolves just rip you open and dine on live guts. Considering what you've done for cattle, have you ever considered making capital punishment more humane? I have read things about the malfunctions of the electric chair, and I know exactly why it did not work. I know how to fix it, but I will not use my knowledge to have any involvement in that. I will not cross the species barrier to help kill people. Period. Even if you knew you were helping people to die more comfortably? I don't kill people, period. What do you think will happen when you die? Do you believe in God or an afterlife? I have a poster on my wall of the Hubble Deep Field, which shows hundreds of galaxies out in outer space. When I think about those big issues, I just think about that Hubble space poster. You made a decision in adolescence that you would live a celibate life. Why? When I was in boarding school, they were very concerned about the girls getting pregnant. And I found that if I could be absolutely trusted not to run off with the fellas in the bushes, then I could kind of get some extra privileges, like fly my kite up on the hill or ride my horse down in the pasture without having to have a staff member present. If I could be totally trusted on sex, then I got a lot of extra privileges. Have you had to fight urges over the years? Yeah. Now I'm old enough to where that's all gone, and it's like, Good riddance. INTERVIEW HAS BEEN CONDENSED "}
