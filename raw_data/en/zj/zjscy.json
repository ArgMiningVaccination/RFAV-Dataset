The spine and central nervous system are what massage therapy treatment primarily focuses on. Massage therapy isn't just for pain but can also improve muscle strength and a patient's overall health. At Chiropractic USA in Oro Valley, we combine massage therapy with holistic methods to promote optimal spinal health. How Is Chiropractic Massage Different? Massage therapy from our chiropractor is a non-invasive treatment method that promotes spinal health and improved recovery. This therapy can help realign your vertebrae and treat bulging or herniated discs. It can also bring toxins from the soft tissues out of your body, so your body functions well again. We will provide adjustments to certain body parts and then use massage to improve how the tissues and muscles feel afterward. Chiropractic massage focuses on muscles and relieving tension, and restoring flexibility. While it doesn't focus on pain, massage therapy can help reduce muscle tension once the body is realigned. Physical Assessment Before massage therapy begins, our Oro Valley chiropractor performs a physical assessment. We will discuss your medical history, your symptoms, and any concerns you may have. We may also perform diagnostic imaging tests to diagnose you properly. Drinking a lot of water before chiropractic care helps your body flush out toxins and minimize any soreness after treatment. Our goal is to discover the underlying cause of your pain and address it directly. Conditions Massage Therapy Can Treat Chiropractic massage from our chiropractor helps improve blood flow and promote better health. Common conditions that our massage therapy can help treat include: - Back and neck pain: Some common causes of back and neck pain include: scoliosis, subluxations, herniated or bulging discs, degenerative disc disease, and spondylosis. Massage therapy helps realign the body, which helps to reduce any pain or discomfort in or around the spine. Massage therapy helps to loosen muscles, which allows the back and neck to move more freely. - Headaches: Many headaches are caused by tight muscles in the neck and upper spine. This leads to a restriction of blood flow to the head, causing pain. Our massage therapy loosens these muscles and promotes blood flow to the cervical area.
