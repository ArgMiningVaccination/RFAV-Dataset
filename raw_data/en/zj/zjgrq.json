In December 2011, Interface Associates and York Consulting were commissioned by the Welsh Government to undertake a 'Review of Parenting Support for Flying Start'. The revi ew was conducted between January and March 2012. 2. The Flying Start programme was l aunched by the Welsh Government in 2006/07 as a pilot with the aim \" to make a decisive difference to the life chances of children aged under four in the areas in which it runs\" . It provides the following entitlements: Enhanced Health Visiting Support; Childcare; Parenting Support; and Language and Pl ay (LAP) programmes. The programme is prescriptive in terms of the scale and quality of the entitlements, but allows for local flexibility and expects local accountability. Flying Start sits alongside support offered by other programmes, such as Families First, Communities First and Integrated Family Support Services (IFSS). The aim is that these programmes form seamless s upport that meets the needs of children and their families as soon as they are i dentified. There is an expectation that these programmes should be interlinked an d part of the overall strategy to tackle child poverty. Background 3. Parenting support was included as a s pecific entitlement within Flying Start because the evidence shows that warm and supportive parenting facilitates the development of strong and secure relati onships and that parenting which is harsh and neglectful increases the risks of poor outcomes for children. The definition of parenting s upport used within the Flying Start guidance is focused on \"programmes providing support and skills training for parents whose aim is to promote children's wellbeing by enhanc ing protective factors and reducing their exposure to risk\". The parenting entitlement wit hin Flying Start includes informal, formal and intensive support. 4. The parenting programmes delivered as part of Flying Start were informed by the Communities that Care Review under taken in 2006. Current Flying Start guidance categorises parenting programmes as follows: 3 Group A : Programmes were eligible for Flyi ng Start funding due to strong evidence of improved outcomes for children when used with the Flying Start age group. These programmes were already in use in Wales with opportunities for training and peer support. Group B : Programmes could be funded if they filled a gap in current service delivery and there were no local examples of Group A to build on. These were programmes where their effectiveness had been proven in rigorous evaluation studies but they were not being delivered in Wales. Group C : Programmes were those where there was insufficient evidence from rigorous evaluation studies, but there was established practice and experience in Wales. They were not e ligible for Flying Start funding unless they were part of a jointly funded res earch programme to evaluate their effectiveness using controlled resear ch designs and there were already experienced trainers and materials available. Objectives of the Review and Methods 5. This current review reflects the Wels h Government's recognition that there was a need to review the current Flying Start guidance to ensure that it was still fit for purpose. The objectives of the review were to: refresh the evidence base on informal and formal parenting support and summarise the implications for policy and practice, relating this to current activity within Flying Start; review the current parenting entitlement in Flying Start , identify barriers, enablers and best practice in delivery; support the future development of the programme , identify gaps in evidence and provide suggestions on how to improve the evidence base on the effectiveness and impact of these interventions in Flying Start. 6. As part of the review the research team undertook: a Rapid Evidence Assessment (REA) of published and academic literature focused on support for 0-4 y ear olds and their families, from 2006 onwards; telephone consultations with: 4 Flying Start Coordinators and ma nagers across the 22 Welsh local authorities; representatives from national, volunt ary sector stakeholders involved in parenting support. 7. It is important to note t he limitations of this review. This was not an in-depth analysis of parenting suppor t within Flying Start and practice was not observed or evaluated. Review of the current evidence base 8. The parenting support identif ied (both in consultations and across the literature) can be categorised according to: universal programmes of support (including informal support) available for all parents and children irrespective of risk (which may include some targeting); targeted and specialist programmes of support for parents/children with identified additiona l needs/risk factors. 9. Universal interventions are important because they offer opportunities to make parenting support accessible to as wide a population as possible, thereby widening the likely benefits. They also mi nimise the stigma which influences the take up of targeted support and provide opp ortunities for the identification of high risk families. Flying Start clearly has an important role to play in delivering support at this level and in provid ing universal support based on both need and entitlement. 10. The support identified was further di vided into three thematic areas: perinatal support and support in the early years : focused on universal, generally health-led approaches and pr ogrammes centred on parental attunement and/or attachment with babi es and young children, e.g. the Neonatal Behavioural Assessment Scale (NBAS), the Newborn Behavioural Observations Systems Training (NBO) and the Solihull Approach; 5 early intervention approaches to supporting vulnerable parents: focused on developing early parenting capacities, bonding, and establishing effective parenting stra tegies, e.g. the Community Mothers Programme (CMP) and Family Nurse Partnerships (FNP); positive parenting: programmes to support parent/child relationships and the management of children's behaviour, e.g. the Family Links Nurturing Programme (FLNP) and the Incredible Years (IY) Parenting Programmes . 11. Our review provided the following conclu sions regarding the provision of these programmes: Perinatal Support and Support in the Early Years : although the evidence base was not particularly robust, evidence from the review suggests that baby massage is a suitabl e low cost intervention for low risk families. The review also highlight ed the need for further research to explore the particular benefits of engag ing fathers in such support. The benefits of using developmental gu idance such as the NBAS were identified, but also the need to ensure that such approaches are embedded within longer-term intervention, particularly for higher risk parents. The evaluation of the Solihull Approach provided some promising evidence, but it also identified a number of issues which have implications for all programmes delivered via Flyi ng Start, namely the need: for longer- term follow-up to see whether changes in outcomes are maintained; to analyse demographic data to identify the variables which influence how parents respond to programmes; the reas ons why they drop out or do not engage with support; and to ensure that programmes are suitable for the parents recruited on to them. Early intervention approaches to supporting vulnerable parents : the benefits of some community based home visiting programmes were identified, e.g. the Community Mothers Programme. However, less positive evaluations of other home visiting programmes highlighted the importance of implementing a structured approach and ensuring deliverers are appropriately trained and supported. The value of using multi-component, long term nurse home visiting programmes for young, vulnerable, first time parents wa s evidenced through the FNP programme. 6Findings from evaluation of this progr amme in the US provides important learning in relation to the delivery of such approaches and both endorse and reinforce the approaches undertaken by the enhanced health visiting role within Flying St art partnerships. Positive Parenting: at the targeted level, t he evidence base for Parents Plus Early Years Programme (PPEY) was robust and showed improved outcomes for both parents and children. The evaluation of the Incredible Years BASIC Programme undertaken in Wales supports its continued use with parents with children at risk of conduct disorder. Ho wever, it is critical that the right parents are engaged in the programme in order to minimise drop out and maximise engagement and there is a need to review longer-term outcomes. At the universal le vel, findings from the randomised controlled trial (RCT) undertaken for 1-2-3 Magic appear ed promising but further research is required. With regards to the FLNP, previous evaluations showed a wide range of benefits. While the recent FLNP study in south Wales identified some positive outcomes, they were not statistically significant and therefore were inconclusive. The evaluation raised issues concerning the challenges of using a RCT to evaluate a universal programme already available in areas which had existing enhanced levels of parenting support, al though this issue is the subject of ongoing debate. Assessing Current Delivery 12. Telephone consultations conducted as par t of the review were used to explore why partnerships have developed their o ffer in different ways; to gather consultees' views on the current progr amme guidance; how this has been used in decision making by local partnerships; and how they would like it to develop. The consultations also focused on the strategic development of parenting support and the implementation of parenting programmes. Strategic Development of Parenting Support 13. The review highlighted the need for the Welsh Government to clearly communicate the expectati ons of parenting support in improving the outcomes 7for families in Flying Start areas. Findi ngs from the consultations suggest the Flying Start guidance could set out the ov erarching strategic priorities and desired population outcome indicators for parents and families, as well as indicators of outcomes for children, to measure the contri bution of parenting support. 14. In some Flying Start areas there was a comprehensive and cohesive approach to delivering parent support services through alignment with local plans and partnerships. In others, a lack of strong governance arrangements for the delivery of parenting and fam ily support in the local area highlighted the need to ensure strategic and operati onal alignment of the Fl ying Start parenting offer with local authority (LA) plans and other relevant strategies and initiatives. Such an approach would enable each Flying Start partnership to define outcomes at the local level aligned to LA outcomes in order to monitor and manage performance. 15. Links with programmes such as Fam ilies First and Integrated Family Support Services varied across areas, with some demonstrating strong and effective links and others seeking clarity on the par tnership approaches. Information and referral routes need to exist between universal and more targeted and specialist services, both within Flying St art, as well as with other agencies. Adopting a multi-agency approach rather than a single a gency referral route for the identification and asse ssment of parenting and fa mily support needs of vulnerable groups ensures support is bet ter targeted and is family focused. Key Features of the Flying Start Parenting Offer 16. Targeted, evidence based programmes approved in the Flying Start Guidance are used across the Flying Start Partnership. The Incredible Years Parenting Programme was the most widely used Category A Programme. The NBAS and NBO (Brazelton Approaches) were the only Category B Programmes currently being delivered in a small number of Flyi ng Start areas. There was variation in the level of parenting provision on offer, with some partnerships offering a wide range of programmes. FLNP was the mo st popular Category C Programme and other programmes such as The Solihull Approach were also delivered. 8Partnerships were also delivering a range of informal support programmes, including Baby Massage, Stay and Play , and breastfeeding and weaning clubs. Parental Engagement and Retention 17. Informal programmes were used by partnerships as a successful mechanism to engage parents in support. However, data collected from the partnerships revealed that a number still found it difficult to engage and retain particular groups, such as fathers, teenage parent s and black and minority ethnic parents (BME), reflecting findings elsewhere. Ho wever, partnerships were addressing these issues through a range of strategies and approaches including: employing dads' workers; using interpreters; employing specialist young parent midwives; using local/familiar venues; and offering courses in evenings and at the weekends. 18. A number of partnerships offered spec ialist programmes for other vulnerable groups, such as the Earlybird programme for parents with an autistic child, and specific domestic violence programmes but the data for these was not reflected as part of the parenting offer. Workforce Development 19. In all Flying Start partnerships workforce development was seen as key to effective delivery. This consisted of training in specific programmes and the underlying philosophy of parent ing principles and practi ce. Where both of these elements were delivered across the workforce this led to clear assessments and referral pathways and effective integrated service delivery. Variation in Delivery 20. The review highlighted variation in parenting support across the 22 Flying Start partnerships, both in terms of offe r and practice. Although a challenge, the variation also reflected Flying Start part nerships developing services tailored to meet the needs of local communities. T he interim evaluation published in 2010 questioned \" should the variation observed in the scale of the parenting entitlement across partnerships be reduc ed by specifying mi nimum levels of provision? \" Opinion of the Flying Start team s was fairly evenly split as to 9whether minimum levels of provision s hould be set out in the guidance between a straight yes, a yes with some loca l considerations, to a no, it had to be decided locally. 21. We would recommend Flying Start partner ships, in partnership with the Welsh Government and their local partners, se t minimum outcome indicators at the local level rather than minimum levels of provision. These indicators could include school readiness, a reducti on in referrals to speech and language therapy and a reduction in referrals to spec ialist services such as social care. Building the Evidence Base 22. The findings from this review suggest that there is st ill a lack of a robust evidence base for parenting programmes in the UK, particularly at the universal level of delivery and in the use of RCTs. However, the review also identified the challenges in applying such approaches to universal programmes of support and that debate on this issue continues. The review highlighted the issue of over-reliance on RCTs for evidencing impact, particularly in relation to the types of universal/preventative programmes considered here and the need to consider various forms of evidence in the decision making process. 23. There is a need to improve the evidence ba se at the local level, particularly in relation to knowing what the 'active ingredients' of parenting programmes are, which programmes work for which types of parents and which parents drop out, or fail to engage (and the reasons why), as well as the need to evidence longer term benefits. The review identified a number of issues which have implications for all parenting programmes delivered via Fl ying Start and will help to build the evidence base, including the need for l onger-term monitoring of outcomes to see whether positive outcomes are maintained; more robust monitoring of the engagement and retention of parents on pr ogrammes; and addressing the lack of evaluation evidence from informal programmes of support. 24. Partnerships need to systematically anal yse their data to inform service delivery (a number are already im plementing such an approach). This needs to be undertaken at three levels: at the individual level: undertaking individual assessments of progress; 10 at the programme level: analysis of impact within a programme of support; at the service level: incorporating evidence to allow comparison of outcomes across different programmes of support. Conclusions Objective 1: To refresh the evide nce base on informal and formal parenting support and summarise the implications for policy and practice, relating this to current activity within Flying Start. 25. Overall, the review found little re cently published evidence of new parenting programmes that have been able to provide robust evidence that they improve outcomes for families with childr en aged 0-4, particularly at the universal/informal level. What was ident ified tended to be more at the targeted or specialist level, such as the Par ents Plus Early Years Programme and the Family Nurse Partnership, or was firming up evidence on existing programmes such as FLNP and the Incredible Years. 26. The review highlighted the ongoing debate around the benefits and challenges of undertaking RCTs linked to universal/p reventative programmes of support (e.g. FLNP). The challenges in de monstrating the effectiveness of universal/preventative support should be ta ken into consideration when making decisions on what should be funded. It seems pragmatic to consider the available evidence, whether it is good enough (i.e. given the constraints of 'real world' situations) and balance this with the relative costs of delivery and the potential for additional positive (and negative) outcomes. 27. We would suggest that there conti nues to be a need to widen the base of recommended programmes within Flying St art and to continue to review ongoing research in this area. This could be developed through support for evaluation locally, sharing of common approaches, and using and building on collaboration with ac ademic partners. 28. Most of the Flying Start partnerships were delivering programmes with a robust evidence base. The Incredible Years Parenting Programme was the most widely used programme and comprehens ive training and ongoing support was available for practitioners. There were al so close links with Bangor University 11which had enabled Flying Start areas to support the piloting and development of new programmes, e.g. the Incredible Years Toddler Programme. Incredible Years will clearly continue to be a significant element of Flyi ng Start delivery. 29. The Solihull Approach had been intr oduced in a number of Flying Start partnership areas and the review highli ghted that this programme can deliver positive outcomes. Whilst a RCT has not been undertaken, the review highlighted the importance of looking at other evi dence of effectiveness. 30. FLNP was delivered in a number of Flying Start Partnerships where staff report positively on its effectiveness. The re view highlighted the recent RCT and inconclusive results, but, like the Solihull Approach, there was other evidence of positive outcomes and this needs to be par t of the consideration around which programmes are delivered. 31. Programmes identified by the review that focused on developing positive parenting with some evidence of impr ovements in child outcomes through RCTs included the Parents Plus Early Y ears and 1-2-3 Magic. Neither of these were currently delivered in the Flying St art areas and consideration should be given as to whether these should be tr ialled. There may be some overlap between Parents Plus Early Years which focuses on speech and language with the Language and Play programme. 1-2-3 Magic offers a short universal intervention to managing behaviour and woul d respond to the need identified by some partnerships to have access to s horter programmes, which could improve parental engagement and retention. 32. Findings from community based home visiting programmes and the use of paraprofessionals to provide parents wit h support provided mixed evidence of improved outcomes. However, the evidence from both the Community Mothers Programme and the Family Nurse Partner ship (for vulnerable first time mothers) suggest that both are worthy of further considerat ion. Findings from the UK evaluation of the Family Nu rse Partnership programme should be looked at once published. 33. Baby massage was identified through t he review as an appropriate intervention for low risk families and a number of Fl ying Start areas found it particularly 12useful to engage fathers. It was deliver ed by a large number of partnerships that included it as part of their informal support offer. Objective 2: To review the current parenting entitlem ent and offer, identify barriers, enablers and best practice in delivery. 34. The review identified a number of examples of good practice across many Flying Start Partnerships, including services designed around the needs of parents; the development of Action Learning Sets to share learning and best practice across authorities; and the use of a range of strategies to improve engagement and access, such as the use of a mobile cr\u00e8che and the employment of a male dad's worker. 35. The delivery of the Flyi ng Start parenting entitlement across the partnerships was influenced by local conditions and st ructures. In many LAs the parenting offer was well developed and integrated within a continuum of support with partners, in others there was more fr agmentation and a less integrated offer. The consultations with Flying Start partnerships identified a number of enablers and barriers to delivering an effective and enhanced parenting offer. 36. Enablers focused on: providing a coordinated approach to delivering parenting with other partners and agencies, based on a local needs analysis; providing a well designed and developed Flying Start offer, with clarity on the outcomes that the parenting support was contributing towards; having strong governance arrangem ents closely linked with Local Authority plans; ensuring that evaluation and monitoring of parenting support services is undertaken to inform futu re planning and redesign; providing integrated services for child ren, young people and their families, driven and championed by the lo cal children and young people's board/partnerships; 13 having a Parenting Champion at a senior and strategic level; improving skills and knowledge through joint training, co-working and co- location. Through better communication, shared approaches to assessment and managing risk, services were seen as responsive to local needs, improving engagement of fam ilies and maximising outcomes for children; workforce development that included an understanding of the underlying principles of work with parents, not ju st training in parenting programmes; providing a highly motivated workforc e, delivering creative solutions to local challenges. 37. Barriers focused on: the challenge of demonstrating im pact and outcomes in a coherent way across services; a lack of accessible venues and high costs of transport and childcare/cr\u00e8che facilities; the challenge of engaging some more difficult to reach groups such as fathers, teenage parents, bla ck and minority ethnic groups. Objective 3: To support the future development of the programme, identify gaps in evidence and provid e suggestions on how to improve the evidence base on the effectiveness and impact of these interventions in Flying Start. 38. The review of the liter ature highlighted the chall enges in undertaking research to evidence the impact of parenting pr ogrammes. The issues identified have implications for parenting programmes deliv ered via Flying Start which will help to build the evidence base, namely: 14 the need for longer term monitoring of outcomes to see whether positive changes are maintained. Following up parents post-intervention will have time and cost implications. The chaotic and transient nature of some families' lives would make longer term follow up impossible and it would not be practical for every programme. However, longer term monitoring of outcomes would be beneficia l in order to further develop the local evidence base; using a triangulated approach to monitoring and evaluation, building on parent self-report to provide an independent assessment of impact and improvement in outcomes; better analysis of demographic data to identify the variables which influence how parents respond to progr ammes and how different parents respond to different programmes; more robust monitoring of the en gagement and retention of parents on different programmes, particularly the reasons why parents drop out or do not engage with support. W here possible, this could be undertaken via follow-ups with referring agencies/servic es. Services need to know which parents are not engaging /dropping out and gather the views of those who do not engage to develop further learning, as well as ensuring that programmes are suitable for the parents recruited on to them; to better understand the needs of vulner able or under-represented groups of parents through careful targeti ng so that appropriate engagement approaches are developed, as well as evaluated; the lack of evaluation evidence from informal programmes of support also needs to be addressed with suitable outco me indicators identified for the delivery of all informal support, such as whether participants go on to access additional programmes of s upport or the uptake of formal parenting programmes by vulnerable or hard to reach parents. It would also be beneficial to further explore the suitability of using tools such as SOUL (Soft Outcomes Universal Lear ning) to measure soft outcomes; 15 the informal programmes offered by par tnerships should be reviewed to ensure that services are clear wh ich informal programmes facilitate parental engagement in more fo rmal parenting programmes. 39. Partnerships need to systematically anal yse their data to inform service delivery (a number were already implementing such an approach). This needs to be undertaken at three levels: at the individual level: undertaking individual assessments of progress; at the programme level: analysis of impact within a programme of support; at the service level: incorporating evidence to allow comparison of outcomes across different programmes of support. Recommendations Recommendation 1 : While there was considerable consensus around the need to give more prominence and value to in formal support within Flying Start, the current guidance does not include any info rmal programmes. This might reflect, in part, the lack of robust evidence fo r informal programmes. We recommend that the guidance could be extended to include baby massage, which was seen as a suitable intervention for low risk families. Recommendation 2 : In order to strengthen the evidence base for informal support, we recommend that suitable outcome indicators are identified for the delivery of informal support. A parent ing self-report model such as TOPSE (Tool to measure Parenting Self Efficacy) or 'My World' could be used. Recommendation 3 : It would be advantageous for Fl ying Start partnerships to name a Parenting Champion operating at a senior level who can promote parenting support and engage partners at a strategic level ensuring that services are delivered to meet need and achieve outcomes. Recommendation 4 : We recommend that the parent ing offer be strengthened in the new guidance and that there is a parenting strand within LAs' strategic plans, which includes a local needs assessment. Recommendation 5 : We would recommend the Flying Start partnerships, in conjunction with other se rvices and initiatives, set and agree minimum local 16outcome indicators rather than minimum levels of provision, to ensure better alignment and measurement of impact. 17 "}
