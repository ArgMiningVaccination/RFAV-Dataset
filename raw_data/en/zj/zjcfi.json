Reviews I have been using Oscillococcinum for my pediatric and adult patients for the last 10 years, as well as for myself and my family. It is hands down, my favorite over-the-counter medicine. It really brought back joy with treating my patients because it feels great to be able to alleviate your patients suffering from flu and flu-like symptoms. I had chills but was I burning up; my entire body felt like I had been in a wreck, runny nose, congested coughing. I went to Walgreens picked Oscillococcinum up and started my first dose last night. I don't even feel like the same person this morning. Considering how high copays are, I'm glad this worked out for me. We have used this product for over 15 years, and it has always helped lessen the symptoms and duration of the flu. This is the first year I can't find Oscillo ANYWHERE! I guess the secret is out. Please get it back in stock before we actually need it!
