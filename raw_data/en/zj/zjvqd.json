The Honorable Nancy Pelosi Speaker of the House of Representatives Washington, DC 20515 Dear Madam Speaker: Over the coming weeks, the Administration looks forward to continued engagement with members of both parties to reach a comprehensive, bipartisan agreement to fund the Government for the rest of the fiscal year (FY) and invest in critical national priorities before the December 16th funding deadline. As part of that process, the Congress has an opportunity and obligation to address three additional and critical funding needs that should earn bipartisan support: protecting the American people from COVID-19 and saving lives globally; supporting the people of Ukraine; and helping communities across the Nation recover from devastating natural disasters. Today, I am writing to provide you with the President's request for FY 2023 emergency supplemental funding for critical assistance to Ukraine and critical response activities to address COVID-19. We are working quickly to refine the estimates of funding needs to address recent natural disasters, and we will share additional details on thos~ anticipated needs as soon as possible. I urge the Congress to promptly act on all three of these priorities on behalf of the American people. First, there remains an urgent need for additional COVID-19 funding to help us stay prepared in the face of an unpredictable virus. While COVID-19 is no longer the disruptive force it was when the President took office; we face the emergence of new subvariants in the United States and around the world that have the potential to cause a surge qf infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, particularly as we head into the winter months-a time when viruses like COVID-19 spread more quickly. We know how to manage this moment, but as the Administration has long made clear-including in previous emergency funding requests we sent to the Congress on March 2, 2022, April 28, 2022, and September 2, 2022-we need additional resources to ensure that we have the necessary services and supplies to keep the American people safe. That is why we are requesting funding to help prepare for a possible winter surge, smooth the path to commercialization for vaccines and therapeutics, accelerate research and treatment for long COVID, and develop next-generation vaccines and treatments. Because our safety depends on getting the virus under control everywhere, we are also requesting funding to combat the virus globally by supporting vaccine uptake and expanding access to treatments and testing. Failure to provide more funding would lead to needless infections and deaths across the Nation and around the world. Second, we must continue to support the people ofUkraine as they defend their sovereignty and stand resolute in the face ofRussia's brutal war. Since the beginning of Putin's war, the United States has rallied the world to support Ukraine. Together, with strong, bipartisan support in the Congress, we have provided significant assistance that has been critical to Ukraine's success on the battlefield-and we cannot let that support run dry. To date, roughly three-quarters ofthe funds previously provided by the Congress have been disbursed or committed, with even more expected by the end of the year. That is why we are urging the Congress to provide additional appropriations to ensure Ukraine has the funding, weapons, and support it needs to defend itself, and that vulnerable people continue to receive lifesaving aid. The request also addresses the critical global food and energy shortages caused by Russia's mvas10n. Third, we need to help our communities recover arid rebuild from extreme weather events and natural disasters. The President has visited many ofthese communities in recent months, including parts of Florida and Puerto Rico that have been devastated by Hurricanes Ian and \u00b7 Fiona. At moments like this, Americans come together not as Republicans or Democrats, but as one Nation-and that means we must fund critical disaster response and rebuilding efforts in Florida, Puerto Rico, and other communities across America that have faced severe flooding,' wildfires, drought, and extreme heat over the past year. As the President often says, we must be there for these communities every step ofthe way-for as long as it takes. Staying ahead of COVID-19. Supporting Ukraine's fight to defend its sovereignty. Helping Americans who have borne the brunt ofnatural disasters. The American people rightly expect their leaders to come together and deliver on these priorities, and I urge the Congress to address them as part of a comprehensive, bipartisan agreement in the weeks ahead.

Funds would also support testing, treatment, and infection prevention control via PEPFAR for people living with HIV and their communities. The remaining $925 million for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) would fund USAID efforts to strengthen health and health security systems, and support health workers to manage COVID -19 and prepare for future COVID-19 variants and pandemic threats, in support of the goals of the September 2022 United States COVID-19 Global Response and Recovery Framework. These resources would continue supporting countries to deliver lifesaving COVID -19 vaccines through Global VAX, integrate COVID-19 vaccinations into routine health systems, finance variant-adapted vaccines, and test, contain, and treat COVID-19 cases. This request would also support efforts to fill coverage gaps in routine immunization programs. The request would also support contributions to international organizations working to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and future threats, in addition to activities to manage COVID -19 and build resiliency of health systems. In addition, the request would provide the authority to transfer funds to the Emergency Reserve Fund, managed by USAID. 2 Attachment 2. Ukraine Assistance Needs.

This would be used to fund clearing landmines and other explosive remnants of war in order to facilitate rapid humanitarian access and protection of civilians in areas of Ukraine targeted by Russia. Reports from the newly liberated areas of eastern Ukraine indicate that landmine and unexploded ordnance contamination is more extensive than in northern Ukraine because of the duration of fighting and length of control by Russia's forces. NADR funds would also be used to support non-governmental organizations and contractor demining teams that are on the ground so they could expand their efforts and to continue training and equipping the government of Ukraine demining and explosive ordnance disposal operators so they can take on more of the effort. Funds would also be used to assist Ukraine in reinforcing customs and border security controls and securing materials and addressing a range of issues related to chemical, biological, radiological, and nucle ar materials. 29 Agency: INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS Bureau: INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE Account: Foreign Military Financing Program Subcommittee: State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Estimated Need: $500,000,000 This request would provide an additional $500 million to the Foreign Military Financing Program, within the Department of State. This funding would support grants, loans, or loan guarantees to support Ukraine and other U.S. partners,' including major Non-North Atlant ic Treaty Organization allies,' defense against ongoing and emerging threats.

This funding would support programs to include the National Police of Ukraine (NPU), and the State Border Guard Service (SBGS) of Ukraine. The NPU and SBGS are playing a critical role in protecting civilians, rescuing victims of Russia's repeated attacks against civilian infrastructure and cities, and defending the territory of Ukraine. Support includes providing urgently needed equipment and replacing losses, such as personal protective equipment, field gear, tactical equipment, medical kits and supplies, communications equipment, armored vehicles, small arms and ammunition, and unmanned aerial systems. These resources will also support SBGS and NPU efforts to reestablish civilian security in areas reclaimed by Ukraine's armed forces including through provision of temporary structures and modular command posts that can be used to support forward operations and along new lines of contact. 31 Agency: INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS Bureau: INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE Account: Economic Support Fund Subcommittee: State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Estimated Need: $13,045,000,000 This request would provide $13 billion to the Department of State (State) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for direct budget support for the government of Ukraine (GOU) and for critical energy security and economic stabilization through war time investments in infrastructure repairs, economic productivity, and stabil izing liberated areas. In addition, the request includes funding for cybersecurity in the Western Balkans, which have particular vulnerabilities to destabilizing threats from Russia and its partners, for accountability efforts focused on the use of U.S. budget support and other economic assistance, and for global food security to help cushion the macroeconomic shock and impact on vulnerable populations caused by Russia's war against Ukraine by mitigating the global fertilizer shortage, and building agricultural capacity and resilience. The request would also authorize transfers from the Economic Support Fund to: 1) State's Diplomatic Programs (DP) and Capital Investment Fund (CIF) accounts, and USAID's Operating Expenses (OE) account for increased U.S. cybersecurity and programming needs related to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine; 2) the U.S. Development Finance Corporation for assistance to promote private sector development for the tools listed under section 1421 of the BUILD Act of 2018 (including loans and loan guarantees which would require appropriations language referencing section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974); and 3)the Export Import Bank of the U.S. for export promotion activities in Ukraine (including loans and loan guarantees which would require appropriations language referencing section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974). Direct Budget Support : $9.9 billion to continue critical support for the GOU. This funding will help the GOU maintain confidence in the domest ic currency and financial system, maintain functionality as it defends itself against Russian aggression, support ongoing delivery of essential government services, and mitigate destabilizing inflationary pressures. The European Union, G7 members, interna tional financial institutions, and other bilateral and multilateral donors are expected to provide additional, robust budget support to augment U.S. contributions and help Ukraine stabilize its financial situation. Economic Stabilization and Early Recovery: $1.5 billion to help stabilize Ukraine's economy, while simultaneously working to create the conditions necessary to support Ukraine's future recovery. Economic stabilization will focus on activities that will generate revenue for the GOU, spur economic development, and create conditions for eventual reconstruction. Activities are anticipated in three areas: 32 Critical Infrastructure Recovery. Direct support for projects identified by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), World Bank, and other institutions to restore critical infrastructure and/or funding for technical advisors and infrastructure assessments to lay the groundwork for GOU recovery efforts; Economic Productivity. Reshaping and restarting economic productivity across Ukraine to catalyze and stabilize Ukraine's economy through programs that create jobs, generate income, encourage stability, and generate tax and other revenue for the government; and Stability in Liberated Areas. Targeted assistance to areas liberated f rom Russia's control to help stabilize these areas and enable economic development, including through emergency relief and the transition from relief to development, support to local governments and civil society organizations that aid civilians, and aid in the restoration of health, education, and community services. Energy Security: $1.1 billion to secure and repair Ukraine's energy sector, and to address Ukraine's energy supply. Russia's ongoing attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure have left many households and businesses without power. According to some reports, more than a third of Ukraine's hard- to-replace transmission hubs have been damaged or destroyed. Assistance could be transferred to Treasury and then used multilaterally (e.g., through multilateral development banks such as the EBRD) and/or bilaterally to support: the general cost of operations, repair and maintenance for Ukraine's power, gas, heating, and petroleum sectors, as well as the imports of electricity, gas, and liquid fuels. District heating and water network repairs and shelter will be continuous needs, and the rehabilitation and reconstruction of electricity, water, and heating facilities in conflict- affected areas must be addressed to meet the needs of the broader population during the winter, with special attention paid to critical facilities, recently liberated areas and areas impacted since the October attacks on critical energy infrastructure. These funds would also help Moldova meet its energy needs. Funds could be used for budget support to help the government of Moldova increase imports of electricity from neighboring countries, or to enable the purchase of other fuels or related energy equipment from reliable partners who will not use energy supply as a weapon. Global Food Security: $300 million for global food security to help cushion the macroeconomic shock and impact on vulnerable populations, mitigate the global fertilizer shortage, and build agricultural capacity and resilience to shocks including food pric e volatility, supply chain issues, and other stressors because of Russia's war against Ukraine. These efforts would support, expand, and complement ongoing programs of Feed the Future, the United States' global hunger and food security initiative led by U SAID to respond to immediate rising food insecurity and to mitigate further shocks. These efforts will be consistent with the Federal Government's Global Food Security Strategy and response plan. Department of State and USAID OE: $130 million to bolster State DP, CIF, and USAID OE to provide critical information technology infrastructure support for posts in Ukraine and the region and to maintain critical staffing patterns supporting programming related to Russia's full -scale invasion of Ukraine. Cybersecurity: $50 million to address cybersecurity threats from Russia and its associates against Western Balkans countries, which have particular vulnerabilities to 33 destabilizing cyber threats from Russia and other actors seeking to take advantage of the Ukr aine conflict for malign purposes. Accountability/Transparency: $20 million for the oversight and accountability of appropriated resources. These resources would maintain ongoing efforts to work with the Ukrainian Ministry of Finance and other Ukrainian government institutions on their monitoring, transparency, verification, and reporting related to their use of budget support. Resources could also enable expanded efforts to focus on the use of economic stabilization assistance. 34 Agency: INTERNATIONAL A SSISTANCE PROGRAMS Bureau: AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT Account: International Disaster Assistance Subcommittee: State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Estimated Need: $250,000,000 This request would provide $250 million to the U.S. Agency for International Development to provide lifesaving humanitarian assistance to vulnerable or displaced populations inside Ukraine, in the broader region, and around the globe. As of October 2022, the United Nations estimated that more than 17.7 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection in Ukraine and the region. Meanwhile, Russia's war in Ukraine has contributed to unprecedented global hunger, with nearly 350 million people around the world facing acute food insecurity. Resources would be used to provide people with food and cash assistance, medical supplies and health care, safe drinking water and protection services, as well as other essential aid and services. 35 Agency: INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS Bureau: AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT Account: Transition Initiatives Subcommittee: State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Estimated Need: $50,000,000 This request would provide $50 million to Transition Initiatives, within the U.S. Agency for International Development. This funding would support flexible contingency response programming to advance resilient, democratic recovery and reforms in Ukraine and Moldova. In Ukraine, programming would advance early recovery in key frontline communities and reclaimed areas, help maintain connections between Ukrainians in Ukrainian-controlled and Russian -controlled areas, and broaden the reach of narratives about Ukraine's unity. In Moldova, programming would help mitigate the destabilizing effects of R ussia's war against Ukraine and the associated crisis. More specifically, programs would help increase Moldovans' understanding and engagement in key reforms, European integration, and crisis mitigation. These programs would also increase Moldovans' consumption of independent, accurate media and unite them around shared civic and cultural values. 36 Agency: INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS Account: GENERAL PROVISIONS Subcommittee: State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Estimated Need: Language This provision would expand authority provided to the Department of State in the Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022 by authorizing foreign military financing (FMF) grants, loans, and loan guarantees for major Non- North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, and increasing the authorized ceiling on loan and guaranteed loan gross principal obligations to $8 billion. This flexibility is crucial to most-effectively addressing ongoing and emerging threats to critical allies and partners. 37 Agency: DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS Account: GENERAL PROVISIONS Subcommittee: State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Estimated Need: Language This request would provide the authority for the Department of State to increase the fiscal year (FY) 2023 Foreign Assistance Act section 506(a)(1) drawdown limits for military assistance by $7 billion, to $10.7 billion to facilitate additional military assistance to Ukraine or other countries from Department of Defense invent ories. In addition, this request would provide the authority for the Department of State to increase the cap under section 614(a)(4)(A)(ii) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for FY 2023 and increase other related caps under section 614(a)(4)(C) proportionally to allow for greatly needed flexibility to match resources with evolving needs. In addition, this request would provide authority for the Department of State to request an increase in the cap under section 552(c)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for FY 2023 to facilitate the transfer of additional commodities and services from any United States Government Agency to Ukraine or other countries. In addition, this request would provide authority for the Department of State to request increased caps under section 506(a)(2), including the $75 million cap on drawdowns from Department of Defense resources, to provide additional flexibility to respond to needs for non-military assistance, such as assistance to support energy infrastructure in U kraine. In addition, this request would provide authority for the Department of State to transfer authorities between accounts to be able to flexibly respond depending on the situation on the ground. These are particularly important in terms of security a ssistance, as requirements could change. The request would also authorize transfers from the Economic Support Fund to: 1) the Department of State's Diplomatic Programs and Capital Investment Fund accounts, and the U.S. Agency for International Development's Operating Expenses account for increased U.S. cybersecurity and programming needs related to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine; 2) the U.S. Development Finance Corporation for assistance to promote private sector development for the tools listed under section 1421 of the BUILD Act of 2018 (including loans and loan guarantees which will require appropriations language referencing section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974); and 3) the Export Import Bank of the U.S. for export promotion activities in Ukraine (including loans and loan guarantees which would require appropriations language referencing section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974). 38 Agency: INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT Account: Intelligence Community Manag ement Account Subcommittee: Defense Estimated Need: $75,000 This request would provide $75,000 for the Intelligence Community Management Account, within Intelligence Community Management. This funding would provide support to the Executive Branch for a study on cyber techniques and trends used by Russia in Ukraine. 39 Summary of Funding Request to Meet Critical Needs COVID -19 There remains an urgent need for additional COVID -19 funding to help us stay prepared in the face of an unpredictable virus. While COVID- 19 is no longer the disruptive force it was when President Biden took office, we face the emergence of new subvariants in the United States and around the world that have the potential to cause a surge of infections, particularly as we head into the winter months \u2014a time when viruses like COVID spread more quickly. We know how to manage this moment, but as the Administration has long made clear, we need additional resources to ensure that we have the necessary services and supplies to keep the American people safe. That's why we are requesting $8.25 billion to help prepare for a possible winter surge, smooth the path to commercialization for vaccines and therapeutics, accelerate research and treatment for long COVID, and develop next -generation vaccines and treatments. And because our safety depends on getting the virus under control everywhere, we are also requesting $1 billion to combat the virus globally by supporting vaccine uptake and expanding access to treatments and testing.

Since the beginning of Putin's war, the United States has rallied the world to support Ukraine. Together, with strong, bipartisan support in Congress, we have provided significant assistance that has been critical to Ukraine's success on the battlefield\u2014and we cannot let that support run dry. To date, roughly three- quarters of the funds previously provided by Congress have been disbursed or committed, with even more expected by the end of the year. That's why we are urging Congress to provide $37. 7 billion thro ugh the duration of this fiscal year to ensure Ukraine has the funding, weapons, and support it needs to defend itself, and that vulnerable people continue to receive lifesaving aid.
