I'm going to give you seven ways to unclog arteries naturally. Now, when we use the term clogged arteries, we're talking about a blockage in your arteries which is usually caused by [atherosclerosis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569). Atherosclerosis occurs when you have these fatty acid deposits, as well as deposits of cholesterol, calcium, and sometimes platelets, inside of your inflamed blood vessels. They can cause plaques, which lead to blockage or clogged arteries. Clogged arteries can lead to all kinds of problems, including [heart attacks](https://www.midtownnephrology.com/heart-attack-symptoms/), [strokes](https://www.midtownnephrology.com/what-are-the-warning-signs-of-a-stroke/), [kidney failure](https://www.midtownnephrology.com/kidney-failure-symptoms/), poor circulation. And so if you have clogged arteries, what can you do? What are some ways to unclog your arteries naturally? What Are Arteries? Your arteries are the blood vessels that deliver oxygenated blood away from your heart to all of your tissues and your organs, including your heart, kidneys, lungs, and your liver, all the way to the tips of your toes and to your fingertips. And so you can imagine, if your arteries are clogged, this can cause multiple problems. One thing to remember is that this article is informational and it in no way replaces the advice of your actual physician. What Causes Clogged Arteries? Are you at risk of having clogged arteries? Well, you are at risk if you have a sedentary lifestyle, don't exercise much, or if you have very little physical activity. Also, if you are a person who is living with obesity, you are at risk. If you smoke cigarettes or have high blood pressure, you're at risk. Having a high-fat diet, especially if it's high in animal fats, trans fats, or saturated fats you are at risk of having clogged arteries. Other risk factors include having diabetes and a family history of atherosclerotic heart disease. 7 Ways To Unclog Arteries Naturally Did you know that cholesterol is not just found in your arteries? It's true. Cholesterol does build up in the walls of your arteries, creating plaque and restricting blood flow. But cholesterol can also form around other things like calcium deposits, infections, tumors, or even foreign objects. The body is hard at work trying to heal itself and sometimes that process results in a calcium deposit or other cholesterol-rich plaque within the veins, lymph nodes, or soft tissue. That's why it's important to take care of yourself and avoid all the usual arterial culprits. 1. Eat Foods That Are High In Omega-3 Fatty Acids Fish like salmon, mackerel, tuna, and sardines are high in omega-3s, and they have been associated with low cholesterol, especially low [ bad cholesterol](https://www.midtownnephrology.com/high-cholesterol-symptoms-risk-factors-and-treatment/), like low triglycerides. They have also been associated with a decrease in vascular inflammation, meaning a decrease of inflammation inside of those arteries. Omega-3s have also been associated with a decrease in platelet aggregation, meaning a decrease in the platelets sticking to plaques and making the blockage worse. 2. Eat Walnuts Walnuts have been associated with increased flexibility or elasticity of arteries. They have also been associated with a decreased inflammation in the arteries and a decrease in cholesterol. 3. Add Berries To Your Diet I'm talking about strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries. Berries are high in fiber, minerals, flavonoids, and antioxidants. They help to reduce bad cholesterol and vascular inflammation. And so having a diet that is rich in berries can help to unclog your arteries naturally. Plus, they taste great. 4. Eat Citrus Fruits You want your diet to be loaded down with lemons, oranges, and grapefruits. Again, they taste great, but they're also loaded with vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, and antioxidants. They have been associated with reduced cholesterol and with decreasing vascular inflammation. 5. Eat Beans Beans are another way to unclog your arteries naturally. They are loaded with fiber. They're an excellent plant-based source of protein, and they have been associated with a decrease in bad cholesterol and a decrease in triglycerides. Beans have also been associated with a decrease in plaque buildup, and they're pretty easy to add to your diet. You can put them in soups, or you can add them to your salads. Beans are definitely another way to help to unclog your arteries naturally. 6. Eat Vegetables You want your diet to be loaded down with green, leafy vegetables, as well as broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage. These foods have been associated with decreased plaques, decrease bad cholesterol, and decreased atherosclerosis. 7. Exercise Now you know I have to mention exercise. As I mentioned earlier, the risk factors for atherosclerosis or clogged arteries include being a person with obesity, or also a person with [diabetes](https://www.midtownnephrology.com/diabetes-symptoms-10-warning-signs-you-should-never-ignore/). When you exercise, that helps to decrease your risk factors for having clogged arteries. According to the [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults), you should be exercising 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, so that's about 30 minutes of exercise, five times a week. Bonus! Stop Bad Habits That Lead To Clogged Arteries Now, these are just some of the ways for you to unclog your arteries naturally. You also want to stop bad habits. If you're a smoker, you want to stop smoking cigarettes. You want to avoid diets that are high in trans and saturated fats. You can eat other foods more than the ones I mentioned, and you want to eat oats or beets. There are all kinds of things that you can do. But here's the most important thing to do. In addition to making sure that you consult with your physician and your nutritionist before making any kind of dietary changes, you want to remember this when you are trying to unclog your arteries naturally. There are some patients, many patients, who will require more than just natural remedies to unclog arteries. For example, your physician may find it necessary to prescribe you a medication, such as a cholesterol-lowering medication. And if you already have clogged arteries that are too far gone, you may have to have certain procedures such as heart catheterization, or if your carotid arteries are clogged, you may have to have carotid endarterectomy. If your leg arteries are clogged, you may have to have a procedure to open up that circulation. My point is that natural remedies are wonderful, but it's not one or the other, medicine versus natural. You want your healthcare to be integrative, meaning you use natural remedies, and lifestyle changes under the consultation of your physician, but you also recognize when it is necessary for medicines or procedures. Conclusion Make sure you have a physician with whom you have a good relationship and you're very open about your desire to be natural, and you're also open to listening to all of the remedies.
