Bodhi Meditation for Immunity Malaysia | He Ling: Goodbye I had a weak body condition where I suffered from illnesses such as migraine and a severe case of nose allergy. My migraine would occur whenever the sun shines on my scalp or the weather gets too hot or cold, hence, I have to rely on painkillers to ease the pain. If there's dust or a certain smell in my surroundings, I would constantly sneeze to the extent it hurts my nose, throat and brings tears to my eyes. Soon after, I'll also suffer from cold and fever. After joining the 8.5 Day Health and Happiness Retreat in December 2018, my family members have noticed that my health condition has improved. They realized that I rarely sneeze or rub my nose anymore. A year after the meditation class, I no longer experience nose allergy or migraine! Malaysia | Fen Kang: Sinusitis Gone! I've had sinusitis since I was six. My nose was clogged all the time, hence, I had to rely on medicated spray three times a week to ease the congestion. As the problem persisted and affected my sleep quality, not only would I feel weak and dizzy during the day, but also affect my concentration in class. After participating in the retreat, it cleared my stuffy nose and I don't have to rely on nasal spray. Currently, my sleep quality has improved as I no longer suffer from a clogged nose. Korea | Cang Yong: Welcome Clear Skin and Bright Future Dermatitis was always a part of my growing years. Itchy rashes would spread to all parts of my body when it flared up. I would scratch until my skin bled. As medications did not improve my condition, I could not wear short-sleeve shirts like most teenagers do. The itching would keep me awake. In summer, the condition worsened as sweat would further irritate the broken skin. My skin condition affected my diet and it seemed that obtaining healthy skin would always be beyond reach. I was on the verge of a breakdown. Since 2016, I've been practicing The Meditation of Greater Illumination for 30 minutes daily. I felt that meditation was able to cleanse my mind and boost my energy. After a year, my skin complexion became healthy and there's no signs of dermatitis anymore! Malaysia | Ai Chang: Free of Eczema, Full of Confidence Severe eczema was the main reason behind my low self-esteem. I often avoided communicating with relatives and friends, and even with my own sister. It was after attending the 8.5-Day Health & Happiness Retreat which has helped me regain self-confidence that I could not have in the past. Currently, I am able to communicate better with my relatives and friends, and have enough to speak in front of a crowd. Reference List 1.
