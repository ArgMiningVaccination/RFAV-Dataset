Ask yourself: Will I be in contact with the patient? What will I be doing? What is my chance of being around oblood obody (puke), urine skin opatient's body tissues, e.g. the afterbirth odirty clinic equipment, e.g. re usable medical objects and sharps odirty clinic surfaces and equipmen t, e.g. tables, floors, toilets After doing your own risk assessment, you can use extra precau tions to protect yourself from germs. The extra precautions are on the next page. Remember \u2014if you are not sure, ask for help from your manager or the Nurse-in- Charge. Report anything unus ual, especially if you think it might affect your safety, or someone else's. IMPORTANT! A risk assessment must be done fo r ALL patients and ALL health care workers at ALL times 13 12 Extra Precautions Before you start any housekeeping task and have any patient contact, ask yourse lf: Will you need to use extra precautions? Use extra precautions if a patient has any of the following: \u007fCoughing or sneezing due to an infection: \u007fWear a mask and eye protection within 2 metres (6 feet) of the client. \u007fActive tuberculosis (TB): \u007fWear an N95 respirator mask if you have to enter while the client is still in the room. \u007fMeasles, chicken pox or shingles: \u007fWear an N95 mask if you have not been immunized and have not had the disease and you have to enter while the client is still in the room. \u007fPandemic influenza (flu): \u007fWear a mask, eye protection, gloves and gown within 2 metres (6 feet) of a flu patient or someone with flu-like symptoms. \u007fWear an N95 mask if the client is coughing or sneezing forcefully, and can't or won't cough or sneeze into their sleeve, use tissues, or wear a mask.. \u007fInfectious diarrhoea: \u007fWear a mask and eye protection wh en cleaning up vom it (puke) or feces (poop). How will you know when to use extra precautions? \u007fAsk! \u007fHave a meeting with your manager, community health representative and Nurse-In-Charge to decide a way to let you know when to use extra precautions \u007fSee the next page for mo re inform ation. 14 13Deciding when to use extra precautions\u2014it's a team effort! Here is an example of an arrangement that may work for you in your clinic. 1. The Nurse-In-Charge will stick a col oured Post-it note on the exam room door after a patient leaves the room. The color of the Post-it note matches a certain way of cleaning and disinfection. We will use various colour po st-its for different levels of cleaning and disinfection. 2.

Cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub is the preferred choice as it kills germs in seconds. It is better than washing your hands with soap and running water when they do not look dirty. Washing your hands with soap and running water removes germs and must be done when hands look dirty. Use hand lotion after washing your hands, to stop your skin from getting dry. Two Ways to Clean Hands Make sure that sleeves are pushed up and do not get wet 1. Rub all parts of your hands with alcohol-based hand rub. 2. Pay special attention to finger tips, between fingers, backs of hands and at the base of the thumbs. 3. Let your hands air dr y. 1. Rub all parts of the hands with soap and running water. 2. Pay special attention to finger tips, between fingers, backs of hands and at the base of the thumbs. 3. Wash your hands for at least 15 seconds. 4. Pat your hands dry with paper towels. 5. If there is no running water use moistened towelettes to remove the visible dirt, followed by use of alcohol- based hand rub1. Keep nails short and clean 2. Remove rings, bracelets and watches 3. Do not wear artificial nails 4. Remove chipped nail polish WARNING: Alcohol-based hand rub contains ethanol and rubbing alcohol. Do not swallow or rub wet into eyes.

(Page 69) Decide how much surface cleaner/disinfectant solution you will need for the task. \u007fConcentrated ACCEL\u00ae is corrosive. You mu st wear eye protection and gloves when pouring and mixing. If it splashes into your eyes, IMMEDIATELY flush your eyes with plenty of clean water. If it splashes onto your skin, IMMEDIATELY wash off with water. The diluted solution that you use for cleaning is quite safe. \u007fKeep the ACCEL\u00ae surface cleaner/disinfectant Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) on the cleaning cart or in the supply room in your clinic. NEVER use AHP surface cleaner/disinfectant on medical devices or items such as surgical and dental instrume nts, or Am bu bags, airways or any devices that touch inside the body or on broken skin. These require special disinfection. If you have any questions, speak to your manager or ask a nurse. 60 51 Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide Disinfectant Wipes Use ACCEL\u00ae TB Disinfectant Wipes that are ready to use and pre-moistened with accelerated hydrogen peroxide 0.5% Use disinfectant wipes to disinfect the su rfaces of medical devices/items that are reused on clients with unbroken skin. Use disinfectant wipes to disinfect the su rfaces of electronics and devices that cannot be washed or damp-wiped. Use disinfectant wipes after cleaning medical devices/items to remove obvious dust, soil or fluids. Keep the ACCEL\u00ae TB Disinfectant wipes Materi al Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) on the cleaning cart or in the supply room in your clinic. Do not use disinfectant wipes for regular cleaning purposes on floors, walls, and fabric/cloth surfaces. The wipes are expensive, please don't waste them. Do not use disinfectant wipes on medical de vices/items such as surgical and dental instruments, or Ambu bags, airways or other devices that touch inside the body or on broken skin.

We hope that you find this document useful as you develop policies and procedures for housekeeping staff in your own health care setting. 6 6 Guidelines The patient care environment 1. Patient care areas include: washrooms, waiting rooms and dining rooms used by patients procedure rooms, examination rooms diagnostic and treatment areas equipment reprocessing (sterilization) areas sterile supplies storage, clean utility rooms laundry room, clean linen storage rooms pharmacy laboratory food preparation areas Patient care areas should be used only for patient care activities. Within the health care facility, patient care activities should not be done outside of the designated patient care areas. 2. In patient care areas: a)Replace worn, stained, cracked or torn furnishings; b) Remove upholstered furniture and other cloth or soft furnishings that cannot be cleaned and disinfected. 1 3. Surfaces of furnishings and equipment in patient care areas should be: a)easily maintained and repaired; b) cleanable with hospital-grade detergents, cleaners and disinfectants (see Appendix 4 ); and c)smooth, non-porous and seamless. 2 4. Ensure that cloth items (such as curtains, pillows, mattresses and soft furnishings): a) are easily maintained and repaired; b)are seamless or double-stitched; c)have removable covers for to mould; are cleanable with hospital-grade detergents , cleaners and disinfect ants (see Appendix 4 ); and f)are quick drying. 3 5. Do not carpet areas a)that serve patients who have seriously reduced resistance to infection (e.g., transplant and chemotherapy patients, newborns who are ill or premature) b)where patients receive treatments or procedures 1 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 3. 2 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 4. 3 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 5. 7 7 c)where there is risk of blood or body fluids being spilled, or d)where there is risk of vomit, feces or wastewater being spilled. 4 6. If used, carpet must: a)be cleanable with hospital-grade cleaners and disinfectants (see Appendix 4 ); b) be cleaned by trained staff using appropriate cleaning equipment and procedures; c)be removed and replaced when worn or stained; and d) dry quickly to reduce the likelihood of mould accumulation; carpeting that remains wet after 72 hours must be removed. 5 7. If carpeting is used in patient care areas, there must be a rigorous program of care that includes: a) daily vacuuming with a HEPA-filtered vacuum; b) scheduled cleaning by extraction or shampooing; and c) rapid response for dealing with spills of blood, body fluids , vomit or feces. (See the Housekeeping Manual for carpet cleaning procedures in case of such a spill.) 6 d) Following cleanup of blood, body fluids, vomit or feces, the carpet must be steam cleaned at a temperature of at least 60 degrees C (140 degrees F) 7, or replaced. 8. Do not use equipment that cannot be properl y cleaned, disinfected or covered, in the care environment. 8 This includes electronic equipment. 9. Non-critical medical equipment (equipment that does not touch the patient, or touches only intact skin, but not mucous membranes, for ex ample: blood pressure cu ffs and stethoscopes) must be cleanable to recommended standards (see Appendix 5 ). 9 Note : Equipment that touches mucous membranes or broken skin, (e.g., de ntal and surgical instruments, endoscopes, vaginal specula) is considered \"critical\" a nd requires high-level disinfection or sterilization before re-use. This is only done by staff trained in reprocessing, and is not covered by these guidelines. 10. Each item of non-critical medical equipment must have written cleaning and disinfection instructions provided by the manufacturer. 10 11. Toys in patient care areas should: 11 a)be nonporous and able to withstand thorough cleaning and disinfection; b) not be capable of soaking up or otherwise holding water; c)not have parts that cannot be cleaned; and d) not be cleaned with phenolic disinfectants (Note: phenolic di sinfectants can be absorbed through skin and can harm infants and young children). 4 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 7. 5 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 8. 6 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, page 79. 7 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, p80, p96. 8 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 10. 9 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 15. 10 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 17. 11 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 69. 8 8 Plush toys should be dedicated to individual patients and be se nt home with the patient or discarded; If toys in patient care areas cannot be clean ed and disinfected (e.g., books, magazines, puzzles, cards, comics) they should be discarde d or dedicated to individual patients. Cleaning agents and disinfectants 12. Cleaning and disinfecting products must: a)have a Drug Identification Number (\"DIN\") from Health Canada; b)be compatible with items and equipmen t to be cleaned and disinfected; and c)be used according to the manufacturers' instructions 12; including the expiry date, if one is given. Note : Cleaning agents remove dirt. Soap and detergents are cleaning agents. Disinfectants kill germs. Bleach, ordinary hydrogen peroxide, alcohols, iodophors a nd phenolics are disinfectants. Accelerated hydrogen peroxide and quaternary ammonium compounds (\"quats\") do both: they clean and disinfect at the same time. See Appendix 4 for more about the uses and limitations of these products. 13. Disinfectants chosen for use should: a)be effective against the germs normally found in the health care setting; b)be effective at room temperature and within a short time; c)be safe for the patients, cleaning staff and h ealth care workers (i.e., not toxic and low risk for irritant or allergic effects); and d) be safe for the environment. 13 See Appendix 4 for a list of options. The managers of each community h ealth facility will decide, but we recommend accelerated hydrogen peroxide 0.5% (or 7% diluted 1:16) as a general surface cleaner and disinf ectant in patient care areas. Accelerated hydrogen peroxide is more effective at killing germs than are qua ternary ammonium compounds (\"quats\"), and is easier and safer to use than bleach. We recomme nd bleach for disinfecting toys, dishes, drinking water coolers and laundry, and for additional sporicidal disinfection14 of emergency room washrooms and rooms contaminated with Clostridium difficile . If you choose to use a \"quat\" as your general su rface cleaner and disinfectant, this will be adequate for most purposes in patient care ar eas. However, \"quats\" are NOT strong enough to disinfect spills of blood, body flui ds, vomit or feces. For such spills, you would first need to clean (damp wipe or damp mop w ith the \"quat\" solution, then disinfect by damp wiping or damp mopping AGAIN with bleach (0.1% solution for blood or body fluids, 0.5% solution for vomit or feces). We suggest that it would be simpler to use accelerated hydrogen peroxide. 12 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 12. 13 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 13. 14 A sporicidal agent is effective at killing the spore forms of Clostridium difficile and related bacteria. 9 9 14. Cleaning agents and disinfectants must be labelled with Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (\"WHMIS\") information. A Mate rial Safety Data Sheet (\"MSDS\") must be readily available for each item in case of accidents. 15 15. Cleaning agents and disinfectants must be stored safely in storage rooms or closets. 16 16. If disinfectants are dispensed from bulk contai ners into smaller bottles, the bottles should be clean, dry, appropriately-s ized, and clearly labelled and dated. They should not be topped up or refilled. The bottles should be discarded when em ptied or after the expiry date, whichever comes sooner. 17 17. Personal protective equipment (for example: gl oves, masks, eye protection, gowns) must be: a)sufficient and accessible for all cleaning staff; b)worn as required by the Materials Safety Data Sheet when handling chemicals. 18 18. If the Materials Safety Data Sheet on a product says to flush or rinse eyes with water (if the product splashes into a worker's eyes), then th e workplace must have an eye-washing station, in working condition and accessible to all workers. 19 Hand hygiene for cleaning staff 19. Cleaning staff must be given hand hygiene education that includes: a) indications for hand hygiene; b) factors that influence hand hygiene; c)hand hygiene agents; d) hand hygiene techniques; and e)hand care to promote skin integrity. 20 The Housekeeping Lists, Guides and Personal Protection manual contains examples of hand hygiene education materials that cover the topics listed above. See: a)The Way You Clean Your Hands Matters! b)How to Wash Your Hands c)Washing Hands Works 20. Cleaning staff must follow best practices for hand hygiene (see the following points). 21 21. Choose hand hygiene products that are acceptable to the users; 22 if the workers won't use the product, then it cannot be effective. 15 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 40. 16 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 41. 17 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 43. 18 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 21. 19 BC Occupational Health and Safety Regula tion, Part 5, Sections 5.85 to 5.92: http://www2.worksafebc.com/Publications/OHSRegulation/Part5.asp#SectionNumber:5.85 20 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 45. 21 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 19. 22 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 17. 10 10 22. Choose hand hygiene products that are not irritating to the skin. 23 23. Avoid hand hygiene products that might damage gloves or affect the action of other hand hygiene or hand care products. 24 (Read the manufacturer's instructions and warnings.) 24. Use 70% to 90% alcohol-based hand rub to sanitize hands that are not visibly soiled 25 Non- alcoholic, waterless antiseptic agents are less eff ective than alcohol at killing germs, and should NOT be used. 26 Note : Alcohol-based hand rubs contain a mixtur e of ethanol and isopr opyl alcohol (\"rubbing alcohol\") and may be harmful if swallowed or rubbed wet into the eye. However, they are quite safe to use on skin. Read product labels, and have available the Materials Safety Data Sheet and the telephone number of the Poison Cont rol Centre, in case of an accident. 25. Bar soap should NOT be shared between individuals for hand washing\u2014doing this can spread germs. 27 26. Alcohol-based hand rub, soaps, and hand-mo isturizing lotions must be dispensed from disposable (single-use) disp ensers that deliver an appr opriate amount of the product. 28, 29 If more than two pumps are re quired, the dispenser is inadequate and should be replaced. Single-use dispensers must be discarded when empty; containers must not be \"topped-up\" or refilled. oA refillable dispenser can be used only if it has a disposable bag or cartridge that is replaced when empty (the bag or cartridge must not be topped-up or re-filled). Responsibility for maintaining product dispensers must be clearly defined. 30 27. Alcohol-based hand rub dispensers are for the us e of all clinic staff (including cleaners) and patients. 31 Put dispensers at patient care poin ts, at the entrance to the clinic area, and at the entrances to other areas where clinic staff go. DO NOT put alcohol-based hand rub dispensers in places where they might be exposed to open flames. 32 23 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 18. 24 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 19. 25 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 10. 26 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 16. 27 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 15. 28 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 13. 29 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 20. 30 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 14. 31 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 12. 32 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 42. 11 11 28. Hand washing sinks must be used only for hand washing. 33 Hands-free, freestanding models are best. Hand-operated taps are acceptable, as long as the user does not have to hold on to the tap to keep the water flowing, o,The user must be able to turn off the water without having to touch the taps with clean hands. 29. There should be enough hand washing sinks so that staff do not need to walk more than 6 metres (20 feet) to reach a sink. 34 30. Provide disposable pape r towels for drying hands. 35 The towel dispenser should be designed so that the user can pull out the paper towels without touching anything else. 36 31. A foot pedal-operated waste bin, with a waste bag, should be placed by each hand-washing sink. A waste container should be located near the exit door for disposal of the paper towel used to open the door. 37 32. If a hot-air hand dryer is used and paper towels are not provided, taps that turn off automatically or that can be turned off without using the hands are required 38 33. If hot-air hand dryers or sink controls based on electric-eye technology are used, there must be alternative hand washing facilities avai lable in case of elec trical power failure. 39 34. Cloth towels used to dry hands must be single-use. 40 35. To enable effective hand hygiene: nails must be kept clean and short; nail polish, if worn, must be fresh and free of cracks or chips; artificial nails or nail enha ncements must not be worn; avoid wearing rings; and hand and arm jewellery, including watches, must be removed or pushed up above the wrist before performing hand hygiene. 41 36. When sanitizing hands with alcohol-based ha nd rub, apply enough so that it will remain in contact with the hands for a minimum of 15 seconds before the product dries (usually one to two pumps is enough). 42 33 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 36. 34 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 37. 35 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 38. 36 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 39. 37 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, page 38. 38 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 40. 39 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 41. 40 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 23. 41 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 9. 42 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 21. 12 12 37. Wash hands with soap and water if there is visible soiling with dirt, blood, body fluids or other body substances. If hands are visibly so iled and running water is not available, use moistened towelettes to remove the visible soil , followed by sanitization with alcohol-based hand rub. 43 38. When washing hands with soap and water, r ub and lather all skin surfaces of the hands, fingers and wrists for at least 15 seconds before rinsing. 44 39. Dry hands using a method that does not re-contaminate the hands. 45 Disposable paper towels are the preferred me thod, if the towels can be pulled from the dispenser without touching anything else. 46 After drying hands, use the towels to turn o ff the taps. Do not touch the taps with clean hands. A hot-air hand dryer is acceptable, as long as you do not touch the taps with clean hands. 47 oIf you need to push a button to turn on the hot-air hand dryer, use your elbow or shoulder. If cloth towels are used to dry ha nds, they must be used only once each. 48 If there is an exit door, open the door with the towels. Do not touch the taps or the door hardware with clean hands. 40. Dry hands completely before putting on gloves. 49 41. Do not use alcohol-based hand rub immediately after washing hands with soap and water. 50 It is not necessary, and may cause exce ssive drying and irritation of the skin. 42. Provide staff with hand moisturizing lotions and encourage regul ar frequent use, to prevent excessive drying and irritation of skin associated with frequent hand washing. 51, 52 Put hand lotion dispensers beside hand washing sinks. 43. Supervisors should monitor the staff's co mpliance with the hand hygiene program, and provide timely feedback, by using a reliable, vali dated observer audit tool and training process. 53 An example of such a tool is the Hand Hygiene Observation and Analysis Tool , which can be found on the web page Just Clean Your Hands for long-term care and retirement homes\u2014Tools for implementation , http://www.oahpp.ca/se rvices/jcyh/ltch-implementation.html . 43 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 11. 44 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 22. 45 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 38. 46 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 39. 47 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 40. 48 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 23. 49 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 24. 50 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 25. 51 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 7. 52 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 5. 53 Best Practices for Hand Hygiene, Recommendation 47. 13 13 Personal protective equipment (PPE) for cleaning staff 44. Personal protective equipment (PPE) must be: a)sufficient and accessible for all cleaning staff; b) worn as required for infection prevention and control; and c)removed immediately and disposed of appropr iately, after the infection prevention and control task for which it is worn. 54 45. Wear gloves if hands will be in contact with a)mucous membranes, (i.e., the lining of the mouth, throat, nose, eye, vagina, rectum, or urethra) b)non-intact skin, (i.e., skin that is broken and oozing blood or fluid) c)body tissues, d) blood, body fluids, secretions, e) excreta, or f)equipment or surfaces contaminated with any of the above. 55 46. Select gloves that fit well and are sufficiently durable for the task. 56 47. Put on gloves just before the task or procedure that requires them. 57 48. On leaving each patient care room, staff must remove gloves and sanitize or wash hands. Gloves must not be worn when walking from room to room or to other areas of the health care facility. 58 49. Single-use disposable gloves shou ld not be re-used or washed. 59 50. Wear a gown if a procedure or activity is likely to cause splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, or excreta. 60 51. Remove the gown immediately after the task fo r which it has been used. Avoid shaking the gown or contaminating skin or clothing by touching the outside of the gown. 61 52. Wear a mask and eye protection if a procedure or activity is likely to ca use splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secr etions or excreta. 62 54 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 21. 55 Routine Practices and Additional Precautions, Recommendation 10. 56 Routine Practices and Additional Precautions, Recommendation 12. 57 Routine Practices and Additional Precautions, Recommendation 13. 58 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 22. 59 Routine Practices and Additional Precautions, Recommendation 17. 60 Routine Practices and Additional Precautions, Recommendation 18. 61 Routine Practices and Additional Precautions, Recommendation 19. 62 Routine Practices and Additional Precautions, Recommendation 20. 14 14 53. Wear a mask and eye protection within 2 metres (6 feet) of a patient on Droplet Precautions.63 These are a set of additional measures used in the care of patients with infections that can be spread by large respiratory droplets. 54. Staff may not enter an airborne isolation room occupied by a pa tient with active tuberculosis unless they wear an N95 respirator. 64 55. Staff may not enter the room of a patient with measles, varicella (c hicken pox) or zoster (shingles) unless they wear an N95 respirator, or they are immune (by previous infection or vaccination). 65 56. During an influenza pandemic: Wear a face shield (or a mask and eye protec tion), gloves and gown when working within 2 metres (6 feet) of a patient with influen za (or someone with influenza-like symptoms). Wear an N95 respirator, eye protection, gloves and gown when working within 2 metres of a patient with influenza (or someone with in fluenza-like illness symptoms) who is coughing forcefully, and is unable or unwilling to cover up by e.g., coughing or sneezing into sleeve, using tissues, or wearing a mask. 66 57. During an outbreak or a suspected case of gastrointestinal infection (infectious diarrhea), wear a face shield (or a mask and eye protection), gloves a nd gown when cleaning an area obviously contaminated with vomit or feces. 67 Management of cleaning services and staff 58. Each health care facility must have polic ies and procedures to ensure that cleaning: a)takes place on a continuous and scheduled basis; b) incorporates principles of infection prevention and control; c)clearly defines cleaning responsibilities and scope; and d)meets all statutory requirements Allowance should be made for surge capacity during outbreaks. 68 59. Adequate resources must be devoted to housekeeping staff services. These should include: a) a single individual with assigned responsibility for the care of the physi cal facility; b) written procedures for cleaning and disinfection of patient care ar eas and equipment that include: i.defined responsibility for specific items and areas; ii.procedures for daily and terminal cleaning (\" terminal\" means cleaning that occurs after the patient leaves the room and before the next patient enters), see Housekeeping Manual ; 63 Routine Practices and Additional Precautions, Recommendation 49. 64 Routine Practices and Additional Precautions, Recommendation 54. 65 Routine Practices and Additional Precautions, Recommendation 55. 66 Prevention and Control of Influenza During a Pandemic, p41, 42. 67 Gastrointestinal Infection Outbreak Guidelines, p13. 68 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 20. 15 15 iii.procedures for cleaning in construction/renovation areas; iv.additional procedures with vancomycin- Resistant Enterococcus or C. difficile (see Housekeeping Manual ); v.additional cleaning procedures for outbreaks of gastrointestinal diseas e (infectious diarrhea) and pandemic influenza (see Housekeeping Manual ); vi.cleaning standards and frequency (see Appendix 1 and Appendix 5 ); vii.procedures for cleaning and disinfecting after spi lls of blood, body fluids, vomit or feces (see Housekeeping Manual ); c) adequate human resources to allow thorough and timely cleaning; d) training and continuing e ducation of cleaning staff; e) monitoring of environmental cleanliness (see Appendix 2 and Appendix 3 ); and f) ongoing review of procedures. 69 60. If housekeeping staff services are contracted out, the occupational health and safety policies of the contracting services must be consistent w ith the facility's occupational health and safety policies. 70 61. Cleaning schedules should be developed, with frequency of cleaning reflecting whether surfaces are high-touch or low-touch, the type of activity taking place in the area and the infection risk associated with it, the vulnerability of the patients in the area, and the probability of contamination. See Appendix 1 for instructions on how to dete rmine the appropriate level and frequency of cleaning for an area. 71 62. Non-critical medical equipment (items that touch intact skin, for example: blood pressure cuffs and stethoscopes) requires cl eaning and disinfection at the le vel and frequency specified in Appendix 5 . In most cases, this means after each patient. 72 This also applies to equipment items that are taken from the health care facility and used off-site. 63. Cleaning and disinfection of non-critical medical equipment should be done as soon as possible after items have been used. 73 This also applies to equipment items that are taken from the health care facility and used off-site. 64. Each health care facility should have written policies and procedures for the appropriate cleaning of non-critical medical equipment that clearly defines the frequency and level of cleaning (see Appendix 5 ) and which assigns respons ibility for the cleaning. 74 65. Areas that have toys mu st have policies and procedures for cleaning the toys. 75 a)After each use, clean, disinfect and rinse thor oughly toys that may be 'mouthed' (infant and toddler toys). 69 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 24. 70 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 25. 71 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 27. 72 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 28 and 70. 73 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 11. 74 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 29. 75 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 69. 16 16 b) Clean and disinfect all other shared toys da ily and when visibly soiled. This includes high-touch surfaces of shared electronic games (e.g., keyboards, joysticks), high-touch surfaces of playhouses/climbers/rocking horse s, and high-touch surfaces in playrooms (e.g., tables, chairs, doorknobs). c)The preferred cleaning and disi nfection method is total immers ion: wash in hot water and detergent, then disinfect by soaking for 10 minutes in bleach 0.1% (5% to 8% concentrated bleach, diluted 1:50 with water). Washing toys in a dishwashing machine, using detergent with bleach in it, is also a good method. d)Electronic toys and toys too large to be immersed should be damp wiped with surface cleaner/disinfectant solution. e)Discard shared books, magazines, puzzles, cards and comics when visibly soiled. f)Clean on a regular schedule: toy storage bins /boxes/cupboards/shelves, and all surfaces of playhouses/climbers. 66. During construction and renovations, the health care facility must ha ve a plan to deal with the containment and transport of construction materi als, as well as clearly defined roles and expectations of cleaning staff a nd construction staff related to cleaning of the construction site and adjacent areas. 76 Responsibility for cleaning, and the expected level of cleaning of the job site and adjacent areas during construction must be stat ed in the contract with the builder/renovator. Construction workers are expected to remove gross soil, dust and dirt, construction materials and workplace hazards within the construction zone. This includes: i.sweeping floors to remove debris, ii.vacuuming walk-off mats, iii.replacing 'sticky' mats, iv.removing large pieces of drywall, wiring, etc., and v.wiping work surfaces clean. These are to be done at the end of the day, or mo re often if needed, to reduce dust. A clear plan for transportation of construction materials\u2014avoiding care areas as much as possible\u2014must be established and followed. The health care facility cleaning staff will continue regular cleaning and disinfection while cons truction is in progress. 67. The health care facility must have a plan in place to deal with a flood. 77 In the event of a flood (e.g., overflow from a wa shing machine, dishwasher, toilet, sewer), evacuate the area, contain the flood if possible, and protect equipment w ith plastic sheeting or move if possible. The area must be assessed immediately to determine the risk of contamination. All staff should assume that the water is contaminated until its source is determined. If the floodwater is contaminated with harmful b acteria (e.g., sewer or to ilet overflow) the area should be cordoned off until cleaning and disinfection are completed. Disinfect all equipment and furniture before moving it out of the flood area. Assess the long-term risk of mould from wet materials, drywall and furnishings. 76 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 52. 77 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 53. 17 17 Carpeting that remains wet after 72 hours is likely to have mould, and must be removed. If the flooding involves a food preparation area, all food products that have come into contact with floodwater must be discarded and Environmental Health officers (First Nations and Inuit Health) must be notified. If vaccine refrigerators are involved in a flood, or if flooding leads to a power failure that may have compromised vaccine refrigeration, contact your local public health unit to find out whether the vaccines are still usable. 68. The health care facility must pr ovide the cleaning staff with a training program that includes: a) a written curriculum; b)orientation; c) assessment of proficiency; d) documentation of training and proficiency verification; and e)continuing education and performance monitoring. 78 69. Infection prevention and control education provided to cleaning staff must include: a)hand hygiene and basic personal hygiene; b)appropriate and correct us e and disposal of PPE; c)special cleaning procedures for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus gastrointestinal disease (infectious diarrh ea), and pandemic influenza; d) prevention of blood and body fluid exposures; e)safe handling and disposal of used sharps (e.g., needles, lancets, scalpel blades). 79 70. Housekeeping staff services managers and supe rvisors must attend a course directly related to health care housekeeping, and obtain cer tification within a r ecognized association. 80 71. Housekeeping staff services managers and supervisors should par ticipate in relevant workplace committees, e.g., infection prevention and control, occupational health and safety, and emergency response. 72. There should be a process to measure the quality of cleaning in the health care setting. 81 Routine monitoring (by Visual Assessm ent of Cleanliness, see Appendix 2 ) should take place immediately after cleaning, to en sure that cleaning has been carried out correctly and to an appropriate standard. Use checklists and audit tools (see Appendix 3 ) to monitor and document cleaning and disinfection, and to provide feedback to cleaning staff. Auditing (by direct observation of the cleaner as she works) should be done periodically, when training new cleaning staff, and when cleaning methods or procedures change. 78 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 56. 79 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommenda tion 57, Routine Practices and Additional Precautions, Recommendation 58. 80 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 58. 81 Best Practices for Environmen tal Cleaning, Recommendation 59. 18 18 73. In patient care areas, auditing should also include objective measurement of cleanliness, using at least one of the following tools: re sidual bio-burden or environmental marking. 82 The residual bio-burden test de tects living bacteria, body fluids and other organic materials by making them glow, using chemicals from firef lies. The test measures the amount of glow in a sample and indicates how mu ch contamination is present. Environmental marking uses a clear liquid that glows in ultraviolet light (fluorescence). The liquid is painted onto surfaces before cleaning. When the cleaning is completed, the surfaces are inspected with a handheld ultraviolet lam p. Any of the fluorescent liquid that was not removed by cleaning will glow, sh owing areas that were not pr operly cleaned. This result is then measured by either calculating the percen tage of marked objects/surfaces that were cleaned in a particular room or area; or by giving a cleaning score (e.g., 3 = heavy fluorescence, 2 = moderate fluorescence, 1 = light fluorescence, 0 = no fluorescence). 74. Results of cleaning audits shou ld be recorded and analysed. Feedback can then be given to staff, and action taken to correct deficiencies. 83 75. Housekeeping staff must be offered appropriat e immunizations: annual (seasonal) influenza, pandemic influenza, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), varicella, tetanus, hepatitis B and pertussis vaccines. 84 76. The health care facility must have a program to deal with sharps injuries and other exposures of clinic staff (including cleaning staff) to blood and body fluids. 85 The program will include: a.)identification of exposed staff; b.)provision of immediate first aid and medical attention86 c.)assessment and immunization history; d.) post-exposure preventative treatment and follow-up including: i. collection and analysis of blood specimens from the exposed staff; and ii. prompt administration of any indicat ed vaccines, antibodies, or drugs; e.)documentation of the incident and re porting of injuries to WorkSafeBC; f.)policies and procedures to deal with spills of blood or body fluids; and g.) g) education of staff to improve practices and prevent recurrence of such events. 77. The health care facility must have a respirat ory protection program fo r staff that will be required to wear an N95 respirator (for example, when entering an airborne infection isolation room containing a patient with active t uberculosis). The program must include: a) a health assessment; b) N95 respirator fit-testing; and c) training which includes the following items: i. how to select a respirator for which you have been fit-tested, 82 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 60. 83 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 61. 84 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 62. 85 Routine Practices and Additional Precautions, Recommendation 59. 86 WorkSafeBC. Controlling exposure: Protecting Workers from Infectious Disease 19 19 ii. the need to perform a seal-check each time a respirator is applied, iii. how to perform a seal-check, iv. the need to change respir ator if wet or soiled, v. how to remove and discard the respirator correctly, vi. the need to sanitize or wash hands after removing the respirator, and vii. to NEVER put an N95 respirator on a patient.87 (The patient puts it on him- or herself. It is dangerous for you to get so close to a patient's face.) 78. Management must have a clear policy that sta ff do not come into work when acutely ill with a probable infection or symptoms of an infec tion (e.g., fever, cough, 'common cold', 'flu-like' symptoms, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, or discharge from eyes). 88 79. There must be a procedure for the medical evaluation of staff with symptoms of allergy or irritation from chemicals used in cleaning. 89 Laundry 80. Protection of staff in laundry areas includes: 90 a)training of all cleaning and laundr y staff in procedures for handling of soiled linen, including infection prevention and control and WHMIS; b)a dedicated hand washing sink should be r eadily available in the laundry area; c)appropriate PPE (gloves, gown and face protection) are available and are used to protect staff from splashes of blood, body fluids, vomit or feces when handling soiled linen; d)hand hygiene immediately after removing gloves and when gloves are changed; e)disposal of sharps at the point -of-use to ensure that there are no unexpected sharp objects in linen that might injure laundry staff ; and f)immunization of laundry staff against hepatitis B. 81. Clean and dirty laundry mu st be clearly separated. 91 82. Develop policies and procedures to ensure th at clean laundry is packaged, transported and stored in a way that will protect it from dust and dirt. 92 83. Designate areas for storing clean linen. 93 84. Routine laundering practices can be used for laundering all linens 94 (bleach and hot air drying will disinfect linen s that have been contaminated with any kind of infectious material). Routine laundering practices 95 include: 87 Routine Practices and Additional Precautions, Recommendation 60. 88 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 64. 89 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 65. 90 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, p47. 91 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 31. 92 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 32. 93 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 33. 94 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 34. 95 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, p46-47. 20 20 a)Use and maintain laundry equipment accord ing to manufacturers' instructions. b) Bag or otherwise contain contaminat ed laundry at the point-of-care. c)Do not sort or rinse contaminated laundry in patient care areas. d) Bag personal laundry separately at the point of collection, then launde r separately, or let family members take it away for washing. e)Avoid agitating contaminated laundry to avoid contamination of the air, surfaces and persons. Rolling the laundry up can help. f)Contain wet laundry before placing in the laundry bag (e.g., wrap in a dry sheet or towel). g) Laundry carts or hampers used to collect or tr ansport soiled linen need not be covered. h)Tie linen bags securely and do not over-fill them. i)If laundry chutes are used, ensu re that they are properly desi gned and maintained, and used in a way that dust and particles are no t forced out of contaminated laundry: i)ensure that laundry bags are securely bagged and tightly closed before placing the filled bag into the chute; ii)do not place loose items in the chute; iii)laundry chutes should be maintained under negative pressure and should discharge into the soiled linen collection area; and iv)laundry chutes should be cleaned on a regular basis; j)Establish a procedure for sorting laundry (i.e., before or after washing). k) Before washing, remove any large amounts of soil (e.g., vomit, feces, blood or body fluids) by a suitable method: i)remove with a gloved hand and dispose into a toilet or hopper; or ii)pre-soak in water, then discard the soaking water; iii)DO NOT remove gross soil by spraying with water. l)Wash heavily soiled items separately. m)Laundry may be washed in cold water, using a detergent formulated for cold water (follow the manufacturer's instructions). n)If a cold-water detergent is not used, wash laundry in hot water, at a temperature of at least 71\u00b0C (160\u00b0F). o)Wash laundry using detergent that contains bleach (added by the manufacturer, check the product label.) If the detergent does not contai n bleach, then add 180 mL (3/4 of a cup) of concentrated (5% to 8%) bleach into each washer load. Pour bleach into water, not directly onto fabrics. p)DO NOT use \"bleach alternatives\"\u2014they do not kill germs as bleach does. q)Wash cloth linen bags after each use; this can be done in the same cycle as the linen that was in them. r)Dry laundry with hot air, in a drying machine. Biomedical waste 85. Develop written policies and procedures for the collection, handling, storage, transport and disposal of biomedical waste, including sharps, based on provincial and municipal regulations and legislation. 96 96 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, Recommendation 35. 21 21 In British Columbia, the following types of wastes from community clinics are regulated97: Anatomical waste: Tissues, organs and body parts (not including teeth, hair and nails). These must be packaged in a sealed, leak-p roof container, colour-coded RED, and kept refrigerated or frozen until disposal. Anatomi cal waste must never be kept longer than one week. Non-anatomical biomedical waste: Human liquid blood and semi- liquid blood and blood products. Bandages, paper towels and other items so aked enough blood that they would drip if compressed. Body fluids (not including urine and feces). Sharps, including needles, needles a ttached to syringes, and blades. Broken glass or other material capable of causing punctures or cuts, if contaminated with human blood or body fluids. These must be packaged in a leak-proof container, colour-coded YELLOW. Containers for sharps must also be puncture-resistant. Both types of regulated biomedical wastes must be transported to an approved waste disposal facility for incineration, or for tr eatment (autoclaving, or sporicidal98 chemical disinfection) before disposal in a landfill.99 Hazardous waste chemicals: Discarded unused concentrated cleaning and disinfecting chemicals are \"hazardous waste\", but they are not subject to re gulation if disposed of in amounts less than 5 kilograms or 5 litres in a 30-day period. 100 Amounts over this limit must be taken to an approved waste disposal facility (contact HazWaste BC 101 for a list). Smaller amounts of expired chemicals (less than 5 litres in a 30-day pe riod) may be poured down the drain. 86. Handlers of biomedical waste (including laundry staff) must wear PPE appropriate to the risk. 102 87. Non-immunized handlers of biomedical waste (including laundry sta ff) must be offered hepatitis B immunization. 103 97 Guidelines for Infection Control in the Physician's Office, p22. 98 A sporicidal agent is effective at killing the spore forms of Clostridium difficile and related bacteria. 99 Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning, p49. 100 Environmental Management Act, Hazardous Waste Regulation (B.C.

Aerosol or trigger sprays for cleaning chemicals should not be used, because they may cause eye injuries or respiratory problems. 113 Note : We say \"should not\" because we recognize that some people will not want to give up the convenience of using a spray bottle to apply glass cleaner or t ub and tile cleaner. However, disinfectant solutions must NEVER be sprayed on to surfaces. Wet a cloth with the disinfectant solution, and damp wipe as described in the Housekeeping Manual.) 98. Choose ergonomically designed cleaning equipment, 114 such as .buckets, mops and other materials. Products that are light er in weight, easily emptied and have proper handle length help to reduce the risk of inju ry during repetitive work. 99. Emergency room/urgent care bathrooms should: a)be cleaned at least every four hours; b)after cleaning, preferably be disinfec ted (damp wipe and wet mop) with a sporicidal agent; particularly if there is a risk of C. difficile contamination .

Level of cleaning a) 'Hotel Clean' applies to areas of the health care facility that are not used for patient care: this includes public ar eas such as lobbies, corridors, el evators and stairwells, offices, meeting rooms and service areas. Hotel Clean includes dust and dirt removal from floors, windows and surfaces, and waste disposal. Components of 'Hotel Clean' Floors and baseboards are free of stains , visible dust, spills and streaks. Walls, ceilings and doors are free of visible dus t, gross soil, streaks, spider webs and handprints. All horizontal surfaces are free of visible dust or streaks (incl udes furniture, window ledges, overhead lights, phones, picture frames, carpets etc.) Bathroom fixtures including toilets, sinks, tubs and shower s are free of streaks, soil, stains and soap scum. Mirrors and windows are fr ee of dust and streaks. Dispensers are free of dust, soiling and re sidue and replaced/replenished when empty. Appliances are free of dust, soiling and stains. Waste is disposed of appropriately. Items that are broken, torn, crack ed or malfunctioning are replaced. b) 'Hospital Clean' applies to areas of the health care facility that are used for patient care : this includes: washrooms, waiting rooms and dining rooms used by patients, procedure rooms, examination rooms, diagnostic and treatment areas, equipment reprocessing (sterilization) areas, sterile supplies storage a nd clean utility rooms, laundry room, clean linen storage rooms, pharmacy, laboratory, food preparation areas. Components of 'Hospital Clean' Hotel Clean, plus: High-touch surfaces in patient care areas ar e cleaned and disinfected with a hospital- grade disinfectant (see Appendix 4 ), Non-critical medical equipment is cleaned and disinfected between patients, and Cleaning practices are periodically monitored and audited with feedba ck and education to staff. 27 26 B. Frequency of cleaning Assign a score to each area or room of the hea lth care facility, accordi ng to the following three factors. 1) Probability of contamination Heavy Contamination (score = 3) An area is designated as being heavily contaminat ed if surfaces and/or equipment are routinely exposed to fresh blood or other body fluids (e .g., birthing suite, autopsy suite, haemodialysis station, emergency room, dental procedure r oom, patient washroom if visibly soiled). Moderate Contamination (score = 2) An area is designated as being moderately cont aminated if surfaces and/or equipment do not routinely (but may) become contaminated with blood or other body fluids and the contaminated substances are contained or removed (e.g. wet sheets). All patient care areas are at least moderately contaminated . Light Contamination (score = 1) An area is designated as being lightly contaminat ed if surfaces are not exposed to blood, other body fluids or items that have come into contac t with blood or body fluids (i.e., non-patient care areas). 2) Vulnerability of patients to infection More Susceptible (score = 1) \"More susceptible\" patients have medical conditions that impair the func tioning of their immune systems: for example, oncology, transplant and ch emotherapy patients, newborns who are ill or premature, and those who have severe burns requiring care in a burn unit. Less Susceptible (score = 0) All other patients and areas are cl assified as \"less susceptible\". 3) Potential for exposure High-touch surfaces (score = 3) High-touch surfaces are those that have fre quent contact with hands. Examples include doorknobs, telephones, call bells, bedrails, light switc hes, wall areas around the toilet and edges of privacy curtains. Low-touch surfaces (score = 1) Low-touch surfaces are those that have little contact with hands. Examples include walls, ceilings, mirrors and windowsills. 28 27 For each area or room, add up the scores and determine the cleaning frequency according to the following chart. Total Risk Score Risk Type Minimum Cleaning Frequency 7 High risk Clean after each case/ event/procedure and at least twice per day; clean additionally as required. 4 to 6 Moderate risk Clean at least on ce daily; clean additionally as required (e.g., when visibly dirty). 2 to 3 Low risk Clean according to a fixed schedule; clean additionally as required (e.g., when visibly dirty). 29 28 C.

In order to be valid and reliable, Visual Assessment must be quantified , and it must be judged according to an objective standard . Quantification of Visual Assessment T echniques Example: 25 items inspected Record a site as clean if dust and debris are absent Clean = 20 items Record a site as dirty if any of thes e indicators are pres ent Dirty = 5 items Calculate the cleaning rate as a percen tage Cleaning Rate = 80% of items For Hospital Clean, the passing score should be a cleaning rate of 100%. For Hotel Clean, 80% is acceptable.

ironmental-cleaning-for-prevention-and-control-of-infections.html . 43 41 Appendix 3: Sample Cleaning Checklist and Audit Tool How to use : Auditing is done by supervisors to train cleaning staff and to improve the quality of cleaning. Make an audit list for each room or area. Modify the sample list so that it includes all surfaces, fixtures, equipment and furnishings in th e room. The tool may be used for any type of auditing: (visual assessment of cleanliness, dire ct observation of cleani ng, residual bio-burden, or environmental marking.) Scoring: All observed criteria should be marked either 'Yes', 'No' or 'Not Applicable'. It is not acceptable to enter a 'Not Applicable' respon se where an improvement may be achieved. Visual assessment of cleanliness: mark \"Yes \" if item appears clean, \"No\" if not clean, Direct observation of cleaning: mark \"Yes\" if the worker was observed cleaning the item using the correct procedure, \"No\" if missed, incomplete, or incorrect procedure, Residual bio-burden: mark \"No\" if residual biological matter was detected on the item, \"Yes\" if none detected, Environmental marking: mark \"No\" if residual fluorescent dye was detected on the item, \"Yes\" if none detected. Calculation of Compliance: (Total number of 'Yes' responses) / (Total number of 'Yes' and 'No' responses) x 100% = compliance %. If more than one area has been audited, the total scores can be added together and divided by the number of areas included to calculate the overall average compliance rate.

Cleaning means physical removal of soil, dust and foreign material. Chemical, thermal, or mechanical aids may be used. Items must be we ll-cleaned before disinfection. The following are good cleaners: Accelerated hydrogen peroxide 0.5% Quaternary ammonium compounds Enzymatic cleaners Soap and water Detergents Follow the manufacturers' instructions re garding concentration and contact time. Low-level disinfection kills most bacteria, fungi and viruse s. However, low-level disinfectants usually will not kill mycobacteria (e.g., tuberculosis) or bacterial spores (e.g., C. difficile ). Good low-level disinfectants include: Accelerated hydrogen peroxide 0.5% (5 minutes contact time) Hydrogen peroxide 3% (30 minutes contact time) Alcohol 70-95% (10 minutes) Bleach 0.1% (Bleach 5% concentrate, diluted 1:50; 5 minutes) Quaternary ammonium compounds Iodophors Phenolics (should not be used in nurseries or on equipment that comes into contact with infants) Follow the manufacturers' instructions re garding concentration and contact time.
