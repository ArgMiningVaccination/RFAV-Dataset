This development, discovered over a 20-year period through chemistry and the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine, may help medicinal chemists and drug manufacturers identify new drug leads and predict their potential side effects.

Nai-Yi Wang is a Ph.D. organic chemist with a 35-year career in teaching and research at universities and in the pharmaceutical industry. He holds more than 20 patents in synthetic organic chemistry, natural product synthesis, and biotechnology. His research has focused on cardiovascular drugs discovery, anticancer compounds syntheses, and the development of immunoassays.
