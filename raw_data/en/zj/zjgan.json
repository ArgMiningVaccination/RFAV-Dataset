Vitamin K occurs in 3 main forms: K1 (phylloquinone), derived from foods such as green leafy vegetables, K2 (menaquinone) which originates from bacteria; a third form, K3 (menadione), is a synthetic analogue. Numerous studies have shown that vitamin K2 is the more bioavailable form of the nutrient, and more powerfully influences bone building than K1. There are two forms of vitamin K2 commonly used in supplements: MK-4 and MK-7. The MK-7 form has been shown to have six times the activity of MK-4 in the blood. MK-7 has also been found to remain in the blood approximately nine times as long as the MK-4 (8 hours versus 72 hours), making it the optimal form of K2 for health. A growing body of research shows that when it comes to bone health, ensuring optimal intake of vitamin K is a critical piece of the puzzle. New research is focusing on the synergistic relationship between vitamin K (specifically, vitamin K2) and vitamin D3, especially in terms of bone strength and cardiovascular health. Through its activation of the protein osteocalcin, vitamin K helps to bind newly absorbed calcium to the mineral matrix in bone. In addition, vitamin K has been found to help maintain bone mineral density by decreasing the activity of osteoclasts, a cell that breaks down the bone matrix. Thus, vitamin K and vitamin D not only share similar qualities, but also act synergistically with one another within the body. The Vitamin K2 with D3 formula includes 45 mcg of vitamin K2 delivered as MK-7 and 5,000 IU of vitamin D3 per capsule, for optimal absorption by the body.$32.00 - [Peak For Her](/products/peak-90-caps) 90 CapsulesCategories: Achieving optimal health in women requires thoughtful consideration of the multiple pathways that must be in balance for a woman to feel her best.

CoQ10 is abundant in the mitochondrial membrane and plays an important role in the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a molecule of chemical energy upon which all cellular functions depend. The synthesis of ATP within the mitochondria is a multi-step series of biochemical reactions called the electron transport chain. As a coenzyme, CoQ10 is required for several enzymatic reactions required to produce cellular energy and to protect the body against free radicals produced during this process. To maintain energy production, mitochondrial CoQ10 is continuously recycled from ubiquinone, its ATP production state, to ubiquinol, its antioxidant state. After the age of 35 to 40 years, endogenous synthesis of CoQ10 begins to decline.CoQ10, an essential component of cellular energy production, has been shown to extend cell life and benefit high-energy systems, namely the cardiovascular, neurological, and immune systems. Supplementation with a highly concentrated, oil-based CoQ10 enables faster recovery of CoQ10 levels for those that have increased CoQ10 requirements including those with drug-induced depletion, increasing age, or increased tissue demands. The CoQ-10 300 mg formulation is highly concentrated for those that need to quickly and effectively increase levels of CoQ10. CoQ10 300mg is delivered in a proprietary oil-based formulation and includes natural vitamin E for enhanced absorption "}
