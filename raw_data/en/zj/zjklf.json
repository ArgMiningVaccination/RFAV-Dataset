The University is informed and inspired by its Baptist heritage and three basic theological and biblical presuppositions: learning is appointed and conserved by God as essential to the fulfillment of human destiny; in Christ all things consist and find ultimate unity; and the Kingdom of God in this world is rooted and grounded in Christian community. The University embraces the conviction that there is no conflict between the life of faith and the life of inquiry. To fulfill its mission, the University: presents a worldview informed by Christian principles and perspectives; affirms that truth is revelatory and transcendent as well as empirical and rational, and that all truth finds its unity in Jesus Christ; influences development of moral courage, social sensitivity, and ethical responsibility; gathers a diverse community of learners; delivers academic instruction in the liberal arts and sciences and professional preparation at both undergraduate and graduate levels through traditional, extended campus, and online programs; transfers to students the vast body of knowledge and values accumulated over the ages; encourages students to think critically and creatively; fosters the development of intellectual vitality, physical wellness, and aesthetic sensibility: forges a community of learning that is committed to the pursuit, discovery, and dissemination of knowledge; provides students with servant leadership opportunities; cooperates with other educational institutions to expand learning opportunities for students; offers service and other opportunities to the greater community through athletics, continuing education, and cultural enrichment programming.College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences The mission of Campbell University College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS) is to educate students in a Christian environment to be health care professionals who will function effectively as a part of an interdisciplinary team of health care providers to meet existing and future health care needs and who will provide leadership to their profession and professional organizations. History On January 5, 1887, James Archibald Campbell\u2014a 26-year-old Baptist minister\u2014 welcomed 16 students to a small church in Buies Creek, North Carolina, for the first day of classes, thus marking the founding of Buies Creek Academy. From that humble beginning, Buies Creek Academy evolved to become Campbell Junior College (1926), Campbell College (1961), and Campbell University (1979). Throughout these transformations, the institution has remained true to its founding principles to address the most pressing needs of North Carolina and to educate men and women for Christian service and leadership around the world. The University enjoys an autonomous and voluntary relationship with the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina. The founding principles still guide Campbell University today. In 2013, Campbell launched the Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine, North Carolina's first new medical school in over 35 years. In August 2016, the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing\u2014housed within the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences\u2014welcomed its first cohort. Simultaneously, Campbell opened its School of Engineering, which was only the second engineering school at a private university in North Carolina. They joined Campbell's other established colleges and schools: the College of Arts & Sciences, the Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law (1976), the Lundy-Fetterman School of Business (1983), the School of Education (1985), the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (1985), and the Divinity School (1996). In addition to its main campus in Buies Creek, Campbell University has off- campus instructional sites in Camp Lejeune (Jacksonville), Fort Bragg & Pope (Fayetteville), Raleigh (2009 relocation of the law school), Tunku Abdul Rahman 2 | 2019-2020 Ac Ademic BulletinUniversity College (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia), and a vibrant online presence through Campbell Online. Today, Campbell University enrolls approximately 7,000 students per year, including more than 5,000 undergraduate and graduate students on its main campus. More than 100 degree programs in the liberal arts, health sciences, fine arts, and professions are offered to them, continuing Campbell's tradition of preparing students for purposeful lives and meaningful service.

In order to mitigate risk, limit liabilities and protect the safety and well-being of patients and research subjects, criminal background checks (CBCs) and substance abuse screening tests (SASTs) have evolved into required components of the employment and educational processes at most health care facilities and research and development organizations for employees and learners. Additionally, CBCs and SASTs may be required prior to licensure to practice and maybe required for currently licensed health care professionals as defined by the associated regulatory boards. CPHS is being required to attest that CBCs and SASTs, plus other requirements (e.g. CPR, HIPAA compliance, health insurance, immunizations, etc.) have been completed prior to health professions students (nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and physician assistant) being allowed to engage in experiential training at the clinical education sites. Also, many sites for the BSCR and BSPS internships have such requirements. As a result of these risk management movements in the healthcare industry, these required screens have become an important part of the process for matriculation of candidates seeking degrees in the CPHS undergraduate and professional degree programs. If accepted applicants or current students in CPHS programs are not eligible for entry to the appropriate training sites in order to perform the mandatory experiential component(s) as required to complete their degree, then they are not eligible for matriculation at entry and/ or progression through their designated program. Individuals in the graduate clinical research, pharmaceutical sciences or public health programs may be subject to CBCs, SASTs or similar aforementioned requirement as a component of any current or future required or elective experiential trainings. Beginning in the academic year 2016-2017, the cost of all CBCs and SASTs became the responsibility of the individual accepted applicant/current student in the specified Campbell University CPHS program. Prior to students being permitted to participate in experiential education courses (clerkships, internships, etc.), they must submit to updated CBCs and SASTs. Individuals who: do not consent to the required screening (CBC, SAST, etc.) refuse to provide information necessary to conduct these screens in required time frame provide false or misleading information in regard to the CBC and SAST attempt to manipulate body fluid samples in the screening process complete the screening obligation in a timely manner and by the required deadlines may lose their status of good standing and will be referred to the appropriate CPHS committee for actions as related to professional behaviors. Sanctions may include loss of eligibility: to receive university scholarships to hold leadership positions to receive CPHS funding for professional meetings to participate in experiential education activities and are subject to sanction up to and including dismissal from the college in accordance with CHPS policies. Information from the updated CBCs and SASTs are kept as confidential as possible and are retained in a file separate from other educational and academic records. Information will be shared with the CPHS Experiential Education Committee, the Associate Dean for Admissions & Student Affairs and with clinical education sites if there is a need to determine the acceptability of a student to the site. Additional Considerations Admitted students cannot refuse assignment to a particular experiential site because they do not wish to submit to further substance abuse testing or criminal background checks required by the site. The designated experiential faculty member will evaluate alternate placement options and feasibility for any CPHS student who is refused admission to a training site, or who is asked to leave a site because of information discovered through the screening process for experiential training (CBC, SAST, or other background requirement). However, no guarantee of alternate placement can be made. CPHS does not accept responsibility to continually seek educational training sites who will accept CPHS students previously denied access to any assigned site. CPHS does not accept responsibility for any student being ineligible for coursework, training, continued enrollment in the college, or subsequent licensure for any reason, including failure to pass a CBC and/ or SAST regardless of whether or not the student has participated in a corrective action plan attempting to make them acceptable to experiential education training sites. Criminal Background Check Policy for Campbell University Health Programs CPHS requires criminal background checks (CBCs) of all nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and physician assistant program applicants who earn acceptance into their respective health programs prior to matriculation. Current and BS in Pharmaceutical Sciences programs may be required to have a CBC, prior to matriculating into the mandatory senior internship. Currently, applicants and students enrolled in the MS in Clinical Research, MS in Pharmaceutical Sciences and MS in Public Health degree programs are not required to complete CBCs; however, CPHS graduate students who participate in any experiential training experience, required or elective, may be subject to a CBC as part of the process for entrance to the training site. Accepted applicants to any of the aforementioned CPHS degree programs will be notified of the background check requirement as part of the application/ interview/orientation process. Failure to disclose any convictions or pending charges may result in reconsideration of an applicant's admissions status. Current students are required to notify the designated experiential faculty member within three (3) business days of any new relevant criminal convictions or pending charges acquired since enrollment. Those students who fail to disclose new charges or convictions within three (3) business days may result in reconsideration of a student's enrollment status. CPHS will contract with an outside vendor for the performance of the background check, and students will be responsible for the cost of the testing. Educational training sites may require CPHS to provide them with a copy of the results of any criminal background check performed on students prior to and for the duration of their placement 6 | 2019-2020 Ac Ademic Bulletinat the site. Some clinical training sites may also require a CBC of their own in addition to the CBC completed by CPHS. Clinical education sites may set their own standards in regard to who they will admit based on the results of the criminal background screening or require further screening. Students must be willing to disclose and release the required personal information and CBC results in order to participate in clinical education activities. Students who are not willing to allow the release of the required personal information will not be able to be placed at an affiliated clinical education site, and thus cannot meet the requirements to continue their education and fulfill the curriculum requirements for graduation. Charges and convictions do not automatically prevent an applicant or current student from matriculating into or continuing in a CPHS degree program at Campbell University. Any charges or convictions as described above must be reviewed for potential impact on the individual's eligibility for placement at experiential training sites to perform the necessary clinical activities or internship requirements for the successful nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and physician assistant students will also be required to have a CBC annually or as often as required by experiential sites. Students enrolled in the BS in Clinical Research completion of the applicable CPHS program and ultimately licensure eligibility for the individuals enrolled in health professions programs. In certain cases, the criminal record may prevent the student from being able to meet the requirements for progression through a program or ability to graduate. Any organization that provides an experiential training site for student internships and/or clinical training experiences has the right to review all CBC results, and ultimately has the right to accept or deny the placement of any CPHS student based upon these results. Procedure 1. A criminal background check will be completed on: all accepted applicants to the CPHS health professions programs prior to matriculation, all current health professions students annually and/or as required by clinical sites, and any CPHS undergraduate student (BSCR/BSPS) as necessitated for internship placement. 2. Applicants accepted late in the admissions cycle will be given a date for completion of all testing. Failure to complete required testing in the specified time period may result in reconsideration of an applicant's admissions status. 3. Accepted applicants and selected wait listed applicants will receive a letter from the College with detailed information about these requirements. The letter will explain the contingency that the final decision regarding matriculation will be made after review of the applicant's criminal background check report. 4. Appropriate authorization, with pertinent identifying information necessary to initiate the check, will be received from each accepted applicant prior to initiating a criminal background check. This authorization will inform the accepted applicant that he or she will have access to criminal background check data about himself or herself to ensure the accuracy of the criminal background check report. 5. CPHS contracts with an outside vendor for the performance of the criminal background check. Results are sent directly from the vendor to the designated program representative(s) for review. 6. Recommendations regarding matriculation of an accepted applicant or continuation of a current student whose criminal background check reveals information of concern will be made by the CPHS Experiential Education Committee. 7. No information derived from a criminal background check will automatically disqualify any accepted applicant from matriculation or prevent progression of a current student. 8. Decisions about matriculation or continuation in a health program will be made only after a careful review of factors including: the nature, circumstances and frequency of any offenses, length of time since the offenses, documented successful rehabilitation if required, the accuracy of the information provided by the applicant in his or her application materials, and/or compliance with policy related to reporting court dates and their decisions. 9. Information from these reports that is unrelated to decisions about admissions and continued enrollment will be maintained in the Office of the Dean and will not become part of the student's permanent file. 10. Information obtained will only be used in accordance with state and federal laws.11. Due to the potential impact of clinical placements, enrolled health professions students or those currently granted a deferral or alternate course of study are required to self-report any new charges or convictions to the designated program representative within three (3) business days. 12. For current health professions students, failure to disclose new criminal charges within three (3) business days to the designated experiential faculty member may result in program specific action and /or referral to the appropriate CPHS committee for possible professional behavior violations. 13. Current students must notify their designated experiential faculty member of scheduled court dates no greater than one week prior to the hearing. 14. Current students must notify their designated experiential faculty member of any court decisions and provide official court documents of the case outcome within one week. 15. Students, who receive court convictions during their enrollment in CPHS health programs, will be required to obtain updated CBCs as necessitated at their expense. 16. All criminal background data will be maintained in a secure location to assure confidentiality. Routine access to the information will be limited to staff members in the office of Admissions & Students Affairs, the associate dean of admissions & student affairs, and directors/ coordinators of experiential education in each health program. Substance Abuse Screening Protocol CPHS requires substance abuse screening tests (SASTs) of all nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and physician assistant program applicants who earn acceptance into their respective health programs prior to matriculation. Current nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and physician assistant students will also be required to have a SAST annually or as often as required by experiential sites, in addition to random or just cause SASTs. Students enrolled in the BS in Clinical Research and BS in Pharmaceutical Sciences programs may be required to have a SAST, prior to matriculating into the mandatory senior internship and may be required to submit to random or just cause SASTs. Currently, applicants and students enrolled in the MS General InformatI on | 7in Clinical Research, MS in Pharmaceutical Sciences and MS in Public Health degree programs are not required to complete SASTs; however, CPHS graduate students who participate in any experiential training experience, required or elective, may be subject to a SASTs as part of the process for entrance to the training site. Accepted applicants to any of the aforementioned CPHS degree programs will be notified of the background check and substance abuse screening protocol requirement as part of the matriculation process. Additional screening tests may be required as determined by CPHS or the experiential training sites. SAST results may be reviewed the CPHS admissions office, the CPHS Experiential Education Committee, the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee (if necessary), the designated experiential education office and the designated experiential training sites providing student internships and clinical experiences for CPHS programs. It is extremely important to note an understand that the affiliate rotation/internship/clinical/ experiential sites, not CPHS, ultimately have the ability to accept or deny the placement of any student based upon the SAST results even after acceptance into the program. Consumption of alcohol is not permitted during classes, experiential or co-curricular activities. CPHS reserves the right to require drug or alcohol testing on any currently enrolled CPHS student (BS, MS or doctoral) when based on unusual or erratic behavior or reasonable suspicion exists that a student is under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Examples of reasonable suspicions include but are not limited to: a formal or public complaint issued by students, faculty, or staff, and/or physical proof. Refusal or failure to submit to screening may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Students found to have screening tests positive for alcohol, illicit substances or prescription medications without a valid prescription will have results evaluated by the CPHS Experiential Education Committee with possible referral to the appropriate CPHS professionalism committee for possible disciplinary action up to and including dismissal as warranted by CPHS administration. Educational training sites may require CPHS to provide them with a copy of the results of any substance of abuse tests performed on students prior to and for the duration of their placement at the site. Some clinical training sites may also require a SAST of their own in addition to the SAST completed by CPHS. Clinical education sites reserve the right to set their own standards in regard to who they will admit based on the results of the substance abuse screening or require further screening. Students who are not willing to allow the release of the required personal information will not be able to be placed at an affiliated clinical education site, and thus cannot meet the requirements to continue their education and fulfill the curriculum requirements for graduation. A positive drug/alcohol screen may require the student to be evaluated and receive counseling. In this case, the student may be evaluated by a qualified clinician in the Campbell University behavioral health center, or they can opt to be evaluated at a community behavioral health agency/ practice. Should the student opt to use a behavioral health center other than Campbell, the student will be responsible for the cost of evaluation and the associated therapy. All students will be responsible for ensuring that all necessary documentation is provided to the College regarding attendance at a behavioral health center. Procedure 1. The currently approved urine substance abuse screening test will be completed at a designated lab facility with results sent directly to the current Campbell University vendor. SASTS will be performed on all accepted applicants prior to matriculation and on current health programs' students at least annually. 2. The letter sent by the respective program to each accepted applicant, as well as to selected wait-listed applicants, will include information about these requirements with the contingency that the final decision regarding matriculation being made after institutional review of the accepted applicant's SAST report. 3. Appropriate authorization, with pertinent identifying information necessary to initiate the test, will be received from each accepted applicant and current student prior to initiating a SAST. 4. Accepted applicants and current students must have the sample collected at a CPHS approved collection site. CPHS contracts with an outside vendor for the performance of the test. Such tests will be conducted in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable laws. Results are sent directly from the vendor to the designated CPHS Health Program representative(s) for review. 5. Applicants and current students without any abnormal SAST findings can be approved by the Admissions Office or program representative for matriculation or continuation in their respective program. 6. Applicants and current students with abnormal SAST findings, other than a \"negative dilute\" must undergo further review by the CPHS Experiential Education Committee. a. Applicants/current students with SAST positive results for illegal substances or non-prescribed controlled medications will be referred to the CPHS Experiential Education Committee with the potential for their offer of admission to be rescinded or dismissal from their current program, depending on the status of the student. b. Applicants/current students with a SAST result of \"negative dilute\", MUST repeat the SAST at their expense. A second negative dilute result may jeopardize a student's admission or ability to continue studies in the progression of his/ her respective program. c. Decisions for continuation of a health program student with a SAST positive result are made after careful evaluation of all pertinent information and take into consideration the individual's ability to be accepted at the necessary clinical/experiential sites, the test value levels, and normative data related to drug use. d. The CPHS Experiential Education Committee reserves the right to refer students with positive SAST results for mandatory drug rehabilitation or psychological evaluation for progression in a health program. 7. Although we acknowledge that marijuana use is legal in several states, marijuana is a Schedule I drug and it is currently considered ILLEGAL by the federal government and by the state of North Carolina; therefore, applicants/ current students will be held to this standard set by our federal and state government. The possession and/ or consumption of marijuana may 8 | 2019-2020 Ac Ademic Bulletinjeopardize an applicant's/student's ability to matriculate and progress through the CPHS degree programs.

Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) Family Education Rights and Privacy Act information is found in this link on the Campbell website: https://www.campbell. edu/registrar/family-education-rights-and- privacy-act-ferpa/. Grade Reports, Records & Transcripts A report of grades attained by a student in the CPHS will be available through the University's Student Planner system at the end of each semester. The official records of each student in CPHS will be maintained securely in the Office of the Registrar. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (PL93-380) will govern the release of information for this record which contains the transcript from Campbell University, transcripts and transcript evaluations from other educational agencies attended by the student, secondary school transcripts, scholastic aptitude, GRE, and other standardized test scores. The application for admission, general correspondence with the student and, if applicable, letters concerning misconduct or disciplinary actions at Campbell University are maintained by the Office of Admissions & Student Affairs within the university archival system. The transcript and contents of the permanent record may be examined by the student upon appointment with the Registrar, or the associate dean for admissions and student affairs. Repeat Courses For repeat courses, the last attempt only will affect the final grade point average. Previous hours attempted, previous hours passed, and previous quality points will General InformatI on | 9not be considered, although they will remain on the permanent record. All grades from all attempts are recorded and remain on the transcript permanently. Health Insurance Due to contractual requirements enumerated in agreements with clinical experiential training sites, all CPHS health professions students are required to have health insurance coverage. Students with coverage must opt-out of the University provided plan and provide proof of health insurance coverage. Failure to opt-out will result in a charge for insurance even if enrollment information is not provided by student. Students may also be required to upload the necessary supporting documentation verifying active health insurance coverage into the electronic management systems utilized by their respective program in order to track all experiential training requirements. Any medical costs incurred by students as a result of injury, exposure to infectious diseases or materials, while in training, are the responsibility of the student and his or her health insurance carrier. Events covered under the Accidental Insurance Policy are covered in a future section. Immunization During introductory and advanced experiential experiences and clinical rotations, students will be involved in direct patient care and; therefore at risk for potential exposure to infectious materials and patients. All students must provide a completed medical history form and proof of immunization as directed by their respective program. Students are responsible for maintaining immunizations; this requirement is mandated by CPHS in order to complete all required supervised clinical practice experiences. Prior to registration, students must provide proof of the immunizations/ immunity requirements listed below. Requirements Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis: Td booster within the past 10 years. Students must have a one-time dose of Tdap unless contraindicated. Students must have booster protection across all years enrolled in the program (i.e. lapses in coverage between boosters are unacceptable). -Polio: Complete IPV or OPV series -MMR: Two doses or laboratory evidence of immunity to each of the three diseases -Hepatitis B: Students must show documentation of a three- dose series with the first of the three doses upon admission to CPHS. Before the end of the first professional year, students must provide documentation of all doses in the series. -Varicella (chicken pox): Students must either receive the two- series Varicella vaccination or prove immunity to the Varicella virus by a positive (+) blood titer. Individuals utilizing blood titer as proof must submit a copy of the actual numerical lab result. History of \"chicken pox\" in your medical record is not sufficient. Tuberculin (PPD) skin test: Annually (some rotation sites require a 2-step PPD - CPHS will let the student know if this applies.) If the TB skin test is positive, a chest X-ray is required. Influenza: Annual flu vaccine is required. Standard Precautions The Center of Disease Control (CDC) has developed a list of the following precautions to prevent accidental spread of infectious diseases to both students and patients: Hand washing (or using an antiseptic hand rub) -After touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, and contaminated items -Immediately after removing gloves between patient contact Gloves -For contact with blood, body fluids, secretions, and contaminated items -For contact with mucous membranes and non-intact skin Masks, goggles, face masks -Protect mucous membranes of eyes, nose, and mouth when contact with blood and body fluids is likely Gowns -Protect skin from blood or body fluid contact -Prevent soiling of clothing during procedures that may involve contact with blood or body fluids Linen -Handle soiled linen to prevent touching skin or mucous membranes -Do not pre-rinse soiled linens in patient care areas Patient care equipment -Handle soiled equipment in a manner to prevent contact with skin or mucous membranes to prevent contamination of clothing or the environment -Clean reusable equipment prior to reuse -Environmental cleaning -Routinely care, clean, and disinfect equipment and furnishings in patient care areas Sharps -Avoid recapping used needles, use self-capping safety needles if available -Avoid removing used needles from disposable syringes -Avoid bending, breaking, or manipulating used needles by hand -Place used sharps in puncture- resistant containers Patient resuscitation -Use mouthpieces, resuscitation bags, or other ventilation devices to avoid mouth to mouth resuscitation Patient placement -Place patients who contaminate the environment or cannot maintain appropriate hygiene in private rooms OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Training CPHS requires that all students who have contact with patients complete online modules regarding OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens (BBP). Copies of student training records will be kept in the office of each respective professional program. Physician Assistant Students Only- Tuberculosis Training Physician assistant students will receive training for preventing the transmission of tuberculosis (TB) annually. All students who have the potential for exposure to TB may be fit tested for National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) certified personal respirator protective devices, as required by clinical sites. These 10 | 2019-2020 Ac Ademic Bulletindevices are considered personal protective equipment and must be purchased by the student. Personal Illness Students presenting signs or symptoms of infectious or communicable diseases have a duty not to spread illness to others. Students should consult the Student Health Center (910-893-1562), their preceptor, clinical supervisor or the infection control office at the clinical site about the advisability of working with patients and when it is safe to return to patient care. Incident Reporting Body Fluid and Needle Stick Policy and Procedure Incidents involving needle sticks and exposure to body fluids or potential bloodborne pathogens require immediate action to protect students' health and safety. If a student sustains a needle stick or is exposed to infectious materials he or she should: 1. Immediately wash exposure site thoroughly with soap and water (or water only for mucous membranes). -Wash needle stick and cuts with soap and water. -Flush the nose, mouth or skin with water. -Irrigate eyes with clean water, saline or sterile irrigants. 2. Notify the preceptor or clinical supervisor at the rotation site for assistance. -For pharmacy students the preceptor should notify the Office of Pharmacy Experiential Education by phone, 800-760-9697, or email (Shawn Carrillo, ext. scarrillo@ campbell.edu or Dr. Tina Thornhill, ext. 1402/email: thornhillt@campbell.edu) as soon as reasonably possible to begin the process of filing an incident report. -For physician assistant students the preceptor should notify the PA clinical coordinator by phone, -910-893-1252 or email, gerstnerl@ campbell.edu, or the PA department's office, 910-893-1210, as soon as reasonably possible to begin the process of filing an incident report. 3. Seek immediate care for necessary lab work and post-exposure prophylaxis -In the event that the rotation site has an existing exposure policy, the student should comply with the site's policy. -If the rotation site is not able to assist the student, the student should seek care at the nearest available facility to provide appropriate care (initial lab work for HIV, HBV, HCV and risk assessment to determine the need for chemoprophylaxis, etc.) or students may be seen at Campbell University's Student Health Center. 4. The preceptor or appropriate institutional representative should obtain consent from the source patient for appropriate laboratory testing (i.e. HIV, HBV, and HCV status). -Students should receive post- exposure prophylaxis within hours of the exposure rather than days, per CDC recommendations, if the status of the source patient is deemed high risk or if there is uncertainty of the source patient's status. 5. Some clinical sites will provide post- exposure care to students at no charge. When this is not the case, needle sticks and other exposure are covered under the Campbell University Student Accident Insurance Policy. Accidental infectious exposure must be reported as directed in this policy: BMI Benefits, LLC PO Box 511 76 Main 077447 Policy Number: 11SPD8336001 Phone: presenting to a clinic for post- exposure care, the student may provide the above policy information and his or her student ID card. However, the site may or may not accept direct payment through this plan. Students may have to pay out of pocket at the time of service. However, reimbursement for services up to $5,000 per incident can be filed via the Student Health Center. Students will need: To provide an itemized statement complete with diagnosis and procedure codes. Complete a claim form either in person, or call Student Health Services at 910-893-1560.

Although, the preceptor or clinical supervisor may have contacted CPHS as indicated above, the student must also contact the Office of Experiential Education or the Physician Assistant Department Office as soon as reasonably possible but within a minimum of 72 hours of the exposure to finalize the incident report. The incident report shall contain: -The date and time of exposure. -Clinical site, location and unit information. -Details of how the exposure occurred. -Details of the type and severity of the exposure. -Details about the source patient (i.e. post-exposure management, previous vaccinations, current HIV, HBV, HCV status). -The Office Experiential Education or the Physician Assistant Department Office will provide a copy of the incident report to Student Health Services. This will alert the Student Health Services in the event that an accident insurance claim needs to be filled. -In the event that an incident report was filed at the rotation site, a copy of this must be sent to the Office of Experiential Education or the Physician Assistant Department Office to be maintained in the student's file. 7. In the event of an exposure, the National Clinician's Post Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline is available by phone, 888-448-4911, 24 hours per day, seven days per week, to provide guidance in managing exposures. Inclement Weather During periods of inclement weather, classes at CPHS will meet according to the decisions made by the University. Students may monitor decisions made through the University's inclement weather website, www.campbell.edu/weather.General InformatI on | 11Students are encouraged to use their own good judgment relative to safety in traveling to campus. Should classes meet and students who commute are unable to travel safely to the campus, they will not be penalized and will be able to make-up missed work. Meal Plan Campbell University Dining Services offers a variety of meal plan options that includes dining locations across campus. Visit campbell. campusdish.com for detailed meal plan information. Parking Students parking on campus are required to obtain a parking decal. Registration information, parking maps, and parking regulations are available at: https://www. campbell.edu/campus-safety/parking/ vehicle-bicycle-registration/. Professional Liability Insurance Campbell University maintains student liability insurance for all students during their clinical experiences and internships required as part of their curriculum of study. This coverage is valid only during assigned clinical activities. All students and faculty members of the College while participating in a clinical experience and/ or internship as part of their curriculum of study are covered by a malpractice liability insurance policy in accordance with contractual agreements with training sites. Refunds An admissions deposit is required of each accepted applicant. These deposits are non-refundable. In the event of a student's complete withdrawal from the university for a particular enrollment period, refunds/ repayments are calculated according to the Higher Education Act and its subsequent modifications. Campbell University will comply fully with federal regulations as required. This method will be used to determine refunds/repayments for Title IV aid as well as state and institutional aid. This includes students who do not follow the university's policy for official withdrawal. To withdraw officially from the University during a semester, a student is required to complete an official Withdrawal Form, which can be acquired from the Office of Admissions & Student Affairs. The Withdrawal Form must be completed with proper signatures obtained, and turned into the Registrar's Office for placement in the student's permanent file. Failure to withdraw properly will result in a non- prorated reassessment of charges to the student account. Upon completion of the Withdrawal Form, the Registrar's Office updates class registration as a withdrawal from the University denoting the Withdrawal Effective Date provided on the form. The Business Office verifies all classes have been updated accordingly and reassesses student tuition and fee charges. Housing and meal plan assignments are reviewed to ensure their correct reassessment. Drop Period: Days 1-5 of the drop period: 100% tuition refund Day 6 - until the last day of drop period: No tuition refund Financial Aid Disbursed to Student Account: Financial aid will disburse to student account the first day of class. Financial Aid Refund: Financial aid refunds will be refunded on or after day 6 of the drop period. If day 6 is a weekend or holiday, the Business Office will refund the next banking/business day. Contingent on banking regulation and individual banking processes, student will receive refunds in their bank account within 3 business days from the date of refund. The Business Office is responsible for the reassessment of student account charges; however, it is the responsibility of the Financial Aid Office to ensure financial aid awards have been evaluated and reassessed accordingly. The Business Office reserves the right to hold refund of credit balances until the Financial Aid Office has evaluated and approved the release of funds awarded to students who withdraw from the University.

Sexual Harassment Title IX Policies & Procedures The Title IX policies and procedures are found in this link on the Campbell website: https:// www.campbell.edu/policies/title- ix/title-ix-policies-and-procedures/. Social Media Policy Campbell University's College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS) recognizes that online blogs, email lists and social network sites may include (but are not limited to) Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Pinterest, LinkedIn (hereafter collectively referred to as social media) and are increasingly popular tools for communication and social interaction. CPHS does not actively monitor online activities of the student body; however, it does address issues related to unprofessional behavior brought to the attention of the Office of Student Affairs. A CPHS student must understand that by identifying oneself publicly through social media, he/she is creating perceptions about CPHS, clinical/experiential sites, and/or his/her chosen health profession; therefore, students must assure that all social media content is consistent with the values and professional standards of Campbell University, CPHS, and their profession. Individuals should make every effort to present themselves in a mature, responsible, and professional manner. Discourse should be civil and respectful while taking care to avoid displays of vulgar, disrespectful, unflattering, or inflammatory language or photographs that reflect poorly on the student, program, or college. Please be aware that no privatization measure is perfect and that undesignated persons may still gain access to your networking site. Any and all future employers may review these network sites when considering potential candidates for employment. Although posted information can be removed from the original social networking site, exported information cannot be recovered. Any digital exposure can \"live on\" beyond its removal from the 12 | 2019-2020 Ac Ademic Bulletinoriginal website and continue to circulate in other venues; consequently, one should think carefully before posting any information on a website or application. Unprofessional behavior towards patients, other healthcare professionals, preceptors, faculty, staff, peers, or the public is a significant consideration in the evaluation and academic promotion of CPHS students. Students who use social media must be aware that posting certain information is proprietary and illegal. Violations of existing statutes and administrative regulations may result in criminal and civil liability including fines and imprisonment. Offenders may also be subject to adverse academic actions up to and including dismissal as outlined and detailed in the Academic Bulletin (Honor Code: Articles 2.5 , Non-Academic Matters). Any conduct which evidences a lack of knowledge or ability to apply professional principles or skills, constitutes unprofessional conduct in violation of professional standards (Honor Code: Article 9 Student Clinical Code of Conduct). Prohibited actions that will be interpreted as unprofessional conduct and in violation of the CPHS Professional Behavior Standards as described in the Academic Bulletin and may also constitute a violation of the University's academic and non- academic misconduct codes include, but are not limited to the following: You may not share the personal health information of other individuals. Removal of an individual's name does not alone constitute proper de-identification of protected health information. Inclusion of data such as age, gender, race, diagnosis, date of evaluation, the type of treatment or the use of a highly specific medical photograph (such as a before/after photograph of a patient having surgery or a photograph of a patient from a medical outreach trip) may still allow the reader to recognize the identity of a specific individual. You may not report private (protected) academic information of another student or trainee. Such information might include, but is not limited to: course grades, narrative evaluations, examination scores, or adverse academic actions. You may not represent yourself as an official representative or spokesperson for Campbell University or the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. You may not represent yourself as another person, real or fictitious, or otherwise attempt to obscure your identity as a means to circumvent any prohibitions listed in the Academic Bulletin. You may not knowingly distribute false evidence, statements, or charges against another student or faculty/ staff member. You may not distribute negative comments against another student, faculty/staff member, preceptor, or affiliated training site. You may not contribute to or engage in any activity which disrupts or obstructs the teaching, research or extension programs of CPHS or Campbell University, either on the campus or at affiliated training sites. You may not threaten or engage in acts of physical violence to CPHS administration, faculty, staff, or students. You may not harass, in any form, CPHS administration, faculty, staff, or students. You may not violate the confidentiality of a CPHS committee. Retaliation in any form is prohibited. You may not utilize websites and/or applications in a manner that interferes with your work commitments. You may not present any photograph(s) that may reasonably be interpreted as condoning the irresponsible use of alcohol, substance abuse, or sexual promiscuity. In addition to the examples of the absolute prohibitions outlined above, the following actions (and similar) are strongly discouraged as these are considered unprofessional and reflect poorly on the individual, the healthcare profession, the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences and Campbell University. Displays of vulgar language. Displays of language or photographs that imply disrespect for any individual or group because of age, race, gender, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Posting of potentially inflammatory or unflattering material on another individual's website The following actions are considered best practices and are strongly encouraged: Bringing content that could harm a patient's privacy, rights, or welfare to the attention of the appropriate authorities. Notifying CPHS faculty or staff of any violation of noted absolute prohibitions and unprofessional behavior that could negatively impact CPHS. Using privacy settings to limit unknown or unwanted access to your profile or application. Regularly checking your privacy settings to optimize privacy and security. Minimizing personal information on all social media profiles. Excluding addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, PID numbers, passport numbers, driver's license numbers, birth dates, or any other information that could be used to obtain personal records. Using a personal email address (not a campbell.edu address) as the primary means of identification, if choosing to list an email address on a social networking site. Discourse should always be civil and respectful. Presenting yourself in a mature, responsible, and professional manner. Violations of the CPHS Social Media Policy are subject to referral to the CPHS Student Affairs Office and/or the CPHS Student Conduct & Professionalism Committee. This policy was adapted and modified from The University of Louisiana at Monroe, College of Pharmacy, Social Media Policy, Student Handbook, 2013-2014; from The University of Florida's College of Pharmacy Social Media Policy, 2017; and from the National Student Nurses' Association, Inc. Recommendations for Social Media Usage and Maintaining Privacy, Confidentiality and Professionalism. Student Health Students may utilize the Student Health Center for preventive services and personal health concerns. For patient privacy and confidentiality, students must not be treated by CPHS faculty in the student's program who may occasionally cover the clinic. The students should identify themselves as a CPHS student when checking into the clinic so that they may be scheduled with an appropriate provider. More information about health services offered is available at https:// www.campbell.edu/health-center/. Student Services CPHS Office of Admissions & Student Affairs offers various student services available to all graduate and professional CPHS students including academic support consultations, career services, and peer tutoring services. One-on-one appointments and group workshops are available for both academic support General InformatI on | 13needs (time management, study skills, test-taking, stress management, etc.) and career services needs (job searching, resume review, cover letter review, etc.). Peer tutoring services are available in each CPHS program to graduate and professional students. Students may request a tutor throughout the semester and sign up based upon their schedule. One-on-one and small group tutoring is available. Any questions regarding graduate and professional student services should be directed to the main office at 910-893-1690. Technology Devices (Computers/Tablets) Technology devices are provided to students at orientation prior to the first year of, and for use in, their respective professional program. In accepting this program-issued device, the student agrees to the following: The student will maintain the device in good working condition throughout the entirety of the respective CPHS program. The student will do due diligence to protect the device against instances of loss, theft, and/or damage. The student will uphold the terms and conditions of the required software. The student agrees not to use the device and any software for commercial purposes. The student ultimately agrees to follow all University rules and policies which govern computer usage. Technology devices distributed to the students by the program are considered program property until graduation from the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS). In the event a student leaves the program prior to graduation, program- issued devices along with any additional issued equipment, are to be returned prior to exit from the University. Technology devices distributed by the program are to be used for program-related needs (in-class lectures, out-of-class assignments, clinical rotations, etc.) and required software platforms (Blackboard, ExamSoft, etc.). CPHS is aware social network sites are in high demand for active communication and social interaction. These sites can contain viruses so make sure to protect devices, as instructed by Campbell University IT Services. In General: Students are responsible for any and all actions stemming from their activities on the program-issued device. Students are responsible for needed maintenance and updates of the hardware and software on their program-issued device. Students should maintain updated virus protection. Students are to contact Campbell University IT Services Helpdesk (x1208) (helpdesk@campbell.edu), with any program-issued device needs and/or concerns (i.e. software issues, hardware issues, broken parts, etc.). Program-issued devices are not the sole property of the student until the student has graduated CPHS. Therefore, devices are not to be given away or sold until they are no longer considered the property of CPHS. Violation of this agreement/policy is considered to be a professionalism issue and may result in referral to the student conduct and professionalism committee for possible probation or dismissal. Campbell University will carry a warranty on the program-issued technology device. This warranty coverage may vary from year-to-year, as well as the provisions included within it. Detailed information regarding warranties will be provided, along with the issue of technology devices, at first year orientation. Students should consult the Campbell University IT Services Helpdesk for ALL warranty issues. However, in the event the technology device is lost, stolen, or damaged beyond repair, the student will be responsible for repairing the device or replacing it with a similar product, in order to meet the in-class and testing needs of the program. As well, batteries are considered consumables and may not be covered under warranty. Tuition & Fees Tuition and fees are determined annually and are available at https://www.campbell. edu/business-office/tuition-fees/cphs/. Tuition and fees for the upcoming academic year are estimated and are subject to change. Any new tuition and fee schedules will become effective at the beginning of each entering class of the program. Tuition payment will be due the first week of classes. Graduating students are responsible for the purchase of their regalia. Withdrawal Withdrawal from the CPHS should only be considered after a careful and thorough evaluation of the academic, financial, and personal impacts arising from such an action. Prior to requesting an official withdrawal from the University during a semester, a student should discuss options with their academic advisor and/or program director. To officially withdraw from the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences during a semester, a student must meet with the Director of Student Affairs and is required to complete an official CPHS Withdrawal Form available in the CPHS Student Affairs Office (Room 119, Maddox Hall, 910-893-1690). The CPHS Withdrawal Form must be completed, with proper signatures obtained, and returned to the Director of Student Affairs. The Director of Student Affairs will process the withdrawal and a copy of the appropriate documentation will be placed in the student's permanent file with appropriate administrative offices/ personnel notified. This form, once completed, will be distributed to the following offices: Registrar, Financial Aid, Business, Accounting, Veteran's Affairs, and International Admissions, so that a student's record may be closed out in all these areas. Upon completion of the CPHS Withdrawal Form, the Registrar's Office updates class registration as a withdrawal from the University denoting the Withdrawal Effective Date provided on the form. The Business Office verifies all classes have been updated accordingly and reassesses student tuition and fee charges. Failure to withdraw properly will result in full charges and failing grades. Students will be responsible for all grants, scholarships, loans, and federal monies applied toward their tuition and general fees. Students receiving veterans' benefits must report to the Director of Veterans Affairs within thirty days of withdrawing from Campbell University. All graduate and professional programs at CPHS will have published dates for withdrawing from school (each is unique due to different start and stop dates). Withdrawal from CPHS prior to or on the designated withdrawal date will result in a student receiving grades of W for all classes. Withdrawal after the designated withdrawal date will result in a grade determined by the materials completed, usually resulting in a grade of F. When a student withdraws at any time in cases of 14 | 2019-2020 Ac Ademic Bulletindocumented medical emergencies, even after the published last date to withdraw, the grade will be entered as a W. Any student requesting a Medical Withdrawal will be required to provide documentation from a medical professional (in addition to the official CPHS Withdrawal Form), and will be withdrawn from all courses and assigned a grade of W. Please note: in order to be eligible for re-instatement and enrollment after a medical withdrawal was granted, a student must provide documentation from a medical provider that he/she is medically cleared to return to the academic rigors of the graduate/ professional program. Additionally, the appropriate committee must evaluate any student, who was on probation or suspension due to performance at the time of withdrawal (i.e. academic probation or suspension is evaluated by the APSC). These evaluations are intended to provide a framework to assist the individual for a successful return to the program of study. Honor Code We, the students, staff and faculty of Campbell University's College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS), recognize that health care related professions are among the most noble and honorable callings to which one may aspire. These are professions that demand of their members the highest degree of professional competence, ethical behavior, and morality. They require continuous educational development, constant personal and professional self-examination, and an ever-present awareness and sensitivity to human problems. It is the responsibility of every health care related professional, from the day that his or her professional career begins, to seek to achieve the highest aspirations and goals inherent in the profession; to exhibit honor and integrity in the use of his or her special skills for the betterment of humankind; and to act at all times in a manner which will instill public confidence in the profession. We therefore adopt this Honor Code in an attempt to set forth the minimum standards by which our conduct should be governed. Article 1: Academic Matters A. General Statement Recognizing that it is impossible and inadvisable to set forth with specificity a range of conduct that is prohibited, we nevertheless realize that questions arise occasionally with respect to what a student may or may not do in connection with an academic matter. This Honor Code therefore sets forth the minimum standards of conduct with the hope and expectation that a CPHS student will never approach, and certainly never fall below, these minimum standards. It is the obligation of the students and faculty to participate in making the honor system viable by reporting violations of all academic matters. B. Definition An academic matter means any one of the following: any activity which may affect a grade in a course; any activity which in any way contributes to satisfaction of the requirements of a course, or requirements for graduation, or co-curricular activities of an academic nature including student publication and competitions. C. Prohibited Activities with Respect to Academic Matters CPHS students shall not: 1. Use materials during an examination other than those specifically authorized by the instructor. To avoid even the appearance of impropriety during an examination, all books, notebooks, briefcases, and the like should be placed in the front or rear of the examination room. 2. Use of materials in any research or assignment that are specifically forbidden by the instructor. This prohibited activity includes reuse of the student's own work. 3. Engage in any form of plagiarism. Plagiarism is using the words or ideas of another source directly without proper acknowledgment of that source. While it is often necessary to obtain information from other sources, the willful or inadvertent use of information from another source without acknowledging it (including all types of commercial term paper preparation services; internet or electronic database sources for term papers, journal clubs, or case presentations; and other students' or professors' work) is considered plagiarism. Ignorance is not an excuse. The student bears the responsibility to learn from the individual instructor the procedure for acknowledging sources and indicating quotations as required for each assignment. 4. Give, solicit, or receive information or assistance to or from any person or source during an examination, makeup examination, or written assignment unless specifically authorized to do so by the instructor. 5. Submit modified or changed tests, answer sheets, or assignments for regrading. 6. Intentionally deface, remove without authorization, or conceal any material from CPHS, the Drug Information Center, or any library. 7. Make an unauthorized or improper use of a computer or computer program, including unauthorized use of programmable calculators during an examination. 8. Fail to report to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee any firsthand knowledge of any violation to any of the aforementioned provisions of this Honor Code. 9. Willfully conceal or misrepresent information material to an investigation of any alleged violation of this Honor Code when the information is sought by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee, faculty, dean, or the dean's designee. Article 2: Non-academic Matters A. General Statement CPHS students are hereby informed that in their personal and professional lives they represent not only themselves, but also CPHS and the health profession. Therefore, while they have the right and freedom to exercise individual autonomy, they also have the responsibility to exercise that autonomy in a manner that will bring honor to themselves, CPHS, and their chosen profession. B. Prohibited Activities with Respect to Nonacademic Matters CPHS students are subject to the same level of conduct as all Campbell University students; students residing in university housing are subject to the rules for all students who reside in university housing. Any infractions of these rules will be handled by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. All General InformatI on | 15students are encouraged to study the sections concerning these violations in the current Campbell University Student Handbook. In addition, CPHS student shall not: 1. Fail to conform his or her conduct to the ethical and moral standards of the health care profession as articulated in the Student Clinical Code of Conduct (Article 9). 2. Intentionally make misrepresentation on a resume or curriculum vitae concerning class rank, grades, academic honors, work experience, or any other matter relevant to job placement. 3. Purposely furnish false information. 4. Perpetrate any form of theft, forgery, falsification, or fraudulent use of university or work- site property. 5. Willfully conceal or misrepresent information material to an investigation of an alleged violation of this Honor Code when the information is sought by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee, faculty, dean, or the dean's designee. 6. Use or remove unauthorized prescription or nonprescription drugs or appliances from the site of a clinical rotation or work-site. Article 3: Violations: Civil Law CPHS shall direct all cases concerning violations of civil laws to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. Any violations will be handled by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee as described in the University handbook. All students are encouraged to study the section concerning these violations in the Campbell University Student Handbook. Article 4: Penalties The associate dean of admissions & student affairs at CPHS may impose the following penalties for any of the violations listed above. Recommendations to the associate dean of admissions & student affairs are submitted by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. Following proper procedures listed in article 5 of this Honor Code, the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee may recommend to the associate dean of admissions & student affairs for one or more of the following penalties:1. Separation: Separation is a state in which the student is not permitted to continue his/her program at the university. The student shall be withdrawn from all uncompleted courses in which he/she is currently enrolled. The student will not be permitted to re-enter the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences' educational programs. 2. Suspension: Suspension is a temporary state of separation for a definite period from the university including the programs, facilities and activities. The completion of the period of suspension does not guarantee reinstatement. The decision to readmit a student will be the responsibility of the associate dean of admissions & student affairs. 3. Probation: Probation can be of two types: Level-one probation Level-one probation for a stated period carries a loss of eligibility for: Holding or running for elected office in student professional organizations; Representing the University in any capacity both on campus and away from campus; Competing for honors and distinctions; Active participation as an elected representative or member of an honorary organization; Obtaining reimbursement monies from any funders within the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. Violation of the terms of level-one probation may result in extended probation, level-two probation, or in the student's suspension. Level-two probation Level-two probation for a stated period carries a loss of eligibility for attendance at any and all CPHS sponsored activities. A student who is placed on level-two probation will automatically be placed on level-one probation. Violation of the terms of level-two probation may result in extended probation or in the student's suspension. The terms of probation will be enforced by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. Other persons may be appointed by the associate dean of admissions & student affairs or the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee to help enforce said terms. 1. Community Service: Community service for a stated number of hours will require a student to perform tasks that will benefit the community or CPHS. Tasks will be assigned and administered by the director of admissions & student affairs. Failure to perform required service in an appropriate fashion may result in probation. 2. Loss or Lowering of the Course Grade: All students who are found guilty of the act of cheating or plagiarism shall receive a score of zero (0) on that specific component of the course (quizzes, tests, projects, assignments). Specific penalties for these violations may also include, but are not limited to, course failure, probation, suspension, and/or separation from the program and the University. A second act of cheating or plagiarism by the student will result in the separation of the student from the University. 3. Reprimand: An official reprimand will be given by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee when the charges are not dismissed. A summary of the offense and the reprimand will be placed in the students file in the dean's office. Any professor may define penalties for a student who violates particular course regulations. The professor must clearly state these regulations and penalties in his or her course syllabus. The student has the right to appeal such penalties to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. See Article 5, Section C - 1. Article 5: Student Conduct & Professionalism Committee A. General Statement The associate dean of admissions & student affairs is responsible for the administration of the CPHS disciplinary system. This responsibility is exercised on behalf of the president of the University and entails the supervision of several bodies. Alleged violations of the University's student code of conduct or civil laws will be handled by the University policies as written in the Campbell University Student Handbook. Alleged violations of the CPHS Honor Code will be evaluated by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. B. Organization The Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee is composed of faculty members from each department, students and the director of student affairs (ex-officio). An ad-hoc member will be chosen to replace any member who cannot or 16 | 2019-2020 Ac Ademic Bulletinchooses not to attend the proceedings. The associate dean of admissions & student affairs will appoint this member. This committee serves as a hearing board for incidents of misconduct involving violations of the Honor Code. The Honor Code includes standards for academic, non-academic, and clinical behavior. The Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee will make recommendations to the associate dean of admissions & student affairs. The associate dean of admissions & student affairs will then notify the student in writing of actions concerning alleged violations. A record of disciplinary actions is normally maintained by the dean's office until the student graduates or leaves CPHS. Students may examine the contents of their file by appointment with the director of admissions & student affairs. C. Instigation of Hearings When there is a suspicion of academic misconduct, investigation and appropriate actions may be pursued by either the professor of the course in which the alleged misconduct occurred or by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. In either case, the matter must be promptly resolved. If the professor decides to deal with the incident, he or she should report the student's actions to the chair of the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. Individual faculty policies concerning misconduct should be clearly stated in the course syllabus. The accused student has the right to appeal any action by the faculty member to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee, in which normal committee procedures will be followed. Charges of misconduct may arise from a student (or group of students), professor, adjunct professor or preceptor. Within seven (7) days of the alleged misconduct or discovery of alleged misconduct, the accuser(s) should discuss the situation with either the director of student affairs or the professor in charge of the course. Dated notes should be taken to describe the discussion. Every effort should be made to maintain confidentiality in these discussions. If the accuser(s) has (have) opted to bring the matter before the director of admissions & student affairs, the director should meet with the professor and the chairperson of the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee to explore options. This meeting should take place no longer than seven (7) days after the matter was brought to the attention of the director. The options available for resolution of the situation include: 1. If a faculty member assigns a student an F or a grade of zero on any assignment or test for which the reason was academic dishonesty, the faculty member must immediately notify the Associate Dean for Admissions and Student Affairs and the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee chairperson (SCPC) in writing of this event. The student does have the right to appeal the faculty's decision. If the SCPC and Associate Dean for Admissions and Student Affairs uphold the faculty's decision OR if the student chooses not to appeal, the record of the offense will remain in the student's file until graduation. If a second violation of the CPHS Honor Code occurs before graduation that is upheld by SCPC or not appealed, the student will automatically be referred to the SCPC for separate, additional sanctions including possible dismissal from the program. If the faculty member involved in the event currently serves on the SCPC, then the faculty member should recuse himself/herself from the committee meeting. 2. The case can be referred to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee for resolution. Referral to the committee must be by a written memo which names the student, describes the alleged misconduct (including pertinent dates and times), and summarizes the content of earlier meetings regarding this case. 3. The case may be dismissed. Within five (5) days of referral of the case to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee, the chair of the committee will provide a copy of the referral memo to the accused student(s). In addition, the chairperson will schedule an initial hearing for any charged student with the committee. This hearing should be held within ten (10) days of the referral of the case to the committee.D. Proceedings The chair will begin preliminary investigation of the allegations. Whenever possible, this should include a personal interview with the student, witnesses, and professor involved. Preliminary findings shall be presented at the initial meeting with the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. The chair shall objectively present his or her findings to the committee. The accused student(s) shall meet with the committee and be informed of the allegations and afforded an opportunity to defend him or herself. Although the purpose of this hearing is exploratory and fact finding in nature, the accused student does have the right to solicit advice and to offer witnesses to support his or her position. The committee shall vote on whether or not preliminary findings warrant a full hearing by a simple majority vote. If a hearing is deemed necessary, the chair will notify the student and witnesses of the hearing date in writing at least three (3) days prior to the hearing. A waiver of his or her notice may be made if the student so chooses. A full hearing should be held within ten (10) days of the preliminary committee review. If the committee votes that no hearing is warranted, the case will be dismissed. The chair will file the minutes in the permanent files of the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee and a copy shall be placed in the dean's office until the student graduates or leaves CPHS. Should additional information become available, the chairperson may reopen the case and ask the committee to consider the new information. All sessions of the committee will be closed to all individuals except those immediately concerned in the case, except by the expressed wish of the accused that the hearings be open. No attorney shall be present, as this setting is not a court of law. In the case of a closed hearing, all persons present at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the committee does in its official report on the case. Revelation of such details will be considered a violation of the Honor Code. In the case of closed hearings, the testimony of each witness shall be given while the other witnesses in the case are out of the room. In open General InformatI on | 17hearings, the witnesses of both parties shall be present during the entire proceedings. The committee may allow introduction of evidence other than testimony of witnesses provided that the evidence is relevant to the question before the committee on any matter. The committee shall set rules for the conduct of all cases and all arrangements connected with the taking of evidence. Time frames for instigation of hearings and proceedings may be altered if circumstances warrant. Votes on all matters shall be a simple majority. Deliberation of the committee shall take place in private and remain secret. Voting on decisions of guilt shall be by secret ballot. If the committee determines that the student was in violation of the Honor Code, it will consider and recommend the appropriate penalty. The student should be informed immediately of the judgment and the recommended penalty in case of guilt. The associate dean of admissions & student affairs may uphold or reject any decision or penalty recommended by the committee. A letter from the associate dean's office will serve as the official notice of judgment and sentence. All minutes and evidence shall be placed in the permanent files of the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee, and a copy will be sent to the associate dean of admissions & student affair's office where it shall remain until the student graduates or leaves CPHS. Article 6: Rights of the Student With respect to violation of the student Honor Code, a student of Campbell University is guaranteed the following rights: 1. The right to a prompt hearing; 2. The right to a reasonable amount of time to prepare for his or her hearing; 3. The right of being presumed innocent until proven guilty; 4. The right to solicit advice; 5. The right to appeal; 6. The right to know his or her accuser; 7. The right to expect that the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee will deal with his or her case in a confidential manner.Article 7: Appeals Process Any decision reached by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee may be appealed to the associate dean of admissions & student affairs. An appeal shall be requested by the student in writing, within three (3) days following the date the student receives the decision of the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. All appeals to the associate dean of admissions & student affairs should be delivered in person or by registered mail to: Campbell University College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences Office of Admissions & Student Affairs PO Box 1090 Buies Creek, NC 27506 Article 8: Notes & Definitions 1.

Article 9: Student Clinical Code of Conduct CPHS students and faculty have adopted the following code of conduct to guide ethical behavior in hospitals, community pharmacies, research and production facilities, and various rotation sites included as clinical practice experiences. We feel that the magnitude of our responsibility as health care professionals necessitates the establishment of the highest standards of professional conduct. This code of conduct represents general standards of behavior and illustrates ideals for which to strive; however, specific infractions reported by students, preceptors or faculty to the chair of the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee may be investigated by this committee with respect to both the magnitude and chronicity of incidents considered. It should also be understood that these general standards may not afford guidance in every conceivable situation or anticipate every possible infraction. The Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee will be charged with the responsibility of promptly investigating alleged infractions of this code. All cases will require the submission of a report of findings and appropriate recommendations to the associate dean for admissions & student affairs in a timely manner. Students should read, discuss and sign the Honor Code prior to enrollment to CPHS. This code of conduct was created by the students and faculty of CPHS. Modifications of this code will require majority approval of both the faculty and student body. The students attending CPHS will: Respect and Concern for the Welfare of Patients Treat patients and their families with respect and dignity both in their presence and in discussions with others. Recognize when one's ability to function effectively is compromised and ask for relief or help. Recognize the limits of student involvement in the medical care of a patient and seek supervision or advice before acting when necessary. Not use alcohol or other drugs in a manner that could compromise themselves or patient care. Respect for the Rights of Others Deal with professional, staff and peer members of the health care team in a considerate manner and with a spirit of cooperation.

Article 10: Pledge A student's signature indicates that he or she agree to uphold the following pledge. A separate pledge form with the language below will be provided and must be signed prior to entry into CPHS. I, having read and receiving a clear understanding of the basis, spirit and interpretation of the CPHS Honor Code, pledge my personal honor. I will uphold this code and its standards in all matters.

Box 1090 Buies Creek, NC 27506 910-814-4909 Mission Statement The mission of the Department of Clinical Research is to educate and train students to meet existing and future clinical research needs; and, to provide leadership to the clinical research industry. The Department of Clinical Research supports the broad mission of Campbell University and the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. Academic Programs The Department of Clinical Research offers a Bachelor and Master of Science in Clinical Research degrees as well as a minor. The Master of Science in Clinical Research degree is offered as an online program. The Clinical Research Program is located forty-five minutes from North Carolina's Research Triangle Park, one of the world's largest and most dynamic research centers. Many world-class research hospitals and organizations in this area look to Campbell's clinical research graduates when recruiting new talent. Bachelor of Science in Clinical Research (BSCR) The Bachelor of Science in Clinical Research degree is ideally suited to prepare students for entry-level jobs in the clinical research industry. Students in the program are required to complete an internship in the clinical research field, which provides them with networking opportunities, potential jobs, and experiential training. The department collaborates with sites primarily located throughout North Carolina and neighboring states to facilitate their placement. Students may choose an internship site based on their future career goals, including academics, clinical settings or research management sites. Many BSCR graduates gain employment as a direct result of their internship experience. Online Master of Science in Clinical Research (MSCR) The Master of Science in Clinical Research degree is an online program. The program is designed to educate students in literature evaluation, study design, research methodologies, data management, and statistical analysis and interpretation. The online environment offers enhanced interaction between peers, faculty and industry professionals. The MSCR program culminates with a research project based on the students' therapeutic interest. Students may work independently or collaborate with another MSCR student. The faculty serve as research project advisors throughout the entire research project experience. This degree prepares graduates to enter the field in positions including data managers, medical writers, clinical research monitors, study coordinators, regulatory affairs specialists, Institutional Review Board (IRB) administrators and project specialists. In addition, many graduates pursue professional degrees within the medical and health sciences fields. 3+2 Program The Department of Clinical Research provides an avenue for students to earn both their Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Clinical Research degrees. While the traditional time to earn both degrees is six years, the 3+2 program places students on a fast track toward completing two degrees in five years, by utilizing two summer sessions. By virtue of pursuing both degrees, the program offers students a competitive edge in the job market and rapid career advancement. Consideration for acceptance into this program, students must meet the following requirements: GPA of 3.0 or higher. All MSCR course prerequisites. See admissions requirements. Summer only admission for 3+2 program. Clinical Research Minor Students pursuing degrees in multiple disciplines will benefit from additional education in Clinical Research to augment their major field of study. These disciplines/programs include: Nursing, Biology, Chemistry, Exercise Science, Pre- Med, Pre-Law, Healthcare Management, Business Administration, and Psychology. To complete the Clinical Research minor, students must complete 21 credit hours of prescribed clinical research courses.The following courses will comprise the Clinical Research Minor: Courses Credit Hours CLNR 324 - Intro to Biostatistics 3 CLNR 330 - Regulatory Affairs I 2 CLNR 338 - Scientific Literature Seminar 2 CLNR 341 - Medical Terminology 1 CLNR 363 - New Product Development 2 CLNR 364 - Principles of Clinical Research 2 CLNR 365 - Managing & Monitoring Clinical Trials I 2 CLNR 379/L - Physical & Clinical Assessment 2 CLNR 450 - Data Management CLNR 3 451 - Scientific & Technical Writing 2 Total 21 Policies & Procedures The policies and procedures found in this section apply to all graduate and professional students within the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences unless otherwise specified and can be found in the General Policies section of the CPHS academic bulletin: Accommodation Anti-Hazing Assignment Grade Appeals Attendance Complaints/Grievances Counseling Criminal Background Check & Drug Screen Dress Code Environmental Health and Safety Grade Reports, Records, and Transcripts Health Insurance Immunization Incident Reporting Inclement Weather Meal Plan Parking Professional Liability Insurance Refunds Safety and Emergency Preparedness Sexual Harassment Social Media Student Health Student Services Technology Devices Tuition & Fees Withdrawal Admissions Policies BSCR Matriculation The students in the pre-pharmacy or equivalent program can declare their major and matriculate into the BSCR degree program. It should be noted that Clini Cal ReseaRC h | 27BSCR students are required to complete a semester-long internship. Most internships are completed at external companies that serve as experiential training sites for CPHS. These institutions may require criminal background checks, substance abuse screenings and/or more stringent immunization requirements. All BSCR students are subject to these types of screenings and the results will be evaluated as detailed in the Criminal Background Check and Substance Abuse Screening policies and procedures outlined in this academic bulletin. MSCR Matriculation The MSCR program is a fully online, year round program with applicants considered for Summer and Fall 1 terms. While the Department operates on rolling admission, individuals should submit their applications by the following deadlines: Summer Admission: April 30 Fall I Admission: July 15 The following requirements and standards are designed to ensure scholastic and professional success in the College's MSCR degree program. Applications for admission to the MSCR degree program are evaluated by the Department of Clinical Research's Admissions committee. Acceptance into the graduate program is based on the overall record and ability of the applicant. There are three pathways to admissions to the MSCR program. Applicants may be considered in one of the following categories: 1. Graduate of a Bachelor's program These applicants are required to have completed their undergraduate degree, from a regionally accredited college or university, prior to matriculation and enrollment in any graduate coursework. Individuals may apply prior to completion of their undergraduate degree and gain acceptance contingent upon completion of the degree. 2. Campbell University undergraduate student pursuing BSCR/MSCR 3+2 Qualified applicants may apply to the MSCR program with the understanding the students will not have a completed degree prior to enrolling in MS coursework as defined in the academic bulletin. Accepted applicants would complete the BS and MS degrees in a five year period as outlined. Please note: The MS degree cannot be conferred upon the students in this category until the requirements of bachelor's degree are met.3. PharmD/MSCR dual degree applicant An applicant with acceptance into the doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) program may apply for the MSCR program to pursue the PharmD/ MSCR dual degree. Since matriculates to the PharmD program are only required to have completed 64 hours of prerequisites, and not required to have an undergraduate degree, these MSCR applicants may enter the program with or without completion of an undergraduate degree prior to enrollment. Accepted applicants have been accepted into both degree programs and normally pursue the degrees over a five-year time period. Students without an undergraduate degree cannot graduate with the MSCR until completion of the requirements of doctor of pharmacy degree or bachelor's degree is met. It should be noted the Admissions Committee continues to review the results of pending coursework, transcripts and behavior during the admissions and matriculation process. The Admissions Committee reserves the right to rescind the offer of admission due to poor performance or unprofessional behavior.

Smith Hall 4150 U.S. Hwy 421 910-893-1842 ipe@campbell.edu Academic Programs The Office of Interprofessional Education (IPE) provides students of all Campbell University health science programs with experiences that allow them to interact and collaborate with one another. Participating Programs IPE events and activities are typically attended by the following programs: Clinical Research Medicine Nursing Pharmaceutical Sciences Pharmacy Practice Physical Therapy Physician Assistant Practice Public Health In addition, other programs such as Law, Business, Social Work and/or Divinity may participate depending on topic. Mission Statement The mission of Interprofessional Education at Campbell University is to equip students to function effectively as members of interprofessional rural health care teams. Vision Campbell University Interprofessional Education aspires to create a robust program in which students practice collaboratively to provide safe, cost- effective, and efficient patient-centered and team-based care. Triple Aim To these ends, the Office of Interprofessional Education centers its strategic plan around the IHI Triple Aim. The framework, designed in 2007 by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, encourages institutions to pursue the following dimensions: Improve the patient experience of care (including quality and satisfaction) Improving the health of populations Reducing the per capita cost of healthcare Curriculum Annual Events & Activities First Year Event - Fall COMBINE - Fall CICS Cases - Fall Activity Day I - Spring Activity Day II - Spring IPE Research Symposium - Spring Event & Activity Descriptions The following events make up the major programming of CUIPE. The first three events are required for all on-campus CPHS students, and the activities that follow are additional, optional opportunities. First Year Event The IPE First Year Event is held every year in September and is specifically geared toward first-year students. Students participate in an event designed to demonstrate the roles and responsibilities of each discipline represented on the interprofessional healthcare team. This event allows students from all programs, outside of their program \"silos,\" to discuss common healthcare issues or concepts. The goal of the event is for students to form collaborative relationships across program boundaries. Health Professions COMBINE All CPHS students attend COMBINE, a conference-style event that focuses on professionalism and leadership. COMBINE is held every October, and features sessions such as Resume Tips & Tricks, Mindfulness & Meditation for Stress Relief, and The Do's and Don'ts of Social Media. This event offers students invaluable opportunities for networking and professional development. COMBINE is a joint effort between the Office of Student Affairs and the Office of Interprofessional Education. Activity Days Every year, students of the health science programs at Campbell University gather together for an event that spans over two different dates in the spring. The Activity Day events are largely supported by the faculty of CPHS and CUSOM, who create, design, and facilitate activities based on their own interests and expertise. Students also have the opportunity to design and facilitate activities. Participants have the freedom to select an activity to attend based on their own interests, and the result is a veritable smorgasbord of interactive sessions focusing on interprofessional concepts and competencies. Examples of sessions include Anthrax Attack; Cultural Competence in Healthcare Practice; Hypertension Cases; New Drug Development; and iOSCE. IPE Research Symposium The annual Interprofessional Education Health Sciences Research Symposium, showcases the research accomplishments of students, residents, and faculty. Every symposium features an esteemed keynote speaker as well as poster awards in a number of categories. Students and faculty are welcome to attend whether they are presenting research or not. CICS CICS, or Campbell Interprofessional Case Studies, are specifically aimed to allow students to practice interprofessional communication, collaboration, and teamwork skills and strategies. In interprofessional groups, students interview a patient (an actor who serves as a standardized patient) and collaborate to identify a diagnosis and create a treatment plan. While diagnosis and treatment make up one of the goals of the case, the main focus is interprofessional collaborative practice. Students benefit not only from receiving feedback about their interviewing, diagnosing, and treatment planning skills; but they also pick up skills from other students, and, most importantly, witness the greater scope of treatment and care across the spectrum of professions. CICS cases are held 4 times throughout the year.40 | 2019-2020 Ac Ademic BulletinNursing Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing Campbell University College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences Tracey F. Smith Hall 4150 U.S. Hwy 421 Creek, NC 27506 Phone: 910-893-1967 Academic Programs The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree at Campbell University provides the students with the training and education necessary to enter the workforce as a registered nurse. The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice [American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), 2008]; Nursing Scope and Standards of Practice (2015) and the regulations from the state of North Carolina provide the framework for the liberal arts and pre- licensure nursing education curriculum and the associated clinical experiences. The Essentials address the core knowledge required of nursing professionals and concepts of patient centered care, interprofessional teams, evidence-based practice, quality improvement, patient safety, informatics, clinical reasoning, cultural sensitivity, professional values and practice across the life span. The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing is dedicated to helping students become the best health care professionals they can be by offering interprofessional education opportunities, top of the line training facilities, and first-hand experience with rural health care needs. Program Philosophy The mission of Campbell University and the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing is to graduate students with exemplary academic and professional skills prepared for purposeful lives and meaningful service as beginning practitioners of nursing. We embrace the concept of a community of learning that is committed to the pursuit, discovery, and dissemination of knowledge. We believe that nursing is a practice discipline that relies on both science and art to provide care that addresses mind, body and spirit. We believe that: The concept of baccalaureate generalist education facilitates the integration of the roles of the nurse as: provider, designer/manager/coordinator of quality, safe care and member of a profession practicing in a variety of health care settings. A learner-centered environment promotes independence, inquiry, and cultivates the relationship between theory, practice and research. The BSN graduate applies scientific principle, nursing process and evidence based practice to reason caring practices that: promote health and well- being, prevent illness and injury across the lifespan in the care of diverse, underserved patients, families, groups and communities. The BSN graduate recognizes the value of interprofessional health care teams, lifelong learning, interdisciplinary collaboration, professional accountability and responsible use of resources. The BSN graduate embraces a holistic, comprehensive practice that includes the relationship between mind, body and spirit. Mission Statement The mission of Campbell University College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS) is to educate students in a Christian environment to be health care professionals who will function effectively as a part of an interdisciplinary team of health care providers to meet existing and future health care needs and who will provide leadership to their profession and professional organizations. The mission statement of the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing is consistent with the missions of Campbell University and the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. Our program mission contains and supports those aspects of the College and University to include leadership, advocacy, service, professionalism, critical inquiry, and interdisciplinary learning. The evidence for Christian principles are within the shared mission through patient-centered care, compassion, ethics, character, and respecting cultural differences.Vision Our graduates will meet future health care needs through the provision of safe, effective quality care, lead purposeful lives and provide meaningful service. Program Objectives Function effectively within nursing and interprofessional teams by fostering open communication, respect and shared decision-making to achieve quality outcomes in patient care. Collect, analyze, and synthesize data to make reasoned judgments about evidence-based interventions and evaluation of outcomes for the care of diverse, underserved patients, families, groups and communities. Assume accountability for quality and safety for one's own practice and delegated nursing care. Demonstrate knowledge of the influence of policy on social determinants of health and lifestyle variations for interventions related to health promotion, risk reduction and disease prevention for individuals, families, groups, communities and populations across the lifespan and across the continuum of health care. Use knowledge of organizations and systems leadership to design, manage, coordinate, collaborate and negotiate a plan of care with the patient/family, interprofessional health care team, and to allocate physical, fiscal and human resources. Behavioral/Social Skills & Professionalism Students in the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing must demonstrate attributes of empathy, compassion, integrity, collegiality, high moral character, excellent interpersonal communication, listening, and self- motivation; as such qualities are assessed throughout the program. Students must exhibit sound judgment in the care of patients and academic inquiry along with developing appropriate and effective patient relations. Additionally, students must be able to function in a collegial environment demonstrating proper levels of assertiveness, task delegation, along with organization and time management skills.

This academic rigor is essential for the assumption that the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing BSN graduate is a safe and effective care provider. Grading Scales - must be completed in the prescribed sequence and within 3 years of matriculation to the BSN Program. 2. A student must earn a grade of at least 2.0 (75) in each nursing course. 3. Rounding of Methods of Evaluation- the calculation of a grade will be based on rounding a score ranging from number + 0.5 below the number to + .49 above the number to the common whole number (Example: A grade of 75 = 74.5 through 75.49; 74 = 73.5 through 74.49). Rounding occurs only for end of course grades. 4. A student earning a grade of less than 2.0 must repeat the course. If a student earns less than 2.0 or in a second nursing course, the student is dismissed from the program and is ineligible for readmission. A nursing course can be repeated one time only. 5. Two course failures within the BSN division results in dismissal from the program with an ineligible status for readmission.6. The expectation is that the students meet each clinical objective/behavior with a satisfactory performance by the end of the course. 7. Unsatisfactory clinical performance constitutes a course failure. Failure in either the clinical or didactic portion of the course results in a failure and necessitates repeating the course. Tuition and Fees Reference the General Information section in this bulletin for more details. There will be additional expenses upon entry to the BSN Degree Program. These may include but are not limited to the following: scrub uniform, Rotation Manager, lab kit, transportation to clinical, cost of NCLEX-RN testing, CPR certification, immunizations, books, supplies and graduation expenses. Financial Aid For information on financial aid availability and application procedures, please contact the student financial planning office at (910) 893-1310 or visit www.campbell.edu/financial-aid. Vehicular Requirements All students of the nursing program are required to provide his/her own transportation to and from the University as well as to the clinical experience sites. Conduct The enrolled student is accountable for all aspects of the current Student Conduct (Professional, Academic and The Honor Code) as defined in the Undergraduate Academic Bulletin and the General Information section of this academic bulletin for the Honor Code. Nursing students are required to read and sign the Honor Code, attesting that they understand the code that they have read and understand the bulletin, and will abide by it. A signed copy of the code will be kept in the students file. Academic Standards A Campbell University academic review convenes in May of each year to review the academic progress of undergraduate students. An \"Academic Warning\" is issued to any student who incurs a quality point deficit between 10 and 34.5 quality points. The student is referred to campus resources for resolution. The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing has additional progression requirements and focused remediation efforts designed to protect the student and public in care delivery situations while assuring a greater opportunity for success. Please refer to Student Handbook for the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing or the CPHS Academic Bulletin for details. Reports on academic performance and progress are generated at the mid-term and completion of each semester. The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing faculty meets at the end of each academic term, or as necessary, to discuss the academic performance of all students. Any discussions regarding type of academic deficiency and remedy occurs with development of an Academic Success Plan and draft of a letter from the program director stating the specific academic standing described in the following sections. The letter is provided to the student via email and hard copy by mail. The letter will contain the following: Description of academic standing (probation, suspension, dismissal) Rationale for academic standing Criteria required to regain good academic standing Contact information of the program director to discuss items outlined in the letter Notification of appeals process Good Academic Standing Students are considered in good academic standing providing: A semester GPA 75 or 2.0 average cumulative grade point (GPA) based on the BSN grading criteria Satisfactory evaluation on the Clinical Evaluation Tool for clinical experiences No violations of student Honor Code or Code of Conduct have occurred No occurrence of a patient safety violation Remediation The CWWSON believes that remediation is a process that begins once a student has failed to achieve a passing score (< 75%) on an exam, assignment or clinical performance (safety violations, NI, or U). The Clinical Instructor and/or CD will identify clinical performance issues that require remediation with specific suggestions for improvement. The student is to reach out to the Course Director or BSN Advisor to develop academic strategies that will result in positive outcomes. Strategies may focus on: study habits, testing strategies, test review, small group remediation or referrals to Counseling, Student Success or those listed on the course syllabi. Faculty may notify the student of low performance through Blackboard, Starfish or email. The student is responsible for the follow through in 44 | 2019-2020 Ac Ademic Bulletinorder to assure academic progression. Should a student fail to improve academic and/or behavioral performance issues, they will receive a failing grade for the course. This will necessitate a delay in the graduation date. Students provide remediation for: A grade of D or F in any single course Continuing Needs/Improvement or Unsatisfactory ranking on the Clinical Evaluation Tool Violations of student Honor Code or Code of Conduct Any patient safety issue throughout the curriculum Academic Probation Academic probation is the initial action for a student failing to make satisfactory academic progress following remediation interventions. A student will be placed on academic probation for: Failure to follow through with the Academic Success Plan (remediation) Continuing Needs Improvement or Unsatisfactory ranking on the Clinical Evaluation Tool A grade of D or F in any single course Repeated violations of the student Honor Code or Code of Conduct Violations of patient safety A student placed on academic probation will remain so until the end of the semester. Students who fail to complete the criteria for lifting academic probation will be considered for suspension or dismissal from the BSN program. The BSN Academic Performance and Standards Committee and program director, with notification to the associate dean for health sciences, will recommend these actions. A recommendation will be made to the program director to restore good academic standing if: A semester GPA 75 or 2.0 average cumulative grade point (GPA) based on the BSN grading criteria is achieved The Starfish Warnings/Academic Success Plan was followed with desired results achieved Satisfactory evaluation on the Clinical Evaluation Tool for clinical experiences No violations of student Honor Code or Code of Conduct have occurred No occurrence of a patient safety violation Academic Suspension Academic suspension from the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing and CPHS are imposed for a specified period of time and must not exceed one year. Suspension occurs when a student has academic deficiencies which preclude continuation in a normal program of study, but may be expected to be able to complete the requirements for the degree under a modified program of study with or without remedial courses. A student on academic suspension is not allowed to continue the standard course of study. The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing Academic Performance and Standards Committee and program director will specify the length of time of the suspension and remedial work required for reinstatement, with approval from the associate dean for health sciences. Academic Dismissal The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing Academic Performance and Standards Committee and program director may recommend academic dismissal to the associate dean for health sciences under the following circumstances: Fails to make satisfactory progress during the period of probation and or suspension. A single egregious and/or knowing violation of patient safety, confidentiality, or professionalism. A student earning a grade of less than a 75 or 2.0 average cumulative grade point (GPA) based on the BSN grading criteria, must repeat the course. If a student earns less than 2.0 in a second nursing course, student dismissal from the BSN Program occurs. This dismissal results in being ineligible for readmission. A repeat of a nursing course occurs one time only. Unsatisfactory clinical performance constitutes a course failure. If a student earns less than 2.0 in a second nursing course, student dismissal from the BSN Program occurs. This dismissal results in being ineligible for readmission. A repeat of a nursing course occurs one time only. Academic Status Appeals At the end of each academic term, the program director will notify each student, the Academic Performance and Standards Committee chair and the associate dean for health sciences of the students that qualify for academic probation, suspension, or dismissal. The Academic Performance and Standards Committee (APSC) evaluate each student that is subject to suspension or dismissal in order to make a recommendation whether to retain or promote the student in the professional program. The student may appear in person before the committee. The Director notifies students in writing regarding any decision by the committee to require a modified course of study, to suspend enrollment, or to dismiss the student from the College and informs the associate dean for health sciences. Students have the opportunity to appeal any decision made by the APSC by submitting a written petition to the associate dean for health sciences within three business days of their receipt of the earned grade. The petition must contain the specific variance requested, a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance, and a proposed course of study and/or conditions for consideration should the variance be granted. The decision of the associate dean for health sciences is final. Grade Appeal Students can initiate an appeal of an assignment grade or final course grade by following the procedure as detailed in the current CPHS Academic Bulletin. Delayed Graduation Policy If a nursing student is required to re-take classes as a result of specific course failure or a deficiency in overall academic performance, then a delay in scheduling nursing clinical experiences or matriculation through the curriculum will occur and the student's graduation is delayed. Voluntary course withdrawals or a temporary leave of absence may cause a delay in scheduling clinical experiences, progress through the curriculum, and a subsequent delay in graduation. Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education-based financial aid. For specific counseling and advice, students should contact the University's Office of Financial Aid. Graduation Requirements Recommendation for graduation requires faculty approval and attainment of the following requirements: 1. Successful completion of all courses, requirements, and remediation 2. Successful completion of all clinical experiential training 3. Attendance of graduation week activities that includes licensure preparation courses and comprehensive curriculum review 4. Attendance at the graduation ceremony is expectedNursiN g | 45The BSN Division Requirements for Graduation Completion of the nursing and general education courses prescribed by the faculty Completion of nursing courses with a minimum grade of 2.0 (75) in each course Attainment of a minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA (see grading scale variation) 25% of semester credit hours in residence at Campbell University Attendance at the graduation ceremony is expected A faculty vote is required to approve students for graduation The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing appoints a faculty advisor for each student to assist the student with program planning and tracking of prerequisites and BSN division requirements. However, the responsibility for assuring that all requirements are met rests solely with the student. Registered Nurse Licensure Exam Requirements The North Carolina Board of Nursing (NC- BON) uses the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX\u00ae) prepared by National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) to measure competence for entry-level practice for graduates of Board-approved nursing education programs. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing has contracted with Pearson VUE to administer NCLEX\u00ae.For more detailed information about the NCLEX, please visit the National Council of State Boards of Nursing's website. Eligibility requirements for examination: Completion of a member Board approved RN nursing education program Application for licensure to state Board of Nursing Registration with Pearson Vue is required prior to the release of an Authorization to Test (ATT) All applicants must complete a criminal background check prior to the issuance of a license The Board of Nursing determines if the student with a prior criminal conviction is allowed to sit for the NCLEX-RN exam. Please note that conferring a degree to a student who has completed the curriculum does not guarantee that the Board of Nursing will issue an Authorization to Test.Curriculum The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice [American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), 2008]; Nursing Scope and Standards of Practice (2015) provide the framework for the development of the liberal arts and pre-licensure nursing education curriculum and the associated clinical experiences. The Essentials address the core knowledge required of nursing professionals and concepts of patient centered care, interprofessional teams, evidence-based practice, quality improvement, patient safety, informatics, clinical reasoning, cultural sensitivity, professional values and practice across the life span. The practice experience in the final two years enhances the connections with didactic content and facilitates growth across the curriculum. The rationale for sequencing of courses facilitates moving from the simple to the complex. Students begin their nursing courses by learning to assess and plan care for meeting basic needs of the independent community based adult followed by the nursing home resident at variable levels of required skill. Upon completion of the program, students are working as a team member to organize, implement, collaborate and evaluate nursing care for groups of patients/families, community groups and populations. The student evaluations demonstrate increasing expectations in clinical performance.46 | 2019-2020 Ac Ademic BulletinFreshman Year Semester 1 Courses Credit Hours ENGL 101 - Academic Writing 3 HIST 111 or 112 - Western Civilization I or II 3 BIOL 111 - Basic Biology 4 NURS 100 - Nursing 1 PE 185 - Lifetime Wellness 2 MATH 111 (or greater) 3 Total 16Semester 2 Courses Credit Hours CUC 100 - Connections 0.5 ENGL 102 - Academic Writing & Literature 3 PSYC 222 - General Psychology 3 BIOL 275 - Clinical Microbiology 4 CHRS 125 - Intro to Christianity 3 A/M/T 131 - Intro to Art, Music, or Theater 3 Total 16.5 Sophomore Year Semester 1 Courses Credit Hours CUC 200 - Connections 0.5 SOCI 225 - Principles of Sociology 3 BIOL 285 - Human Anatomy & Physiology I 4 PSYC 260 - Developmental Psychology 3 ELECTIVE*(Humanities) 3 Total 13.5 *It is strongly recommended that students take CHRS 224 - Christian Ethics.Semester 2 Courses Credit Hours ENGL 2XX - Literature 3 BIOL 286 - Human Anatomy & Physiology II 4 COMM 261 - Team & Small Group Communication 3 MATH 160 - Statistics 3 ELECTIVES 4 Total 17 Junior Year Semester 1 Courses Credit Hours NURS 300 - Professional Nursing Practice 2 NURS 310 - Health Assessment 3 NURS 320 - Fundamentals of Nursing Practice with Older Adults 6 NURS 330 - Concepts of Pathophysiology & Pharmacology I 4 Total 15Semester 2 Courses Credit Hours NURS 350 - Research & Evidence Based Practice 3 NURS 360 - Adult Health Nursing Practice I 5 NURS 370 - Psychiatric & Mental Health Nursing Practice 4 NURS 340 - Concepts of Pathophysiology & Pharmacology II 4 Total 16 Senior Year Semester 1 Courses Credit Hours NURS 400 - Adult Health Nursing Practice II 5 NURS 410 - Nursing Practice of Women & Children 6 NURS 420 - Leadership in Nursing 3 NURS 430 - Health Policy 2 Total 16Semester 2 Courses Credit Hours NURS 450 - Population Health 4 NURS 460 - Focused Patient Experience Practicum 6 NURS 470 - Transitions to the Role of the Professional Nurse 3 NURS 475 - Managing Healthcare for Vulnerable Populations 2 NURS 480 - Nursing Informatics 2 Total 17NursiN g | 47Course Descriptions NURS 100 - Success in Nursing Seminar Credit: 1 hour The design of the course is an introduction to the profession of nursing and to the Catherine W.

The Admissions Committee reserves the right to rescind the offer of admission due to poor performance or unprofessional behavior. Academic Standards BS in Pharmaceutical Sciences Academic standards and grade appeals for undergraduate programs are specified in the Campbell University's Undergraduate Academic Bulletin. MS in Pharmaceutical Sciences The academic success of our students is of utmost importance in the MSPS program in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences. The main purpose of the PS Graduate Academic Performance & Standards (GAPS) policy is to identify and alert students with low academic performance as early as possible and provide assistance to improve their performance to successfully finish the program. 1. Students must have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 in all MSPS courses to graduate from the program, and all courses (Core courses, track-specific course and electives) must be completed with a grade of C or better. Earning any credits of D or F will result in dismissal. 2. Students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 to remain in good 50 | 2019-2020 Ac Ademic Bulletinacademic standing. Failure to maintain this minimum GPA will result in a probationary period, not exceeding one semester. The student will be dismissed if the required cumulative GPA has not been achieved at the end of the probationary period. 3. Any student on academic probation is automatically ineligible to: -Hold or run for elected office in student professional organizations; -Represent the University in any capacity either on campus or away from campus at a scientific conference; -Compete for honors, distinctions, and scholarships; -Hold any job within the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences; -Conduct any research (e.g., 504, 610, and 620). 4. Students dismissed from the program may appeal to the MSPS Graduate Academic Performance and Standards (GAPS) Committee to be reinstated. Upon reinstatement, any course with a grade of D or F must be repeated at the next course offering, unless the Committee otherwise allows. 5. Students must complete all coursework within seven (7) years of entering the MSPS program. The chair of the GAPS Committee will periodically review students' files and forward his/her findings to the director of pharmaceutical sciences programs. The director in turn will notify the student in writing or by email concerning any change in his/her standing in the program. A student may appeal the dismissal to the Committee (see Rule 3 above). The student must submit a written or email petition to the chair of the GAPS Committee within three (3) business days of the student's receipt of notification of the dismissal. The student's failure to submit the petition letter within three (3) business days is acknowledgement of dismissal. The petition must contain the specific variance requested, a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance, and a proposed course of study and/or conditions for consideration should the variance be granted. The Committee's recommendations are forwarded to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs of the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences for a review. The Committee's chair will notify the student in writing or by email concerning the Committee's recommendations. The student can appeal the committee's decision to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Within three (3) business days of their receipt of notification. The Associate Dean's decision is final. MSPS Program Remediation Policy 1. The primary goal of remediation should be to make up a student's deficiencies in a single unit exam, project, or homework assignment rather than to improve his/her GPA. 2. Only students with an earned final course grade lower than a C (less than 70%) due to poor performance on a single unit exam, project, or homework assignment must be offered remediation, and the highest grade that can be achieved after remediation would be a C. This would discourage students from using remediation as a second chance to significantly enhance their GPAs. 3. Instructors should complete the remediation process as soon as practically possible, e.g., during Christmas break for Fall courses or during the month of May for Spring courses. In addition, instructors must notify the Department Chair and the Chair of the Graduate Academic Performance & Standards (GAPS) Committee of any remediating student and provide an expected completion date. 4.

In addition to academic performance, the Admissions Committee places emphasis on personal merit, leadership, community involvement, maturity, communication skills, diverse pharmacy work, and dedication to professional goals. Admissions Criteria Applicants must complete a minimum of 64 credit hours prior to matriculation into the doctor of pharmacy program. All required pre-professional academic work must be completed at an accredited college or university in the United States. All prerequisite courses must be completed with earned grades of \"C\" or higher. A minimum grade point average of 2.5 on a 4.0 scale in all coursework attempted will be considered for admission into the program. Students with a bachelor's degree from an accredited United States institution are only required to complete the economics, public speaking, math and science prerequisites. The bachelor's degree must be conferred prior to matriculation into the program. Students who have not earned a bachelor's degree are required to meet the non-science prerequisites as well as the economics, public speaking, math and science prerequisites. Electives coursework may include basic science, math, or liberal arts courses; however, advanced science coursework (chemistry, biological sciences, pharmaceutical sciences and clinical sciences) are beneficial in building a strong foundation for the doctor of pharmacy program. Candidates for admission to the College's doctor of pharmacy program must also meet the requirements listed in the Technical Standards for Admission & Matriculation section of this bulletin. Science and Math Requirements Calculus (3 credit hours) Examples: Calculus I, Analytical Geometry, Calculus Statistics (3 credit hours) Physics* (4 credit hours) Physics for health professions majors (does not need to be calculus based) General Chemistry* (8 credit hours) Organic Chemistry* (8 credit hours) Biological Sciences* (12 credit hours) General Biology (4 credit hours) Human Anatomy & Physiology with lab (4 credit hours) One course covering the whole body (i.e., Essentials of Human Anatomy and Physiology) or a two-course progression (i.e., Human Anatomy and Physiology parts I and II).

Application Deadline Beginning each fall, members of the next class are selected using a modified rolling admissions procedure. Under this system, qualified applicants are admitted into the doctor of pharmacy program on an ongoing basis until the class is filled. Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit all required admissions documents early in the admissions cycle to maximize their admissions potential. Applications received after November 1 face significantly increased competition for 60 | 2019-2020 Ac Ademic Bulletinadmission and may be placed on a waiting list, regardless of qualifications. The final deadline for applications is June 1; all information must be received by this date. Application Process All material must be received by June 1. Complete online PharmCAS application at www.pharmcas.org. Submit all official transcripts to PharmCAS. Submit Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT) scores to PharmCAS. Information on the PCAT may be obtained at www.pcatweb.info. Submit three letters of recommendation to PharmCAS. At least one letter from a science professor and a pharmacist is strongly preferred. Submit supplemental application and a business headshot to CPHS. The applicant is responsible for ensuring the timely receipt and updating of all required application documentation. A file will not be reviewed by the Admissions Committee until all application materials have been received by the Admissions Office. PharmCAS Applicants must submit an application through the Pharmacy College Application Service (PharmCAS) online at www. pharmcas.org. Original official transcripts from all US post-secondary schools (including the planned fall courses) and Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT) scores must be submitted to PharmCAS. All college coursework attempted must be submitted to PharmCAS. For applicants currently enrolled in classes, it is imperative to update newly completed coursework. When fall grades are available the applicant must submit official transcripts to PharmCAS in order to update their application. Transcripts reflecting spring grades must be sent directly to the CPHS Admissions Office. Applicants are also required to submit three letters of recommendations to PharmCAS. At least one letter from a science professor and a pharmacist is strongly preferred. Applicants gaining acceptance to the doctor of pharmacy program are required to submit to a urine drug screen and a criminal background check through the PharmCAS system. Results of these screens which violate policies and procedures of CPHS, Campbell University or one of the affiliated institutions may have a negative impact on the candidate's ability to matriculate into the program.It should be noted the Admissions Committee continues to review the results of pending coursework, test scores and behavior during the admissions and matriculation process. The Admissions Committee reserves the right to rescind the offer of admission due to poor performance or unprofessional behavior. Supplemental Materials A supplemental application and business headshot must be submitted to CPHS. The supplemental application is available online at www.cphs.campbell.edu. Failure to complete the required supplemental components of the admissions process will delay the review of the application package until all elements are completed. Interviews Completed application packages are evaluated by the Admissions Committee to determine the applicant's potential as a student pharmacist. Based on this evaluation, an invitation to participate in a personal admissions interview may be extended. The interview process incorporates a multiple mini interview (MMI) format. This interview style is composed of six stations and is designed to assess non-cognitive qualities, such as communication skills, critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and leadership. The applicant will participate in six MMI stations. Each station lasts 7 minutes, with a short break in between interviews. MMI interviews are moderated by faculty, alumni, staff, clinicians, and/or residents affiliated with CPHS. Applicants are notified by email of admissions decisions following the interview process. Early Decision Program An Early Decision Program is available for eligible applicants and the deadline for Early Decision is determined by PharmCAS. Through this option, applicants select one school as their preference through PharmCAS. The college and the student have the potential to benefit from this program by confirming admissions and enrollment for qualified applicants early in the admissions process. To be eligible for the Early Decision Program at Campbell, the applicant must have taken the PCAT examination by September 30. The completed PharmCAS application with the Early Decision designation along with three letters of recommendation, the supplemental application (fee waived for Early Decision applicants) and photograph must be submitted by the first Tuesday after the U.S. Labor Day holiday.All materials must be forwarded to the appropriate locations prior to the Early Decision deadline in order to be considered as an Early Decision candidate. A decision will be rendered by the deadline specified by PharmCAS. Valid admissions decisions for an Early Decision candidate consist of: acceptance, denial or deferral of the applicant to the general applicant pool (applicant becomes eligible to apply to other pharmacy programs while still being considered by their primary preference). Technical Standards for Admission & Matriculation The Accreditation Council on Pharmaceutical Education (ACPE), the accrediting body for colleges and schools of pharmacy, requires that doctor of pharmacy curricula meet standards and guidelines which emphasize a strong scientific foundation and practice-based competency. The pharmacy curriculum is designed to develop caring and competent pharmacists, practitioners who assume responsibility for safe and effective medication use in patients. The pharmacy curriculum is also designed to produce pharmacists who are collaborative partners in the care of patients within an interdisciplinary health care system. Technical Standards refer to nonacademic admissions and matriculation criteria that are essential to participation in the doctor of pharmacy program. All students must possess the intellectual, ethical, physical, and emotional capabilities required to undertake the full curriculum and to achieve the levels of competence required by the faculty. The technical standards described below are essential functions and therefore prerequisites for entrance, continuation, promotion, and graduation from the doctor of pharmacy program, with or without appropriate accommodations in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Candidates for admission to and graduation from the Campbell University College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences doctor of pharmacy Program must possess the following abilities: Observation The candidate/student-pharmacist must be able to observe required lectures, demonstrations and experiments, including but not limited to microscopic studies, pharmaceutical lab instruction (technical quality of prepared and Pharmacy | 61compounded materials), and patient care demonstrations (physical observation and physical assessment). A candidate/ student-pharmacist must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand, noting non-verbal and verbal signals. Observation necessitates functional use of vision, hearing and somatic senses. The candidate/student- pharmacist must be capable of remaining alert and attentive at all times in the clinical setting. Communication A candidate/student-pharmacist must be able to effectively speak, read and write in English. Visual and auditory senses must be intact to detect verbal and nonverbal communication signals. A candidate/student-pharmacist must be able to elicit information from and communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. Motor Abilities A candidate/student-pharmacist must have sufficient motor function to carry out the basic laboratory experiments and physical assessment. The candidate/ student-pharmacist must be able to carry out duties within the classroom, laboratory, pharmacy and clinic settings. Motor function must be sufficient to perform fundamental patient care, such as required for disease prevention, drug therapy monitoring, emergency treatment, general care and basic physical assessment (e.g. blood pressure assessment, palpation for edema, injection of vaccines, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, etc.). Motor function must also be sufficient to perform drug distribution duties in both a community and hospital pharmacy setting. Candidates/student-pharmacists must have the ability to maintain aseptic technique in the preparation of sterile materials. This will require the ability to work under a laminar flow hood and in sterile rooms. Candidates must possess the motor function sufficient to direct and supervise the accurate compounding and preparation of medications for dispensing to patients. A candidate/student pharmacist must be able to safely and effectively operate various types of laboratory and patient care equipment such as weights and balance, a glucose meter, stethoscope and sphygmomanometer. They must be able to use computer-based information systems. These motor actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium and functional use of the senses of touch, vision, and hearing. Additionally, some aspects of patient care require that the student-pharmacist be able to act quickly and speed of motor function may be an essential requirement. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative, and Quantitative Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of pharmacists, requires that a candidate/student-pharmacist be able to learn, retrieve, analyze, sequence, organize, synthesize and integrate information efficiently, and reason effectively. In addition a candidate/ student-pharmacist should possess the ability to measure and calculate accurately, to perceive three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. Behavioral and Social Attributes A candidate must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of his/ her intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients and their family members, staff, and colleagues. Each candidate must be able to work effectively as a member of a health- care team. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, collegiality, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admission and education processes. Equal Access to the CPHS Doctor Of Pharmacy Program In accordance with Campbell University's nondiscrimination policy, the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences does not discriminate against otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities who apply for admission to the doctor of pharmacy program. It is recognized that the on-site interview may not adequately evaluate a student's ability to meet the technical standards. Students who are unsure that they meet the technical standards because of a disability are responsible for disclosing that to the Campbell University Office of Student Success. The Director of Disability Services in that office will consult with the student regarding possible accommodations. At the time an applicant accepts an offer to the CPHS doctor of pharmacy program, students must attest in writing that they are able to meet the CPHS Doctor of Pharmacy Program Technical Standards for Admission & Matriculation with or without accommodations. Students will continue to attest in writing during orientation through the fourth year that they are still able to meet the standard. The CPHS Doctor of Pharmacy Program is committed to providing reasonable accommodation to ensure that equal access is provided to all otherwise qualified students in the course of study leading to the doctor of pharmacy degree and licensure. Accommodations Accepted students with a disability who believe they may require accommodations to meet these standards should contact the Campbell University Director of Disability Services immediately upon accepting the offer of admission. The Director of Disability Services will consult with CPHS faculty and administration to determine what reasonable accommodations can be made. Candidates pursuing the academic program who lack the ability to appropriately meet these standards and who do not seek accommodations may place themselves in academic jeopardy. The use of an intermediary, a person trained to perform essential skills on behalf of the student, is not permitted. Should a candidate develop a condition during their education in the doctor of pharmacy program that would affect their ability to meet the above technical standards, they must contact the Director of Disability Services to determine whether or not a reasonable accommodation can be made. Again, candidates pursuing the academic program who lose the ability to appropriately meet these standards and who do not seek accommodations may place themselves in academic jeopardy. The Director of Disability Services will meet with the student to discuss areas of concern. The Director will then develop an accommodation plan, consulting regularly with the CPHS Office of Academic Affairs, the CPHS Office of Admissions & Student Affairs, the CPHS Office of Experiential Education, the CPHS Pharmacy Practice Department, and other offices as needed 62 | 2019-2020 Ac Ademic Bulletinduring the process. The accommodation plan will require the approval of the above departments, Student Success, and the student. Appeals Process Accepted students who are unable to meet the Technical Standards, with or without accommodation, will not be offered admission and will be notified by the Admissions Committee. Enrolled students who are found not to meet the Technical Standards, with or without accommodation, will be evaluated by the CPHS Academic Performance and Standards Committee and will use the appeals process for that committee's work. Student-pharmacists who disagree with an accommodation decision made by the office of Student Success will use that office's grievance process which can be found in the \"Student Guide to Accessing Disability Services\" on the Student Success website. The above standards mirror our current CPHS PA program technical standards and were modified based on language incorporated from the Technical Standards documents of University of Mississippi, University of Iowa, Kentucky University, and University of California, San Francisco schools of pharmacy. Academic Standards Retention and Promotion Criteria Students enrolled in the doctor of pharmacy program at the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences are expected to make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of the degree requirements. Satisfactory academic progress is defined as successful completion in the prescribed time, maintenance of a 2.2 semester grade point average (SGPA), professionally required course grade point average (PGPA), and a cumulative grade point average (CGPA), and completion of any professional deficiencies and/or required remedial courses in the time and manner prescribed. PGPA calculations are based only on professionally required courses, and do not include grades earned in elective courses. Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress in the professional program are automatically placed on academic probation. A letter from the Academic Performance & Standards Committee will be sent to students placed on academic probation containing specific guidance. These letters are individualized and may contain specific actions that must be taken as well as helpful suggestions to assist each student. Students may be required to meet with an assigned contact to develop an academic contract, to participate in academic counseling, or to be enrolled in a remedial program of study. Demonstration of continued poor academic performance by students on probation could result in suspension or dismissal as indicated by the policies described in the subsequent sections. Such actions will be determined by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee, with notification to the associate dean for academic affairs. The student will be notified of these actions by the chair of the Academic Performance and Standards Committee. Students on academic probation or suspension are required to meet with the Support Services Senior Coordinator to complete a CPHS success plan. Actions taken in these matters are not to be viewed as punitive, but as a recognition that it is unrealistic to continue in a course of study where there is little probability of success. These same standards will be applied to students enrolled in an approved part-time course of study. 1. Academic Probation Academic probation is the initial action for a student failing to make satisfactory academic progress. A student will be placed on academic probation for: Failure to maintain a minimum SGPA of 2.20; Failure to maintain a PGPA of 2.20; Failure to maintain a CGPA of 2.20; A failing grade in a professionally required course; Two or more \"D\" grades in professionally required courses in one semester; Unauthorized failure to complete any degree requirement at the prescribed time. Depending on the nature of the academic deficiencies and overall academic record, a student placed on academic probation may or may not be permitted to continue in the regular sequence of the professional curriculum. A student failing a course in sequence may be permitted to take the next course in the sequence, if directed by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee as part of a modified course of study, or by gaining written permission from the associate dean for academic affairs. Students placed on academic probation have two weeks from the notification from APSC to meet with the Support Services Senior Coordinator to develop a CPHS success plan. Failure to do so may result in suspension or dismissal from the program. If a student fails a professionally required course, it must be repeated during the next term the course is offered. A student placed on academic probation is typically given one semester to correct any grade point deficiencies. The Academic Performance and Standards Committee will review the student's record at the end of the term of probation: If the SGPA and PGPA for that term are 2.20 or above, and the CGPA is 2.20 or above, the student will be released from academic probation. If SGPA and PGPA are 2.20 or above, but the CGPA is below 2.20, the student will remain on academic probation. A student remaining on academic probation for more than two consecutive semesters will be subject to suspension or dismissal. If a student fails to make satisfactory progress during the period of academic probation, and/or fails to correct academic deficiencies, within the prescribed time, that student will be subject to automatic suspension and may be dismissed from CPHS. 2. Academic Suspension Academic Suspension from CPHS occurs when a student: Has failed to make satisfactory progress as demonstrated by SGPA or PGPA less than 2.20, or received more than a single \"D\" grade in a professionally required course during a period of academic probation; Has academic deficiencies which preclude continuation in a normal program of study, but may be expected to be able to complete the requirements for the degree under a modified program of study with or without remedial courses; Has received a failing grade in any two professionally required courses. Suspensions are imposed for a specified period of time and must not exceed one year. A student on academic suspension is not allowed to continue the standard course of study. The Academic Performance and Standards Committee will specify the length of time of the suspension, remedial work required for reinstatement, and the program of study required upon re-instatement. Students Pharmacy | 63placed on academic suspension have two weeks from the notification from APSC to meet with the Support Services Senior Coordinator to develop a CPHS success plan. Failure to do so may result in dismissal from the program. 3. Academic dismissal Academic dismissal from CPHS will occur when a student: Fails to make satisfactory progress during a period of academic probation or suspension; Has academic deficiencies which preclude continuation in the prescribed program of study and may not reasonably be expected to complete the requirements of the degree. Except under very extenuating circumstances, academic dismissal will be recommended if a student: Was previously suspended from the College and again failed to make satisfactory academic progress; Is on academic suspension under a remedial course of study and again fails to make satisfactory academic progress as demonstrated by SGPA or PGPA less than 2.20, or earns more than a single D-grade in professionally required courses for that term; Fails a single professionally required course more than one time, or accumulates two or more failures in professionally required courses; Accumulates a grade point deficiency which reasonably precludes the possibility of completing the degree requirements. A student dismissed from the College may seek re-entry by applying for re-admission using the standard admissions process. *PGPA and the grade D are used only for the Class of 2020 Academic Status Appeals At the end of each academic term, the Academic Performance and Standards Committee chair reviews the academic performances of all students enrolled in CPHS. The chair notifies each student who does not meet the academic standards as defined by the academic regulations at CPHS. The College's associate dean for academic affairs is also notified. Each student subject to suspension or dismissal is evaluated by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee in order to determine whether to retain or promote the student in the professional program. The student may appear in person before the committee. The chair of the Academic Performance and Standards Committee notifies students in writing regarding any decision by the committee to require a modified course of study, to suspend enrollment, or to dismiss the student from the College and informs the associate dean for academic affairs and associate dean of admissions & student affairs. Students have the opportunity to appeal any decision made by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee by submitting a written petition to the associate dean for academic affairs within three days of their receipt of notification. The petition must contain the specific variance requested, a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance, and a proposed course of study and/or conditions for consideration should the variance be granted. The decision of the associate dean for academic affairs is final. Any student on probation or suspension for a stated period is automatically ineligible to: Hold or run for elected office in student professional organizations; Represent the University in any capacity either on campus or away from campus (see policy below for additional information); Compete for honors and distinctions; Participate as an elected representative or member of an honorary organization; Obtain reimbursement monies from any funders in the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (see policy below for additional information). Event Attendance Policy While on any level of probation or suspension, students are unable to represent the university in any outside event such as regional or national conferences/meetings. A student may appeal this decision by submitting a written petition to the Academic Performance and Standards Committee addressing the conference or meeting they desire to attend, why they want to attend this meeting, how attendance at this meeting would benefit their education and provide documentation of how they have improved their academic studies during the semester. Reimbursement Policy While on any level of probation or suspension, students are unable to receive any reimbursement monies from any funders in the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. The student's academic status will be confirmed upon any request for such funds. Remediation Policy for Class of 2021 & Beyond The goal of this remediation policy is to provide the underperforming student with a means to overcome any deficiencies in achieving the competency in the required course material if failure of one examination in one course results in course failure. The student is expected to seek individualized assistance during the course as needed. Students having academic difficulties should utilize tutoring services and meet with the course director/instructor for guidance. Remediation is only available for course failure related to academic performance and not failures due to academic dishonesty, honor code violations, or other professionalism issues. eligibility: 1. A student is eligible for remediation if they fail a required course based on underperformance on a single examination. A student is NOT eligible for remediation if failure is based on lack of attendance, multiple examination failures, or failure to complete assigned work. 2. Students may remediate only one course assessment during the remediation period. 3. A student is allowed only one attempt at remediation for a given course. 4. Students will be allowed to remediate no more than three times during years one to three of the professional degree program with no more than one course remediated in the same block. A student is not allowed to remediate a fourth didactic course and is automatically dismissed from the program. This dismissal may be appealed within three days of notification to the Academic Performance and Standards Committee (APSC) and then to the associate dean for academic affairs within three days of notification. Procedures and Grading: 1. The remediation process occurs during the week between each block and the week at the end of an academic semester. 2. Remediation procedures will include assessment as deemed appropriate by the course director. The student and the course director/instructor will agree upon the remediation plan. Examples 64 | 2019-2020 Ac Ademic Bulletinof plan content may include items such as exam date, meeting times, or assignments. 3. Students may not remediate and take an IPPE or an APPE at the same time. 4. A student who is unsuccessful at remediation will earn a failing grade and will be required to retake the course either utilizing the Course Repeat policy or the next time the course is offered. 5. The student is required to achieve a score of 70% or better for the assessment. The maximum score recorded for the assessment is 70%. The new grade will replace the failed examination in the calculation of the course grade. Failure to pass the course after remediation will result in an F grade in the course and a requirement to retake the course. 6. Multiple course failures in a block/ semester will prevent student progression and require repeating the unsuccessful block/semester after review and recommendation by the APSC. Course Repeat Policy After a Failure Occurs If a student fails a course despite the efforts made for early academic difficulty detection, re-taking of the course will be required. The student may be allowed to re-take the course during summer session or may be required to re-take the course during the next academic year when the course is regularly offered. The determination will be made by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee (APSC) and the decision can be appealed within three days of notification to the associate dean for academic affairs, College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. As directed by the APSC, the student may take the course again in the following summer session after the original course was taken. For example, if a student fails PHAR/PHRD XXX, he/she will register for and re-take it as a summer course. This will result in additional tuition charges for the summer course, which may be assessed on a per-credit hour basis. A student may only take the course by authorization of the APSC and approval by the CPHS associate dean for academic affairs. The repeated course will be a Summer Session III registered course. The actual duration and schedule for the course will be determined by the course director. It is recommended that the course duration meets the following criteria: a minimum of 1 week per credit hour and a maximum of 2 weeks per credit hour. The repeated course should be similar in scope and content to the original course. The course will be available to the student primarily as a self-directed module with the student(s) viewing the lectures that were recorded at the time the student was originally enrolled in the course. The course will be supplemented with weekly conferences with the instructor(s) to ensure student progress. Weekly conferences with the instructor(s) may be held in person, via email, by phone, or with other technology (at the discretion of the individual instructor). A comparable number of exams should be administered during the repeated course. Exams may be of a different format, with a different number of questions; however, the exams should cover the same material covered during the regular course. Exams may be given via ExamSoft. The student will be required to take all course exams ON CAMPUS as offered through the course director or his/her affiliate. Exam dates will be communicated at the beginning of the course. Exam dates, office hours, or conference times with the instructor(s) will also be specified in the syllabus. Whether the student passes or fails the remediation course, his or her progression in the curriculum will be determined by the APSC. In addition, any student who has NOT failed a course, but has a cumulative GPA lower than 2.2, may also take a repeated course if it is recommended by the APSC and approved by the CPHS associate dean for academic affairs. Students will only be allowed to take 1 summer course per summer. If greater than 1 course is required for matriculation, the student should repeat any additional courses during the regularly scheduled Fall/Spring semester. Students may only take a summer course when recommended by the APSC. Academic Progression for Class of 2020 In the event of academic probation, suspension or other academic issues for students matriculating in the previous curriculum, the College will work with the student pharmacist and make reasonable accommodations that allow the student pharmacist to matriculate in the curriculum in which they started. If a student pharmacist has multiple deficiencies as defined in the academic standards published in the CPHS academic bulletin, then the student pharmacist may be dismissed from the program. In the event of multiple deficiencies, the student pharmacist may be allowed to remediate up to two of these deficiencies during summer school per approval of the Academic Performance and Standards Committee (APSC) and the associate dean of academic affairs. If a decision is made by APSC and the associate dean of academic affairs to allow the student pharmacist to continue with more than two deficiencies, the remaining deficiencies will need to be corrected during the fall and/or spring semesters either when the courses are repeated or as an independent study after the courses are no longer offered. If the deficiencies cannot be corrected by independent study, the student pharmacist will be required to restart the curriculum beginning with the P1 year. Advancement to a Higher Class Advancement to a higher class requires: to a Second Professional Year 1. A cumulative grade point average of 2.20 or higher 2. Completion of all first professional year courses 3. Completion of all pre-professional requirements 4. Exceptions may be granted by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee and/or the associate dean for academic affairs to a t hird Professional Year 1. A cumulative grade point average of 2.20 or higher 2. Completion of all second professional year courses 3. Exceptions may be granted by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee and/or the associate dean for academic affairs to a Fourth Professional Year 1. A cumulative grade point average of 2.20 or higher 2. Completion of all third professional year courses Delayed Graduation Policy If a student pharmacist is required to re- take a class as a result of specific course failure or a deficiency in overall academic performance, then a delay in scheduling their introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPE) or advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) will occur and the student's graduation may be delayed. Voluntary course withdrawals or a temporary leave of absence will also cause a delay in scheduling the IPPE or APPE and a delay in graduation. Any alteration in Pharmacy | 65the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education-based financial aid. For specific counseling and advice students should contact the College's Office of Academic Affairs and the University's Office of Financial Aid. Policy examples: If a student is forced to withdraw from any or all courses in the fall semester, then he or she returns to a delayed schedule in fall of the next year (delaying graduation by one year). To prevent entering financial aid repayment, or \"grace period,\" a student may be able to register for six credits (half- time) of elective or required courses in the spring semester. Specific approval of this modified course plan must be obtained from the College's Office of Academic Affairs and the University's Office of Financial Aid. A single course in each semester of the P-2 year may be repeated simultaneously with full time registration as a P-3 student. Approval must be obtained from the College's Office of Academic Affairs. A need to repeat two or more courses in either semester of the P-2 year may prevent simultaneous enrollment with P-3 coursework. In such cases, progression to the P-3 year will be delayed and graduation will be postponed by one year. Counseling with respect to financial aid considerations must be obtained. Student pharmacists are not allowed to start any P-4 APPE until he or she has successfully completed all P-1, P-2, and P-3 courses, including Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPE). However, the student would not be able to complete any P-4 APPE until he or she has successfully completed all P-1, P-2, and P-3 courses, including Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPE), and (PHAR 508). Assuming that all courses are passed successfully in the P-3 spring semester, a student would be able to begin APPEs after repeating necessary fall courses. This would allow the student to begin APPEs in January of the following year, possibly qualifying for graduation in December depending on available APPE sites. In order to forestall educational loan repayment, a student must enroll at least half-time (six credit hours) when repeating fall courses. If a student fails any P-3 courses in the spring semester, he or she will be prevented from starting his or her APPE rotations until he or she has successfully repeated the courses the following spring. After the student has successfully completed the required courses, he or she may begin his or her APPE immediately subject to preceptor and site availability. If a student begins these experiences in March, he or she may be able to graduate in December. If the student begins in May, he or she cannot graduate until the following May (one year later). If a student fails any P-3 courses, any APPE schedule in place at that time will be entirely cancelled and re-scheduling of all APPE will be necessary (without exception). If a student fails one or more courses, IPPE or APPE rotations, it may be necessary to delay his or her graduation due to limited course offerings or unavailability of appropriate training sites. It currently is not possible for a student to complete a rotation during the months of May, August, or December and also graduate during that month because University graduation certification occurs in the middle of each month. Transfer Students CPHS does not accept transfer students directly into the doctor of pharmacy program. The College utilizes a process to evaluate potential students that may differ from other programs. In addition, there is a great deal of heterogeneity among doctor of pharmacy curricula across the nation. The scheduling difficulties for correcting potential course deficits become extremely complicated. Furthermore, the College could only consider such requests if space becomes available due to a decrease in the number of enrolled students; therefore, CPHS has determined that accepting transfer students with advanced standing is not in the best interest of the student nor the College. The College feels it would not be providing consistent opportunity for all students. As a result, students currently enrolled in a doctor of pharmacy program in the United States should apply to CPHS as an entry-level student. Interested individuals must follow the procedures for admission. Applicants must be in good academic standing and have a letter from the dean of their institution supporting the request. These admissions decisions will be handled in the same manner as all other applicants to the College by the actions of the Admissions Committee.Any individual admitted to CPHS who has completed coursework in another doctor of pharmacy program or another graduate/ professional degree may formally request transfer of credits. All accepted transfer students seeking \"advanced standing\" through the transfer of credits must submit a formal request as outlined in the policy and procedure for course transfer and waiver in the CPHS Academic Bulletin. All prerequisites must be met prior to matriculation to the doctor of pharmacy program at Campbell University.

Experiential Training Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences Following successful completion of all required coursework in the preceding academic year, student pharmacists complete introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPE) each summer between their academic semesters. Between the P-1 and P-2 years, students complete a one month community rotation and between the P-2 and P-3 years, they complete a one month hospital rotation. Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences In the final year of the curriculum, P-4 students are divided into four geographic areas to complete nine advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs). These regions include: Buies Creek/Fayetteville Greenville Raleigh/Durham Winston-Salem/Greensboro During experiential training, students are responsible for all travel expenses, housing arrangements, and incidental expenses such as parking fees. Information regarding expenses associated with each training site may be obtained from the Office of Professional & Experiential Education (OPEE). The OPEE makes every effort to secure availability based on the student's in- region preference; however, student pharmacists must be prepared to fulfill training requirements wherever they are assigned. The OPEE does not guarantee placement at a site. Registration of Rotations and Billing The OPEE will register students and submit grades for all IPPEs and APPEs.Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences & Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences Student pharmacists with any CU Business Office hold on their student accounts cannot register for the next semester; therefore, they will not be able to start any rotation (IPPE or APPE) until the CU Business office has cleared the student through the CPHS Office of Academic Affairs. Student pharmacists who successfully complete all required prerequisite work in the first and second years will complete a one month (160 hour) introduction to community and introduction to hospital rotation, respectively. Students will earn either a grade of pass (P) or fail (F) in an IPPE. These rotations will be completed in either December (of the fall term) or in the summer term (May, June, or July). Student pharmacists will register for the IPPE in the term the rotation is completed and the earned grade will be recorded during the corresponding term. Students completing their IPPE during the summer term will not be charged any additional tuition beyond the fall and spring term for that year. Due to the Office of the Registrar's closing date for submission of fall grades (early to mid-December), students completing an IPPE in December will receive an incomplete (IC) recorded as their initial course grade. Once all rotation requirements are satisfied and the final grade is recorded in the rotation management system, the OPEE will submit a Grade Change Form to the registrar's office. Student pharmacists completing their IPPE in the summer term will receive a grade during the same term. However, due to the Office of Registrar's closing date for submission of summer grades (middle of July), students completing an IPPE in July will receive an IC recorded as their initial course grade. Once all rotation requirements are satisfied and the final grade is recorded in the rotation management system, the OPEE will submit a Grade Change Form to the registrar's office. In the event that a student pharmacist cannot or elects not to complete the IPPE in either the summer term or in December following the first year, he/ she must complete both IPPEs during the summer term following the second year or in December. If a student pharmacist receives a grade of Fail (F) on an IPPE, the grade will be submitted to the registrar's office and recorded on the student's transcript. The student will not be allowed to reschedule 68 | 2019-2020 Ac Ademic Bulletinthe failed rotation in the same term; therefore, the grade will remain on the transcript. If a student pharmacist is unsuccessful at either of the IPPEs, then he/she will be rescheduled for another introductory rotation of the same type either the following fall term (December), or the next summer term where applicable. Student pharmacists successfully completing all required coursework in the preceding three years, including both IPPEs, are classified as P4s and can register for their P4 rotations (APPEs). A minimum of nine rotations (1440 hours) in advanced community, ambulatory care, geriatrics, internal medicine I, internal medicine II, advanced hospital, and three electives is required. Grades for APPEs are recorded as A, B, C, or F (fail). Students usually complete their APPEs in May through April of the following year of expected graduation. All students will register according to his/her actual rotation schedule. Students will only be charged one program fee for the fourth year; one- half of the fee will be incurred in the fall term and the other half during the spring term. In the sample schedule below, the student will be registered in the summer, fall, and spring terms; however, one-half of the program fee will be assessed in the fall and the other half in the spring. No program fee will be incurred in the summer. registering for less than three (3) APPEs in either the fall or spring term will be classified as a half-time student. If a student pharmacist receives a grade of F (fail) in an APPE, the grade will be recorded on his/her transcript; moreover, the student will not be rescheduled for the rotation again within the same term preventing grade replacement. APPEs are not completed in succession. If an APPE must be rescheduled for any reason (including, but not limited to a rotation cancellation, rotation failure, course failure, not documenting all necessary requirements for site clearance, medical illness, etc.), the OPEE will make every effort to reschedule the rotation for the next semester or term; however, the OPEE implies no guarantee of on-time graduation if placement for a rotation is not available. If a student pharmacist's rotation cycle exceeds more than one calendar year (12 months) for any reason beyond OPEE's inability to find suitable placement, he/ she will be responsible for the per credit hour cost of each rotation. If a student pharmacist's rotation cycle exceeds more than one calendar year (12 months) due to the OPEE's inability to find suitable placement, there will be no additional cost for the rotation. Once a student pharmacist begins his/ her P4 rotations, all rotations must be completed within a two-year (24 month) time frame. If a student pharmacist is granted a leave of absence during the APPE cycle that exceeds two years (24 months), then all rotations prior to the leave must be repeated. If a student pharmacist is granted a leave of absence during the APPE cycle that exceeds one year (12 months), he/she will automatically be referred to the Academic Performance and Standards Committee for recommendations regarding successful re-entry into the program. International Travel after Onboarding for IPPEs and APPEs It is recommended that once clearance and onboarding procedures are completed for Introductory and/or Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPEs/ APPEs), student pharmacists should not travel abroad except for Campbell University-sponsored international travel (i.e.: mission trips, international electives, etc.) which is cleared through CU Global Engagement. Whether travelling internationally on Campbell University's (CU) behalf or for personal reasons, the Office of Professional and Experiential Education recommends students familiarize themselves with the political, health, crime, and other safety-related conditions of their travel destination and follow the Center for Disease Control's recommendations. Clinical Rotation Sites Within the four geographic regions there are numerous affiliated training sites ranging from large tertiary care hospitals, such as Duke University Medical Center and Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, to smaller community hospitals, chain and independent community pharmacies, and long-term care facilities. Clinical rotation sites are established in the following global areas of practice (please note, this is not an all-inclusive list and sites are subject to change): Academic Pharmacy Advanced Community Pharmacy* Advanced Hospital* Ambulatory Care* Cardiology Clinical Research Community Management Drug Information Emergency Medicine Geriatrics* Hospital Management Infectious Disease Intensive Care Internal Medicine I* & II* Nuclear Pharmacy Oncology Pediatrics Pharmacy Administration Professional Association Management Psychiatry Surgery Veterinary Pharmacy *Required rotation Requirements for Pharmacy Internship Regulations regarding internship licensure require that the experience is obtained after acceptance to the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS). Information pertinent to internship licensing among the various states is available from the board of pharmacy pages for each respective state. Successful completion of the CPHS experiential clerkship program will suffice for the internship requirement in the state of North Carolina. Students seeking internships or planning to take the state pharmacy board exam outside of North Carolina are responsible for reviewing the respective state's requirements for information regarding out of state intern licensure and pharmacy licensure post- graduation.

Students must have sufficient manual dexterity to write, type, grasp, pinch, hold, push, pull, lift, and palpate. Students must be able to ensure patient safety at all times. Students must be able to successfully perform dissection, debridement, auscultation, percussion, and wound/burn management along with performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED). These actions require coordination of many sensory systems (vision, hearing, equilibrium, touch).Physical Thera Py | 95Academic Standards Reports on academic performance and progress are generated at the mid-term and completion of each semester. The DPT program core faculty meets at the end of each academic term, or as necessary, to discuss the academic and/ or professional/behavioral performance of all students. Any discussions regarding type of academic and/or professional/ behavioral deficiency and remedy occurs with development of an action plan (if remediation is required; see below for remediation process) and draft of a letter from the program director stating the specific academic standing described in the following sections. The letter will be provided to the student via email and hard copy by mail. The letter will contain the following: Description of academic standing (remediation, probation, suspension, dismissal) Rationale for academic standing Criteria required to regain good academic standing Contact information of the program director to discuss items outlined in the letter Notification of appeals process Core faculty is actively involved in promoting student retention through annual advisement sessions. A modified generic abilities document will be used to guide the process. Advisement can occur more frequently (e.g. professionalism, behavioral, or academic concerns) should the need arise. Mechanisms are in place to encourage students to seek assistance for academic performance using StarFish and ExamSoft programs. Retention and Promotion Criteria Full-time students enrolled in the doctor of physical therapy program at the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS) are expected to make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of the degree requirements. Satisfactory academic progress is defined as successful completion of didactic and experiential training in the prescribed time and maintenance of a 2.8 cumulative of grade point average. Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress in the professional program are automatically placed on academic probation. They may be required to participate in academic counseling, be enrolled in a remedial program of study, or dismissed according to the policies described in subsequent sections. Students, who fail to maintain good academic standing at the completion of a semester prior to a semester requiring a clinical experience(s), cannot participate in the full-time experience(s) portion of a semester. The student would need to undergo a remedial course of study, with successful completion, prior to engaging in the experience(s)s (DPT 800, 802, 804). In the event remediation is not successful, students cannot progress to the clinical experience(s). Such actions will be recommended by the DPT Academic Performance & Standards committee and program director, with notification to the associate dean of health sciences. The student will be notified of these actions by the director of the DPT program. Students may need to take leave from the DPT program for non-academic reasons considered and approved by the program director on a case-by-case basis (e.g. illness, financial hardship, family responsibilities, etc.). Should a student be unable to attend classes for 2 consecutive weeks for a reason approved by the program director, disengagement from the program will be necessary. Should absence occur during clinical experience(s), see policies in Clinical Education Manual. The length of disengagement and any requirements for reengagement will be outlined in a letter from the program director along with a face-to-face meeting. The length of disengagement cannot be greater than 3 consecutive semesters. The following contains a description of the types of academic standing within the DPT program: 1. Good Academic Standing Students will be considered in good academic standing providing all the following criteria are met. Maintenance of GPA requirement -Cumulative GPA of 2.8 Passing grades for all clinical/ experiential training No violations of student honor code or code of conduct have occurred Successful completion of required remediation 2. Remediation Students who fail to meet academic standards within a given course or clinical/ experiential rotation will be required to remediate coursework and/or attend another clinical/experiential training. Students will require remediation for any patient safety issue throughout the curriculum. Students must initiate remediation within 24 hours of receiving a grade of < 70% on any examination or failing grade on any OSCE within a given course. Failure to initiate remediation will be considered a professional behavior violation. The content and expectation for remediation will be directed by the course instructor within a week of receiving a grade. Upon successful remediation, grades are not modified. Successful remediation of an exam must occur in the provided time and only a single attempt is allowed. In the event that remediation cannot be scheduled and completed within the current semester, the earned grade will be assigned and student will be placed on provisional status. Remediation must be completed by the end of the following semester or the student will be placed on probation. If the student is not successful in the allowed single remediation attempt, he/ she will be placed on academic probation. Should a student fail to remediate academic performance, or there are any behavioral and/ or non- academic reasons preventing them from participating in regularly scheduled clinical experience, this must be remediated prior to progression in the program. Should a student fail a clinical experience, this experience must be remediated prior to progression in the program. Clinical experiences cannot be completed out of sequence. Clinical internships may be repeated providing student has adhered to all stipulations in the letter from the Program Director. Upon successful completion, the student will rejoin in the normal curriculum sequence and graduate, assuming all didactic courses have been completed. See Graduation after Deceleration policy. A student failing more than one clinical/experiential rotation will be dismissed from the program. 3. Academic Probation Academic probation is the initial action for a student failing to make satisfactory academic progress. A student will be placed on academic probation for: Failure to maintain a per semester GPA requirements A grade of D in any single course Failure to complete any degree requirement at the prescribed time without prior approval Failure to successfully complete required remediation in allowed single attempt or complete attempt within the following semester Provisional probation is assigned for students not completing required remediation prior to conclusion of semester96 | 2019-2020 Ac ADE mic BullE tinDepending on the nature of the academic deficiencies and overall academic record, a student placed on academic probation may or may not be permitted to continue in the regular sequence of the professional curriculum. Students cannot be on academic probation more than two times throughout the program. Students who fail to complete the criteria for lifting academic probation will be considered for dismissal from the DPT program. The core DPT Academic Performance & Standards committee and director will review the student's record each semester and again at the end of the term of probation. A recommendation will be made to the program director to restore good academic standing if: 1. The student's semester GPA returns to 2.8 2. Successfully completed a deficient clinical/experiential training and recommendation for a return term/year for the program. A recommendation will be made to the program director to dismiss if while on academic probation: 1. A student makes a \"D\" or below in any course. 2. A student fails to correct academic deficiencies within the prescribed time. 4. Academic Dismissal Academic dismissal from the DPT program and CPHS may be recommended to the Associate dean for academic affairs by the director of the DPT program and DPT Academic Performance and Standards Committee if a student: Makes a F in a single course. Fails to maintain program minimum GPA requirements for > 2 semesters. Fails to make satisfactory progress during a period of academic probation. Has an academic deficiency which precludes continuation in the prescribed program of study, and may not reasonably be expected to complete the requirements of the degree. A student dismissed from the College may seek re-entry by applying for re-admission using the standard admissions process. Academic Status Appeals At the end of each academic term, the DPT director will notify the DPT Academic Performance and Standards Committee of all students enrolled in DPT program that qualify for academic probation, suspension, or dismissal. The DPT program director notifies each student who does not meet the academic standards as defined by the academic regulations at CPHS. The College's associate dean for health sciences is also notified for any student at risk of suspension/dismissal. Each student subject to probation or dismissal (as recommended by DPT core faculty and program director) is evaluated by the DPT Academic Performance and Standards Committee in order to make a recommendation whether to retain or promote the student in the professional program. The student may appear in person before the committee. The DPT program director notifies students in writing regarding any decision by the committee to require a modified course of study or to dismiss the student from the College. The program director reviews all records for student and committee and makes decision to retain or dismiss a student. Should recommendation for dismissal occur, information is shared with the associate dean of admissions & student affairs. Students have the opportunity to appeal any decision made by the DPT Academic Performance and Standards Committee and program director by submitting a written petition to the associate dean for health sciences within seven days of their receipt of notification. The petition must contain the specific variance requested, a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance, and a proposed course of study and/or conditions for consideration should the variance be granted. The decision of the associate dean for health sciences is final. Professional Behavior Concerns Professional behaviors are expected of Campbell University DPT Students at all program-sponsored activities' including but not limited to: classes, service activities, pro bono and migrant camp work, experiential/internship assignments, and professional conferences. Faculty and staff are required to document unprofessional behaviors using the CU DPT Remediation Form. Completed forms should be placed in the student advising folders with notification sent to assigned advisor for reference. Unprofessional behaviors are assessed by faculty and the APS Committee using a decision tree indicating severity of violation, and required follow-up action if needed. These actions can range from a meeting with the involved faculty/staff member, advisor follow-up, consultation with APS Committee, referral to Program Director, referral to appropriate CPHS Committee, or recommendation for dismissal. Repeated or significant unprofessional behaviors have the potential to impact didactic, service, and clinical activities required for the successful completion of the Doctor of Physical Therapy Program and ultimately licensure eligibility. The decision tree is meant to be a guide. Faculty/ staff are encouraged to consult with the APS committee for guidance when clarity is required. Time to Complete the Program Students have up to 150% of the total normal program length or 13 semesters to complete the DPT program. Approved medical leave and academic deficiencies (e.g. suspension) count toward the total time clock. Should a student take longer than that amount of time to complete the program, additional studies or repeating of semesters may be required to ensure competency in content knowledge and skills. Delayed Graduation Policy If a Physical Therapy student is required to re-take classes as a result of specific course failure or a deficiency in overall academic performance, then a delay in scheduling Physical Therapy clinical experiences or matriculation through the curriculum will occur and the student's graduation may be delayed. Voluntary course withdrawals or a temporary leave of absence may cause a delay in scheduling Physical Therapy clinical experiences, progress through the curriculum, and a subsequent delay in graduation. Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education-based financial aid. For specific counseling and advice, students should contact the College's Office of Academic Affairs and the University's Office of Financial Aid. Graduation Requirements Recommendation for graduation requires faculty approval and attainment of the following requirements: Successful completion of all courses, requirements, and remediation Successful completion of all clinical/ experiential training Attendance of graduation week activities that includes licensure preparation courses and comprehensive curriculum review Attendance at the graduation ceremony is expected Graduation after Deceleration DPT students who decelerate due to approved medical leave, and are in good academic standing, may walk at the graduation ceremony with their original cohort if they lack no more than six hours Physical Thera Py | 97of credit (one clinical rotation). The missing credit must be completed no later than March 15 of the original graduation date. Students who lack more than six hours of credit will walk at the next graduation ceremony after completion of their outstanding requirements. Students who decelerate will receive their degree at the next University awarding period; either the May, August, or December graduation dates. Students may not sit for their FSBPT licensure examination until after the degree has been awarded. With fixed date testing, the FSBPT application is due at least 6 weeks prior to testing date. See https://www. fsbpt.org/ForCandidatesAndLicensees/ NPTE/FixedDateTestingInfo/index.asp for available testing dates. Employment while in the Program Outside employment during the DPT program is strongly discouraged. Required program activities cannot be altered. Outside obligations cannot interfere or impede class attendance or completion of assignments and program requirements. Students must not substitute for faculty or staff by performing any administrative, clerical, or clinical duties while on supervised clinical experiences. Transfer Students CPHS DPT does not accept transfer students directly into the DPT program. Students currently enrolled in another DPT program in the United States seeking admission into the Campbell DPT program will be asked to apply. Interested individuals must follow the procedures for admission. Applicants must be in good academic standing and have a letter from the dean of their institution supporting the request. These admissions decisions will be handled in the same manner as all other applicants to the College by the actions of the Admissions Committee. All prerequisites must be met prior to matriculation to the DPT program at Campbell University. CPHS reserves the right to make changes in requirements for admission, curriculum, standards for progression, advancement and graduation, fees and rules and regulations. To apply to the DPT program, please follow the policies and procedures in the admissions portion of the CPHS Academic Bulletin.Grading System The following arbitrary grading scale is utilized for the DPT B, C, D, F, and W\" are included in semester hours attempted and will affect the grade point average. A student may appeal a grade per the policy in the general section of this document. An instructor or director initiated inquiry/request will be remediated and corrected at any time. Curriculum Campbell University's Doctor of Physical Therapy Program is a 36 month graduate degree program with 26.5 months of didactic education and 9.5 months of supervised clinical experiences. Graduates will receive the Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) degree upon successful completion. There is a one-week summative session before graduation. The program starts in January with graduation in December. Most didactic courses are held on the main campus with an online licensure preparation course completed while on terminal clinical experience in the final year of study. The DPT program curriculum is a competency-based graduate education (minimum required skills for physical therapist education and normative model of PT education) curriculum based on a hybrid model pulling from traditional, lifespan, and problem based learning. The sequence of courses is designed to start with foundation courses in the basic sciences, professional development, and early clinical skills. Following the initial foundational coursework, subsequent courses teach clinical assessment and intervention, medical, surgical and pharmacy concepts in patient management from a population based lifespan perspective. Integrated curricular themes in service-learning and early clinical experiences, therapeutic exercise, and approach to patient care using a lifespan model is designed to enhance student learning and promote confidence in application of skills and didactic knowledge. Clinical reasoning courses are designed to enhance student interaction through problem-based learning, application of concepts/skills, and critical interpretation of evidence. The integrated service learning and clinical experiences are designed to encourage inter-professional interaction and collaboration. Assessment of students in the didactic/classroom years is by written examinations, performance on laboratory practical examinations, OSCE, reflective narrative, professional portfolio, and participation in small group activities. Three clinical experiences occur throughout the curriculum with a six- week introductory clinical experience in the spring of the second year. The remaining terminal experiences occur in the third program year with durations of 16 weeks each for a total of 38 weeks of clinical training. Students complete clinical experiences and service learning in rural locations with most completing a clinical internship in a rural location. Clinical experiences can be completed in an acute/ subacute, neuromuscular, musculoskeletal, general practice, and specialty settings. Specialized settings may include burn/ wound care, aquatic, industrial/vocational, and VA/military locations, home health, and school systems. Evaluation of clinical-year students includes a preceptor and student self-assessment of student performance using the clinical performance instrument (CPI), reflective narratives on patient care experience/ delivery, case study presentations, and written examinations to prepare for licensure. All students complete all didactic elements in the program at the same time. All students complete the required clinical experiences. The only elective study available in this curriculum is spring semester of the third year.

The use of an intermediary, a person trained to perform essential skills on behalf of the student, is not permitted. The following technical standards are adapted from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) guidelines. Before matriculation, accepted students must attest in writing that they have read and are able to meet the program's technical standards. Candidates for admission to and graduation from the Campbell PA Program should possess the following abilities:Physician a ssistant Practice | 109Observation The candidate must be able to observe required demonstrations and experiments in the basic sciences, including but not limited to anatomic dissection, microscopic studies, and patient demonstrations. A candidate must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the sense of vision, hearing, and somatic sensation. Communication A candidate must be able to speak, to hear, and to observe patients in order to elicit information, describe changes in mood, activity, and posture, and perceive non- verbal communication. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. Communication includes not only speech, but also reading and writing in English. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. Motor Abilities A candidate must have sufficient motor function to carry out basic laboratory techniques; elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion, and other diagnostic maneuvers; perform dissection of a human cadaver and have sufficient motor ability to use a microscope. A candidate should be able to perform a complete physical examination (including pelvic and rectal examination) and diagnostic procedures (e.g., venipuncture and basic laboratory tests such as urinalysis). A candidate must be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Examples of treatment reasonably required of PAs are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the administration of intravenous medication, the application of pressure to stop bleeding, the suturing of simple wounds, assisting in surgical operations, and the performance of simple, general obstetrical and gynecological procedures. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium and functional use of the senses of touch, vision, and hearing. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative, and Quantitative Abilities Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of PAs, requires that a candidate be able to learn, retrieve, analyze sequence, organize, synthesize and integrate information efficiently, and reason effectively. In addition, a candidate should possess the ability to measure and calculate accurately, perceive three- dimensional relationships and understand the spatial relationships of structures. Behavioral and Social Attributes A candidate must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of his or her intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients and their family members, staff, and colleagues. Each candidate must be able to work effectively as a member of a health care team. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, display flexibility and learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, collegiality, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admission and education processes. Disclaimer: Accepted students with a disability who believe they may require special accommodations should contact the Director of Access & Outreach immediately upon accepting the offer of admissions and before matriculation. Academic Standards PA Academic Performance and Standards Committee The Academic Performance and Standard Committee (APSC) of the Campbell University Physician Assistant program consists of the principal faculty: the program director (chair), medical director, academic coordinators, clinical coordinators, and general faculty members. The committee meets at the end of each block and semester to review the academic standing of each student. Prior to the end of the didactic year the APSC convenes to recommend students for advancement to the clinical year; it convenes again prior to the end of the clinical phase to recommend candidates for graduation. The committee will also be convened at any point in the program at the recommendation of a faculty member to discuss a student whose performance is at risk for not meeting standards. Retention and Promotion Criteria Students enrolled in the Physician Assistant program are expected to make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of degree requirements. Satisfactory academic progress is defined as successful completion of all required courses and completion of all deficiencies and/or required remedial programs in the time and manner prescribed by the Physician Assistant program faculty. Students must also achieve and maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.8 at the end of blocks 2, 4, and 5. Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress will be placed on academic probation. Students on academic probation will be advised to participate in academic counseling and/or in a remedial program of study, as determined by the APSC. Assignment Completion All course assignments must be turned in by the date and time posted by the instructor. Unless specific reasons for late submissions are approved in advance by the instructor, an assignment that is more than 6 days late will not be accepted and the student will receive a zero for the assignment. Exam Protocol - Late for an Exam Students must be in their seats and have their computers set up before the posted exam time (usually on the hour). Students who are late for an exam must not enter the exam room; these students must report to the security desk. They will be set up in a location provided by faculty or other proctors who may be available. For a first offense the earned grade will be awarded. For any subsequent exam tardiness, students up to 15 minutes late will receive a 10% reduction in grade for the exam. Students more than 15 minutes late will not be allowed to take the exam. For extenuating circumstances beyond the student's control the student must notify his/her advisor or the course coordinator by email, text, or phone as soon as possible. Program faculty will decide whether a make-up exam will be permissible. Didactic Year Remediation Students having academic difficulty can request tutoring by contacting the Coordinator for Academic Support Services. There is no fee for this service. The number to call is 910-814-5693. 110 | 2019-2020 Ac Ademic BulletinAdvisors may refer students for tutoring and assessment as part of a remediation plan. 1. didactic e xam Remediation In the didactic curriculum, 70% is a passing score. An exam failure with a grade of less than 70% in any course will result in a required remediation exercise. The grade earned on the initial exam will be the grade used to calculate the final course grade. Failure to successfully remediate an exam failure will result in automatic course failure and placement on academic probation. In addition, following any exam failure, the program may require any or all of the following interventions, or others, as appropriate: 1. The student may be required to meet with the Academic Success Team (which may include the Faculty Advisor, Course Coordinator, and/or Program Director) to discuss exam performance. 2. The student may be placed on academic probation. 3. The student may be required to complete a Learning Contract. Failure of a third exam in any one block or failure of four exams during the didactic year will result in automatic academic probation. 2. didactic c ourse Remediation Students must successfully remediate any course failure prior to progression to subsequent blocks. Failure to successfully remediate the course in the prescribed manner and time will result in dismissal from the program. Advancement to the Clinical Year Advancement to the clinical year requires faculty approval and attainment of the following requirements: 1. Successful completion of all didactic year courses, 2. Maintenance of a 2.8 or greater overall GPA, 3. Successful completion of the didactic year summative evaluations, 4. Completion of hours of required service learning, and 5. Participation in all required Campbell University interprofessional education (IPE) events. If a student does not meet all of the above requirements, he/she will not be allowed to progress to clinical year. The APSC will meet to confirm dismissal from the program.Clinical Year Remediation End-of-Rotation Exam Remediation The final grade for clinical rotations is a combination of end-of-rotation (EOR) exam grades, preceptor evaluation, written assignments, and the professionalism evaluation, as outlined in the course syllabus. Failure of any EOR exam, with a score of less than 65%, must be successfully remediated with a written exam and a remediation assignment. The grade earned on the initial EOR exam will be the grade used to calculate the final course grade. If a student does not successfully remediate a failed EOR exam, s/he will fail the rotation/course and be placed on academic probation. Failure of the course results in deceleration, delayed graduation, and additional tuition and fees. Students may successfully remediate up to two failed EOR exams, without being placed on academic probation. Failure of a third EOR exam will result in academic probation and evaluation by the PA Academic Performance & Standards Committee. The committee will review each student's overall academic performance on an individual basis to determine whether deceleration with delayed graduation is in the student's best interest. Failure of a fourth EOR exam will result in the student being evaluated by the PA Academic Performance & Standards Committee. The committee will review the student's overall academic performance to determine whether, and under what conditions, the student may continue in the program. Preceptor Evaluation Remediation Clinical preceptor grades are an integral part of assessment of clinical year students. Clinical year students who receive a failing grade from a preceptor on any rotation may be placed on probation, after review of the situation by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee (APSC). If failure by the preceptor is upheld by the APSC, the student will receive a failure for the rotation. Students who receive a failing grade from a second preceptor evaluation will again be brought before the APSC. The APSC will evaluate the specific circumstances of each preceptor evaluation. If the APSC decides that the evaluations are evidence that the student is unprepared for the rigors of clinical practice, the student will be dismissed from the program.Clinical Year Course Remediation Failure of a clinical rotation with a grade of less than 70% requires repeating the rotation and the student will be placed on academic probation. Mandatory repeating of the clinical rotation will result in delay of graduation from the program. The student will incur additional tuition costs for the repeat rotation. Remediation Records A record of all student remediation exercises will be kept in the student's file. A record of remediation for each semester is kept in a flow sheet in the program files. Program Progression The following policies apply to both the didactic and clinical phases of the PA Program: First Course Failure: Receiving a final grade of less than 70% will result in failure of the course. A course failure will result in automatic academic probation. The student will be given one opportunity to remediate the course. Remediation time frame and requirements are at the discretion of the course coordinator/ APSC. After successful remediation the course grade will be advanced to 70% and the student will be allowed to progress in the program. Second Course Failure: Failure of any second course during the PA Program is not remediable and will result in a recommendation to the APSC for dismissal from the program. Academic Probation Academic probation is the initial action for a student failing to make satisfactory academic progress. A student will be placed on academic probation for: 1. Failure to successfully remediate an exam in which he or she received a grade of less than 70% in the didactic year or 65% in the clinical year 2. Failure of a third exam in any one block or failure of four exams during the didactic year 3. Failure of a third EOR exam in the clinical year 4. Failure of one course with a grade of less than 70% 5. Failure to maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.8 at the conclusion of blocks 2, 4, or 5 6. Failure to demonstrate appropriate professional attitudes and behaviors 7. Observed behaviors/ conduct that would preclude professional licensure. The APSC will make specific recommendations regarding the student's Physician a ssistant Practice | 111academic probation. Students placed on academic probation due to a course failure will remain on academic probation for the remainder of the program. Students on academic probation must comply with all requirements as directed by the APSC. Failure to meet these requirements may result in dismissal from the Program. PA Program Dismissal Students will be dismissed from the Physician Assistant program for the following: 1. Failure to successfully remediate a course failure, in which the student received a grade of less than 70%, or 2. Failure of a second course within the program 3. Failure to meet satisfactory academic and/or professional progression in the program as determined by the APSC Students who are dismissed from the program have three (3) business days to appeal the decision to the associate dean for health sciences. The associate dean will review the case within seven (7) business days and deliver a decision. The decision of the associate dean for health sciences is final. Students who are dismissed must return the program provided laptop, iPad mini, identification card, name tags, and the Campbell logo patch. Graduation Requirements Recommendation for graduation requires faculty approval and attainment of the following requirements: 1. Successful completion of all courses, requirements, and remediation, 2. Successful completion of the Campbell PA program PANCE board review seminar, and 3. Successful completion of all summative clinical year evaluations. Graduation after Deceleration PA Students who decelerate due to probation, repeating a clinical rotation, or approved medical leave, will be able to walk at the next graduation ceremony after completion of their outstanding requirements. Students who decelerate will receive their degree at the next University awarding period. Students may sit for their NCCPA boards and apply for state licensure once all program requirements have been met and the program director releases their names to the appropriate boards. All academic, clinical, and remedial work must be completed within three years of matriculating in the PA program. Students who have outstanding work after three years may reapply for admission as described under the academic dismissal policy. Employment while in the Program 1. Outside employment during the didactic or clinical phases of the PA program is strongly discouraged. 2. Required program activities cannot be altered by outside activities. Outside obligations cannot interfere or impede class attendance or completion of assignments or program requirements. 3. Students are not permitted to perform any clerical, administrative, or physical work for the PA program or be employed as a graduate assistant. 4. Students must not substitute for faculty or staff by performing any administrative, clerical, or clinical duties while on supervised clinical educational rotations. Medical Leave-of-Absence Students who require a medical leave- of- absence must request a meeting with the program director. The circumstances of the leave will be reviewed with the Academic Performance and Standards Committee. Each case will be considered on an individual basis. A plan for deceleration, remediation, or withdrawal will be developed in discussion with the associate dean for admissions and student affairs. Student withdrawal will follow the \"Withdrawal\" protocol in the general section of this bulletin. Students returning after a medical leave-of- absence must obtain a medical clearance letter prior to returning to the program. Curriculum The Campbell PA program is 24 months in length. The graduate degree program consists of 12 months of didactic education and 12 months of supervised clinical experiential education. Upon successful completion of the program, graduates will receive the Master of Physician Assistant Practice (MPAP) degree. The program starts in July, with graduation after six concurrent semesters of training. All didactic courses are held on the health sciences campus in Lillington, NC. The Campbell PA program is a competency-based graduate medical education curriculum based on the medical model. The sequence of courses is designed to be fully integrated, vertically and horizontally. Basic foundational concepts are aligned with systems-based courses including clinical medicine, clinical skills, and pharmacotherapeutics, as well as more specialized courses such as emergency medicine and surgery. The development of critical thinking skills and hands-on competencies are integral to the curriculum. Clinical simulations and early experiential opportunities complement the curriculum throughout the didactic and clinical years. Assessment of students in the first year is by written examinations, performance on practical examinations and simulation exercises, and participation in small group activities as well as final summative exams. All students complete all didactic elements in the program at the same time. All students must complete all required clinical experiences. The only elective study available in this curriculum is in the second year when students may undertake supervised clinical experiences in two four- week rotations of their choosing. Curriculum design and operationalization is guided by the standards of accreditation for physician assistant education, as published by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA). The ARC- PA accreditation standards describe the required curricular components and required supervised clinical experiences for a program to receive accreditation. The curriculum described was designed to meet these accreditation requirements. Clinical Education Clinical rotations in the second year consist of four-week supervised clerkship experiences in the major disciplines, a seminar in evidence-based medicine and two clinical electives. Evaluation of clinical-year students includes a preceptor assessment of performance, and student performance on written examinations or presentations given at the end of each required clinical rotation. There are final summative exams at the conclusion of the clinical year which are prerequisites for graduation.112 | 2019-2020 Ac Ademic BulletinDidactic Courses Block 1 Courses Credit Hours MPAP 531 - Anatomy & Physiology 4 MPAP 535 - Foundations of Health & Disease 1 MPAP 504 - Clinical Medicine I 3 MPAP 522 - Clinical Skills I (History & Physical) 3 MPAP 515 - Pharmacotherapeutics I 1 Total 12 Block 2 Courses Credit Hours MPAP 505 - Clinical Medicine II 3 MPAP 523 - Clinical Skills II 4 MPAP 516 - Pharmacotherapeutics II 2 MPAP 503 - Behavioral Medicine 2 MPAP 536 - Foundations of Health & Disease 1 Total 12 Block 3 Courses Credit Hours MPAP 506 - Clinical Medicine III 3 MPAP 537 - Foundations of Health & Disease 1 MPAP 519 - Health Policy 1 MPAP 517 - Pharmacotherapeutics II 1 MPAP 521 - Surgery 3 MPAP 524 - Clinical Skills III 3 Total 12 Block 4 Courses Credit Hours MPAP 526 - Clinical Medicine IV 3 MPAP 538 - Foundations of Health & Disease 1 MPAP 509 - Evidence - Based Medicine I 1 MPAP 514 - Orthopaedics 2 MPAP 527 - Pharmacotherapeutics IV 2 MPAP 525 - Clinical Skills IV 3 Total 12 Block 5 Courses Credit Hours MPAP 528 - Clinical Medicine V 4 MPAP 539 - Foundations of Health & Disease 1 MPAP 530 - Pharmacotherapeutics V 1 MPAP 510 - Emergency Medicine 3 MPAP 529 - Clinical Skills V 3 Total 12Clinical Rotations Courses Credit Hours MPAP 601 - Emergency Medicine 5 MPAP 602 - Family Practice 5 MPAP 603 - Internal Medicine 5 MPAP 604 - Surgery 5 MPAP 605 - Pediatrics 5 MPAP 606 - Psychiatry 5 MPAP 607 - OB/GYN 5 MPAP 608 - Primary Care 5 MPAP 609 - Evidence-Based Med.

Students will be notified of their clinical training sites during the spring/ summer semester of the didactic year. Clinical Rotations at Distant Sites While many clinical educational rotations are in Harnett and surrounding counties, it may be necessary for the program to arrange some rotations at distant sites. Every effort will be made to arrange clinical rotations that are within a 90 minute drive time from campus, or from a student's home, for those who are North Carolina residents. Travel expenses are the student's responsibility. Nevertheless, there are times when it may be necessary for the program to send some students to sites that are not within convenient driving distance. In those few instances the program will arrange for suitable housing; however, students will be responsible for travel and housing costs. Students may qualify for discounted housing rates that the program may arrange if available through North Carolina AHEC. Distant rotations will account for no more than three of any student's total rotations.
