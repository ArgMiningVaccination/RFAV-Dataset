About Medically Monitored Detox For many individuals, in Pennsylvania and throughout the United States, one of the most intimidating parts of receiving treatment for chemical dependency is the thought of having to go through the detoxification process. Once a person's body becomes dependent on the presence of a substance, adjusting to the lack of that substance can be extremely difficult and uncomfortable. In fact, this process of withdrawal can be so uncomfortable that, in many cases, it can be the predominant reason that individuals return to using their substances of choice. At the addiction rehab centers within the White Deer Run Treatment Network in Pennsylvania, we recognize how unpleasant the withdrawal process can be, which is why we are pleased to be able to offer medically monitored detoxification programs to help keep participants safe and as comfortable as possible as their bodies become rid of harmful substances. The length of time during which the detox process takes place can vary from individual to individual, depending upon such factors as the specific substance that was being abused, the frequency of the abuse, and the length of time during which the abuse has taken place. Our detoxification programs can last anywhere between three and seven days, but the exact time period will be determined based on each individual's physical needs. What to Expect During the detoxification process, participants will meet with a variety of clinical staff members who will assist in ensuring their safety and comfort. Physicians and physician's assistants typically meet with participants at least once each day, and nursing staff is available around-the-clock to monitor vital signs and withdrawal symptoms so that each participant remains comfortable. Our detox programs are primarily a medically monitored process that takes place before participants engage in other types of programming, yet the particular aspects of an individual's participation in detox can vary from location to location. At some of our rehab centers, individuals are encouraged to engage in the programming options that are offered through the residential rehabilitation programs during their time in the detox program if they are able and medically stable enough to do so. At other locations, the various aspects of treatment, such as group therapy, family therapy, and experiential therapies, may not begin until the detox program is complete. However, in either case, participants may be able to meet with a counselor or therapist during their time in detox if they request it or if it is deemed clinically appropriate. The staff members at each of White Deer Run Treatment Network's locations work diligently with participants to ensure that a thorough treatment plan is devised according to their particular needs so that full participation in programming can begin once the detoxification process has ended.
