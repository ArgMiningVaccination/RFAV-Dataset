However, modern farming practices have depleted our soil of its nutrients, which makes it nearly impossible to get all your nutrients with even the healthiest diet. By some counts, we now need 10 servings of vegetables to get the same nutrients that we'd get from one serving 50 years ago. While an organic diet of whole foods is the key to good health, it just isn't enough for optimal health and immune support. We recommend that you incorporate high-quality immune support supplements into your diet to account for the nutrients your body needs. Along with our current immune supplements of VitD3/K2, Atak, Gold, ViVi (virus fighter), we also have products that can fight inflammation and improve memory. Here are some of our recommendations for supplements to support a healthy immune system: Adaptocrine In times like these, it is common to develop ailments from the stress our bodies and minds are under. Adaptocrine is a supplement that is specifically formulated to help ease these symptoms and support optimal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function. Adaptocrine is formulated with a selection of plant extracts, vitamin C, and pantethine to assist with digestion, focus, and mental clarity. It includes key adaptogens such as ashwaganda and rhodiola that can help support calm and relaxed energy without the use of stimulants. This product boasts over 15 years of successful clinical use and has helped users with mental and physical issues that can arise during times of stress. BioShield+ Bioshield is a product we carry that is a natural energy booster and immune system protector. Among its many benefits, it can support a strong immune system, provide natural energy, sharpen mental clarity, and relieve overworked joints. Bioshield works by supporting a balanced cytokine response to ensure that your immune system does not damage organs and tissues when it responds to threats. Their formula helps deliver nutrients that your immune system needs to function optimally. Turmeric with Bioperine You may be familiar with turmeric if you enjoy curry dishes, but there is so much more to turmeric than its yellow hue. This spice can also provide us with an array of health benefits. Turmeric has been used for centuries in Asian countries tor its nutritional properties. It has natural anti inflammatory properties, loads of antioxidants, and can improve brain function. This supplement is especially powerful due to addition of Bioperine. Bioperine is a black pepper extract that increases the bioavailability of turmeric in your body. This means that you can make the most of each dose and reap the rewards that much more. "}
