DOI: 10.1086/676022purpose Previously published guidelines are available that provide com- prehensive recommendations for detecting and preventinghealthcare-associated infections (HAIs). The intent of this doc-ument is to highlight practical recommendations in a conciseformat designed to assist acute care hospitals in implementingand prioritizing their surgical site infection (SSI) preventionefforts. This document updates \"Strategies to Prevent SurgicalSite Infections in Acute Care Hospitals,\" 1published in 2008. This expert guidance document is sponsored by the Societyfor Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) and is theproduct of a collaborative effort led by SHEA, the InfectiousDiseases Society of America (IDSA), the Ame rican Hospital Association (AHA), the Association for Professionals in Infec-tion Control and Epidemiology (APIC), and The Joint Com-mission, with major contributions from representatives of anumber of organizations and societies with content expertise.The list of endorsing and supporting organizations is presentedin the introduction to the 2014 updates. 2 section 1: rationale and statements of concern I. SSIs are common complicati ons in acute care facilities A. SSIs occur in 2%-5% of patients undergoing inpatient surgery.3,4 B. Approximately 160,000-300,000 SSIs occur each year in the United States.5,6 C. SSI is now the most common and most costly HAI.7-9 II. Outcomes associated with SSI A. Up to 60% of SSIs have been estimated to be pre-ventable by using evide nce-based guidelines.10,11 B. SSIs account for 20% of all HAIs in hospitalized patients.12 C. Each SSI is associated with approximately 7-11 addi- tional postoperati ve hospital-days.3,9,13,14 D. Patients with an SSI have a 2-11-times higher risk of death compared with operative patients without anSSI. 15,16 1. Seventy-seven percent of deaths in patients with SSI are directly attributable to SSI.17 E. Attributable costs of SSI vary depending on the type of operative procedure and the type of infecting patho-gen. 14,16,18-25 1. SSIs are believed to account for $3.5 billion to $10 billion annually in healthcare expenditures using theCPI (consumer price index for inpatient hospital ser-vices with all cost estimates adjusted for 2007dollars). 6 section 2: background\u2014strategies to detect ssi I. Surveillance denitions A. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN)denitions for SSI are widely used for public reporting,interfacility comparison, and pay-for-performancecomparisons. 26 B. SSIs are classied (Figure 1) as follows: 1. Supercial incisional (involving only skin or subcu- taneous tissue of the incision). This content downloaded from 24.19.122.24 on Fri, 12 Dec 2014 02:04:49 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions606 infection control and hospital ep idemiology june 2014, vol. 35, no. 6 gure 1 . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Na tional Healthcare Safety Network classi cation for surgical s ite infection (SSI).215 2. Deep incisional (involving fascia and/or muscular layers). a. Deep incision primary (DIP)\u2014SSI identied in a primary incision in a patient who has had an op-eration with 1 or more incisions. b. Deep incision secondary (DIS)\u2014SSI identied in a secondary incision in a patient who has had anoperation with mor e than 1 incision. 3. Organ/space (involving any part of the body opened or manipulated during the procedure, excluding skinincision, fascia, or muscle layers). II. Methods for surveillance of SSI A. The direct method with daily observation of the surgical site by the physician, physician extender, registerednurse, or infection prevention and control (IPC) postoperatively is themost accurate meth od of surveillance. 13,27-29 1. While the direct method is used as the gold standard for studies, it is rarely used in practice because ofits resource utilization requirements and im-practicality. B. The indirect method of SSI surveillance consists of a combination of th e following: 1. Review of microbiology reports and patient medical records. 2. Surgeon and/or patient surveys.3. Screening for readmission and/or return to the op- erating room. 4. Other information, such as coded diagnoses, coded procedures, operative reports, or antimicrobialsordered. C. The indirect method of SSI surveillance is less time- consuming and can be readily performed by IPC per-sonnel during surveill ance rounds. D. The indirect method of SSI surveillance is both reliable (sensitivity, 84%-89%) and specic (specicity, 99.8%)compared with the gold standard of direct surveil-lance. 30,31Components of the indirect methods that were associated with highest sensitivities included re-view of nursing notes, International Classication of Dis- eases, Ninth Revision codes, and antimicrobials used. E. Indirect methods for SSI surveillance are not reliable for surveillance of supercial incisional infections, par-ticularly those occurr ing postdischarge. 32 F. Automated data systems can be used to broaden SSI surveillance. 1. SSI surveillance can be expanded by utilizing hospital databases that include administrative claims data (in-cluding diagnosis and procedure codes), antimicro-bial-days, readmission to the hospital, and return tothe operating room and/or by implementing a systemthat imports automated microbiologic culture data,surgical procedure data, and general demographic in-formation into a single surveillance database. 33-35 2. These methods improve the sensitivity of indirect sur- veillance for detection of SSI and reduce the effortof the infection preventionist. 33 3. Medicare claims data can be used to enhance tradi- tional surveillance methods for SSI and to identifyhospitals with unusually high or low rates of SSI. 36,37 4. Use of administrative data can increase the efciency of SSI reporting and validation.38 III. Postdischarge surveillance A. Over the past 3 decades, advances in medical technology and changes in payment arrangements have increas-ingly shifted performance of surgical procedures from This content downloaded from 24.19.122.24 on Fri, 12 Dec 2014 02:04:49 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditionsstrategies to prevent ssi: 2014 update 607 the acute care setting to the amb ulatory (free-standing or hospital-afli ated) outpatient care setting.39-41 B. Concurrently, postoperative hospital length of stay has steadily declined.42These trends highlight the increasing importance of postdischarge surveill ance, without which SSI rates will be underestimated43and oppor- tunities for improvements in healthcare delivery, patientsafety, and SSI prevention will be missed. C. The proportion of SSIs detected through postdischarge surveillance can vary by surveillance method, operativesetting, type of SSI, and surgical procedure. 1. No standardized or reliable method for postdischarge surveillance has been established. 34,44-48Postdischarge surveillance based on surgeon and patient question-naire results have been shown to have poor sensitivityand specicity. 44,49-51 2. The ambulatory care setting represents a challenge because patients do not return to it for routine post-operative care or for management of complications. 41 Research is needed to better understand how de-nitions and postdischarge surveillance protocols de-veloped for the acute care setting can be translatedto the ambulato ry care setting. 3. Supercial incisional SSIs are most commonly detected and managed in the outpatient setting. In contrast,deep incisional and organ/space infections typically re-quire readmission to the ho spital for management. 32 4. In the Netherlands, the proportion of deep SSIs iden- tied after discharge from the hospital ranged from6% for colon resections to 88% for knee arthroplas-ties. 43The differences between these procedures could be explained by potential differences in both woundcontamination class and the duration of postdis-charge surveillance (30 days versus 1 year for animplant-related procedure). A pilot study in generalsurgery reported that 10.5% of SSIs following colonprocedures were identied after discharge from thehospital. 52 5. By improving completeness of reporting, the overall institutional SSI rate typically increases after post-discharge surveillance methods are implemented re-gardless of which method is used. 43,44,53 a. To improve interfacility comparisons and minimize potential bias introduced by differences in post-discharge surveillance methods, national public re-porting focuses on nonsupercial incisional SSIsdetected during hospitalization for the index pro-cedure or after discharge and requiring readmissionfor management. 41,54,55 section 3: background\u2014strategies to prevent ssi I. Summary of existing guidelines, recommendations, and requirements A. CDC and Healthcare Infection Control Practices Ad-visory Committee (HICPAC) guidelines 1. The most recently published guideline for prevention of SSIs was released in 1999 by Mangram et al.17The CDC and HICPAC are currently working on an up-dated version of the guideline with a projected pub-lication date in mid-2014. B. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)\u2014United Kingdom 1. NICE published guidelines for the prevention and treatment of SSI in 2008. 56 C. Surgical Infection Prevention (SIP) Project 1. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) created the SIP project in 2002. a. After review of published guidelines, an expert panel identied 3 performance measures for quality im-provement related to antimicrobial within 1 hour before incision (2 hours areallowed for the administration of vancomycinand fluoroquinolones). ii. Use of an antimicrobial prophylactic agent con- sistent with publishe the prophy lactic antimicro- bial agent within 24 hours after surgery (dis-continuation within 48 hours is allowable forcardiothoracic procedu res in adult patients). b. The SIP project focused on 7 procedures: abdom- inal hysterectomy, vaginal hysterectomy, surgery, vas-cular surgery, and colorectal surgery. c. Many hospitals that implemented and improved compliance with SIP performance measures de-creased their rates of SSI. 59 D. Surgical Care Impro vement Project (SCIP) 1. The SCIP , a multiagency collaboration created in 2003, is an extension of SIP . 2. In addition to the 3 performance measures of SIP , the SCIP also focuses on 3 additional evidence-sup-ported process measures to prevent SSIs and ex-panded the types of operations eligible for the per-formance measures. 58 a. Proper hair removal: no hair removal, although hair removal with clippers or the depilatorymethod is considered appropriate. Use of razors isconsidered inappropriate with exception of use onthe scrotal area or on the scalp after a traumatichead injury. Because of near-universal compliancewith this performance measure, CMS retired themeasure in 2012. b. Controlling blood glucose during the immediate postoperative period for cardiac surgery patients:controlled 6 am blood glucose (200 mg/dL or lower) on postoperative days 1 and 2, with theprocedure day being postoperative day 0. In 2014,this measure will be revised to assess glucose con-trol (180 mg/dL or lower) in cardiac surgery pa- This content downloaded from 24.19.122.24 on Fri, 12 Dec 2014 02:04:49 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions608 infection control and hospital epidemiology june 2014, vol. 35, no. 6 tients in the time frame of 18-24 hours after an- esthesia end time.60,61 c. Maintenance of perioperative normothermia in surgical patients who have anesthesia duration ofat least 60 minutes. E. Institute for Healt hcare Improvement (IHI) 1. The IHI created a nationwide quality improvement project to improve outcomes in hospitalizedpatients. 62,63 2. The IHI recommends the same 6 preventive measures recommended by the SCIP and has included these inthe 100,000 and 5 Million Lives Campaigns. 62,63 F. The Joint Commission Nati onal Patient Safety Goals 1. The Joint Commission's National Patient Safety Goal 07.05.01 includes several evidence-based practices forprevention of SSI. 64 G. Federal requirements 1. CMS a. In accordance with the Decit Reduction Act of 2005, hospitals that are paid by Medicare underthe Acute Care Inpatient Prospective Payment Sys-tem receive their full Medicare annual paymentupdate only if they submit required quality mea-sure information to CMS. b. CMS now requires hospitals to submit data on 7 SCIP measures as a part of the Hospital InpatientQuality Reporting (IQR) system. 65Three of these measures focus on prevention of SSI (antimicrobialprophylaxis provided within 1 hour of incision,antimicrobial selection, and cardiac surgery peri-operative glucose control). In addition, CMS nowrequires hospitals to report SSI rates for patientsundergoing abdominal hysterectomy and colorec-tal surgery through NHSN. 65 c. Actual rates of performance on SCIP measures now impacts hospital payment under the Value-BasedPurchasing (VBP) program. Current benchmarksidentied for the VBP score that is used to modifya hospital's base operating diagnosis-related grouppayment are at or near 100%. 65,66 II. Infrastructure requirements A. Trained personnel 1. Infection preventionists must (1) be specically trained in methods of SSI surveillance, (2) haveknowledge of and the ability to prospectively applythe CDC/NHSN denitions for SSI, (3) possess basiccomputer and mathematical skills, and (4) be adeptat providing feedback and education to healthcarepersonnel when app ropriate. 17 B. Education 1. Regularly provide education to surgeons and periop- erative personnel through continuing education ac-tivities directed at minimizing perioperative SSI riskthrough implementation of recommended processmeasures.a. Several educational components can be combined into concise, efcient, and effective recommenda-tions that are easily understood and remembered. 67 b. Provide education regarding the outcomes asso- ciated with SSI, risks for SSI, and methods to re- duce risk to all patients, patients' families, sur- geons, and perio perative personnel. c. Education for patients and patients' families is an effective method to reduce risk associated with in-trinsic patient-relat ed SSI risk factors. 68,69 C. Computer-assisted decision support and automated reminders 1. Several institutions have successfully employed com- puter-assisted decision support methodology to im-prove the rate of appropriate administration of an- timicrobial prophylaxis (including redosing during prolonged cases). 70-73 2. Computer-assisted decision support, however, is po- tentially expensive, can be time-consuming to im- plement, and in a single study was reported to initially increase the rate of adv erse drug reactions.74 3. Institutions must appropriately valida te computer-as- sisted decision support systems after i mplementation. D. Utilization of automated data 1. Install information technology infrastructure to fa- cilitate data transfer, receipt, and organization to aid with tracking of process an d outcome measures. section 4: recommended strategies for ssi prevention Recommendations are categorized as either (1) basic practices that should be adopted by all acute care hospitals or (2)special approaches that can be considered for use in locations and/or populations within hospitals when HAIs are not con- trolled by use of basic practices. Basic practices include rec- ommendations where the potential to impact HAI risk clearly outweighs the potential for undesirable effects. Special ap-proaches include recommendations where the intervention is likely to reduce HAI risk but where there is concern about the risks for undesirable outcomes resulting from the inter- vention, where the quality of evidence is low, or where evi-dence supports the impact of the intervention in select set-tings (eg, during outbreaks) or for select patient populations. Hospitals can prioritize their efforts by initially focusing on implementation of the prevention approaches listed as basicpractices. If HAI surveillance or other risk assessments suggest that there are ongoing opportunities for improvement, hos-pitals should then consider adopting some or all of the pre-vention approaches listed as special approaches. These canbe implemented in specic locations or pa tient populations or can be implemented hospital-wide, depending on outcomedata, risk assessment, and/or local requirements.

Grading of the Quality of Evidence Grade Denition I. High Highly condent that the tr ue effect lies close to that of the estimated size and direction of the effect. Evidence is rated as high quality when there is a wide range of studies with no majorlimitations, there is little variation between studies, and the summary estimate has a narrowcondence interval. II. Moderate The true effect is likely to be close to the estimated size and direction of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different . Evidence is rated as moderate quality when there are only a few studies and some have limitati ons but not major flaws, there is some variation between studies, or the condence inte rval of the summary estimate is wide. III. Low The true effect may be substant ially different from the estimat ed size and direction of the effect. Evidence is rated as low quality when supporting studies have major flaws, there is importantvariation between studies, the condence inte rval of the summary estimate is very wide, or there are no rigorous studies, only expert consensus. note . Based on Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE)234and the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.235 tion prevention recommendation is given a quality-of-evi- dence grade (see Table 1). I. Basic practices for preventing SSI: recommended for all acute care hospitals 1. Administer antimicrobial prophylaxis according to evi- dence-based standards and guidelines (quality of evi-dence: I). 17,75,76 a. Begin administration within 1 hour before incision to maximize tissue concentration.57,58Administering agent closer than 1 hour is effective, and some studiesshow superior efcacy for administration between 0and 30 minutes prior to incision compared with ad-ministration between 30 and 60 minutes. 77,78 i. Two hours are allowed for the administration of vancomycin and flu oroquinolones. ii. Many experts believe that antimicrobials should be infused prior to inflation of tourniquets in proce-dures using \"bloodless\" techniques, although dataare insufcient to support thi s recommendation. 79,80 b. Select appropriate agents on the basis of the surgical procedure, the most common pathogens causing SSIsfor a specic procedure, and published recommen-dations. 76 c. Discontinue agent within 24 hours after surgery.76 i. Although guidelines suggest stopping the antimi- crobial agent within 24 hours of surgery, there isno evidence that agents given after closure con-tribute to efcacy, and they do contribute to in-creased resistance 81,82and the risk of Clostridium difcile disease.83 d. Adjust dosing on the basis of patient weight;76for example: i. Use 30 mg/kg for pediatric patients, 2 g of cefa- zolin for patients weighing 80 kg or more, and 3g for patients weighing 120 kg or more. ii. Vancomycin should be dosed at 15 mg/kg. iii. Gentamicin should be dosed at 5 mg/kg for adultpatients and 2.5 mg/kg for pediatric patients. (a) For morbidly obese patients receiving genta- micin, the weight used for dose calculation should be the ideal weight plus 40% of theexcess weight. e. Redose prophylactic antimicrobial agents for long procedures and in cases with excessive blood loss dur-ing the procedure. 76 i. Prophylactic antimicrobials should be redosed at intervals of 2 half-lives (measured from time thepreoperative dose was administered) in cases that exceed this time. f. Use a combination of parenteral antimicrobial agents and oral antimicrobials to reduce the risk of SSI fol- lowing colorectal procedures. 84-91 i. The additional SSI reduction achieved with me- chanical bowel preparation has not been studied,but the data supporting use of oral antimicrobialshave all been generated in combination with me-chanical bowel preparation. ii. Mechanical bowel preparation without oral anti- microbials does not de crease the risk of SSI. 92 2. Do not remove hair at the operative site unless the presence of hair will interfere with the operation. Do not use razors (quality of evidence: II).17,93 a. If hair removal is necessary, remove hair outside the operating room using clippers or a depilatory agent. 3. Control blood glucose during the immediate postop- erative period for cardiac surgery patients58(quality of evidence: I) and noncardiac surgery patients94-98(quality of evidence: II). a. Maintain postoperative blood glucose of 180 mg/dL or lower. i. The recommendation of maint aining postoperative blood glucose less than 200 mg/dL at 6 amon post- operative days 1 and 2 is being replaced. In 2014,this measure will be revised in the SCIP to assess This content downloaded from 24.19.122.24 on Fri, 12 Dec 2014 02:04:49 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions610 infection control and hospita l epidemiology june 2014, vol. 35, no. 6 glucose control (180 mg/dL or lower) in cardiac surgery patients in the time frame of 18-24 hoursafter anesthesia end time. Several societies, experts,and the National Quality Forum support this newrecommendation. 60,61,99,100 b. Intensive postoperative glucose control (targeting lev- els less than 110 mg/dL) has not been shown to re-duce the risk of SSI and may actually lead to higherrates of adverse outcomes, including stroke anddeath. 101 4. Maintain normothermia (temperature of 35.5 /H11034Co r more) during the perioperative period (quality of evi-dence: I). a. Even mild degrees of hypothermia can increase SSI rates. Hypothermia may directly impair neutrophilfunction or impair it indirectly by triggering subcu-taneous vasoconstriction and subsequent tissue hyp-oxia. In addition, hypothermia may increase bloodloss, leading to wound hematomas or need for trans-fusion, both of which can increase rates of SSI. 102 b. Randomized controlled trials have shown the benets of both preoperative and intraoperative warming toreduce SSI rates and to reduce intraoperative blood loss. 103-105 5. Optimize tissue oxygenation by administering supple- mental oxygen during and immediately following sur-gical procedures involving mechanical ventilation (qual-ity of evidence: I). a. Supplemental oxygen is most effective when com- bined with additional strategies to improve tissue oxy-genation, including maintenance of normothermiaand appropriate volume replacement. The availableevidence is in patients undergoing surgery with gen-eral anesthesia using mech anical ventilation. 106-108 i. lished FiO2(4 with oxide110-112) in patients undergoing general anesthesia with in-traoperative mechanical ventilation and postop-erative oxygen delivered for 2-6 hours via a non-rebreathing mask. ii. Three trials in patients undergoing elective colo- rectal resection 106,107,111and 1 each esophago- jejunal anastomosis112reported an approximate 40% decrease in the rate of SSI. Three of the studiesreported protocols that included maintenance ofperioperative normothermia and liberal fluid re-placement. 106-108 iii. Two trials in mixed surgical po pulations under- going emergency or elective laparotomy for gas-trointestinal, gynecologic, urologic proceduresreported different results. 109,110 (a) The large multicenter trial that restricted peri- operative fluid replacement reported no dif-ference.109A follow-up study performed in this population noted that patients undergoingcancer surgery who received 80% FiO 2had higher rates of mortality than patients under-going cancer surgery who received 30%FiO 2.113 (b) The smaller trial without standardized proto- cols for perioperative normothermia or volumereplacement reported an increase in SSIs. study, the 80% FiO2group had a signi- cantly higher proportion of patients with highbody mass index (more than 30), higher bloodloss, more crystalloid infused, and longer op-erations. This group also had 5 patients whoremained intubated postoperatively (vs 1 in the35% group). Postoperative intubation was pre-dictive of SSI. b. A meta-analysis of 5 of the abov e-referenced studies concluded that perioperative supplemental oxygenled to a relative risk (RR) reduction of 25% for SSI. 114 6. Use alcohol-containing preoperative skin preparatory agents if no contraindication exists (quality of evi-dence: I). a. Alcohol is highly bactericidal and effective for pre- operative skin antisepsis but does not have persistentactivity when used alone. Rapid, persistent, and cu-mulative antisepsis can be achieved by combining al-cohol with chlorhexidine gluconate or an iodophor. 115 i. Alcohol is contraindicated for certain procedures, including procedures in which the preparatoryagent may pool or not dry (eg, involving hair) dueto re risk. Alcohol may also be contraindicated for procedures involving mucosa, cornea, or ear. b. The most effective disinfectant to combine with al- cohol is unclear. i. A recent trial of 849 patients undergoing clean- contaminated surgery randomized patients to pre-operative skin antisepsis with ch lorhexidine- alcohol or povidone-iodine. 116The overall rate of SSI was signicantly lower in the chlorhexidine-alcohol group than in the povidone-iodine group(9.5% vs 16% [ Pp.004]; RR, 0.59 [95% con- dence interval (CI), 0.41-0.85]). ii. In contrast, a single-center study compared pov- idone-iodine followed by isopropyl alcohol versuschlorhexidine-alcohol versus iodine -alcohol using a sequential implementation design. 117General surgical patients who received skin antisepsis withiodine-alcohol had the lowest rates of SSI (3.9 per100 procedures), compared with 6.4 per 100 pro-cedures for patients who received povidone-iodinefollowed by alcohol and 7.1 per 100 proceduresfor patients who received chlorhexidine -alcohol. iii. In the absence of alcohol, chlo rhexidine gluconate may have advantages over povi done-iodine, in- This content downloaded from 24.19.122.24 on Fri, 12 Dec 2014 02:04:49 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditionsstrategies to prevent ssi: 2014 update 611 cluding longer residual activity and activity in the presence of blood or serum.118,119 iv. These disinfectants are not interchangeable. Fol- low the manufacturers' instructions to ensure cor-rect application. 7. Use impervious plastic wound protectors for gastroin- testinal and biliary tract surgery (quality of evidence: I). a. A wound protector is a plastic sheath that lines a wound and can facilitate retraction of an incisionduring surgery without the need for additional me-chanical retractors. b. A recent meta-analysis of 6 randomized clinical trials in 1,008 patients reported that use of a plastic woundprotectors was associated with a 45% decrease inSSIs. 120 i. There was a nonsignicant trend toward greater protective effect using a dual-ring protector com-pared with a single-ring protector. 8. Use a checklist based on the World Health Organization (WHO) checklist to ensure compliance with best prac-tices to improve surgical patient safety (quality of evi-dence: I). a. The WHO checklist is a 19-item surgical safety check- list to improve adhere nce with best practices. b. A multicenter quasi-experimental study conducted in 8 countries demonstrated that use of the WHOchecklist led to lower rates of surgical complications,including SSI and death. 121 c. These ndings have been conrmed in subsequent single-center and multicenter q uasi-experimental studies.122,123 9. Perform surveillance for SSI (quality of evidence: II). a. Identify high-risk, high-volume operative procedures to be targeted for SSI surveillance on the basis of arisk assessment of patient populations, operative pro-cedures performed, and available SSI surveillancedata. b. Identify, collect, store, and analyze data needed for the surveillance program. 17 i. Develop a database for storing, managing, and accessing data colle cted on SSIs. ii. Implement a system for collecting data needed to identify SSIs. Data are required from surgical andmicrobiological databases. Obtain the followingdata from surgical databases: patient name, med-ical record number, date, type of procedure, sur-geons, anesthesiologists, incision time, woundclass, ASA score, closure time, and presence of anSSI. Ideally, these data are supplemented with pro-cess data, including prophylactic agent and doseand time(s) of administration of prophylacticagent. For patients diagnosed with an SSI, nec-essary microbiological data include type of SSI,infecting organism and antimic robial susceptibil- ities, and date of infection. More detailed surgicaland patient information may be useful for some procedures, including use of general anesthesia,emergency or trauma-related surgery, body massindex, and diagn osis of diabetes. iii. Prepare periodic SSI reports (time frame will de- pend on hospital needs and volume of targetedprocedures). iv. Collect denominator data on all patients under- going targeted procedures in order to calculate SSIrates for each type of procedure. 67 v. Identify trends (eg, in SSI rates and pathogens causing SSIs). c. Use updated CDC NHS N denitions for SSI.26 d. Perform indirect surveillance for targeted pro- cedures.30,31,124,125 e. Perform postoperative surveillance for 30 days; ex- tend the postoperative surveillance period to 90 daysfor certain procedure categories. 26 i. Procedures that require 90-day surveillance are de- termined by specic procedure codes. f. Surveillance should be performed on patients re- admitted to the hospital. i. If an SSI is diagnosed at your institution but the surgical procedure was performed elsewhere, notifythe hospital where the original procedure wasperformed. g. Develop a system for routine review and interpre- tation of SSI rates to detect signicant increases oroutbreaks and to identify areas where additional re-sources might be needed to improve SSI rates. 125If increased rates are identied, determine the numberof potentially preventable infections that occurred,dened as the number of SSIs that occurred duringa procedure in which less than 100% of recommendedpractices and processes were completed. 10. Increase the efciency of surveillance through utili- zation of automated dat a (quality of evidence: II). a. Implement a method to electronically transfer mi- crobiology and operative data, including process mea-sures when available, to IPC personnel to facilitatedenominator data acquisition and calculation of SSIrates for various procedures. b. If information technology and infrastructure re- sources are available, develop automated methodsfor detection of SSIs utilizing automated data forreadmissions, diagnosis and procedure codes, mi-crobiology results, and anti microbial dispens- ing. 35,126-129 c. Implementation of automated surveillance may im- prove the sensitivity of surveillance. 11.

Routinely provide feedback to surgical staff, periop- erative personnel, and leadership regarding compli-ance with targeted process measures. 13. Educate surgeons and perioperative personnel about SSI prevention (qualit y of evidence: III). a. Include risk factors, outcomes associated with SSI, local epidemiology (eg, SSI rates by procedure, rateof methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] infection in a facility), and basic prevention measures. 14. Educate patients and their families about SSI preven- tion as appropriate (quality of evidence: III). a. Provide instructions and information to patients prior to surgery describing strategies for reducing SSIrisk. Specically provide preprinted materials topatients. 131 b. Examples of printed materials for patients are avail- able from the fol lowing websites: i.JAMA patient page: wound infections (from the Journal of the American Medical Association ; avail- able at http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/294/16/2122). ii.

SSI: resources for patients and healthcare provid- ers (available from the CDC at http://www.cdc.gov/hai/ssi/ssi.html). 15. Implement policies and practices aimed at reducing the risk of SSI that align with evidence-based standards(eg, CDC, Association for periOperative RegisteredNurses, and professional qual-ity of evidence: II). 17,58,132 a. The pathogenesis and likelihood of developing an SSI involves a complex relationship among the following: i. Microbial characteristics (eg, degree of contami- nation, virulence of pathogen); ii. Patient characteristics (eg, immune status, co- morbid conditions); and iii. Surgical characteristics (eg, type of procedure, in- troduction of foreign material, amount of damageto tissues). 133 b. Risk factors for SSI can be separated into intrinsic patient-related characteristics and extrinsic proce-dure-related characteristics. Implement policies and practices to reducing modiable risk factors (Table2), including the following: i. Optimal preparation and disinfection of the op- erative site and the hands of the surgical teammembers. ii. Adherence to hand hygiene, including nonsurgeon members of the op erating team. 134 iii. Reduce unnecessary trafc in operating rooms.135,136 iv. Appropriate care and maintenance of operating rooms, including appropriate air handling and op-timal cleaning and disinfection of equipment andthe environment. 17 II. Special approaches for preventing SSI Standard infection control methods of outbreak inves- tigation are recommended for use in locations and/orpopulations within the hospital with unacceptably highSSI rates despite implementation of the basic SSI preven-tion strategi es listed above. 1. Screen for S. aureus and decolonize surgical patients with an antistaphylococcal agent in the preoperative set-ting for high-risk procedures, including some ortho-pedic and cardiothoracic procedures (quality of evi-dence: II). a. Screening for S. aureus refers to the practice of at- tempting to identify patients colonized with methi-cillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and/or MRSA. Decolonization refers to the practice of treating pa-tients with known S. aureus colonization with anti- microbial and/or antiseptic agents to eliminate S. au- reus colonization. i. There is no standardized approach to either screen- ing or decolonizing. Most clinicians attempt to de-colonize surgical patients with a combination ofchlorhexidine gluconate applied to the skin and na-sal mupirocin. b. A Cochrane review concluded that mupirocin alone may be effective, particularly in certain groups, in-cluding orthopedic and cardiot horacic patients. 137 Several nonrandomized trials corroborate this con- clusion.138-140 c. Clinical practice guidelines from the American So- ciety of Health-System Pharmacists recommend giv-ing mupirocin intranasally to all patients with doc-umented S. aureus colonization for orthopedic procedures, including total joint replacement and hipfracture repair, and cardiac procedures. 76 d. Some trials demonstrate that preoperative screening forS. aureus , coupled with intranasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine bathing is effective in reducing SSI forsome patients. i. For example, a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter trial that evaluated rapididentication of S. aureus nasal carriers followed This content downloaded from 24.19.122.24 on Fri, 12 Dec 2014 02:04:49 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditionstable 2. Selected Risk Factors for and Recommendations to Prevent Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) Risk factor RecommendationQuality of evidence Intrinsic, patient re lated (preoperative) Unmodiable Age No formal recommendation. Relationship to increased risk of SSI may be secondary to comorbidities or immunosenescence.216-218NA History of radiation No formal r ecommendation. Prior irradiati on at the surgical site increases the risk of SSI, likely due to tissue damage and wound ischemia.219NA History of SSTIs No formal recommendation. History of a prior skin infection may be a marker for inherent differences in host immune function.220NA Modiable Glucose control Control serum blood glucose levels for all surgical patients, including pa- tients without diabetes.17For patients with diabetes mellitus, reduce glycosylated hemoglobin A1c levels to less than 7% morbidly obese patients.76,221I Smoking Encourage cessation within 30 days of procedure.17,222-226I Immunosuppressive medications Avoi d immune-suppressive medications in perioperative period, if possible. III Hypoalbuminemia No formal recommendation. Although a noted risk factor,227do not delay surgery for use of TPN.NA Extrinsic, procedure related (perioperative) Preparation of patient Hair removal Do not remove unless hair will interfere with the operation.17If hair re- moval is necessary, remove outside the OR by clipping. Do not userazors.II Preoperative infections Identify and treat infectio ns (eg, urinary tract infection) remote to the sur- gical site prior to elective surgery. 17Do not routinely treat colonization or contamination.II Operative characteristics Surgical scrub (surgical team members' hands and forearms)Use appropriate antiseptic agent to perform preoperative surgical scrub.17,228For most products, scrub the hands and forearms for 2-5 minutes.II Skin preparation Wash and clean skin around incision site. Use a dual agent skin prepara- tion containing alcohol, prophylaxis Administer only when indicated.17I Timing Administer within 1 hour of incision to maximize tissue concentration76,aI Blood transfusion Blood tran sfusions increase the risk of SSI by decreasing macrophage function. Reduce blood loss and need for blood transfusion to thegreatest extent possible. 229-231II Choice of prophylactic agent Select appropriate agents on the basi s of surgical procedure, most com- mon pathogens causing SSIs for a specic procedure, and publishedrecommendations. 76I Duration of prophylaxis Stop agent within 24 hours after the procedure for all procedures.76II Surgeon skill/techn ique Handle tissue careful ly and eradicate dead space.17III Appropriate gloving All members o f the operative team should double glove and change gloves when perforation is noted.208III Asepsis Adhere to standard principles of OR asepsis.17III Operative time No formal re commendation in most recent guidelines.

In contrast, other trials have failed to demonstrate a benet. i. A prospective, interventional cohort study with a crossover design involving 21,000 patients con-cluded that universal, rapid screening for MRSAat admission coupled with decolonization of car-riers did not reduce the rate of SSI due to MRSA. 142 ii. A double-blind randomized controlled trial in- volving more than 4,000 patients showed that in-tranasal application of mupirocin, which was notcoupled with chlorhexidine bathing, did not sig-nicantly reduce the S. aureus SSI rate. 143 (a) In a secondary analysis of these data, the use of intranasal mupirocin was associated with anoverall decreased rate of nosocomial S. aureus infections among the S. aureus carriers. f. A recently published meta-analysis of 17 studies con- cluded that decolonization strategies prevent gram-positive SSIs, S. MRSA SSIs, although there was signicant heterogeneity among the trials. 144 g. Factors that impact the decision to implement screen- ing for S. aureus and decolonization include adher- ence to basic SSI prevention strategies, baseline rateof SSI due to S. aureus , individual patient risk factors for acquiring SSI due to S. aureus , availability of re- sources to implement the protocol, and ability to fol-low-up on protocol parameters (eg, laboratory re-sults) and adherence. h. Routine preoperative decolonization with mupirocin without screening is not currently recommended. i. Mupirocin resistance has been documented. 145 2. Perform antiseptic wound lavage (quality of evidence: II). a. Wound lavage is a common practice, although the solution used for lavage differs among surgeons.146 b. Several groups have evaluated whether dilute povi- done-iodine lavage of the surgical wound can de-crease the risk of SSI. A meta-analysis published in2010 evaluated 24 randomized controlled trials andconcluded that lavage with dilute povidone-iodine decreased the risk of compared with nonantiseptic lavage (RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.51-0.82]). 147 3. Perform an SSI risk assessment (quality of evidence: III). a. Convene a multidisciplinary team (eg, surgical lead- ership, hospital administration, quality managementservices, and infection control) to identify gaps, im-prove performance, measure compliance, assess im-pact of interventions, and provide feedback. 148b. Determine baseline SSI rates by surgical specialty, procedure, and/or surgeon to better target your eval-uation and interventions. 4. Observe and review operating room personnel and the environment of care in the operating room (quality ofevidence: III). a. Perform direct observation audits of operating room personnel to assess operating room processes andpractices to identify infection control lapses, includ-ing but not limited to adherence to process measures(antimicrobial prophylaxis choice, timing and dura-tion protocols, hair removal, etc), surgical hand an-tisepsis, patient skin preparation, operative technique,surgical attire (wearing and/or laundering outside theoperating room), and level of operating room traf-c. 149-153Perform remediation when breaches of stan- dards are identied. i. Operating room personnel should include sur- geons, surgical technologists, anesthesiologists, cir-culating nurses, residents, medical students, train-ees, and device manufactu rer representatives. 149 b. Perform direct-observation audits of environmental cleaning practices in the operating room, instrumentprocessing (sterilization ), and storage facilities. i. Review instrument processing and flash steriliza- tion logs. ii. Review maintenance records for operating room heating, ventilation, and air condi tioning system, including results of temperature and relative hu-midity testing, and test for maintenance of positiveair pressure in the operating room(s). c. Provide feedback and review infection control mea- sures with operating room and environmentalpersonnel. 5. Observe and review practices in the postanesthesia care unit, surgical intensive care unit, and/or surgical ward(quality of evidence: II). a. Perform direct observation audits of hand hygiene practices among all personnel with direct patientcontact. 151 b. Evaluate wound care practices.154 c. Perform direct observation audits of environmental cleaning practices. d. Provide feedback and review infection control mea- sures with staff in these po stoperative care settings. III. Approaches that should not be considered a routine part of SSI prevention 1. Do not routinely use vancomycin for antimicrobial pro- phylaxis (quality of evidence: II).75,76,155 a. Vancomycin should not routinely be used for anti- microbial prophylaxis, but it can be an appropriateagent for specic scenarios. Reserve vancomycin forspecic clinical circumstances, such as a proven out-break of SSI due to MRSA; high endemic rates of SSIdue to MRSA; targeted high-risk patients who are at This content downloaded from 24.19.122.24 on Fri, 12 Dec 2014 02:04:49 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditionsstrategies to prevent ssi: 2014 update 615 increased risk for SSI due to MRSA (including car- diothoracic surgical patients and elderly patients withdiabetes); and high-risk surgical procedures in whichan implant is placed. 156 i. No denitions for high endemic rates of SSI due to MRSA have been established.157 ii. Studies of the efcacy of vanco mycin prophylaxis were published prior to the emergence of com-munity-acquired MRSA. b. Two meta-analyses of studies comp aring glycopeptides tob-lactam antimicrobial prophylaxis concluded that there was no difference in rates of SSI between the 2antimicrobial prop hylaxis regimens. 144,158 c. A meta-analysis of 6 studies concluded that prophylaxis with a glycopeptide and a second agent was protectiveagainst SSI due to gram-positive organisms comparedwith prophylaxis with a b-lactam alone. 144Of note, the 2 randomized controlled trials included in the meta-analysis combined a glycopeptide with non- b-lactam antibiotic(s). Thus, no study has prospectively analyzedthe effect both glycopeptides and b-lactam antimicrobials for preoperative antimicrobial prophy-laxis. As vancomycin does not have activity againstgram-negative pathogens and appears to have less ac-tivity against MSSA than b-lactam agents, many experts recommend adding vancomycin to standard antimi-crobial prophylaxis for the specic clinical circum-stances described above. 76,157-159 2. Do not routinely delay surgery to provide parenteral nutrition (quality of evidence: I). a. Preoperative administration of total parenteral nu- trition has not been shown to reduce the risk of SSIin prospective randomized controlled trials and mayincrease the risk of SSI. 160,161 b. Individual trials comparing enteral and parenteral control diets tend to have very small num-bers and fail to show signicant differences. Two re-cent meta-analyses, however, demons trate reduction patientsreceiving enteral diets containing glutamine and/orarginine administered either before or after the sur-gical procedure. 162,163 3. Do not routinely use antiseptic-impregnated sutures as a strategy to prevent SSI s (quality of evidence: II). a. Human volunteer studies involving foreign bodies have demonstrated that the presence of surgical su-tures decreases the inoculum required to cause an SSIfrom 10 6to 102organisms.164 b. Some trials have shown that surgical wound closure with triclosan-coated polygactin 910 antimicrobialsutures may decrease the risk of SSI compared withstandard sutures. For example, a recent randomizedcontrolled trial of 410 colorectal surgeries concludedthat the rate of SSI decreased more than 50% (9.3% in the control group vs 4.3% among cases; Pp.05). 165 c. In contrast, a recent systematic review and meta-anal- ysis evaluated 7 randomized clinical trials and con-cluded that neither rates of SSI (odds ratio [OR], 0.77[95% CI, 0.4-1.51]; Pp.45) nor rates of wound dehiscence (OR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.21-5.43]; Pp.93) were statistically different compared with controls. 166 In addition, one small study raised concern abouthigher rates of wound dehiscence while using thesesutures. 167 d. The impact of routine use of antiseptic-impregnated sutures on development of resistance to antisepticsis unknown. 4. Do not routinely use antiseptic drapes as a strategy to prevent SSIs (quality of evidence: I). a. An incise drape is an adhesive lm that covers the surgical incision site to minimize bacterial woundcontamination due to endogenous flora. These drapescan be impregnated with antiseptic chemicals, suchas iodophors. b. A 2007 Cochrane review of 5 trials concluded that nonantiseptic incise drapes were associated with ahigher risk of SSI compared with no incise drape (RR,1.23 [95% CI, 1.02-1.48]), 168although this have been caused by one specic study.169 Two trials (abdominal and cardiac surgical patients)compared iodophor-impregnated drapes to nodrapes. 170,171While wound one trial,170neither demonstr ated that iodophor-impregnated decreased the rate ofSSI. A nonrandomized retrospective study similarlyconcluded that impregnated drapes do not preventSSIs after hernia repair. 172 IV . Unresolved issues 1. Preoperative bathing with chl orhexidine-containing products. a. Preoperative bathing with agents such as chlorhexi- dine has been shown to reduce bacterial colonization of the skin.173Several studies have examined the utility of preoperative showers, but none has denitivelyproven that they decrease SSI risk. A Cochrane reviewevaluated the evidence for preoperative bathing orshowering with antiseptics for SSI prevention. 174Six randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of 4%chlorhexidine gluconate were included in the analysis,with no clear evidence of benet noted. It should benoted that several of these studies had methodological limitations and were conducted several years ago.Thus, the role of preoperative bathing in SSI preven-tion is still uncertain. i. To gain the maximum antiseptic effect of chlor- hexidine, adequate levels of CHG must be achievedand maintained on the skin. Typically, adequatelevels are achieved by allowing CHG to dry com- This content downloaded from 24.19.122.24 on Fri, 12 Dec 2014 02:04:49 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions616 infection control and hospital epidemiology june 2014, vol. 35, no. 6 pletely.

Preoperative intranasal and pharyn geal chlorhexidine treatment for patients undergoing cardiothoracic procedures. a. Although data from a randomized controlled trial exist to support the use of cream is neither approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) nor com-mercially available in th e United States. 3. Use of gentamici n-collagen sponges. a. Gentamicin-collagen sponges have been evaluated as a way to decrease SSI among colorectal and cardiacsurgical patients. i.Colorectal surgical patients . Several single-center randomized trials have demonstrated that genta-micin-collagen sponges decrease the risk of SSI fol-lowing colorectal procedures. 178-180The rate of SSI was higher with the sponge, however, in a recentlarge, multicenter random ized clinical trial. 181 ii.Cardiothoracic surgical patients . Four randomized controlled trials have evaluated the use of genta-micin-collagen sponges in cardiothoracic surgery.Three of these trials demonstrated a decrease inSSIs, 182-184and one showed no difference.185A recent meta-analysis combining these trials concluded thatthe risk of deep sternal wound infection was sig-nicantly lower in patients who received a genta-micin-collagen sponge than in patients who did not(RR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.39-0.97]) despite signicantheterogeneity among the trials. 186 b. Gentamicin-collagen sponges are not currently ap- proved by the FDA for use in the United States. 4. Use of bundles to ensure compliance with best practices. a. Bundles have been promoted as methods to improve adherence to best practices. b. Although generally favorable, the use of bundles for the prevention of SSI has led to mixed results, de-pending on which com ponents are included. 59,187,188 c. Thus, there is no consensus on the components of an effective bundle to prevent SSIs. section 5: performance measures I. Internal reporting These performance measures are intended to support internal hospital quality improvement efforts and do notnecessarily address external reporting needs. The processand outcome measures suggested here are derived frompublished guidelines, other relevant literature, and theopinion of the authors. Report process and outcome mea-sures to senior hospital leadership, nursing leadership, and clinicians who care for patients at risk for SSI. A. Process measures 1. Compliance with antimicrobial prop hylaxis guide- lines. a. Measure the percentage of procedures in which an- timicrobial prophylaxis was appropriately pro-vided. Appropriateness includes (1) correct type ofagent, (2) start of administration of the agentwithin 1 hour of incision (2 hours allowed for van-comycin and fluoroquinolones), and (3) discon-tinuation of the agent within 24 hours after surgery. i. Numerator: number of patients who appropri- ately total number of selected opera- tions performed. iii. Multiply by 100 so that the measure is expressed as a percentage. 2. Compliance with hai r removal guidelines. a. Measure the percentage of procedures for which hair removal is appropriately performed (ie, clip-ping, use of a depilatory or no hair removal isperformed rather than use of razor). i. Numerator: number of patients with appropri- ate perioperative hair removal. ii. Denominator: total number of selected opera- tions performed. iii. Multiply by 100 so that the measure is expressed as a percentage. 3. Compliance with perioperative glucose control guidelines. a. Measure the percentage of procedures for which serum glucose is 180 mg/dL or lower within 18- 24 hours after anesthesia end time for all cardiac surgery patients. 60,61,100 i.

Rates of SSI can be risk adjusted using one of 2 methods: stratication using the NHSN riskindex 133or calculation of the standardized in- fection ratio (SIR).189NHSN now promotes the use of SIR over the NHSN risk index for im-proved risk adjustment potential, 190and SIR is preferentially used for the national public re-porting outcome measure within NHSN. (a) The NHSN risk index is an operation- and patient-specic prospectively applied riskscore that predicts SSIs. 191This risk index includes 3 predictors of increased risk of SSI:(1) estimators of wound microbial contam-ination, (2) duration of operation, and (3)markers for host susceptibility. 42 (b) SIR is the ratio of the observed number of SSIs ( O) that occurred compared with the expected number for a surgeon performinga specic type of 189The expected number can be obtained by multiplying the number ofoperations done by the surgeon in each pro-cedure risk category by the NHSN rate forthe same procedure risk category and divid-ing by 100. Values that exceed 1.0 indicatethat more SSIs occurred than expected. Im-portantly, SIR can only be calculated if thenumber of expected HAIs is 1. Thus, this approach may be more difcult for smallsurgical programs or if few procedures areperformed for any one procedure type. 192 (c) Risk adjustment using logistic regression and the SIR method generally provides better risk-adjustment than the basic risk index. 190,193 II. External reporting There are many challenges in providing useful infor- mation to consumers and other stakeholders while pre-venting unintended adverse consequences of public re-porting of HAIs. 194Recommendations and requirements for public reporting of HAIs have been provided byHICPAC, 195the Healthcare-Associated Infection Working Group of the Joint Public Policy Committee,54the Na- tional Quality Forum,55and CMS.196The following is an example of an external performance measure that is cur-rently required by some healthcare stakeholders andregulators. A. Process measures 1. Compliance with CMS antimicr obial prophylaxis guidelines (see the section above on internal reportingin \"Section 5: Performance Measures\"). a. Measure the percentage of procedures in which an- timicrobial prophylaxis was appropriately pro-vided. Appropriateness includes correct type ofagent, administration of the agent within 1 hourof incision (2 hours are allowed for vancomycin and fluoroquinolones), and discontinuation of theagent within 24 hours after surgery (48 hours forcardiothoracic procedures). 197 2. Compliance with the CMS guideline for control of postoperative blood glucose in cardiac surgerypatients. a. Measure the percentage of procedures in which postoperative blood glucose was appropriately con-trolled in cardiac surgery patients. B. Federal and state requirements 1. Federal requirements a. The CMS published a nal rule in the Federal Reg- ister on August 18, 2011, that includes SSI reporting via the CDC's NHSN in the CMS Hospital IQRprogram requirements for 2012. 196More speci- cally, the rule announced a reporting requirementfor SSI data for inpatient abdominal hysterectomyand inpatient colon procedures beginning with sur-gical procedures performed on January 1, 2012. 198 b. The requirements for SSI reporting to NHSN for the IQR program do not preempt or supersedestate mandates for SSI reporting to NHSN (ie, hos-pitals in states with an SSI reporting mandate mustabide by their state's requirements, even if they aremore extensive than the requirements for this CMSprogram). NHSN users reporting SSI data to thesystem must adhere to the denitions and report-ing requirements for SSIs as specied in the NHSNPatient Safety Component Protocol Manual. 198For more information, see htt p://www.cdc.gov/nhsn /acute-care-hospital/ssi/index.html. 2. State requirements and collaboratives a.State requirements . Hospitals in states that have mandatory SSI reporting requirements must collectand report the data required by the state. For in-formation on state requirements, check with yourstate or local health department. b.State collaboratives . Currently 27 states have im- plemented voluntary moreinformation on state collaboratives for SSI, seehttp://www.cdc.gov/hai /stateplans/states-w-SSI -collaborative.html. 3. External quality initiatives a. Several external quality initiatives focused on SSI prevention are ongoing. The benets in partici-pation in these external quality initiatives is un-known but may include improvement in the cul-ture of safety and patient ou tcomes, including decreased rates of SSI.

Fundamental Elements of Accountability for Healthcare-Associated Infection Prevention Senior management is responsible for ensuring that the healthcare system supports an infection prevention and control (IPC) pro- gram that effectively preve nts healthcare-associated in fections (HAIs) and the transmission of epidemiologic ally important pathogens Senior management is accountable for en suring that an adequate number of trained personnel are as signed to the IPC program and adequate stafng of other departments that play a key role in HAI prevention (eg, environmental services) Senior management is accountable for ensuring that healthcare personnel, including licensed and nonlicensed personnel, are ade- quately trained and competent to per form their job responsibilities Direct healthcare providers (such as physicians, nurses, aides, and therapists) and ancillary personnel (such as environmental service and equipment processing person nel) are responsible for ensurin g that appropriate IPC practices ar e used at all times (including hand hygiene, standard and isolation precautions, and cleaning and disinfection of equipment and the environment) Senior and unit leaders are responsible for holding personnel accountable for their actionsIPC leadership is responsible for ensuring that an active program to identify HAIs is implemented, that HAI data are analyzed and regularly provided to those who can use the information to improve the quality of care (eg, unit staff, clinicians, and hospitaladministrators), and that evidence-based practices are incorporated into the program Senior and unit leaders are accountable for ensuring that appropriate training and educational programs to prevent HAIs are devel- oped and provided to personn el, patients, and families Personnel from the IPC program, the laboratory, and information techno logy departments are responsible for ensuring that systems are in place to support the surveillance program section 6: examples of implementation strategies Accountability is an essential principle for preventing HAIs. It provides the necessary translational link between scienceand implementation. Without clear accou ntability, scienti- cally based implementation strategies will be used in an in-consistent and fragmented way, decreasing their effectivenessin preventing HAIs. Accountability begins with the chief ex-ecutive ofcer and other senior leaders who provide the im-perative for HAI prevention, thereby making HAI preventionan organizational priority. Senior leadership is accountablefor providing adequate resources needed for effective imple-mentation of an HAI prevention program. These resourcesinclude necessary personnel (clinical and nonclinical), edu-cation, and equipment (Table 3). The following information identies impl ementation strat- egies that can be used as part of a program to prevent andreduce the risk for SSI. The implementation strategies areorganized under 4 concepts: engage, educate, execute, andevaluate. 199 I. Engage In the engagement phase, there needs to be clear and effective communication pertaining to the reasons why theSSI implementation strategies are important for patientcare. Engagement of senior leadership, physician cham-pions, infection preventionists, and multidisciplinaryteams are examples of strategies necessary for initial im-plementation of a program to reduce SSIs. The followingimplementation strategies are described in the literature asbeing essential for the enga gement process. A.Obtaining support for SSI reduction from senior leader- ship. Senior leadership support is an important factor contributing to SSI rate decreases. Senior leadership isalso critical for sustaining improvements over time.Senior leadership can include but is not limited to the hospital's board, president, chief operating ofcer, chief medical ofcer, and chief nursing ofcer. 148,200-203 B.Obtaining highly engaged physicians as champions .M e d - ical and surgical staff engagement is critical for SSI pre- vention activities and to champion SSI prevention throughout the hospital. Examples include a physicianleading an SSI prevention multidisciplinary team anda physician champion who provides education on strat-egies to reduce SSIs to other physicians and staff. 202,203 C.Use of multidisciplinary teams . Numerous studies and literature address the effectiveness of multidisciplinary teams to plan, develop, implement, and evaluate effortsto reduce SSIs. The key components of the team includepreoperative, intraoperative, and post operative man- agement of the patient. Teams should include nursing, pharmacy, and phys ician champions. 148,200,204-207 D.Adopting evidence-based practices and guidelines . Several studies in the literature focus on the need for hospitals to adopt evidence-based practices and guidelines in an effort to decrease the risk of SSIs. The literature stressesthat, although evidence-based interventions can reducethe number of SSIs and improve patient outcomes,implementation of these practices nationally occurs lessfrequently than is desirable. 10,148,203,208-210 E.Focus on a culture of safety . The literature supports the need for a culture of safety to successfully implement a program focusing on reducing SSIs. A culture of safety focuses on teamwork, technical processes, and pro-moting accountability for preventing SSIs throughoutthe continuum of care. 136,200,202 II. Educate Education pertaining to practices to prevent SSIs is es- sential for senior leadership, physicians, nurses, and pa-tients and families. The following impl ementation strat- This content downloaded from 24.19.122.24 on Fri, 12 Dec 2014 02:04:49 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditionsstrategies to prevent ssi: 2014 update 619 egies describe the types of education that can impact SSI rates and who should be the focus of educational efforts. A.Aligned and coordinated SSI education for licensed in- dependent practitioners and staff . Multidisciplinary ed- ucation for licensed independent practi tioners (physi- cians and midlevel practitioners) and other practitionerstaff (registered nurses) must be aligned and coordi-nated. The content of the education focuses on thecontinuum of the patient's care and execution of evi-dence-based practices t o prevent SSIs. 202,203 B.One-to-one education of the surgeon when an SSI issue is identied . Provide one-to-one education when sur- geons have elevated SSI rates and/or when appropriatepreventive processes are not being adhered to. This ed-ucation may be conducted by another surgeon, infec-tion preventionist, quality ofce, or other qualied in-dividuals. The education should be nonc onfrontational with an emphasis on understanding variation in prac-tice rather than judgment. If lack of adherence to evi-dence-based practices is identied, then an action planmust be developed. 203 C.Education for senior leadership that describes the value and benets of SSI reduction . Provide education to ex- ecutive leadership regarding the value of reducing SSIs,including patient and scal outcomes. 131 D.Education for the surgical team on safety science . Provide education to licensed independent practi tioners and staff involved in the care of surgical patients on thescience of safety, including the principles of safe systemdesign. 200 E.Specic SSI education for patients and families . Patient education for reducing SSIs is a major priority for anyhospital focused on preventing SSIs. Education strate-gies such as presurgical classes, television education, andone-to-one education with the patient and family havebeen used successfully. Educational materials should beprovided in multiple languages on the basis of the pop-ulation served. 131,202,203 III. Execute In the execution phase, the focus is on implementation strategies to reduce barriers and improve adherence withevidence-based practices and reduce the risk of SSIs, in-cluding ( a) standardization of care processes, ( b) creating redundancy or independent checks, and ( c) learning from defects when an SSI occurs. As noted above, no consensusexists on the components of an effective bundle to pre-vent SSIs. Thus, individual hospitals must identify localdecits and create their own bundle. A.Use a quality improvement methodology . Use of quality improvement methodology for designing and imple-menting a program leads to reduced rates of SSIs. Qual-ity improvement methodologies include Lean SixSigma, the Comprehensive Unit-Based Safety Program,and the Plan-Do-Check-Act model. Various perfor-mance improvement (PI) tools have been used, in-cluding dashboards, scorecards, and histograms, to dis- play ric populations . Pediatric-focused evidence-based practices for reducingSSIs are lacking. Clinical interventions designed for theadult population cannot necessarily be transferred tothe pediatric population. Hospital and pediatric sur-geons must determine whether adult evidence-basedinterventions can be safely used with the pediatricpopulation. 203 C.Use of information technologies (IT) . IT innovations can be used to simplify and standardize clinical documen-tation. IT and the electronic medical record can alsobe used for electronic surveillance, electronic prompts,automatic stops for prophylactic antibiotic orders, andeducation. Education can be delivered to patients, fam-ilies, and healthcare workers through different media,including the Inte rnet and television. 148,202,203,212 D.Participation in a collaborative . Numerous studies have reported that participation in a collaborative can helpreduce SSI rates in participating or ganizations. Colla- boratives provide a me chanism for organizations to 1. Utilize valid data, such as with the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality ImprovementProgram; 213 2. Identify increased morbidity and mortality through comparisons to peer hospitals on a national basis;213 and 3. Learn through the collaboration pro- cess.161,202,203,205,207,209,213,214 E.Use of preoperative/postoperative order sets . Standardized order sets can be developed on the basis of evidence-based practices. The order sets should be approved bythe medical staff and updated when the evidence-basedpractices change. The development of order sets is alabor-intensive process necessitating skills and expertiseof several disciplines, including surgery, anesthesia,nursing, and pharmacy. All relevant disciplines shouldbe educated in the use of the order sets. 148,202,203 F.Acting on identied SSI issues . When issues suspected of increasing the risk of SSI are identied, the hospitalshould take action to resolve the identied issues. Sev-eral hospitals conduct root-cause analyses with a mul-tidisciplinary team to identify the cause of the issuesand any lack of adherence in the evidence-based prac-tices. 149,202-204 G.Establish a protocol for preoperative a protocol for procedure-specic preoperative testing todetect medical conditions that increase the risk of SSI.The protocol should focus on nutritional counseling ifindicated, smoking cessation if indicated, preadmissioninfections, and reconciling medications with adjust-ments prior to surgery if indicated. 202If high-risk pa- tients are identied through screening, alerts should beadded to electronic medical records to ensure that all This content downloaded from 24.19.122.24 on Fri, 12 Dec 2014 02:04:49 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions620 infection control and hospital ep idemiology june 2014, vol. 35, no. 6 members of the perioperative team are aware of the high-risk condition(s). IV . Evaluate In the evaluation phase, the focus is on the use of measurement and evaluation tools to determine the ef-fectiveness of implementation strategies in the preventionof SSIs. A.Use of performance improvement tools . Various PI tools can be used. PI tools include dashboards, scorecards,or histograms to display data. Additional PI tools caninclude root-cause analysis and failure modes and ef-fects analysis. 148,202,203 B.Direct observation of evidence-based practices .A sp a r to f a hospital's SSI improvement activities, trained observ-ers (eg, infection preventionists, educators, nurses, andphysicians) should observe surgery to assure that evi-dence-based practices have been implemented in theoperating room. Direct observation can also be con-ducted for hand hygiene and surgical hand antisepsistechnique. This activity is used to educate and reinforceevidence-based practices with the operating roompractitioners. 136,149,203,214 C.Longitudinal evaluation of SSI rates and compliance rates . Track the success of the SSI reduction program by eval-uating SSI rates over time (ie, before, during, and afterthe program). If specic practices or processes are iden-tied for improvement, evaluate the compliance withevidence-based practices related to these practices andprocesses.
