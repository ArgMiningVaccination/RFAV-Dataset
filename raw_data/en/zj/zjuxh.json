Oddly enough, it's a simple result of our body trying to protect itself. Sound strange? Check this out: the body produces mucus as a [protection mechanism just like it does tears and saliva.](https://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Fighting-Infection/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/The-body-s-first-line-of-defence) Mucus (like other bodily fluids) contains an enzyme that helps break pathogens we encounter through the environment, our food, or when our immune system senses it's under attack. This is why allergic foods produce mucus and why when you're sick you produce more. So while it's not a very enchanting thought, that fluid we all see as gross is good for us. The problem is if we're consistently producing mucus all the time, which indicates the immune system consistently senses it is under attack. (This may also indicate our [gut bacteria is weakened ](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/natural-health/how-to-build-and-maintain-a-healthy-gut/)since it protects us from infection and unhealthy bacteria in which the body wouldn't produce mucous in the first place.) So, if we are producing too much mucus (post nasal drip after eating, constantly running nose, cystic white acne, or persistent mucus from the nose or eyes), we need to think about what we are eating, drinking, or encountering that is triggering the reaction. For many people, it's the top allergenic foods: wheat, soy, dairy, tree nuts, eggs, and gluten (which wheat is part of). For others, it might be an autoimmune disease or simple [zinc](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/natural-health/the-importance-of-getting-enough-zinc-in-a-vegan-diet-and-how-to-do-it/) or good bacteria deficiency. So the first step is to find out the offenders, remove them, and go on an elimination diet if need be. Excess carbohydrates and refined sugar can also weaken good bacteria and, therefore, cause the body to produce mucus as a result. So whatever your case may be, figure that out first, and then add these foods below.
