Sustainable business activities are a matter close to our heart that ensure we play our part in creating a world in which the health and beauty of human beings and nature continually unfold. Over the past year, we have fundamentally reworked our sustainability strategy, and this has now been adopted. In developing this strategy, we identified seven areas of action on which we will be particularly focusing over the next few years. The three pillars of sustainability - economic viability, environmental protection and social responsibility - are implicitly included in every area of action. In line with the new strategy, the report is divided into seven chapters: Product development and products Ecological farming and biodiversity Respectful supply chain Sustainable sites, production and logistics Meaningful and effective work Cultural and social development and relationships Management and finance The performance of Weleda is above all attributable to the efforts of our 2,440 employ-ees. Each of the seven chapters begins with the short story of an employee or some-one who works with Weleda, sharing what they do in and for the company and beyond. We are calling these contributions they make \"goodprints\" - as opposed to footprints. I would like to take this opportunity to express my warm thanks to all employees for their dedication. In 2017 they played a crucial part in enabling us to once again conclude the year successfully. On this basis, we on the Board of Directors have made the follow-ing strategic decisions: to renew our infrastructure with the core element of a new produc-tion and logistics building in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, to develop the new pharmaceuticals strategy, to revise the range strategy for natural and organic cosmetics, to carry out addi-tional investment in research and development, and to formulate concepts for Weleda Treatment Studios. I look forward to continuing to work with you for our customers and a humane society. Yours, Paul Mackay Chairman of the Board of Directors of Weleda AGIt is a matter close to my heart to take Weleda in a direction in which it can make a unique and lasting contribution to society, the people associated with the company, and nature. Paul Mackay, Chairman of the Board of DirectorsA successful, cooperative leadership at Weleda is reliant on an effec- tive organisation and good corporate governance 1. It is to this that I am personally committed. Dr J\u00fcrg Galliker, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors and independent lawyer in Basel The research and development of anthro posophic pharmaceuticals is a cause that I particularly care about. I am devoting my efforts to making them available worldwide in a cost-effective way. Prof. Dr Harald Matthes, senior doctor at Havelh\u00f6he Community Hospital in BerlinMedicine and cosmetics come from the same source. There are still many treasures to be found. By discovering these, we open the door to a successful future at Weleda. Elfi Seiler, pharmacist by training and co-owner of the St Peter Pharmacy in Zurich The contribution that Weleda makes to people, society and the environment is extremely important for us as owners. Creating premium innovative products for healing and care with passion and love - that is my goal. Dr Andreas J\u00e4schke, Managing Director of Klinik Arlesheim 1 Principles of corporate governance (page 85 ) 2 3BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF WELEDA AG EDITORIAL OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORSThe Executive Board of Weleda AG As the person with responsibility for the markets, I take the view that we must never lose sight of our customers in all decisions we take. In addition, the internationalisation and entrepreneurialism of Weleda are particularly important to me. Andreas Sommer, Chief Commercial Officer My aim is to strengthen the financial resilience of Weleda in the long term, structuring the value chain as efficiently as possible and distributing this value in line with our vision. Michael Brenner, Chief Financial OfficerI am responsible for the areas of research and development as well as production. Scientifically tested, innovative pharmaceuticals and natural and organic cosmetics with the classic Weleda signature as well as a forward-looking production environment are my guiding principles. Dr Aldo Ammendola, Chief Research and Development Officer / Chief Operations OfficerMission, Vision, Goals Why does Weleda make a difference for the world? How do we want to realise our vision? When doing so, what is the specific goal or material requirement that we are aiming for? The declaration on our Mission, Vision and Goals is our guiding star for the work we do as a company. Inspired by anthroposophy, Weleda researches, develops, creates and sells pharmaceu-ticals and cosmetics. Weleda products activate the healing forces of human beings and nature. Weleda sustainably develops its business in harmony with nature and the human being.Goals Vision Mission Goals Mission Vision Creating a world in which the health and beauty of human beings and nature continually unfold. Vision Mission Goals Weleda is the global market leader for anthroposophic pharmaceuticals and shares a responsibility for the system of anthroposophic medicine. Weleda is a benchmark company and global market leader for certified natural and organic cosmetics. Weleda develops markets in such a way as to achieve long-term market relevance. 4 5MISSION, VISION, GOALS THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF WELEDA AGDevelopment of the Weleda Sustainability Programme In the reporting year, we revised and further specified our Sustainability Programme in order to map out the value chain of Weleda in a traceable way and present our actions more clearly. It is now divided into seven areas of action, which will each be presented in the following chapters: with our commitments, targets and achievements as well as news from 2017. Until now, the focus of our sustainability management had been on the three dimensions of sustainability: economic, environmental and social. Our reporting was structured accordingly. However, this categorisation meant many as- pects were artificially separated, such as the topic of supply chains, for example, which spans all dimensions. Our objec-tive was therefore to map out the Weleda value chain so that it can be clearly and effectively communicated. Seven areas of action The Weleda sustainability flower with dimensions and ac- tion fields enabled us to draw contextual connections be- tween areas of action - with the corporate vision always at the centre (see page 5 ). The seven areas of action (see diagram on page 7 ) correspond to the core sustainability considerations at Weleda. In all areas, the activities are aimed at being socially responsible, environmentally friend-ly and commercially successful. What Weleda stands for The areas of action include commitments by which Weleda is already bound today. These are initiatives and achieve- ments, and voluntary undertakings and promises, in rela- tion to our business activities. In addition, we have defined commitments for the future which strive dynamically to support the Weleda vision and contribute to the sustainable development of the company. A few of the topics that are of particular importance to us are presented briefly here; others, such as packaging to name but one, can be found in the following pages. Ecological farming and biodiversity Healthy soil plays an important role in enabling sustain-able agriculture to thrive in the long term. It is essential for the health and beauty of flora and fauna, so is ulti- mately a prerequisite for all Weleda products. As a com-pany, we are inextricably linked with organic farming. The organic share of our plant raw materials already stands at more than 80 per cent now.We are especially closely aligned with biodynamic agricul-ture. It is our conviction that biodynamic cultivation is the most sustainable form of farming. For this reason, we have set ourselves the target of sig- nificantly raising the percentage of raw materials sourced from biodynamic cultivation over the next five years: to 30 per cent of the organic share. In addition, we intend to launch initiatives for biodynamic farming in collaboration with our partners to raise awareness of issues such as bio-diversity, insects and healthy soil in local and global cam- paigns. Respectful supply chain We strive to deliver comprehensive and measurable trans- parency and fairness within Weleda's supply chains. Fur- ther, we want to prove that organic farming and biody- namic agriculture are beneficial to humans and nature alike. For this reason, we have decided to launch pilot projects for calculating the true cost of some lead plants (true cost accounting ). Sustainable management and finance Transparent business management with high ecosocial aspirations has been important for Weleda since the very start. In future, we will be involving our associated com- panies throughout the world even more strongly in order to reach ambitious ecosocial targets. Both internally and as a group we want to be more intensively connected to the world so that we as a company can positively influ- ence people and the planet. We will also be supporting the B Corp initiative, a global network of companies that has redefined what it means to be successful in business. \"B\" stands for benefit, having a positive impact. This is interwoven with a management approach comprising tools that offer guidance on how to consistently enhance this beneficial impact. Part of this is our efforts to further improve sustainability reporting and increase transparency on the impact and achievements of Weleda (www.bcorporation.net ). The next chapters on our areas of action will each intro-duce an individual. These are people from the world of Weleda who are doing good and consequently helping to make the world a better place - through their pro-fessional work or with voluntary activities in their spare time. We have coined the term \"goodprint\" for this pos- itive work, as opposed to the already familiar concept of an ecological footprint.Cultural and social develop- ment and relationshipsManagement and financeProduct development and products Respectful supply chain Meaningful and effective work Sustainable sites, production and logisticsEcological farming and biodiversityCreating a world in which the health and beauty of human beings and nature continually unfold. 6 7WELEDA SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAMME WELEDA SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAMMEProduct development and products Weleda has stood for a very special promise of quality since the start and this is also the foundation of our customers' trust. Alongside high product quality, there is great demand for resource-efficient packaging today. Our research and development team have been working hard in this area for many years. They make a vital contribution to the future of Weleda, in natural and organic cosmetics as well as pharmaceuticals.1 Weleda's commitment to quality: - NATRUE certification of natural and organic cosmetic products - Products based on natural, nature-identical and derived natural substances - No use of parabens, paraffins, synthetic fragrances, colourings or preservatives, gelatine, aluminium salts, phthalates, genetically modified raw materials or microplastics; and no animal testing for natural and organic cosmetics High quality requirements for raw materials according to Weleda's specifications: testing for pesticides, testing of all raw materials in our own analysis section Raw materials are processed fresh and immediately: generally by in-house tincture manufacturing according to pharmaceutical methods. In-house fragrance development: pure natural essential oils Involvement in palm oil (see pages 16 and 18 ) Packaging: - Around 50 per cent of primary packaging materials are recycled - Certified 100 per cent: paper, cardboard and package inserts of natural and organic cosmetic products - Transport packaging made up 100 per cent of recycled fibres - Made in EuropeWhat we have achieved so far - our commitments Target achieved Target partially achieved Target not achieved Further development of environmen-tally friendly, recyclable packaging for natural and organic cosmetics Optimised screw cap for aluminium tubes in 2016 and 2017 Introduction of the harmony bottle (body oil with pump ) that is 85 per cent recycled glass Definition of sustainability criteria for new product development First mineral oil-free colour printing on folding boxesContinuation of targets: Baby PET bottle with 50 per cent recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) Roll-on deodorant container with 50 per cent recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE ) Sustainable materials for folding boxes and package inserts Projects to replace aluminium tubes containing Coex plastic film with recycled HDPE Concept to redesign transport packaging (cardboard ) Started process for concept development Development of concept for transport packagingTargets 2018 Targets set for 2017 Achievements 2017 Sustainability must also be practical: new mothers want to be able to open and close baby oil bottles with one hand. Murat Haner, Head of Packaging Development at Weleda Switzerland 8AREA OF ACTION PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTSOvercoming boundaries. Perhaps sometimes finding a way to square the circle: what do tubes and bottles for Weleda's natu-ral and organic cosmetics need to be made of to ensure they protect their contents for three years, but are easily compostable on expiration? \"This is what we are currently researching,\" says Murat Haner, as well as how packaging could perhaps find a \"second life\", as a decorative piece, for example. The Head of Packaging Development and his small team are constantly working on new solutions that will make the Company's packaging for natural and organic cosmetics as well as medicinal products even more sustainable: \"Our vision is modern, functional, sustainable packaging that customers love and also sim- plifies our processes.\" The graduate in chemical engineering has been at Weleda for just under two years and much has already been achieved in that time (see column on right ). This year, the calendula baby care range will become available with a practical flip-top on a plastic bottle that is made of 50 per cent recycled material. \"In the nat-ural cosmetics sector, half is a lot,\" Murat asserts. This does not make it cheaper but is consistent with the original mission of 1921 to be responsible in the use of resources. Murat Haner is also personally invested. He first discovered Weleda products in Vienna when he moved from western Turkey to work for an international company, first in Austria and later in Dusseldorf, before Weleda offered him a job. He now lives near Arlesheim, 2,500 kilometres from Izmir, with his wife Sebnem and their two-year-old daughter. The family prefers to buy fruit and vegetables locally at the market where it is fresh and comes without all the unnecessary packaging.Murat Haner (39) is Head of Packaging Development at Weleda AG in Arlesheim and Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd. He has worked for the company since 2016 and hopes soon to be able to manufacture food-grade pack- aging directly from the dispos- al of recyclable waste.New people in key positions KIDS 2 IN 1 SHOWER & SHAMPOO With three different Kids 2 in 1 Shower & Shampoo options with fun designs, we now offer care products for children alongside our baby care range.EDELWEISS SUN CREAM Weleda sun cream pre- viously had to be with- drawn from the market in 2008 but in 2018 we launched five new sun protection products. They use mineral non-nano UV filters.Chemist Bernhard Irrgang has been Head of Research and Devel- opment for Natural and Organic Cosmetics at Weleda since July 2017. This area comprises the teams in Galenic Development, Packaging Development, Active Substance Development and Fragrance Devel-opment as well as the Regulatory Affairs and Scientific Information departments. Bernhard Irrgang can look back on many years of experi- ence in the development of natural and organic cosmetics. As of July 2017, biologist Gerald K\u00fcnstle has headed up the newly established Pre clin- ical Development Unit. His role is to collect scientific data and facts for selected pharmaceuti- cals and consequently support the marketing of these products. BEAUTY BALM After the success- ful introduction of tinted lip balm, two face creams have been on the market since the start of 2018: Beauty Balm 5 in1 Tinted Day Cream in the shades of nude or bronze.GENTLE CLEANSING FOAM Since the start of 2018, the Weleda facial cleansing line has been enhanced with a cleansing foam.FEEL GOOD SHOWER LIMITED EDITION Spicy ginger to feel great: this limited edition shower gel has been available ex- clusively in Austria, France, Germany and Switzerland since spring 2018.New products We introduced 12 products in 2017 and early 2018. Weleda was also repositioned in two new market segments: sun care and care for children. It is my aim to ensure that Weleda regains its role as trendsetter in natural and organic cosmetics. My goal is to underline the efficacy of Weleda medicinal prod- ucts with scientific facts and make them commercially success- ful as a result.IN BRIEF Successes in packaging development in 2017 4 t of material was saved by optimising the weight of the screw cap for aluminium tubes. 85 % of each green glass bottle used for body oils is recycled material - the highest share of recycled glass possible. A pump dispenser also dis- penses the oil more easily. 250,000 fewer package inserts were printed following the switch to dual labels on body oils: the removable bottle label now features the product information on the reverse side. Further achievements For the first time, mineral oil-free ink was used to print on folding boxes. Aluminium barrier laminate (ABL) tubes were used for the new beauty balms: the plastic tubes contain a thin aluminium layer which effectively protects the product and at the same time improves ease of use. The foam pump was optimised for the new cleansing foam. Skin Food skin cream has been sold without a package insert since September 2017. 10 11AREA OF ACTION PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTSAREA OF ACTIONPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTS\"Research is essential for our survival\" Dr Aldo Ammendola took on the new role of Executive Board member with responsibility for Research and Development (R & D ) in 2016. He talked to us about the challenges of researching complementary medicine and the further development of Weleda's pharmaceuticals range. What does research mean for Weleda? ALDO AMMENDOLA: For a company like Weleda, R & D is essential for survival. Especially in the area of pharma- ceuticals, innovative research forms the basis of being able to offer patients proven effective and safe products. In addition, R & D makes a fundamental contribution to the financial stability of Weleda. Anthroposophy has served as our inspiration. It is the driving force behind the development and research of new medicinal products drawing on the latest scientific methods. How has pharmaceuticals research changed since you took over the unit? ALDO AMMENDOLA: For a long time Weleda drew on the rich pool of traditional knowledge and above all concen- trated on managing and securing its very large existing range. About a year ago, we shifted our focus more towards the scientific research of selected products and innovation. The aim is to reconcile therapeutic variety with cost-effectiveness. What do you think are the challenges for research in complementary medicine? ALDO AMMENDOLA: In contrast to the pharmaceutical giants, medium-sized companies such as Weleda have a limited availability of financial resources for the development of medicinal products. Conversely, it is important that the wealth of traditional knowledge from herbal medicine and anthroposophic medicine is brought into line with the demands of modern, evidence-based medicine and a clear-ly describable mode of action in terms of natural science. How does Weleda benefit from the research? ALDO AMMENDOLA: Research is always initially an invest- ment in the future. The findings of our current research activities will only be evident in a few years. For totally new medicinal products, the time horizon is even longer owing to the higher development effort that is required. The new spirit of research has already noticeably re- vived the working atmosphere - after years of stagna-tion during the restructuring phase, a spirit of excited optimism is now in the air. To the outside world, innova- tive research has enabled Weleda to position itself as a future-oriented and sustainable company. And as a company that recognises gaps in pharmaceutical and complementary medicine for the treatment of diseases and aims to plug these through effective and safe me-dicinal products.Dr Aldo Ammendola in discussion with Christine Holzschuh, who works in the Analysis department in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd.Galenic Development in Arlesheim: this is where research on the compo-sition of substances is con-ducted. Research is always initially an invest- ment in the future. The findings of our current research activities will only be evident in a few years.What type of research does Weleda conduct? ALDO AMMENDOLA: The focus of research in com- plementary medicine is on the aspects of quality, efficacy and safety. Specifically, Weleda carries out pharmaceutical research (further development of manufacturing methods ), preclinical research (investigation of innovative therapies in non- clinical testing ) and clinical research (pharmaceu- tical trials with healthy subjects and patients ). Who decides the area for research? ALDO AMMENDOLA: The Company's own experts and expert panels determine and quantify gaps in the pharmaceuticals market and identify the necessity for the research and further develop- ment of medicinal products. The medical need of patients and the predicted commercial success play an important role in this respect. Ultimately, the Executive Board and the Board of Directors decide whether research will be conducted in this field.What is the current focus of your research? ALDO AMMENDOLA: At present, our research activi- ties are concentrating on eye diseases and skin disorders as well as stress and sleep problems. Which goals are you pursuing in the Research department? ALDO AMMENDOLA: In the medium term, we want to achieve first tangible successes and gradually expand the research at the same time. We are therefore on course to make some of our pharma-ceuticals marketable at an international level. Furthermore, we are developing our range in close cooperation with anthroposophic doctors.>100 More than 100 employees work in the area of R & D. Investment in the double-digit millions is planned over the next few years. 12 13AREA OF ACTION PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTSEcological farming and biodiversity2 The organic proportion of plant raw materials used in Weleda products is more than 80 per cent. By cultivating an area of just under 248 square kilometres worldwide in accordance with organic cultivation guidelines, which is the equivalent of almost 35,000 football pitches, we nurture biodiversity, soil health and the protection of water quality together with our partners. This results in humus-rich and fertile soils as well as healthy and strong plants - the basis for healthy products. Organic share of at least 80 per cent Largest biodynamic medicinal plant garden in Europe as well as other own gardens Involvement in palm oil: - Chair of the Executive Board of FONAP (Forum for Sustainable Palm Oil ) and member of RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ) - Pure palm oil of the highest quality: certifications include RSPO IP (Identity Preserved 1), Bio (organic ), Fair Trade and more - Palm derivatives are 100 per cent certified as RSPO MB (Mass Balance 2) and Book & Claim 3 by our suppliers. Cultivation area of around 248 square kilometres for organic raw materials (including certified wild collection ) Involvement in seed initiatives: Organic Seeds Sunflower Initiative (IBS) and Hortus Officinarum association Endangered and protected species from sustainable and organically certified sources (e. g. arnica )What we have achieved so far - our commitments 1 Palm oil is verifiably derived 100 per cent from a single certified plantation. Traceability from the end product to the palm oil plantation can be guaranteed at all times. 2 Mass Balance supply chain model 3 The palm oil used in the end product is not physically certified, but the same volume of certificates is bought to offset use. Further information can be found at www.forumpalmoel.org/certification/trade-options Consistent organic proportion of 80 per cent Organic standards implemented for new raw materials; new partnerships in compliance with organic standards Continuation of target Continuation: projects for the protection of biodiversity Status report on biodiversity in three supply chains; project to plant hedges Global launch of further projects to protect and maintain biodiversity in cultivation and collection regionsTargets 2018 Targets set for 2017 Achievements 2017 Publication of a Weleda garden book Purchase of 1 square metre of organic land for every Werde magazine sold at the newsstandNew targetsIn the stillness of our medicinal gardens I feel how strongly we are all connected with nature. It's the essence of our medicines. Claire Hattersley, Head Gardener, Weleda medicinal plant garden, at Weleda UK Target achieved Target partially achieved Target not achieved 14AREA OF ACTION ECOLOGICAL FARMING AND BIODIVERSITYMedicinal plant garden is UN Decade project In recognition of its commitment to biodiver- sity, Weleda's medicinal plant garden in Schw\u00e4-bisch Gm\u00fcnd was selected as a project of the UN Decade on Biodiversity in September 2017. Europe's largest biodynamically cultivated medicinal plant garden provides a habitat for countless plant and animal species. Each year, the medicinal plant garden welcomes an average of 25,000 visitors and carries out around 700 tours. This is a chance for them to gain an insight into Weleda's corporate concept, see the abun- dance of species in the garden as well as learning more about anthroposophic medicine and pharmacy. Since 2016, the medicinal plant garden has included an inter-cultural garden in which Weleda staff and people who have experienced displacement come together regularly to work on some of the land. \"We see the garden as a living organism,\" says Head Gardener Michael Straub, adding: \"Diversity stabilises the ecosystem and thwarts the proliferation of pests.\" Biodynamic cultivation in the medicinal plant garden functions in accordance with this principle. The prepon-derance of flowering plants is essential for the survival of many beneficial organisms. Hedges and flower strips offer a place for innumerable beneficial insects to live and feed, including Ichneumon parasitoid wasps, green lacewings and ladybirds. Weleda cultivates seven medic-inal plant gardens around the world. Our medicinal plant garden is a living and breathing organism in which everything is interconnected.Dorotheanthus bellidiformis. Claire Hattersley rather tenderly whispers the Latin name which she already learned from her father as a child. \"The pink and orange mesembryanthemums in our garden are like little gemstones sparkling in the sunshine,\" says the Head Gardener of the Weleda medicinal plant garden in the East Midlands, though this plant is in fact native to the warm climes of South Africa. Her grandfather was also green-fingered and with this heritage Claire Hattersley together with her team is able to bring flowers to bloom in the heavy, moist soil of the garden north-west of Nottingham which include 50 medicinal plants such as calendula (marigold ), camomile, oats and St. John's wort for pharmaceuticals: \"The biodynamic preparations help, but we also have to keep coming up with clever ideas.\" Draining the ground is an option, \"but we don't want to battle the land, we want to work with it\". So wild flower meadows which like wet ground were created alongside flowerbeds, fields and ponds. As a result, the five hectares boast a wide variety of plants, butterflies, insects and birds all contributing to the biodiversity. Claire is delighted that \"we also have a nature conservation organisation mowing our meadows and in turn improving the biodiversity of its own land with seeds from this mowed material\". A beekeeper has set up hives and reveals their secrets to groups of schoolchildren. In summer, workshops in biodynamic gardening will be held for the first time for Weleda Wellbeing Advisors, a role currently unique to England - so they can convey the inner value of the products to users even more effectively. In 2019, they will also be open to amateur gardeners. Claire Hattersley was once one herself. But after passing her exams in fine art and working in museum exhibition design for ten years, she found the call of her childhood love of gardening growing ever stronger. So, Claire applied at Weleda, fearing she would not stand a chance without any qualifications as a gardener. However, what counted was her passion and skilled interaction with the plants - and the rest is history. Further information on the Weleda garden is available at www.weleda.co.uk/natural-ingredients/quality/weleda-gardensClaire Hattersley (55) manages the Weleda medicinal plant garden in Ilkeston, in the UK. She has worked for Weleda UK since 1996.

This has enabled 100,000 children to learn about the importance of biodiversity and the role that pollinators and insects play in agriculture. A further 500 nesting aids are currently being distributed across the country. \u20ac 6,000 Donation for bird protection Weleda Spain extended inter- national Earth Day on April 22 nd into an Earth Month and do- nated one per cent of all sales proceeds to SEO/BirdLife which is the biggest bird conserva- tion charity in the country. This money will be used to renat ural- ise the banks of the Man zanares river in central Spain. Involvement in palm oil Weleda has once again been elected to the Executive Board of the Forum for Sus tainable Palm Oil (FONAP ) and now holds the chair. Weleda is also chair of the Derivatives working group which has full traceability in the supply chain as its aim. www.forumpalmoel.org Rich diversity The medicinal plant garden in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd was established in 1959. More than 1,000 differ- ent species of plant grow on 23 hectares and 120 plants are used freshly picked in tinctures for our pharmaceuticals and natural and organic cos metics. The 4 kilometres of hedges are home to around 50 differ- ent types of bird, more than 30 species of wild bee and many other animals. Ponds provide a habit for 3 newt species, river and painter's mussels, European cray- fishand native fish, includ- ing the rare pond loach.Preservation of seeds As part of our commitment to biodiversity, we support the Hortus Officinarum association in the biodynamic cultiva- tion and propagation of medicinal plants. Hortus has been nurturing seed cultures of aromatic and medicinal plants at Weleda's medicinal plant garden in Switzerland, the Bruderholzhof, since 2010. Backed by the Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture, the aim is to regenerate the seeds of medi-cinal plant species that are stored in the Swiss gene bank. To date, this has been success-ful for 20 spe-cies, and seeds could be harvested from four species in 2017, of which cen taury was one.81 % is the organic share of plant raw materials 30 % of the organic share will be cultivated in accordance with biodynamic guidelines over the next few years. Controlled organic and biody- namic cultivation are all about the responsible production of natural raw materials, without chemicals or genetic modification. 16 17AREA OF ACTION ECOLOGICAL FARMING AND BIODIVERSITYRespectful supply chain3 Weleda products are based on thousands of substances from nature. Many natural raw materials and precious medicinal plants are sourced from suppliers all over the globe, and we work with more than 50 cultivation partners in organic farming and certified wild collec- tion worldwide. We support them as they make the changeover from conventional to organic cultivation methods as well as in measures for the protection of biodiversity. Around 50 cultivation projects and partnerships with social and/or environmental promotion Management programme according to Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT ) standards (www.ethicalbiotrade.org ) along the entire supply chain of natural raw materials: global standard on social and environmental aspects as well as the protection and the sustainable use of biodiversity Greatest possible transparency and traceability within supply chains: regular on-site auditsWhat we have achieved so far - our commitments Supply chain management system based on the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT ): Adopting a standard questionnaire and assessment tool Auditing four suppliers Selection of tools and amendment of questionnaire enabled introduction in 2018; audited two supply chains, two further audits were not possible owing to the political situation Evaluation of certification of our UEBT management system Introduction of a standard question - naire and assessment tool Palm oil: Membership of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO ) Continuing to participate actively in FONAP (Forum for Sustainable Palm Oil ) Ongoing conversion to certified quality in order to achieve the 100 per cent target Conducting an additional evaluation of alternative raw materials as a replace - ment for derivatives Member of the RSPO since 2017 Elected as chair of Executive Board and continued to serve as chair of the Derivatives working group in FONAP The pharmaceuticals sector remains problematic as there are no certified goods being offered on the market.

The jury was impressed by Weleda's entire supply chain for natural raw materials being guided by the standard of the Union for Ethical Biotrade (UEBT ). Responsible Business Award In 2017, Jayn Sterland from Weleda UK accepted this award in the Supplier Engagement of the Year category. The jury said their decision was in recogni- tion of the supply chain manage- ment structure and the commit- ment to sustainable raw material procurement. The accolade is bestowed by the Ethical Corpo- ration in the UK. Sustainable in Export Award Weleda New Zealand was crowned as Most Sustainable in Export by ExportNZ ASB Awards Hawke's Bay. The company impressed with its biodynamic medicinal plant garden, including goats and cows, as well as its many economic, environmental and social initiatives.It was only supposed to be a short holiday back home: Ibrahim Abouleish had studied chemistry in Austria and was still living there with his family. However, when the dedicated anthroposophist saw how the agricultural industry was harming the environment in Egypt, he decided to return and found the Sekem enterprise. Around 40 years ago, he started biodynamic cultivation in the desert. \"I was speechless when I saw everything this includes today,\" says Markus Weidner, buyer for vegetable oils: several farms, a school for employee children and a university in Cairo. Products are supplied by 250 contract farmers in the country. They are also involved in the first major cooperation between Weleda and Sekem: in 2017, Weleda signed a preliminary agreement with Helmy Abouleish, son of the company founder and the current boss, for the supply of 58 tonnes per year of biodynamically cultivated cold-pressed jojoba oil from the desert. \"In the Bahariya oasis around El-Bawiti, a day's drive from Cairo, the first young plants are growing on eight hectares of sandy soil. The intention is to expand this to 50 hectares, with the first harvest in three years,\" explains Markus Weidner. \"Until then, we will already be procuring around ten tonnes from a number of Sekem contract farmers.\" This cooperation has initially been agreed for ten years and secures the investment of Sekem as well as uncou-pling the farmers' income from the fluctuating world market price. For Weleda, the nutrient-rich oil of the jojoba shrub is used as the basis of many creams and body lotions. \"Up to now, the majority of our oil of Demeter quality has come from the Argentinian desert,\" says Markus, \"but now we will have two major sources of supply if a harvest were ever to fail.\" Especially sustainable: the long- term supplier in Argentina is acting as an advisor and passing on their unique jojoba expertise to Sekem. Further information on Sekem is available at www.sekem.com Markus Weidner (36) has been in International Strategic Sourcing at Weleda in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd since 2014. The agronomist with a major in sustainable resource man-agement previous-ly worked in an or-ganic certification body for African smallholders.Creating a future to stop rural depopulation The 35 children run towards their school in eager anticipation. In time for the start of winter, the building was fitted with a new roof and a porch to protect the entrance steps from snow, ice and rain. The winters are long and cold in the Western Romanian Carpathians. We funded the renovation of this small school in 2017 as a further step towards securing the future of the Apuseni mountain region. Arnica blossoms have been collected in the heart of these mountains for more than 30 years. To preserve this precious treasure of nature, Weleda has been supporting a \"protection through care\" project. Farmers and collectors receive ongoing training and have formed local cooperatives. Drying facilities have also been built to make it much easier to dry out the blossoms. The project offers incentives for the extensive cultivation of species-rich arnica meadows and safeguards the future livelihood of this mountain population. The best news is that rural depopulation has already slowed significantly.When asked what they most wished for, the school- children responded: \"A room for our PE lessons!\"Before and after: a new roof for the school building, a new insulated fa\u00e7ade and totally new sanitary facilities.Harvest volume 2017: thirty tonnes of fresh arnica blossoms - generates five tonnes of dried flowers from which oil is extracted for use in arnica massage oil and stretch mark massage oil. 20 21AREA OF ACTION RESPECTFUL SUPPLY CHAINAREA OF ACTIONRESPECTFUL SUPPLY CHAINSustainable sites, production and logistics4 We also set high standards with regard to the responsible use of environmental resources in our own company. Our aim is to increase the recovery and recycling rates so that a closed system is created. Through our environmental management, we are continually improving environmental protection and biodiversity. The consolidated environmental data can be found on pages 78 to 80. Reuse of waste ratio of over 98 per cent (including thermal recovery ) Recycling and composting ratio of 61 per cent (excluding thermal recovery ) Electricity for production in own buildings 1 is 100 per cent from renewable sources.What we have achieved so far - our commitments Definition of targets for resource use and intensities: Energy use and emissions Water and waste water Other resources and waste Specific targets determined in drawing up the Sustainability Programme Implementation of targets Climate impact of the main sites in Switzerland and Germany Climate impact assessment carried out for both sites Continuation of targetTargets 2018 Targets set for 2017 Achievements 2017 Advancement of site mobilityNew targets 1 Sites in France, Germany and SwitzerlandI am impressed by how seriously Weleda takes sustainability and how anthroposo phic principles are followed in day-to- day activities. Rainer Saner, Interior Designer at Doppler und Saner GmbH in Switzerland Target achieved Target partially achieved Target not achieved 22AREA OF ACTION SUSTAINABLE SITES, PRODUCTION AND LOGISTICSProgress in intensities How efficiently companies make use of natural resources is reflected in the environmental key figures. All intensities relate to the largest manufacturing countries of France, Germany and Switzerland. There was this moment where one last thing was fundamentally changed. \"Can it be that Weleda em- ployees are walking around on a synthetic floor?\" asked a member of staff. Interior designer Rainer Saner had selected carpet tiles for the new build that were \"manu-factured from recycled fishing nets and fully certified\" - he had been impressed. \"But essentially, they were still made from oil (petroleum ) and this material cannot be returned to the system,\" comments Rainer, who says he learned a valu-able lesson from this to \"always look very carefully at seals and certifications\". That the focus is on people at Weleda was reflected in the fact that around 50 employees helped design \"their\" new workplace. \"We integrated four meeting rooms as peninsulas on two of the floors so that the new open plan offices are not too loud,\" Rainer explains, \"this softens the acoustics.\" And it adds a pop of colour: the glass-walled rooms feature pastel tones of blue, pink, yellow and orange on the inside, but are otherwise dominated by light beech and birch plywood, white varnished walls and off-white furniture, which employees helped choose. \"Everything was to be as light as possible,\" he recalls. Through the giant window panes, daylight dictates when the lights come on with their warm-toned LEDs. Geothermal probes and heat pumps provide heat, or cool the office in summer. The entire concept corresponds to the high Swiss stand- ards for energy efficiency and value preservation, Minergie-P and Minergie-ECO. The plant nursery that had to make way for the new build was integrated in the building while the show garden was retained. Nature appears to continue with- in the offices themselves because employees walk on green linoleum that has a cork layer for sound absorption. This will later decompose 100 per cent. Further information on interior designers Doppler und Saner GmbH is available at www.dopplerundsaner.chRainer Saner (46) the design studio Dop- Saner GmbH in Zwingen near together with his business partner, Patrik Doppler. They were instrumental in designing our new offices at Arles- heim, which were ready for their new occupants at the start of 2018. To earn Minergie-P status, the specifications for the building shell must be at least 30 per cent better than required by Swiss law.Packaging intensity in grams per kilogram of finished product Energy intensity in kilowatt-hours per kilogram of product contentWater intensity in litres per kilogram of product content Waste intensity in kilograms per tonne of finished productPackaging intensity improved by 3.8 per cent. This was above all ow-ing to the fact that new natural and organic cosmetics in lightweight plastic packaging came on the market while products in heavy glass bottles were at the same time re- moved from our range. The recycled share in natural and organic cosmet-ics also improved from 43 per cent to 46 per cent, largely owing to the increase in the recycled proportion of green glass bottles (see page 10 ). This key figure shows the weight of packaging in grams per kilogram of finished product, relating to the manufacturing volumes and consump- tion in France, Germany and Switzerland.362376 355 3.8 2015 118115 2015 2016108 2017Water intensity increased by 2.6 per cent in 2017 while total water con-sumption was up 35 per cent. The reasons: at the site in France, more water was needed overall for office air conditioning and cooling in pro-duction. Concurrently, the produc- tion volumes increased in the manu- facturing countries (+7 per cent ). Although the intensity has now risen slightly, there has been a clear downward trend in intensity values of between 13 per cent and 16 per cent since 2011. This key figure shows the amount of water consumed from the public water supply in litres per kilogram of product content manufactured at the production sites in France, Germany and Switzerland. Waste intensity improved by 8.3 per cent and amounted to 108.3 grams of waste per kilogram of manufac- tured finished product in 2017. This is a reduction in residual material of 10 grams per kilogram of product. Worldwide, the intensity declined by 2 per cent, while the total amount of waste across all regional compa-nies fell by 26 tonnes. This is a great success for Weleda because it went in tandem with an increase of 7 per cent in the production volume and of 9 per cent in bulk goods produced. This key figure shows the amount of waste that was generated per tonne of finished product manufactured at the German, French and Swiss production sites.In 2017, we used 3 per cent more energy, once again on account of the increased production quantities. By contrast, the intensity declined by 4.5 per cent. Plant utilisation was so high due to increased production that efficiency improved. In France, Germany and Switzerland, natural and organic cosmetics as well as me-dicinal products are manufactured using only energy from renewable sources. This key figure shows the amount of energy consumed in kilowatt-hours per kilogram of product content manufactured at the German, French and Swiss production sites.FACTS Eco-building Arlesheim Addition to the Company's site in Switzer- land: a building created in accordance with the specifications of Minergie-P and Minergie-ECO, offering employees a great level of comfort. It includes offices and workspaces for medicinal plant cultivation. Why is this new building so special? Along the entire lifecycle, the detrimental effects on health and the environment are being reduced to a minimum with mate- rials such as the window and flooring systems all being recyclable. We used recycled concrete, which is a resource-efficient construction mate- rial that enables a circular economy. The building itself is 80 per cent certi- fied Swiss wood, while the exterior is clad in regional FSC wood. Minergie-P stands for maximum energy efficiency. Our energy is sourced 100 per cent from non-fossil fuels. A proportion is generated via the photovoltaic system on the roof of the building. Hot water, heating and air conditioning are all regulat- ed by geothermal energy. The end result is a lowest energy building certi- fied in accordance with Minergie-P. 24 25AREA OF ACTION SUSTAINABLE SITES, PRODUCTION AND LOGISTICSAREA OF ACTIONSUSTAINABLE SITES, PRODUCTION AND LOGISTICSMeaningful and effective work5 Weleda is a business enterprise and at the same time a place of human development based on common tasks.

How can we learn to be open and candid with each other? In an interview, Antonia Jeismann, Training Manager at Weleda, explains how internal workshops on the topic of appreciative communication can help. Making friends in the vegetable field Voluntary, environmental, social. These three words describe the WELED'Agit initiative, which translates as \"Weleda takes action\", at the Huningue site in France. Employees spend one working day each year doing something for others or the environment.Starting from scratch in a totally new place - Anika Zimny knows how that feels. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, she and her parents moved from near East Berlin to Schorndorf in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The family lived in a sports hall for months before they were able to find a flat. \"I was six years old at the time,\" she recalls, \"and aside from the language, everything was different. I had to make new friends and find my way in a new school, but my father luckily already had a job.\" She therefore did not need to think twice when asked last year if she would become a mentor: for 19-year-old Amira 1 from Syria who was starting a three- week internship at Weleda. The company has been offering this career guidance opportunity to refugees since 2015 as part of its Diversity Wins! programme. 2 While she was looking forward to it, there were also a few nerves: what would it be like, with the language, with the cultural differences? \"Amira could already speak German,\" says Anika, \"and if we struggled with a term, my colleague from Lebanon was more than happy to translate into Arabic.\" There was quite a lot of special- ist terminology to get her head around, as Anika works in the packaging of natural and organic cosmetics, bottling oils and bath products. She explained the work on the various machines to Amira and took her to the raw materials warehouse. She could offer reassurance that men and women had separate changing rooms. They were also able to find a way for Amira to keep on her headscarf, which she wears for religious reasons. Instead of the lab coat and cap that have to be worn for hygiene and workplace safety, Amira wore a full-body overall like the colleagues in phar maceutical production, which had enough space in the hood for a headscarf. There is one thing Anika Zimny would do differently: she loves bringing in home- baked goodies for her colleagues and she would leave the dash of alcohol out of the Black Forest cupcakes next time. Amira had not been able to try one because of this addition.

The bakery sales assistant joined Weleda Ger- many in 2010, thus venturing into totally new pro- fessional territory. As a mentor, she shares her experi- ence of \"still being allowed to learn everything at your own pace\". 1 Name has been changed 2 Full name of programme: Diversity wins! Weleda creates prospects for people who have experienced displacementIN BRIEF Mindfulness coaching For eight weeks, staff at Weleda Australia had the chance to take part in internal training for stress reduction. The training sessions always took place one evening each week and were run by a mindfulness coach. This came about because employees and the management expressed the wish for more clarity and focus in a world that is increasingly perceived as restless. The practi- cal exercises have become a part of everyday working life: many employees now consciously take the time to meditate for ten minutes every day. Group meetings also begin in this way. When I have too many thoughts racing round in my mind, these exer cises really help. They help me return to a place of calm and clarity. Ben Clarke, Warehouse Manager at Weleda Australia A field of celery as far as the eye can see. Between the rows of young seedlings, people are weeding. They are employees of the Alsace-based company ICARE. Here the focus is not on the plants but the people. Peo- ple who have been unemployed for a long time owing to all manner of reasons. ICARE provides them with paid employment in a community that currently includes around 100 individuals. In this way, they not only learn how to grow vegetables but also receive recognition and help in finding permanent employment. The fact that 500 paying customers have signed up for these organic vegetable boxes leaves them in no doubt that their work is meaningful. In June 2017, the ICARE employees were joined by staff from Weleda France as they raked the weeds. At the end of a hot day working in the celery, beans and carrots, with many conversa-tions, the encounter between ICARE and Weleda was rounded off with the preparation together of salad and vegetable soup.Why should we learn to communicate in a more appreciative way? ANTONIA JEISMANN: Anger often crops up following misunderstandings and conflict which can cost us valuable energy. The way we speak and listen is strongly linked to our inner attitude towards ourselves, others and our environment. Empathy and awareness are important skills for appre-ciative cooperation. How can appreciative communi- cation help us improve working relationships? ANTONIA JEISMANN: Communicating apprecia- tively means taking note of your own feel- ings and needs, while at the same time not losing sight of the interests of the other person. The combination of clear language with an appreciative attitude is important for resolving matters of conflicts together. What is the aim of these workshops? ANTONIA JEISMANN: In the workshop, employees learn to distinguish between observation and interpretation as well as how to clearly formulate their own needs and concerns. A central aspect is also being able to take responsibility for oneself and recognising that there are always many different pos-sible courses of action, in line with the motto: I could get annoyed right now, but I don't have to.16 workshops on appre ciative communi- cation have already taken place with 172 par- ticipants in Germany and Switzerland.

This is something she might well have picked up from her Indian grand mother who worked on a farm in British Guyana, now Guyana. \"She was neither able to read nor write but was always there for everyone,\" shares Raisia, who also cares about helping others and visited Alzheimer's sufferers while at univer- sity. On completing her bachelor's degree in criminal law, she worked in the supe- rior court probation and as a child support enforcement specialist. \"This never seemed quite the right fit for me. I love doing yoga and meditation.\" She gave notice and moved to New York where she applied to join Weleda. \"I know of no other company in which people care about each other to such an extent,\" comments Raisia. She was very excited last year on getting involved in the project to spread joy at Christmas. The chosen beneficiary was Friends of Karen, a charity that supports through donations around 100 families caring for a child suffering from cancer - with voluntary helpers so that the family can have more precious hours together; financially if they are struggling to pay the rent after paying all the medical bills; with Christmas presents (for siblings, too ), for which there might be neither time nor money. \"I sent an email around and everyone donated,\" reports Raisia, \"and Weleda then matched that sum.\" More than USD 600 was raised and benefitted five families - the wish lists not only included toys, but also coats and heat pillows. One child simply asked for a Christmas card to give to his mother. Further information on Weleda North America is available at www.weleda.com Raisia Martinez (29) has been a management assis- tant at Weleda North America in New York since 2016.

Discover the world as a naturalist Children and teenagers are increasingly afraid of contact with nature - this was a finding of the Jugendreport Natur 2016 report initiated by independent experts. Placing a small slimy snail on their hand: a brave step for many a child. When it senses danger, a snail withdraws into its shell, produces slime and pushes so much air out that lots of little bubbles form. Children learn how this works and recreate it themselves with a straw and water.Observe and be amazed: there are even some sheep on our site.Damp is how snails like it best. Children can experience on their own skin what this feels like with the fine spray from a water atomizer. With our free environmental education programme Weleda's Nature Workshop, we aim to introduce children to the plants and animals they can find in their own natural biosphere. This provision is above all aimed at nurseries and primary schools.

There is much to see from afar and this is something she also loves about her job: \"Controlling gives me a bird's eye view of things as well, and then I dive down to immerse myself into everyday work.\" A colleague is responsible for Aus- tria, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland plus South America, while she deals with the \"rest of the world\", which means around 20 Weleda subsidiaries in total. Perfect for someone who describes herself as \"very inquisitive\". She not only looks at whether sales tar- gets are being met for both natural and organic cosmetics and medicinal products but also why they were perhaps even exceeded, as was the case in Russia in 2017. Or conversely, identifies where sus-tained investment might be required. Patricia explains: \"By preparing the figures, we help our colleagues become better at identifying opportunities and risks in the market.\" The Swiss native also likes to act as the middle person in her leisure time while herself keeping an overview: she only works 90 per cent to enable her to also volunteer on the school council for the municipality of Aesch, where she lives, repre-senting the interests of both pupils and parents to the schools. \"The first thing I did was introduce rules of procedure and ensured that everyone is always informed about every thing,\" she explains. \"This made us more efficient.\" Not every thing is sociopolitical, though. Patricia helped organise a music festival a few years ago, for example. There are so many different exciting sides to life.Patricia B\u00fceler (28) has worked in the Finance and Controlling depart- ment at Weleda in Arlesheim since 2015. She be- lieves neither age nor gender should influence recruit- ment and that the best person for the job should be selected based on merit alone. Patricia B\u00fceler volunteers on the school council of a municipality in the Canton of Basel-Landschaft.Value added statement We will secure our Company's future viability by means of prudent, ethical business practices. By conducting our business in a responsible way, we improve Weleda's ability to manage risk - from behav- iour in the market, through environmentally relevant aspects, to relationships with employees and exchanges with all other key interest groups and stakeholders. This generates sustainable added value which can be distributed to employees (income ), capital providers (dividends, interest ) and charitable organisations (dona- tions ), and the public (taxes ). The value added statement (inside cover page ) illus- trates how the economic activities of our Company gen-erate value for society: unlike the income statement, which is based on the viewpoint of the owners, the value added statement sets out the contribution made by the Weleda Group to private and public income. The value added statement shows the expenditure with which Weleda achieved its Company performance and how the added value generated was distributed. In the 2017 financial year, business performance in- creased due to a growth in received revenues of EUR 10.5 million to EUR 403.5 million. After deduction of inputs, the added value of the Weleda Group amounted to EUR 169.1 million. Added value per Weleda Group employee amounted to EUR 82,222 per full-time em- ployee and was thus 0.7 per cent higher than in the previous year. A total of EUR 2.5 million was spent on donations and similar contributions in 2017, with EUR 2.1 million of this amount going to the School of Spiritual Science in Dornach and to other different anthroposophic insti-tutions. The added value generated was sufficient to cover the income of our employees. Our employees are co-entrepre- neurs who are involved in the performance process. Supporting and promoting a sense of personal responsi-bility and the way that each individual conceives of them-selves is important to the Company. Public authorities received EUR 4.6 million of the created added value in the form of taxes. A further EUR 1.3 mil- lion was attributable to interest to lenders. Pursuant to the proposal of the Board of Directors, a dividend of 7 per cent will be distributed to sharehold- ers for 2017.Weleda in the markets The planned reduction in our dependence on the D - A - CH region of Germany, Austria and Switzerland is making progress. In natural and organic cosmetics we generated more than 80 per cent of our growth outside the German-speaking countries. The phar- maceuticals picture is similar: the current growth region is South America. Below is an overview of the developments in the individual countries and particular highlights. South America and Southern Europe region Brazil The first year of implementing the invest- ment plan of our growth project was suc-cessful. The sales trend in OTC pharmaceu- ticals is very good. In September, the Board of Directors and Executive Board held a meeting in Brazil which enabled them to get to know the enthusiastic team in S\u00e3o Paulo. Chile and Argentina Weleda Argentina continues to achieve double-digit growth. In Chile, construction has started on the new building which will expand the compounding pharmacy. Italy A major first step has been taken in the pharmaceuticals registration project, with 120 pharmaceuticals dossiers submitted to the authorities. The validation process is ongoing. There has been a change at management level: Stefano Riva has been succeeded by Edoardo Ruffinengo.Spain The launched growth strategy is making good progress. Concentrating the market- ing and sales activities on pharmacies has confirmed that this sales channel harbours the greatest potential. Brand awareness has been significantly enhanced by means of a continuous ad campaign for the pome- granate range. There has also been an in-crease in the market share of OTC pharma-ceuticals. North America and Western Europe region USA After many years of stagnation in the market, the new growth strategy has started to take effect. It is based on three pillars: the intensive development of the organic retailing sales channel, the genera- tion of profitable growth through e-com- merce (www.weleda.com ) and the prudent expansion into new sales channels.UK The Weleda Advisor Network was founded in 2013. Around 500 ambassadors were trained to promote and sell Weleda cosmet- ics and OTC pharmaceuticals at events or in their naturopathy practice. Every am-bassador is carefully selected. Many have a background in holistic care. In 2017, the Advisor Network reached the milestone of EUR 1 million in sales. Our aim is to recruit Spain: An ongoing ad campaign for the pomegranate range has boosted brand awareness, which has a positive spillover effect on other product lines.UK: Weleda Advisor Network. Around 500 ambassadors for Weleda, enthusiastic men and women who have found paid and meaningful work with Weleda. 37AREA OF ACTION MANAGEMENT AND FINANCEAREA OF ACTIONMANAGEMENT AND FINANCEA new portfolio strategy for Weleda natural and organic cosmetics An Driessens has been responsible for global marketing at Weleda since June 2017. In our conversation, she talked about how she intends to boost awareness of the Weleda brand worldwide and her plans to position the product portfolio accordingly. Why do we need a new portfolio strategy? AN DRIESSENS: The natural and organic cosmetics market is constantly growing. Weleda is growing as well, but not as quickly. We need a clear strategy up to 2022 that will enable us to grow at that pace. What measures are you considering? AN DRIESSENS: We have formulated our \"natural beauty\" vision and identified the greatest growth prospects on which the organisation will focus, but equally importantly, we compiled a list of things we should not be doing anymore. This process was carried out together with the markets and research and develop-ment. We were very quickly able to come up with a shared vision of our potential opportunities. This alone will surely not be enough? AN DRIESSENS: Certainly not. We realised that growth potential is higher in some categories than others. So, we asked ourselves - where do we want to invest? Where should we call it a day? Our port- folio is too complex. We need to con- centrate our efforts and decide where to stay in the game and where not. Is that a particular challenge for Weleda? AN DRIESSENS: It is not easy to realise, because our competitors are generally not operating in as many countries as Weleda. This means they can focus on one or just a few select markets. In all countries, it is more important than ever before that we specifically focus our range on the customers there.What does that mean exactly? AN DRIESSENS: There are a few countries, such as France, Germany and Switzer-land, where the Weleda brand is already extremely well known, but this is not the case in most other countries. There, consumers are not so aware of why they should be buying a Weleda product. We have to give them a reason by ensuring our origins, our story and our quality are clearly communicated. This has to be made truly relevant for them. What are your plans to bring this about? AN DRIESSENS: The anthroposophically inspired values on which we are based is what makes us unique. These should always be conveyed in such a way as to be clear to all. With the right stories and a smart branding campaign, we can raise awareness. We have a real mission at our core, whereas others try to find a philosophy and make it fit. This is our opportunity. People need to know why they are buying Weleda. We are not so presumptuous as to think that this will work with everyone, but for many it can - and I see this is a truly great opportunity.and train Weleda ambassadors in every postcode area of the UK by 2022, which means 2,800 in total. France On the French market, double-digit growth has once again been realised in natural and organic cosmetics. The pharmaceuticals business remained stable in our largest market for medicines. In November 2017, Weleda put on a unique show online. The dancer Isabelle Pollet Villard was filmed during a performance in the \u00c9l\u00e9phant Pan-ame, a former Parisian mansion house, against a background of flowers and in front of an audience of specially invited journal-ists and influencers. The video has been seen by three million people on social media. Further information is available at www.youtube.com/watch?v=r68hXxha520 Benelux Weleda Benelux proved stable. In Belgium, the switchover to selling in pharmacies was completed successfully: 370 pharma- cies were able to offset the sales decline on the mass market. Market shares were gained in the Netherlands and brand aware- ness raised, not least on account of vari- ous cooperations. Asia / Pacific region Overall, Weleda was able to post year- on-year growth in the double-digit range for this region. Australia was one of the key growth drivers. To tap future growth potential, we are currently in the process of moving to larger premises there. In Japan, the development of our own Natural Care Studios (NCS ) was a great success. There are now seven Weleda Natural Care Studios in the country, three of which offer face and body treatments. Northern and Central Eastern Europe (NCEE ) For the fourth consecutive year, double- digit and profitable growth was achieved in this region. All subsidiaries as well as most of the 19 export markets in the region contributed to this trend with sales ex- pansion and successful marketing meas- ures, above all digital ones. The opening of the new branch in Kiev, Ukraine, was also a success and marks a strategic step for the future orientation of the region. D - A - CH region: Germany, Austria, Switzerland Sales improved slightly in the fiercely competitive market of the D - A - CH region. Pharmaceuticals suffered some decline but natural and organic cosmetics were up by 1.4 per cent (in the largest market of Germany: 2.1 per cent ). A particular high- light was the launch of the Global Garden campaign in the visitor's centre in Schw\u00e4-bisch Gm\u00fcnd (see box ). Lovely award: Weleda is now one of the 2017/ 2018 Green Brands in Germany. At the ceremony in Frankfurt, we once again received recogni-tion for our environmentally friendly and sustainable practices and can now officially call ourselves a \"green brand\".USA: Prominent displays at Ridgewoods and Wholefoods. The ramped-up marketing efforts are beginning to bear fruit.Eleven countries and once around the worldAustralian blogger Lauren Doolan from Melbourne was crowned the winner when in autumn last year Weleda invited users from all around the globe on a Weleda world trip: the Global Garden Tour. This competition was special because it was not the company but the users worldwide who selected the 16 contenders from 16 countries for the final to win the big trip. The hunt was on for individuals who were interested in Weleda, nature and sustainability as well as having the skills to present topics interestingly and vividly (www.weledaglobalgarden.com ). The journey is not over yet for the winner Lauren Doolan: in March 2018, she headed off from Australia to discover the Weleda world. We have a real mission at our core, whereas others try to find a philosophy and make it fit. This is our opportunity. 38 39AREA OF ACTION MANAGEMENT AND FINANCEAREA OF ACTIONMANAGEMENT AND FINANCEThird-party sales per companyStructure of per companyEmployees (Full-time employees ) Currency in 1,0002017 Change from previous year in local currencyPharma- ceuticalsNatural and organic cosmetics2017 2016 Switzerland CHF 36,862 - 0.5 % 36 % 64 % 326 313 Weleda AG, Arlesheim EUR 33,162 Germany EUR 171,700 + 1.2 % 20 % 80 % 762 769 Weleda AG, Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd France EUR 90,734 + 5.4 % 41 % 59 % 370 371 Weleda S.

Business performance For the first time, the Weleda Group increased total sales to over EUR 400 million in 2017. The distribution of growth rates indicates the importance of internationalisation. For example, the pharmaceuticals business segment in Brazil achieved double-digit growth. Additional expenditures for infrastructure, market investments, and research and de- velopment led to a decrease in the operating result. But the net result improved significantly compared to 2016 mainly due to lower taxes. Further reduction in debt plus the generated profit led to a higher equity ratio, further improving the resilience of the Company. Pioneering deci- sions about the future are only possible on the solid basis which was established in the last five years. Some of the most important strategic decisions for the next years are a renewal of our infrastructure with the core element of a new production and logistic site in Germany, investments in research and development, further development of the pharmaceuticals strategy, the revision of the product-mix strategy for natural and organic cosmetics and the sustain- ability program 2018 - 2022. Employees The Weleda Group had an average (previous 1,084 full-time employees (previous year: 1,074 ). Risk assessment Risks are an integral part of business operations. A risk management system that enables the identification, anal- ysis, control and monitoring of significant risks in the cor- porate environment is therefore particularly important for Weleda. In order to identify risks in good time and determine the appropriate action, our management regularly assesses, at Group level and at the level of Weleda AG, any signifi-cant internal and external risks that may impact the entire corporate environment. The Board of Directors discusses and approves the results of the risk assessment and any measures every six months. Development of sales The net sales of the Weleda Group for the 2017 financial year amount to EUR 400.9 million (previous year: EUR 389.8 million ). This corresponds to a growth rate of 2.8 per cent, or EUR 11.1 million, compared with the previous year (adjusted for exchange rate effects: 3.0 per cent, or EUR cent (previous year: 6.1 per cent ). The reduction in the operating result in comparison to 2016 was mainly due to planned market investments relating to international- isation (USA, Brazil, Ukraine and Korea ), a general and planned increase in marketing expenses as well as costs associated with intensifying research and development activities. The operating result (EBIT ) in the separate fi- nancial statements of Weleda AG decreased, compared to the previous year, by CHF 20.1 million to CHF - 0.4 million. Since the year under review, the investments stated in the individual financial statements of Weleda AG are am- ortised over five years, leading to an additional burden of CHF 4.7 million. Result for the year The consolidated result for the year increased by 12.4 per cent to EUR 13.0 million compared to the previous year. The financial result improved by EUR 1.1 million and amounted to EUR - 1.1 million (previous year: EUR - 2.2 mil- lion). The main reason for the improvement was a further repayment of financial liabilities. Due to the decreased business performance and different profit distribution within the Group, income taxes decreased to EUR 4.6 mil-lion (previous year: EUR 10.2 million ). Germany accounted for the biggest share of income taxes with EUR 1.7 million (previous year: EUR 7.8 million ). The separate financial statements of Weleda AG showed a loss of CHF 2.5 million (previous year: profit of CHF 8.1 million ). Financial and assets situation The equity ratio of the Weleda Group again increased and amounts to 46.7 per cent (previous year: 43.8 per cent) due to the improved net result for the year and the repay-ment of financial debt. Consolidated cash flow from operating activities amount- ed to EUR 29.3 million (previous year: EUR 19.4 million). Cash flows from investing activities increased, compared with the previous year, by EUR 2.3 million to EUR 12.8 mil-lion (previous year: EUR 10.5 million). Of the gross invest- ments of EUR 12.9 million, EUR 1.3 million were invested in intangible assets and EUR 11.6 million in property, plant and equipment. Around three quarters of the investments in property, plant and equipment or intangible assets were made at the two main production sites in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd and Arlesheim. Cash flow after investing activities amount- ed to EUR 16.5 million (previous year: EUR 8.9 million ).11.7 million ). This means that Weleda held up well in 2017 despite an intensely competitive market. The net sales from the individual Company Weleda AG increased by 2.7 per cent or CHF 7.5 million year-on-year. Development of sales by markets and regions Around 51 per cent (previous year: 52 per cent ) of sales were generated in the D - A - CH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland ). Sales in this region increased slightly by 0.4 per cent to EUR 203.4 million (previous year: EUR 202.6 million ). Sales in France increased by 5.4 per cent and amounted to EUR 90.7 million (previous year: EUR 86.1 mil- lion). Sales in the other regions increased by a total of 5.6 per cent to EUR 106.8 million (previous year: EUR 101.1 million ). Development of sales in the business segments Natural and organic cosmetics accounted for EUR 292.4 mil-lion or 72.9 per cent of global sales (previous year: EUR 280.8 million or 72.0 per cent ). The sales generated by pharmaceuticals decreased slightly to EUR 108.5 million (previous year: 109.0 million ), corresponding to 27.1 per cent (previous year: 28.0 per cent ) of total sales. Global sales of the pharmaceuticals business segment decreased by 0.5 per cent in 2017 (previous year: decrease of 4.8 per cent ). Sales in the D - A - CH region, which gen- erated about 44 per cent of sales, decreased by about 2.7 per cent compared with the previous year. Growth momentum came primarily from the South America region with growth in sales of 29 per cent. Sales in the other markets decreased by 3.1 per cent compared to the previ-ous year. Global sales of the natural and organic cosmetics busi- ness segment grew significantly by 4.1 per cent compared with the previous year (2.0 per cent sales growth in 2016 ). The growth regions of Western Europe, South America, Asia and Pacific as well as Central and Eastern Europe, including Russia and Ukraine, were primarily responsible for the improvement. Sales increased by 1.4 per cent in the D - A - CH region. Sales growth in all other countries totalled 5.6 per cent. Operating result The consolidated operating result (EBIT ) of the Weleda Group fell, despite higher sales compared to the previous year, by EUR 5.2 million to EUR 18.7 million (previous year: EUR 23.9 million ). The EBIT margin decreased to 4.7 per Financial liabilities decreased, adjusted by exchange rate effects of EUR 11.0 million, to EUR 10.2 million (previous year: EUR 21.2 million ). Cash and cash equivalents in- creased by EUR 3.6 million to EUR 47.3 million at the end of the year. This resulted in a net financial credit balance of EUR 37.4 million (previous year: EUR 22.4 million ). Cash flow from operating activities for Weleda AG amounted to CHF 30.7 million (previous year: CHF 12.1 mil- lion) in the year under review and, after the deduction of net investments of CHF 15.3 million (previous year: CHF 8.7 million ), still came to year: CHF 3.4 million vious year: CHF 17.2 million ) in interest-bearing liabilities in the year under review. Extraordinary events In the year under review there were no significant extra-ordinary events. Research and development activities The growth of natural and organic cosmetics was mainly driven by market expansion and innovation. In pharmaceu- tical research, Weleda has continued to press ahead with the development of competencies. For both segments together, Weleda again invested double-digit millions in research and development this year. Outlook for 2018 In view of the current market conditions, planned inno-vation and the market presence of Weleda, we see con- tinued good opportunities for double-digit percentage growth of natural and organic cosmetics in the USA, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain, the Czech Re public, Russia and Ukraine. We expect lower but positive average growth in the other countries. With regard to pharmaceuticals, we also expect to see stable sales. Due to decisions made about future developments such as further investments in research and development, expansion of the pharmaceuticals strategy, the product- mix strategy for natural and organic cosmetics, and market development outside Europe, we expect no increase in the operating income in the coming year despite the growth of sales.

ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 WELEDA GROUPANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017WELEDA GROUP 48 49Notes to the consolidated financial statements of the Weleda Group General Due to rounding, individual figures in this report may not add up exactly to the reported sum. Key figures and changes are calculated based on the exact amount and not the reported rounded amount. Consolidation principles Accounting principles This Annual Financial Report has been prepared in accordance with uniform accounting standards (Weleda Accounting Manual ). These accounting standards comply with the provisions on commercial accounting of the Swiss Code of Obligations (article 957 - 963 b OR ). The consolidated financial statements of the Weleda Group comply with the law and the Articles of Incorporation. Certain items of the balance sheet as well as the income statement are summarised in order to provide the reader with a better overview. These items are explained in detail in the notes. Scope of consolidation In addition to Weleda AG Arlesheim and its branch Weleda AG Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, 21 subsidiaries are fully consolidated within the Weleda Group statements. These companies are, without exception, Group com panies and controlled by Weleda AG Arlesheim. Weleda AG has direct or indirect invest- ments of more than 50 per cent in these companies. In the year under review Weleda F + E AG and Weleda Ukraine LLC were incorporated and added to the scope of consolidation. The non-controlling interest in Japan is consolidated using the equity method. The consolidated companies are listed in the notes. Consolidation method The consolidated financial statements are based on the annual statements of the Group companies as at December 31 st 2017, which are prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Weleda Accounting Manual. The consolidation period is the calendar year. Capital consolidation is carried out in accordance with the Anglo-Saxon purchase method. For the fully consolidated companies, assets, liabilities, expenses and income are stated at 100 per cent. Non-controlling interests in consolidated shareholders' equity and profit / loss for the year are disclosed separately. The carrying amounts of the parent company's investment are offset against the current share- holders' equity of the subsidiary companies. In accordance with the full consolidation method, assets and liabilities as well as expenses and income also of those companies in which a third party is involved are included in full in the Group accounts. Third parties' shares of shareholders' equity and of the results of consolidated companies are disclosed separately. Currency translation The financial statements of consolidated companies in foreign currencies are translated as follows: current assets, non-current assets and liabilities are translated at year-end rates (rate on balance sheet date ), shareholders' equity at historical rates. The income statement and the cash flow state- ment are translated using average rates for the year. The resulting currency translation effects are booked directly in retained earnings without impacting profit and loss. The following currency exchange rates are applied:Intragroup transactions, balances and intercompany profits All intragroup transactions and balances are eliminated, as were all intercompany profits stated in the balance sheet. Balance sheet and valuation principles In general, assets and liabilities are valued on an individual basis in so far as they are material and cannot be treated together as a group as is customary due to their similarity. Sales recognition Sales are recognised on the transfer of risks and benefits to customers or upon provision of the service. This generally corresponds to delivery of the products. Current assets Receivables and other current assets are reported at their nominal values. The general risk of loss and individual credit risk have been accounted for on the basis of value adjustments. The valuation of inventories is conducted on the basis of acquisition or production cost while observing the princi- ple of lower of cost or market. Non-current assets Acquired intangible assets are recognised at the cost of acquisition, less amortisation. Property, plant and equipment is recognised at acquisition or production cost minus depreciation. Small-value intangible assets and property, plant and equipment with a value of less than EUR 1,000 are depre- ciated in full in the year they are added. Financial assets are recognised at the cost of acquisition. Equity holdings are consolidated using the equity method. Where there are indications of non-current assets being overvalued, carrying values have been reviewed and, where necessary, adjusted. Liabilities Liabilities are recognised based on their nominal value. Provisions for pension plans and similar obli- gations are determined based on actuarial principles. The remaining provisions cover all recognisable risks for un determined obligations. Liabilities are recognised at the respective amount at which they are to be repaid. Leasing transactions Leasing and rental contracts are recognised on the basis of legal ownership. Accordingly, expenses as lessee are recognised on an accrual basis, whereas the leased or rented objects themselves are not recognised. The total amount of outstanding non-current rental and leasing obligations is included in the notes.YEAR-END RATES in EUR 2017 Rates on balance sheet date2017 Average rates2016 Rates on balance sheet date2016 Average CHF (Swiss franc ) REPORT 2017WELEDA GROUP 50 51Notes to the balance sheet and the income statement 1 Trade receivables 2 Inventoriesin 1,000 EUR 31.12.2017 31.12.2016 From third parties 60,596 61,164 From companies in which a non-controlling interest is held 529 477 From shareholders 140 58 Total trade receivables 61,265 61,699 in 1,000 EUR 31.12.2017 31.12.2016 Raw, auxiliary and operating materials 16,119 15,409 Unfinished 11,166 Finished products 5,835 6,071 goods 22,928 22,180 Value adjustments on 1,837 - 1,634 Total inventories 53,329 53,1923 Non-current assets Financial assets include non-current amounts due from third parties, securities and investments of less than 20 per cent.

In 2017, around EUR 4 million of all investments in property, plant and equipment was allocated to the new administration building in Switzerland.

ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 WELEDA GROUPANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017WELEDA GROUP 60 61Report of the statutory auditor To the General Meeting of Weleda AG, Arlesheim Report of the statutory auditor on the consolidated financial statements As statutory auditor, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Weleda AG, which comprise the balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, statement of shareholders' equity and notes (pages 46 to 61 ), for the year ended 31 December 2017. Board of Directors' responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of Swiss law and the consolidation and valuation principles as set out in the notes. This re-sponsibility includes designing, implementing and main- taining an internal control system relevant to the prepa- ration of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circum-stances. Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consol - idated financial statements based on our audit. We con- ducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consol-idated financial statements. The procedures selected de- pend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity's prepara- tion of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circum- stances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control sys-tem. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial state-ments. We believe that the audit evidence we have ob- tained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 comply with Swiss law and the consolidation and valuation principles as set out in the notes. Report on other legal requirements We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licens- ing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA ) and inde- pendence (article 728 CO ) and that there are no circum- stances incompatible with our independence.

ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 WELEDA AGANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017WELEDA AG 66 67Notes to the financial statements of Weleda AG General Due to rounding, individual figures in this report may not add up exactly to the reported sum. Key figures and changes are calculated based on the exact amount and not the reported rounded amount. Accounting principles This Annual Financial Report has been prepared in accordance with uniform accounting standards (Weleda Accounting Manual). These accounting standards comply with the provisions on commercial accounting of the Swiss Code of Obligations (article 957 - 963 b OR ). The Annual Financial Report of Weleda AG complies with the law and the Articles of Incorporation. Certain items of the balance sheet as well as the income statement are summarised in order to pro-vide the reader with a better overview. These items are explained in detail in the notes. Consistency As of January 1st 2017, the net book value of all equity investments is depreciated annually on a straight-line basis of 20 per cent. In previous years, equity investments were not depreciated on an annual basis but only value-adjusted as necessary. This amendment in 2017 has an impact on the income statement of CHF 4.7 million in depreciation. Without this adjustment in consistency, the result for the year would have been CHF 4.7 million higher. Currency translation The accounts of the German business establishment are stated in euro and translated at year end as follows: current assets, non-current assets and liabilities are translated at year-end rate (rate on balance sheet date ), shareholders' equity at historical rate. The income statement and the cash flow statement are translated using the average rate for the year. The resulting currency translation effects are booked directly in the income statement. The following currency exchange rates are applied: Balance sheet and valuation principles In general, assets and liabilities are valued on an individual basis in so far as they are material and cannot be treated together as a group as is customary due to their similarity. Sales recognition Sales are recognised on the transfer of risks and benefits to customers or upon provision of the service. This generally corresponds to delivery of the products.YEAR-END RATE in CHF 2017 Rate on balance sheet date2017 Average rate2016 Rate on balance sheet date2016 Average rate 1 EUR (euro ) 1.170 1.112 1.072 1.090Current assets Receivables and other current assets are reported at their nominal values. The general risk of loss and individual credit risk have been accounted for on the basis of value adjustments. The valuation of inventories is conducted on the basis of acquisition or production cost while observing the prin- ciple of lower of cost or market. Non-current assets Acquired intangible assets are recognised at the cost of acquisition, less amortisation. Property, plant and equipment is recognised at acquisition or production cost minus depreciation. Small-value intangible assets and property, plant and equipment with a value of less than CHF 1,080 / EUR 1,000 are depreciated in full in the year they are added. Financial assets are recognised at the cost of acquisition. Equity investments are also recognised at acquisition values and depreciated over five years (see paragraph Consistency on page 68 ). Additions to equity investments of less than CHF 100,000 are fully depreciated in the year of acquisition. Where there are indications of non-current assets being overvalued, carrying values have been reviewed and, where necessary, adjusted. Liabilities Liabilities are recognised on the basis of nominal value. Provisions for pension plans and similar obli-gations are determined based on actuarial principles. The remaining provisions covered all recognis- able risks for un determined obligations. Liabilities are recognised at the respective amount at which they are to be repaid. Leasing transactions Leasing and rental contracts are recognised on the basis of legal ownership. Accordingly, expenses as lessee are recognised on an accrual basis, whereas the leased or rented objects themselves are not recognised. The total amount of outstanding non-current rental and leasing obligations is included in the notes.

ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 WELEDA AGANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2017WELEDA AG 74 75Proposed appropriation of the result for the year Dividend payment Provided the General Shareholders' Meeting approves the proposed appropriation of result, we will pay the dividend in calendar week 24. No dividend will be paid for voting shares and non-voting shares held directly by the Company at the time of dividend payment. Swiss federal withholding tax of 35 per cent will be deducted from the gross dividend amount. This can usually be reclaimed via tax returns. This applies to shareholders resident in Switzerland or a country with which Switzerland has concluded a double tax agreement. For this reason, the relevant banking receipt should be safely stored and enclosed with the final tax return. Weleda AG, Arlesheim, April 14th 2018 On behalf of the Board of DirectorsSince the statutory capital reserves and the statutory retained earnings have reached 50 per cent of the share capital, there will be no further allocation.

Board of Directors' responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the re- quirements of Swiss law and the company's articles of in- corporation. This responsibility includes designing, imple-menting and maintaining an internal control system rele- vant to the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these finan-cial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Stand- ards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the finan- cial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the finan-cial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assess-ments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity's preparation of the financial state- ments in order to design audit procedures that are appro-priate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 comply with Swiss law and the com-pany's articles of incorporation. Report on other legal requirements We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licens-ing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA ) and in- dependence (article 728 CO ) and that there are no circum- stances incompatible with our independence. In accordance with article 728 a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an in- ternal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors. We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the com- pany's articles of incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.

The rules for good corporate governance are laid down in the Company's articles of association and organisational regulations. Control and risk management The primary objective of risk management is to ensure the long-term survival of the company - as a basis for further development. Risk reporting to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors takes place half-yearly. The material content and elements of Weleda's Group-wide risk policy have been documented and described in a comprehensive control and risk management system (KuRS ). The Audit Committee is a fundamental element of the management structure, with responsibility for compliance with Weleda's corporate governance. Audit Committee Members Two members of the Audit Committee, Dr J\u00fcrg Galliker (Chairman ) and Dr Andreas J\u00e4schke, are also members of the Board of Directors. With Dr Patrick Scarpelli, partner at cctm AG in Basel, an external specialist is also represented. Tasks The function of the Audit Committee is to provide effec-tive support to the Board of Directors in monitoring corpo- rate governance. This includes: - monitoring the integrity of financial reporting and the Group's internal control system as well as monitoring compliance with legal and internal regulations - monitoring the independence and performance of the independent external auditors (auditors and Group audi- tors) and the internal auditing department Weleda institutes new management structure Effective September 1st 2017, the Board of Directors decided to replace the existing management model of a Chief Executive Officer (CEO ) with a cooperative manage- ment system. This change has wide-ranging consequences for the structure of Weleda.In the course of the restructuring, the organisational reg-ulations, the rules of procedure of the Executive Board and Board of Directors, the Audit Committee regulations as well as the remuneration and expense regulations of the Board of Directors have been completely revised. The new management model also requires amendment of the communication, collaboration and decision-making pro- cesses which must now be developed, tested and imple- mented. A challenging, though extremely exciting task for our employees, and above all our management bodies (Board of Directors and Executive Board ). New strategic framework conditions On the basis of the Company's articles of association, the principles and guidelines adopted by the principal share- holders (previously: Owner's strategy ), the vision and mis- sion as well as the new organisational regulations of Weleda AG, the Board of Directors and Executive Board together developed the new strategic framework con- ditions. Guided by these framework conditions, the Exe- cutive Board conceived various strategic initiatives for the future of Weleda which were adopted by the Board of Directors at their meeting of December 8 th 2017. Code of Conduct confirmed. Internal control system expanded to include all companies worldwide In the course of the fundamental restructuring of Weleda, the Board of Directors confirmed the Code of Conduct 2017 that was adopted in 2011 and which applies world- wide. The Code includes the fundamental rules of conduct that apply to all members of staff. This includes the han-dling of information and company assets, the prevention of conflicts of interest, interaction with third parties and business partners, as well as issues of occupational health and safety, fire safety and environmental protection. Lastly, Weleda expanded the internal control system - which already applies in France, Germany and Switzer-land - to include all Weleda companies worldwide. These steps have once again improved the risk and controlling processes at Weleda.
