Dosage adjustment Renal impairment Off-label uses Cytomegalovirus prophylaxis Contraindications Hypersensitivity to drug, its components, or acyclovir Precautions Use cautiously in: renal impairment, concurrent use of nephrotoxic drugs, inadequately hydrated patients elderly patients pregnant or breastfeeding patients children.

Adverse reactions CNS: headache, dizziness, depression, agitation, hallucinations, confusion, encephalopathy GI: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain GU: increased levels Patient monitoring Monitor CBC. Stay alert for signs and symptoms of blood dyscrasias. Discontinue drug if clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with HUS/TTP occur. Assess liver and kidney function tests.

Availability (generic available) Nursing implications Nursing assessment - Assess lesions before and daily during therapy. - Monitor patient for signs of thrombotic thrombocytic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic renal dysfunction, fever). Requires prompt treatment; may be fatal. Potential Nursing DiagnosesRisk for impaired skin integrity (Indications) Risk for infection (Indications, Patient/Family Teaching) Implementation - high alert: Do not confuse valacyclovir with valganciclovir. Do not confuse Valtrex (valacyclovir) with Valcyte (valganciclovir). - Oral: May be administered without regard to meals. - Herpes Zoster: Implement valacyclovir therapy as soon as possible after the onset of signs or symptoms of herpes zoster; most effective if started within 48 hr of the onset of zoster rash. Efficacy of treatment started >72 hr after rash onset is unknown. - Genital Herpes and Herpes Labialis: Implement treatment for genital herpes as soon as possible after onset of symptoms (tingling, itching, burning). - Chicken Pox: Initiate therapy at the earliest sign or symptom; preferably within 24 hr of onset of rash. Patient/Family Teaching - Instruct patient to take valacyclovir exactly as directed for the full course of therapy. Take missed doses as soon as remembered if not just before next dose; do not double doses. Advise patient to read the Patient Information before starting therapy. - Advise patient to maintain adequate hydration during therapy. - Advise patient to notify health care professional promptly if nervous system symptoms (aggressive behavior, unsteady movement, shaky movements, confusion, speech problems, hallucinations, seizures, coma) occur. - Instruct patient to notify health care professional of all Rx or OTC medications, vitamins, or herbal products being taken and consult health care professional before taking any new medications. - Instruct female patients to notify health care professional if pregnancy is planned or suspected, or if breast feeding. - Herpes Zoster: Inform patient that valacyclovir does not prevent the spread of infection to others. Precautions should be taken around others who have not had chickenpox or varicella vaccine, or are immunosuppressed, until all lesions have crusted. - Genital Herpes and Herpes Labialis: Inform patient that valacyclovir does not prevent the spread of herpes labialis to others. Advise patient to avoid contact with lesions while lesions or symptoms are present. Valacyclovir reduces transmission of genital herpes to others. Advise patient to practice safe sex (avoid sexual intercourse when lesions are present and wear a condom made of latex or polyurethane during sexual contact). Evaluation/Desired Outcomes - Decrease in time to full crusting, loss of vesicles, loss of ulcers, and development of crusts in patients with acute herpes zoster (shingles). - Decrease in time to full crusting, loss of vesicles, loss of ulcers, and development of crusts in patients with genital herpes. - Decrease in frequency of outbreaks in patients with genital herpes. - Decrease in time to full crusting, loss of vesicles, loss of ulcers, and development of crusts in patients with herpes labialis. Decrease in transmission of genital herpes. - Treatment "}
