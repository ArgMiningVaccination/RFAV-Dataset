One patient I worked with for several days in a row during his health regimen, commented on the way I transitioned from one stroke to the next and that this was truly an art. Ayurveda is the mother of healing arts, and you are the artist! You can read his review here: [https://www.facebook.com/SevaVeda/reviews](https://www.facebook.com/SevaVeda/reviews) I deeply considered what he said and found resonance with it because giving Abhyanga, and all the other Ayurvedic treatments, is truly a Healing Art. Each massage becomes your blank canvas to which you create the experience through your quality of touch. It becomes a dance as you find your flow from one area to the next. Each artist has their own expression and you will find yours. I encourage you to take what I can share with you and make it your own while still adhering to the vital concepts of Abhyanga. This course will be training you to give Ayurvedic Therapies in a modern, western, day spa, or solo personal practice setting. It includes Abhyanga, Garshana, Shirodhara, and Swedana training. These 4 therapies are the most popular and commonly done together in one session. Please [ click here ](/ayurveda-spa-services)to read a description of these treatments.
