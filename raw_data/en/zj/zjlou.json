ILI data collected at all outpatient sites, reported weekly to the 9 district and 21 provincial health departments, and then forwarded to the National Centre for Communicable Diseases. 375 health units across the country are involved in influenza surveillance and 16 regional hospitals are involved in SARI surveillance. MOH is in the process of establishing national influenza surveillance. The country's NIC received a grant from the CDC to establish a National Influenza Surveillance Network. Vaccine Uptake Data Collection/Reporting System MOH developed an electronic immunization register to record PCV13 doses administered. If successful, will expand to include other vaccines. They have also developed a COVID -19 immunization registry. The National Vaccination Registry is an electronic health record system that records complete vaccination histories.

There's also independent private sector procurement. MoPH funds the entire campaign. The nationwide immunization program procures the doses. Local Capacity to Manufacture Vaccines Manufacture influenza vaccines through the Cantacuzino Institute Some pharmaceutical companies can fill and finish vaccines. A South African consortium was also selected to lead a global hub for producing mRNA vaccines. The Government Pharmaceutical Organization has the capability to produce influenza vaccines. Influenza Vaccine Costs Free for at -risk groups Free through the public system, otherwise costs range from 70 -100 rand ($4.00 -5.75 USD). Some private health insuran ce schemes cover vaccines for high-risk members. Free for at -risk groups, otherwise costs range from around 350 baht ($9.57 USD) in public hospitals to around 700 baht ($19.15 USD) in private hospitals Access Points for Influenza Vaccines GPs and pharmacies Public sector for at -risk groups, private sector for others, pharmacies, workplaces, antenatal clinics Available in public and private health centers, but most vaccinations occur at district healthcare centers and other primary care facilities Influenza Disease Burden Surveillance Collect yearly prospective data from patients hospitalized for SARI NICD manages national surveillance for respiratory pathogens.
