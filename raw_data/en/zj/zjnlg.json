After initially training in Crystal Therapy and attaining a 'Crystal Therapy Practitioner Diploma', I was drawn to research Reiki and decided that this was a path that I wanted to follow. After completing my 'First and Second Degree Reiki', which enabled me offer Reiki Therapy on a professional basis to others, I decided that the next step was to undertake my 'Masters Degree' and become a Reiki Master to be able to offer my family, friends and clients an even stronger connection with the power of Reiki. Following on from that, the natural course for me was to become a Reiki Teacher to enable me to pass on all that I had learned to others who want the gift of Reiki. The Reiki that I offer is of the Usui Shiki Ryoho system of natural healing. In order to expand the range of services that I could offer my clients, I then went on to complete a 'Colour Therapy Practitioner Diploma' an 'Indian Head Massage Practitioner Diploma' and an 'Aromatherapy Blending of Essential Oils Diploma'. My Crystal Therapy, Colour Therapy, Indian Head Massage and Aromatherapy Blending training are all approved by the 'International Institute of Complementary Therapists' (IICT) and the 'Complementary Medical Association' (CMA). I am a member of the International Institute of Complementary Therapists. Crystal Therapy and Colour Therapy work beautifully in harmony with Reiki and I regularly combine all three therapies in a single treatment. Aromatherapy can also be incorporated into any of the therapies, particularly in the massage oils for Indian Head Massage. Reiki can also be beneficial to animals. In recognition of this, I now offer the therapy to a wide range of animals, particularly our canine, feline and equine friends. Further qualification to support this include 'Animal Reiki Diploma', 'Canine Communication Diploma', Behaviour Psychology Diploma' . Again, all approved by the 'Complementary Medical Association' (CMA). I offer treatments throughout Lincolnshire either at my home or by visiting clients in their own homes. I also offer Distant Reiki treatments for those that wish to access my services but are too far away to travel. The pages at the top of this site give more in depth information on each of the therapies, explaining more about what the treatments involve and what to expect. There is also a page explaining the Chakras. For those of you who are interested in learning more about holistic therapies, the link to my blog will take you to a page where I regularly post related articles. I hope you find this site informative, but please feel free to contact me should you wish to access my services, or have any other questions. Elysian Holistic Therapies Copyright \u00a9 2019 "}
