These declarations have granted significant regulatory flexibility and new authorities to pharmacists, student pharmacists (referred to as pharmacy interns), and pharmacy technicians. With everything going on these days, it can be challenging to keep track of it all, so here's a summary of these HHS announcements and the requirements that pharmacists must satisfy before ordering and administering COVID-19 tests and vaccines, and requirements that pharmacy interns and pharmacy technicians must satisfy before administering vaccines, pursuant to these PREP ACT declarations. What is the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) and what does a PREP Act declaration provide to pharmacists and pharmacy professionals? Per the HHS website: The [Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act)](https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/prepact/Pages/default.aspx?utm_source=Staff+%2B+Select+Others&utm_campaign=84ac7bf501-HHS+PREP+ACT+Declarations%26COVIDflexblties+js_COPY_&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_3458486e45-84ac7bf501-114331049) authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to issue a declaration (PREP Act declaration) that provides immunity from liability (except for willful misconduct) for claims of loss caused by, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from administration or use of countermeasures to diseases, threats and conditions determined by the Secretary to constitute a present or credible risk of a future public health emergency to entities and individuals involved in the development, manufacture, testing, distribution, administration, and use of such countermeasures. A PREP Act declaration is specifically for the purpose of providing immunity from liability, and is different from, and not dependent on, other emergency declarations. Importantly, the PREP Act also preempts state law in conflict with any authorization made pursuant to the PREP ACT during the period of emergency. Authorization for Pharmacists to Order and Administer COVID-19 Tests On April 8, HHS issued its [PREP Act declaration](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/authorizing-licensed-pharmacists-to-order-and-administer-covid-19-tests.pdf?utm_source=Staff+%2B+Select+Others&utm_campaign=84ac7bf501-HHS+PREP+ACT+Declarations%26COVIDflexblties+js_COPY_&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_3458486e45-84ac7bf501-114331049) authorizing licensed pharmacists to order and administer COVID-19 tests, including serology tests, that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized through Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). On May 19, the General Counsel for the HHS Office of the Secretary issued an [advisory opinion](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/advisory-opinion-20-02-hhs-ogc-prep-act.pdf?utm_source=Staff+%2B+Select+Others&utm_campaign=84ac7bf501-HHS+PREP+ACT+Declarations%26COVIDflexblties+js_COPY_&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_3458486e45-84ac7bf501-114331049) further clarifying this PREP Act declaration and its preemption on local and state regulations that may conflict with the declaration. What does this declaration do? This PREP Act declaration authorizes Georgia-licensed pharmacists to order and administer COVID-19 tests that have been authorized by the FDA through its EUA process. What does this mean? If a pharmacy has an active CLIA waiver, the pharmacist is granted the authority, and is covered under the liability protections of the PREP Act, to order and administer COVID-19 tests that have been approved as \"waived\" by the FDA through its EUA process.

Adult vaccines: A Vaccine Protocol Agreement is still required for pharmacists to order and administer adult vaccines (pneumococcal; influenza, meningitis, shingles) in Georgia.
