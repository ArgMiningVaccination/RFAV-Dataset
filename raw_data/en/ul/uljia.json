Application Review Information](#_Section_V._Application) [Section VIII. Other Information](#_Section_VIII._Other) [The overall goal of the NIH Research Career Development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the Nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. In addition to this opportunity, NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) support a variety of other mentored career development programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence. These other programs may be more suitable for particular candidates. NIH also supports non-mentored career development programs for independent investigators. ]More information about Career programs may be found at the [NIH Extramural Training Mechanisms](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=41159) website. The purpose of this NIH Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide salary and research support to investigators who are within ten years of completing their degree or residency training. Research and mentorship must be in the field of HIV/AIDS vaccine development, using nonhuman primates (NHPs) as pre-clinical models. These awards will provide 3 years of support for intensive research career development under the guidance of an experienced mentorship team, with expertise in both development of NHP vaccine models and in translation of the results of investigations performed in NHPs to work in humans. The expectation is that through this sustained period of research career development and training, awardees will launch independent research careers and become competitive for new research project grant (e.g., R01) funding. The FY 2016 National Institutes of Health Trans-NIH Plan for HIV-Related Research ( [http://www.oar.nih.gov/strategicplan/fy2016/index.asp](http://www.oar.nih.gov/strategicplan/fy2016/index.asp)) identifies development of safe, effective and affordable AIDS vaccines that can be used in combination with other prevention strategies as the best long-term solution for controlling the AIDS pandemic. Two important research priorities are: 1) To explore new HIV vaccine approaches, and 2) To develop opportunities for new investigators in the HIV vaccine field, enabling them to translate promising preclinical vaccine studies in NHPs into human clinical trials. It is generally accepted that preclinical studies using NHPs are necessary for development of effective HIV/AIDS vaccines. Such NHP-based studies include both direct testing of vaccine strategies and various investigations related to understanding factors promoting vaccine efficacy and to improving vaccine design. Investigations aimed at hypothesis-driven strategies for design of vaccines include, among others: characterizing early innate host-virus interactions; new challenge such as multi-clade SHIVs and HIV-adapted viruses; understanding the role of B-cell and mucosal immunity in vaccine efficacy; and assessing how adjuvants can alter immune responses in both the systemic and mucosal compartments and their effectiveness after mucosal challenge. A second factor that will facilitate development of effective HIV/AIDS vaccines is to increase the workforce that can employ NHPs as pre-clinical models, followed by translation to human clinical investigations and trials. Various facilities, such as the National Primate Research Centers and others, in collaboration with many scientists around the world, are training new investigators to work with NHPs in vaccine-related projects. In part because of the cost and time of performing vaccine studies using NHPs, these investigators can find it difficult to transition to positions of independence, which will allow them to translate promising ideas into the development of effective vaccines. This K01 grant program will support these investigators, facilitating further progress of vaccine-related research projects. The investigators will receive mentorship that will enhance critical aspects of career development such as grantsmanship, networking and ability to translate results from animals to the clinic. Grant: A support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity. New Resubmission Revision The [OER Glossary](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11116) and the SF424 (R&R) Application Guide provide details on these application types. The number of awards is contingent upon NIH appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications. Award budgets are composed of salary and other program-related expenses, as described below. The total award, including salary, fringe benefits and all other costs cannot exceed $350,000 total costs per year. The total project period may not exceed 3 years. NIH will contribute up to $75,000 plus fringe benefits per year toward the salary of the career award recipient. The total salary requested must be based on a full-time staff appointment. The salary must be consistent both with the established salary structure at the institution and with salaries actually provided by the institution from its own funds to other staff members of equivalent qualifications, rank, and responsibilities in the department concerned. If full-time, 12-month salaries are not currently paid to comparable staff members, the salary proposed must be appropriately related to the existing salary structure at the institution. Confirmation of salary may be required prior to the issuance of an award. Fringe benefits, based on the sponsoring institution's rate and the percent of effort, are provided in addition to salary. The sponsoring institution may supplement the NIH salary contribution up to a level that is consistent with the institution's salary scale. However, supplementation may not be from Federal funds unless specifically authorized by the Federal program from which such funds are derived. In no case may PHS funds be used for salary supplementation. Institutional supplementation of salary must not require extra duties or responsibilities that would interfere with the purpose of the career award. The total salary, however, may not exceed the legislatively mandated salary cap. See: [https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/salcap_summary.htm](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/salcap_summary.htm). NIH will contribute up to $275,000, total costs for all non-salary program-related expenses. The budget request must include travel costs associated with attendance at one of the semi-annual meetings of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Research development costs of the award recipient must be justified and consistent with the stage of development of the candidate and the proportion of time to be spent in research or career development activities. Salary for mentors, secretarial and administrative assistants, etc. is not allowed. Indirect Costs (also known as Facilities & Administrative [F&A] Costs) are reimbursed at 8% of modified total direct costs. NIH grant policies as described in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11120) will apply to the applications submitted and awards made in response to this FOA. Higher Education Institutions The following types of Higher Education Institutions are always encouraged to apply for NIH support as Public or Private Institutions of Higher Education: Nonprofits Other Than Institutions of Higher Education Non-domestic (non-U.S.) Entities (Foreign Institutions) are not eligible to apply. Non-domestic (non-U.S.) components of U.S. Organizations are not eligible to apply. Foreign components, as [defined in the NIH Grants Policy Statement](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11118), are not allowed. Applicant Organizations Applicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the SF 424 (R&R) Application Guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. All registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. Registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. The [NIH Policy on Late Submission of Grant Applications](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-11-035.html) states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission. Program Directors/Principal Investigators (PD(s)/PI(s)) All PD(s)/PI(s) must have an eRA Commons account. PD(s)/PI(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in eRA Commons. If the PD/PI is also the organizational Signing Official, they must have two distinct eRA Commons accounts, one for each role. Obtaining an eRA Commons account can take up to 2 weeks. Any candidate with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) is invited to work with his/her mentorship team and organization to develop an application for support. Individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for NIH support. Multiple PDs/PIs are not allowed. By the time of award, the individual must be a citizen or a non-citizen national of the United States or have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence (i.e., possess a currently valid Permanent Resident Card USCIS Form I-551, or other legal verification of such status Current and former PDs/PIs on NIH research project (R01), program project (P01), center grants (P50), sub-projects of program project (P01), sub-projects of center grants (P50), other career development awards (K-awards), or the equivalent are not eligible.

The candidate should have an academic appointment at an institution that houses a facility, such as a National Primate Research Center or equivalent, which can provide NHPs, core facilities and intellectual resources for using NHPs in HIV/AIDS vaccine research. If exceptionally well justified, the candidate can have a primary appointment at an institution distinct from that which houses NHP-related facilities and infrastructure. However, all work directly related to animals must be performed at the institution that houses the NHP-related facilities and infrastructure. This FOA does not require cost sharing as defined in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement.](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11126) Applicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct. The NIH will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time. An individual may not have two or more competing NIH career development applications pending review concurrently. In addition, NIH will not accept: Candidates may submit research project grant (RPG) applications concurrently with the K application. However, any concurrent RPG application may not have substantial scientific and/or budgetary overlap with the career award application. K award recipients are encouraged to obtain funding from NIH or other Federal sources either as a PD/PI on a competing research grant award or cooperative agreement, or as project leader on a competing multi-project award as described in [NOT-OD-08-065](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=51126). At the time of award, the candidate must have a \"full-time\" appointment at the academic institution. Candidates are required to commit a minimum of 75% of full-time professional effort (i.e., a minimum of 9 person-months) to their career development and research training during the mentored phase. Candidates may engage in other duties as part of the remaining 25% of their full-time professional effort not covered by this award, as long as such duties do not interfere with or detract from the proposed career development program. Candidates who have VA appointments may not consider part of the VA effort toward satisfying the full time requirement at the applicant institution. Candidates with VA appointments should contact the staff person in the relevant Institute or Center prior to preparing an application to discuss their eligibility. Under certain circumstances, an awardee may submit a written request to the awarding component requesting a reduction in minimum required percent effort, which will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Details on this policy are provided in [NOT-OD-09-036](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=51125).

Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. As part of the [NIH mission](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149), all applications submitted to the NIH in support of biomedical and behavioral research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. Reviewers should provide their assessment of the likelihood that the proposed career development and research plan will enhance the candidate's potential for a productive, independent scientific research career in a health-related field, taking into consideration the criteria below in determining the overall impact score. Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. Mentor(s), Co-Mentor(s), Consultant(s), Collaborator(s) As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items. For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: (1) risk to subjects, (2) adequacy of protection against risks, (3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, (4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and (5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: (1) the justification for the exemption, (2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and (3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Human Subjects](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11175). When the proposed project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of children to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. For additional information on review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Inclusion in Clinical Research](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11174). The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following five points: (1) proposed use of the animals, and species, strains, ages, sex, and numbers to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals and for the appropriateness of the species and numbers proposed; (3) adequacy of veterinary care; (4) procedures for limiting discomfort, distress, pain and injury to that which is unavoidable in the conduct of scientifically sound research including the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs and/or comfortable restraining devices; and (5) methods of euthanasia and reason for selection if not consistent with the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia. For additional information on review of the Vertebrate Animals section, please refer to the [Worksheet for Review of the Vertebrate Animal Section](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11150). Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed. For Resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project. Not Applicable For Revisions, the committee will consider the appropriateness of the proposed expansion of the scope of the project. If the Revision application relates to a specific line of investigation presented in the original application that was not recommended for approval by the committee, then the committee will consider whether the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group are adequate and whether substantial changes are clearly evident. As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score. All applications for support under this FOA must include a plan to fulfill NIH requirements for instruction in the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR). Taking into account the level of experience of the applicant, including any prior instruction or participation in RCR as appropriate for the applicant's career stage, the reviewers will evaluate the adequacy of the proposed RCR training in relation to the following five required components: 1) Format - the required format of instruction, i.e., face-to-face lectures, coursework, and/or real-time discussion groups (a plan with only on-line instruction is not acceptable); 2) Subject Matter - the breadth of subject matter, e.g., conflict of interest, authorship, data management, human subjects and animal use, laboratory safety, research misconduct, research ethics; 3) Faculty Participation - the role of the mentor(s) and other faculty involvement in the fellow's instruction; 4) Duration of Instruction - the number of contact hours of instruction (at least eight contact hours are required); and 5) Frequency of Instruction -instruction must occur during each career stage and at least once every four years. Plans and past record will be rated as ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE, and the summary statement will provide the consensus of the review committee. See also: [NOT-OD-10-019](http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-10-019.html). Reviewers will assess the information provided in this section of the application, including (1) the Select Agent(s) to be used in the proposed research, (2) the registration status of all entities where Select Agent(s) will be used, (3) the procedures that will be used to monitor possession use and transfer of Select Agent(s), and (4) plans for appropriate biosafety, biocontainment, and security of the Select Agent(s). Reviewers will comment on whether the following Resource Sharing Plans, or the rationale for not sharing the following types of resources, are reasonable: (1) [Data Sharing Plan](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11151); (2) [Sharing Model Organisms](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11152); and (3) [ Genomic Data Sharing Plan (GDS)](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11153). Reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research. Applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by (an) appropriate Scientific Review Group(s), in accordance with [NIH peer review policy and procedures](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11154), using the stated [review criteria](#_1._Criteria). Assignment to a Scientific Review Group will be shown in the eRA Commons. As part of the scientific peer review, all applications: Applications will be assigned on the basis of established PHS referral guidelines to the appropriate NIH Institute or Center. Applications will compete for available funds with all other recommended applications. Following initial peer review, recommended applications will receive a second level of review by the appropriate national Advisory Council or Board. The following will be considered in making funding decisions: After the peer review of the application is completed, the PD/PI will be able to access his or her Summary Statement (written critique) via the [eRA Commons](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11123).
