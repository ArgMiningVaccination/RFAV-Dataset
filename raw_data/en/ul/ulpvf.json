Pilot Feasibility Stud ; 8(1): 87, 2022 most countries, high- [dose] [vaccines]are not widely implemented. Assessing the [effectiveness]estimates. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of conducting a pragmatic randomized Danish vaccine]or [quadrivalent (Danske L\u00e6gers [Vaccinations]Service) for recruitment, inclusion, [randomization], and [vaccination]. collection of baseline and follow-up data including [safety] [monitoring]is performed centrally by [Cardiology]at [Hospital], Copenhagen, [Denmark]using the Danish nationwide [health] [registries]. The study aims to include 40,000 participants during the 2021/2022 [influenza] [season]. The primary endpoints [address]feasibility and include the number of participants enrolled, [randomization]balance, and representativeness compared to the Danish general [population]. Relative [vaccine effectiveness] [will]also be assessed, however, this [feasibility study]is not powered for clinical outcomes and may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION:The DANFLU-1 study is investigating the feasibility of conducting a large-scale [pragmatic clinical trial]in [Denmark]utilizing existing [infrastructure]and the Danish nationwide [registries]. This [will]provide valuable insight, especially for potential [future]fully powered [vaccine]trials, but also for trials wishing to investigate other interventions.
