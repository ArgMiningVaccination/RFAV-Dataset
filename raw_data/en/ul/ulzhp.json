The phenomenon of maternal antibody interference is discussed in the text portion of these guidelines. CORE VACCINATIONS protect against diseas es that are endemic to a region, those with potential public health significance, required by law, virulent/highly infectious, and/or those posing a risk of severe disease. Core vaccines have clearly demonst rated efficacy and safety, and thus exhibit a hig h enough le vel of patient benefit and low enough level of risk to justify their use in all equids. DISEASE Foals and Weanlings (<12 months of age) of mares vaccinated in the prepartum period against the disease indicated Foals and Weanlin gs (<12 months of age) of unvaccinated mare or lacking vaccination history COMMENTS Tetanus 3-dose series : 1st dose at 4 - 6 months of age 2nd dose 4 - 6 weeks after the 1st dose 3rd dose at 10 - 12 months of age Annual R evaccin ation 3-dose series : 1st dose at 3 - 4 months of age 2nd dose 4 - 6 weeks after the 1st dose 3rd dose 10 - 12 months of age Annual Revaccination Eastern/Western Equine Encephalomyelitis (EEE/WEE) 3-dose series : 1st dose at 4 - 6 months of ag e 2nd dose 4 - 6 weeks after the 1st dose 3rd dose at 10 - 12 months of age 3-dose series : 1st dose at 4 - 6 months of age 2nd dose 4 - 6 weeks after the 1st dose 3rd dose at 10 - 12 months of age Note: Primary vaccination series scheduling may be amended with vaccin ations administered earlier to younger foals that a re at increased disease risk due to the presence of vectors . * Foals in the Southeastern USA: The primary vaccination series can be initiated with an additional dose at 2 -3 months of age due to early seasonal vector presence. West Nil e Virus (WNV) 3-dose series : 1st dose at 4 - 6 months of age 2nd dose 4 - 6 weeks after the 1st dose 3rd dose at 10 - 12 month s of age Annual revacci nation 3-dose series : 1st dose at 4 - 6 months of age 2nd dose 4 - 6 weeks after the 1st dose 3rd dose at 10 - 12 months of age Annual Revaccinati on Note: Primary vaccination series scheduling may be amended with vaccin ations administered earlier to younger foals that a re at increased disease risk due to the presence of vectors . * Foals in the Southeastern USA: The primary vaccination series can be initiated with an additional dose at 2 -3 months of age due to ear ly seasonal vector presenc e. Rabies 2-dose series : 1st dose at 4 - 6 months of age (refer to manufacturer label guidelines) 2nd dose 4 - 6 weeks after 1st dose Annual revaccination 1-dose 1st dose at 4 - 6 months of age (refer to manufacturer label guid elines) Annu al revaccina tion The recommendation for a 2 -dose initial series in foals from mar es vaccinated with rabies within the year prior to foaling is to address the potential for maternal antibody interference. Rabies products are efficacious f or at least 12 months based on efficacy studies with naive foals . RISK-BASED VACCINATIONS can be found on the following pages RISK -BASED VACCINATIONS are those having applications which may vary between individuals, populations, and geog raphic regions. Risk assessment should be performed by, or in consulta tion with, a licensed veterinarian to identify whic h vaccines are appropriate for a given horse or population of horses. The listing of a vaccine here is not a recommendation for its inclusion into a vaccination program. Vacc ine scheduling is provided for use after it has been determined which, if any, risk-based vaccines are indicated. Note : vaccines are listed in this table in alphabetical order not in order of priority for use. DISEASE Foals and Weanlings (<12 mont hs of age) of mares vaccina ted in the p repar tum period against the disease ind icated Foals and Weanlings (<12 months of age) of unvaccinated mares COMMENTS Anthrax Not applicable. As it is not recommended t o vaccinate mares during pregnancy there will be no foals of mar es vacc inate d pre partum No age specific guidelines are available for this vaccine. Manufacturer's recommendation is for primary series of 2 doses administered subcutaneously at a 2 to 3-week interval. Antimicrobial drugs must not be given conc urrently with th is vaccine . Caution should be used during s torage, handling, and administration of this live bacterial product . Consult a physician immediately should accidental human exposure (via mu cus membranes, conjunctiva, or broken skin) occur. Botulism 3-dose s eries : 1st dose 2 - 3 months of age 2nd dose 4 weeks after 1st dose 3rd dose 4 weeks after 2nd dose 3-dose series : 1st dose 1 - 3 months of age 2nd dose 4 weeks after 1st dose 3rd dose 4 weeks after 2nd dose Mater nal anti body does not interfere with vaccination; fo als at high risk may be vaccinated as early as 2 weeks of age. Equine Herpesvirus (EHV ) Inactivated or modified live vaccine 3-dose seri es: 1st dose 4 - 6 months of age 2nd dose 4 - 6 weeks a fter 1st dose 3rd dose at 10 - 12 months of age Revaccinate at 6 -month intervals Inactivated or modified live vaccin e 3-dose series : 1st dose at 4 - 6 months of age 2nd dose 4 - 6 weeks after 1st dose 3rd dose at 10 - 12 months of age Revacc inate at 6 -month intervals Equine Vi ral Arteritis (EVA ) Colt (m ale) foals : Single dose at 6 - 12 months of age (see comments) Colt (m ale) foals : Single dose at 6 - 12 months of age (see comments) Prior to initia l vaccination, colt ( male ) foals should unde rgo serologic testing and be confi rmed negative for antibodies to EAV. Testing should be performed shortly prior to, or preferably at, the time of vaccination. As foals ca n carry colostral derived antibodies to EAV for up to 6 months, testing a nd vaccin ation should not be performed prio r to 6 months of age. Equine Influenza Inactivated vaccine 2 or 3-dose series : Depend ent upon the manufacturer 's product recommen dation , the vaccine is an initial two or three do se series with a 3 to 4-week interval between doses (IM) starting at 4 -6 months of age. Modified liv e vaccine Administer a single do se (IN) in foals 11 mont hs of age or older Revaccinate at 6 -12month intervals based on risk Inactiv ated vaccin e 2 or 3-dose series: Depend ent the manufacturer 's product recommen dation , the vaccin e is an initial two or three do se series with a 3 to 4 -week interval between doses (IM) starting at 4 -6 months of age. Modified liv e vaccine Administer a single do se (IN ) in foals 11 mont hs of age or older Revac cinate at 6 -12month intervals based on risk An increased ris k of disease may wa rrant vaccination of younger foals. Because some mate rnal anti -influenza antibody is likely to be present, a complete se ries o f primary vaccinations should still be given af ter 6 months of age. Leptospirosis 2 dose series: 1st dose at 6 months of a ge 2nd dose 3 -4 weeks after 1st dose Annual r evaccin ation 2 dose series: 1st dose at 6 months of age 2nd dose 3 -4 weeks after 1st dose Annual revaccination Safety h as been demonstrated in foals 3 months of age. The effects of circulating materna l antibody and vaccination have not bee n determi ned. Potomac Horse Fever (PHF) 2-dose series: 1st dose at 5 month s of a ge 2nd dose 3 - 4 weeks after 1st dose 2-dose series: 1st dose at 5 months of age 2nd dose 3 - 4 weeks after 1st dose If risk warrants, vaccine may be admini stered to younger foals. Subsequent doses are to be administered at 4 -week inte rvals until 6 months of age. Snake Bite Please see guidelines for additional information Please see guidelines for addit ional information Strangles Streptococcus equi Killed vaccine 3-dose series : 1st dose at 4 - 6 months of age 2nd dose 4 - 6 weeks after 1st dose 3rd dose 4 - 6 weeks after 2nd dose Modified live vaccine 3-dose series administered intranasally : 1st dose a t 6 - 9 months of age 2nd dose 3 - 4 weeks after 1st dose 3rd dose at 11 - 12 months of age Killed vaccine 3-dose ser ies: 1st dose at 4 - 6 months of age 2nd dose 4 - 6 weeks after 1st dose 3rd dose 4 - 6 weeks after 2nd dose Modified li ve vaccine 3-dose series administered intranasally : 1st dose at 6 - 9 months of age 2nd dose 3 - 4 weeks after 1st dose 3rd dose at 11 - 12 months of age Vaccinatio n is not recommended as a strategy in outbreak mitigati on. If risk warrants, the modified live vaccine (MLV) may be safely admin istered to f oals as young as 6 weeks of age. However , vaccine efficacy in this age group has not been adequately studied . If MLV is administered to young er foals, a 3rd dos e of vaccine should then be administered 2 - 4 weeks prior to weaning. The risk of vaccine -associated adverse events is increased when the MLV product is administered to young foals. Vaccinatio ns for Foals were developed by the American Asso ciation o f Equine Pra ctitioners (AAEP) Infectious Disease Committee . These guidelines and char ts were review ed and updated by t he com mittee & Vaccin ation Guidelines Subcommittee and approved by the Board of Directors in 2020 .
