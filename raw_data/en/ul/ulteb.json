Tiffany Jean Barsotti, M.Th., PhD., is a spiritual, medical counselor and researcher at HEAL and THRIVE in Weaverville, North Carolina. A focus of her clinical work is subtle energy, biofield therapies, and energy psychology. With her spiritual and intuitive guidance, she serves as an integrative practitioner working alongside medical doctors, naturopaths, osteopaths, chiropractors, psychiatrists, psychologists, and other allied health professionals. Tiffany's doctoral dissertation research, which earned her honors, was on the topic of The Effects of a Sacred Object on the Human Biofield, research conducted in Peedam, India. Tiffany received her Masters of Theology in Energy Medicine with special emphasis in Medical and Spiritual Counseling and was personally mentored by the school's founders, Drs. C. Norman Shealy and Caroline Myss, as well as many other modern mystics. Tiffany's research has included her novel Master's thesis, A Proposed Spiritual Axis of the Bodymind How the Reticular Activating System (RAS), Vagus Nerve and the Alta Major Chakra Axis May Be the Nexus of Bodymind/Spirit Consciousness, which earned her honors and recognition amongst peers and scholars with an interest in seeing the reunion of science and spirit. Her thesis proposed the 'Reticular Activating System-Vagus Nerve-Alta Major Chakra Axis' as the nexus of communication from Higher Consciousness to the physical and subtle energy bodies of the human being. To advance her clinical and research activities, Tiffany utilizes biofield devices to measure the human biofield and subtle energy interactions related to mind-body mechanisms. "}
