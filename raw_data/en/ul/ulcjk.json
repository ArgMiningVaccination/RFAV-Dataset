It can, however, cause severe birth defects known as the congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) when infection occurs early in pregnancy. As many as 8%-13% of children with CRS developed autism during the rubella epidemic of the 1960s compared to the background rate of about 1 new case per 5000 children. Rubella infection and CRS are now rare in the U.S. and in Europe due to widespread vaccination. However, autism rates have risen dramatically in recent decades to about 3% of children today, with many cases appearing after a period of normal development ('regressive autism'). Evidence is reviewed here suggesting that the signs and symptoms of rubella may be due to alterations in the hepatic metabolism of vitamin A (retinoids), precipitated by the acute phase of the infection. The infection causes mild liver dysfunction and the spillage of stored vitamin A compounds into the circulation, resulting in an endogenous form of hypervitaminosis A. Given that vitamin A is a known teratogen, it is suggested that rubella infection occurring in the early weeks of pregnancy causes CRS through maternal liver dysfunction and exposure of the developing fetus to excessive vitamin A. On this view, the multiple manifestations of CRS and associated autism represent endogenous forms of hypervitaminosis A. It is further proposed that regressive autism results primarily from post-natal influences of a liver-damaging nature and exposure to excess vitamin A, inducing CRS-like features as a function of vitamin A toxicity, but without the associated dysmorphogenesis. A number of environmental factors are discussed that may plausibly be candidates for this role, and suggestions are offered for testing the model. The model also suggests a number of measures that may be effective both in reducing the risk of fetal CRS in women who acquire rubella in their first trimester and in reversing or minimizing regressive autism among children in whom the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2019-09-22", "cleaned_text": "to Autism [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16193543](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16193543) [Children's Health](/journal/ijerph/sections/Children_Health)) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-ijerph-16-03543)]. The infection is characterized by rash, fever and lymphadenopathy. Up to 70% of infected adult women develop arthritis. If, however, infection occurs in the first weeks of pregnancy, up to 85% of neonates are born with a pattern of growth restriction and major birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Later-onset sequelae of rubella in early pregnancy include autism and diabetes [ [2](#B2-ijerph-16-03543), [3](#B3-ijerph-16-03543)]. [4](#B4-ijerph-16-03543)]. In the 12 months from December 2016 to November 2017, only 729 rubella cases were reported in Europe, of which 93 were laboratory-confirmed. The majority of cases (77.3%) were reported from Poland [ [1](#B1-ijerph-16-03543)]. In the United Kingdom, the number of cases of acute rubella fell from 70 per year in 1988 to only 1 case in 1995 [ [5](#B5-ijerph-16-03543)]. In poorer countries, rubella and CRS remain common. In the late 1990s, the incidence of CRS in these countries was estimated at between 44 and 275 cases per 100,000 live births [ [6](#B6-ijerph-16-03543)]. [7](#B7-ijerph-16-03543)]. Worldwide, about 100,000 infants are born annually with CRS [ [8](#B8-ijerph-16-03543), [9](#B9-ijerph-16-03543), [10](#B10-ijerph-16-03543)]. Fetal damage associated with rubella tends to result only when infection occurs in the first 16 weeks of gestation. In general, the earlier the onset of infection, the more severe are the observed malformations [ [11](#B11-ijerph-16-03543)]. 2. Maternal Rubella, Cataract, and the Congenital Rubella Syndrome [12](#B12-ijerph-16-03543)]. The cataracts involved all but the outermost layers of the lens, suggesting that cataract formation had begun early in gestation due to a common toxic or infective factor. Gregg's hypothesis of rubella virus as the likely incriminated agent was subsequently confirmed [ [11](#B11-ijerph-16-03543)], but the pathogenesis of CRS has remained obscure. [7](#B7-ijerph-16-03543), [13](#B13-ijerph-16-03543), [14](#B14-ijerph-16-03543)]: - bulging fontanelle and rash at birth; - fetal growth restriction (FGR) and low birth weight; - seizures; - hearing and cardiovascular defects (most commonly patent ductus arteriosus); - microcephaly; - psychomotor retardation; hepatitis; - hepatosplenomegaly; - - - thyroid disorders; - progressive rubella panencephalitis [11](#B11-ijerph-16-03543)]. Unlike most of the prevalent infections, which typically had high mortality rates, rubella in adults was considered a mild illness with coryza-like symptoms for 1-7 days followed by a 2- to 4-day rash, and then resolution of symptoms. There was therefore no reason to suspect that maternal rubella infection could severely damage the fetus, especially as birth defects were thought to be mostly genetic in origin. 3. Rubella Linked to Autism [15](#B15-ijerph-16-03543), [16](#B16-ijerph-16-03543)]. Many of the children were found to have an altered immune response to rubella vaccination, indicating congenital infection with rubella virus [ [17](#B17-ijerph-16-03543)]. Stella Chess studied the behavioral features of preschool children with congenital rubella in New York City [ [18](#B18-ijerph-16-03543)]. She identified the full syndrome of autism in 10 out of 243 such children and a partial syndrome in an additional eight (i.e., 18/243, or 7.4%). The diagnosis was based on Kanner's criteria [ [19](#B19-ijerph-16-03543)], notably a profound lack of interest in affective contact, coupled with repetitive and elaborate ritualistic behavior. This rate was over 200 times higher than estimated prevalence rates at the time, ranging from 0.7 per 10,000 in the U.S. to 2.1 per 10,000 children in London, England [ [20](#B20-ijerph-16-03543), [21](#B21-ijerph-16-03543)], and far higher also than a more recent reported autism rate in 2014 of 1 in 36 children among eight-year-olds in the U.S. [ [22](#B22-ijerph-16-03543)]. Chess subsequently identified four additional cases in her cohort of children with CRS, increasing the autism rate to 10.24% [ [23](#B23-ijerph-16-03543)]. [15](#B15-ijerph-16-03543), [16](#B16-ijerph-16-03543)]. These data suggested a strong causal association between congenital rubella viral infection and autism. Later studies suggested links between other systemic viral infections and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and autism spectrum disorders [ [24](#B24-ijerph-16-03543), [25](#B25-ijerph-16-03543), [26](#B26-ijerph-16-03543)]. [18](#B18-ijerph-16-03543), [23](#B23-ijerph-16-03543)]. She noted that while sequelae of rubella infection in utero\u2014notably blindness, deafness, and cardiac and neuromuscular defects\u2014remained unchanged in these children, the initial degree of mental retardation tended to diminish over time [ [27](#B27-ijerph-16-03543)]. 4. Congenital Rubella Syndrome\u2014Case Study [28](#B28-ijerph-16-03543)], a 20-year-old Bangladeshi primigravid woman arrived in the U.K. when 20 weeks pregnant and was seen for prenatal care 2 weeks later. Fetal growth restriction (FGR) was noted on ultrasound scan. The baby was born at 31 weeks of gestation weighing 1035 g with features of symmetrical FGR as well as signs of intrauterurine infection, including jaundice, hepatitis, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, patent ductus arteriosus, and failure to thrive. At 6-8 weeks, early retinopathy and bilateral cataracts were noted on fundoscopy. Rubella virus IgM was noted 2 weeks later in serum samples. The mother recalled having a mild influenza-like illness without rash around the tenth week of pregnancy, confirmed by antibody avidity testing on paired maternal serum samples. 5. Rubella Infection and CRS\u2014Introduction [7](#B7-ijerph-16-03543)]. Following respiratory transmission and replication of virus in the nasopharynx and regional lymph nodes, viremia occurs 5-7 days after exposure, spreading throughout the body and transplacentally, leading to fetal damage via destruction of cells and mitotic arrest [ [9](#B9-ijerph-16-03543)]. [29](#B29-ijerph-16-03543)]. Acquired and vaccination-associated rubella infection are also associated with post-infectious acute polyarthritis. In a series of 29 female patients who visited a general medical clinic in Japan, 33% had acute polyarthritis [ [30](#B30-ijerph-16-03543)]. [11](#B11-ijerph-16-03543)]. The mechanisms underlying increased risk of CRS in the first trimester, followed by decreased risk in the second trimester, have not well understood but are suggested below. [31](#B31-ijerph-16-03543)]. Between 25% and 40% of young adults with a history of congenital rubella developed type 1 diabetes between ages 10 and 30, many having chronic thyroiditis or other autoimmune diseases [ [32](#B32-ijerph-16-03543)]. Of 40 patients with congenital rubella born in 1939-1943 and seen again in 1967 and 1991, all had hearing impairments, eye defects (including microphthalmia) and vascular defects [ [33](#B33-ijerph-16-03543)]. We now turn to the pathogenesis of rubella symptomatology, the congenital rubella syndrome, and links autism. Retinoid Toxicity Hypothesis of Rubella Infection [34](#B34-ijerph-16-03543)]. [35](#B35-ijerph-16-03543)], liver damage results in the entry of stored retinoid compounds into the fetal circulation in toxic concentrations, interrupting normal fetal development and causing dysmorphogenesis, brain damage and autism, among other systemic complications. We thus propose that the multiple manifestations of CRS, including autism, represent endogenous forms of hypervitaminosis A. It is further suggested that rising rates of autism and related neurodevelopmental disorders in recent decades result primarily from post-natal influences of a liver-damaging nature, also resulting in exposure to excess vitamin A and inducing CRS-like features as a function of vitamin A toxicity, but without the associated dysmorphogenesis. 6. Retinoids\u2014A Summary [36](#B36-ijerph-16-03543), [37](#B37-ijerph-16-03543)]. Measurements of serum retinol are used to identify individuals with normal or deficient liver reserves, but they are homeostatically controlled by the liver and are neither closely correlated with vitamin A intake nor with signs of deficiency or excess [ [38](#B38-ijerph-16-03543), [39](#B39-ijerph-16-03543)]. [40](#B40-ijerph-16-03543)] ( [Figure 1](#ijerph-16-03543-f001)). [41](#B41-ijerph-16-03543)]. As noted, vitamin A can be very toxic if released into the circulation unbound to protein, i.e., as retinyl esters (REs) rather than as RBP. Retinoid toxicity can occur due to excessive dietary intake, supplements, and vitamin A medications. Vitamin A intake only marginally above the recommended amount is associated with embryopathy, reduced bone mineral density in the neonate, and increased risk for hip fracture [ [42](#B42-ijerph-16-03543)]. REs destroy cell membranes and are a major source of vitamin A toxicity [ [43](#B43-ijerph-16-03543), [44](#B44-ijerph-16-03543)]. Retinoid toxicity can also occur in cholestatic liver disease due to the spillage of RA into the circulation in bile and the leakage of REs into the circulation from damaged hepatocytes [ [45](#B45-ijerph-16-03543)]. Impaired hepatic mobilization lowers serum retinol, giving the appearance of a deficiency state but masking an overall state of retinoid toxicity. A variety of infections and stressors are associated with transient declines in plasma retinol concentrations [ [46](#B46-ijerph-16-03543), [47](#B47-ijerph-16-03543)], an effect that complicates the interpretation of serum retinol as an indicator of vitamin A nutritional status. Plasma retinol concentrations tend to rebound once the inflammatory stimulus is removed [ [48](#B48-ijerph-16-03543)]. [49](#B49-ijerph-16-03543), [50](#B50-ijerph-16-03543)], and even fatal acute liver failure [ [51](#B51-ijerph-16-03543)]. Liver dysfunction is often asymptomatic and up to 70% of patients with fatty liver do not show laboratory abnormalities, since liver function tests (which measure necrotic damage) provide only a crude indicator of abnormal liver function [ [52](#B52-ijerph-16-03543)]. [53](#B53-ijerph-16-03543)]. Patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and other chronic liver disorders can have very high titers of hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies to rubella virus [ [54](#B54-ijerph-16-03543)]. Rubella infection is related to the hemophagocytic syndrome, a systemic clinico-pathological entity characterized by proliferation of benign hemophagocytic histiocytes, fever, cytopenia, abnormal liver function, coagulopathy and hepatosplenomegaly [ [55](#B55-ijerph-16-03543)]. Neonatal hepatitis secondary to rubella occurs in about 10% of cases of infantile cholestasis [ [56](#B56-ijerph-16-03543)]. and Hypervitaminosis A [7](#B7-ijerph-16-03543)]. [68](#B68-ijerph-16-03543)]. An acute and generally mild nonerosive form of arthritis occurs in 10%-30% of infected persons, usually involving multiple small joints and lasting for 5-10 days post-infection, and most cases are short-term and self-limited [ [69](#B69-ijerph-16-03543)]. However, rubella virus has not been recovered from peripheral blood lymphocytes in those with chronic arthropathy following rubella infection or vaccination [ [70](#B70-ijerph-16-03543)]. On the present hypothesis, infection-associated acute and chronic joint pain and arthritis are due not to the virus itself but to the redistribution of vitamin A compounds from the liver to the affected joints in toxic concentrations. [71](#B71-ijerph-16-03543)]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis, increased protein levels and a normal glucose level. Immunoglobulin (Ig)M antibodies against rubella virus were positive in the CSF and serum. IgG antibody became positive in his serum 3 weeks after admission. Encephalitis similar to that seen with measles occurs in about 1 in 6000 cases. The clinical features of progressive rubella panencephalitis (PRP) resemble those of measles-associated subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) but the age of onset of PRP is later and the clinical course is more benign. The main neurologic features are dementia, cerebellar ataxia, and seizures. Severity is highly variable, with a 20% mortality rate. Symptoms usually resolve within 1-3 weeks without neurologic sequelae. Increases in antirubella antibody titer and IgG are found in the CSF, associated with diffuse atrophy of the brain and ventricular dilatation [ [72](#B72-ijerph-16-03543)]. [64](#B64-ijerph-16-03543), [66](#B66-ijerph-16-03543)]. Reports have been published of patients on oral isotretinoin treatment for acne experiencing thrombotic episodes resulting in cerebral ischemia, facial and symptoms of chronic vitamin A poisoning are discussed below in connection with CRS. 8. Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) [31](#B31-ijerph-16-03543)]. Associated features may include encephalitis, mental retardation, pneumonia, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, metaphyseal defects, diabetes and thyroiditis [ [74](#B74-ijerph-16-03543)]. [75](#B75-ijerph-16-03543)]. Echocardiography showed mild aortic valve sclerosis in 68%. Prevalence rates of diabetes (22%), thyroid disorders (19%), early menopause (73%) and osteoporosis (12.5%) were also increased compared with the general Australian population, and 41% had undetectable levels of rubella antibodies. Frequencies of HLA-A1 (34%) antigens were increased, while the haplotype HLA-A1-B8-DR3, which is strongly associated with autoimmune disease, was present in 25%. 9. Pathology of CRS [76](#B76-ijerph-16-03543)], Webster noted the following [ [11](#B11-ijerph-16-03543)]: [77](#B77-ijerph-16-03543)]. [77](#B77-ijerph-16-03543)]. Explanations have focused on the presence and access of the virus to the different structures, and on the timing of viral infection. [78](#B78-ijerph-16-03543)]. Lazar et al. carried out immunohistochemical staining of selected tissues of CRS fatalities and found rubella virus in interstitial fibroblasts in the heart and in adventitial fibroblasts of large vessels as well as in macrophages and progenitor cells of the outer layer of the brain [ [79](#B79-ijerph-16-03543)]. 10. retinol, is a morphogen and a potent cause of numerous congenital defects, depending on the stage of gestation, dose and route of administration. Retinoic acid acts on the cell nucleus to change the pattern of gene activity by binding to specific ligand-activated retinoic acid receptors, which are members of the steroid-thyroid hormone-vitamin D superfamily. Retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDHs) are the enzymes responsible for catalyzing the synthesis of retinoic acid from retinal, and for determining the tissue specificity of retinoic acid synthesis. RALDH2 in particular is required for the spatial and temporal concentration gradients of retinoic acid needed for proper embryonic development [ [81](#B81-ijerph-16-03543)]. If consumed or administered early in pregnancy, retinoids can cause birth effects, fetal resorption and stillbirth in animals, and teratogenic sydromes in humans. Acute and chronic vitamin A supplementation of laboratory animals at therapeutic doses also impairs mitochondrial function in liver and brain, decreases brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels and dopamine D2 receptor levels, decreases glutamate uptake, and alters locomotor and exploratory activity [ [82](#B82-ijerph-16-03543), [83](#B83-ijerph-16-03543)]. Apoptosis has been suggested as the underlying and unifying mechanism of the adverse effects of retinoids in teratogenicity, depression, mucocutaneous side-effects, inflammatory bowel disease, myalgia, and release of transaminases due to liver injury. Genetic variants of components of the apoptotic signaling cascade may explain differences in susceptibility to the adverse effects of retinoids [ [84](#B84-ijerph-16-03543)]. [85](#B85-ijerph-16-03543), [86](#B86-ijerph-16-03543)]. [85](#B85-ijerph-16-03543), [87](#B87-ijerph-16-03543)]. In a report on 154 human pregnancies with fetal exposure to isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid)\u2014prescribed for severe nodular cystic acne but known to be teratogenic in laboratory animals\u2014the relative risk for a group of major malformations was 25.6 (95% CI: 11.4, 57.5). The outcomes were 96 elective abortions, 26 infants without major malformations, 12 spontaneous abortions, and 21 malformed infants. Among the latter there was a characteristic pattern of malformation involving craniofacial, cardiac, thymic, and central nervous system structures. The malformations included microtia/anotia (15 infants), micrognathia (6), cleft palate (3), conotruncal heart defects and aortic-arch abnormalities (8), thymic defects (7), retinal or optic-nerve abnormalities (4), and central nervous system malformations (18). The pattern of malformation closely resembled that produced in animal studies of teratogenesis induced by retinoids [ [88](#B88-ijerph-16-03543)]. [Table 2](#ijerph-16-03543-t002)). As noted, the main features of CRS are eye defects (e.g., cataract, microphthalmia, and retinopathy); bulging fontanelle and intrauterine growth restriction; seizures; and heart defects (including patent ductus arteriosus); psychomotor retardation, behavioral and speech disorders; bone lesions and osteoporosis; type 1 diabetes; thyroid disorders; and encephalitis. Each of these features has a counterpart in the effects of retinoid toxicity, as described below. [85](#B85-ijerph-16-03543), [87](#B87-ijerph-16-03543)]. Both prenatal and postnatal exposure to isotretinoin are known causes of retinopathy and optic-nerve abnormalities [ [88](#B88-ijerph-16-03543)]. Retinoic acid contributes to light-induced retinopathy in mice via mechanisms that may include plasma membrane permeability and mitochondrial poisoning, leading to caspase activation and mitochondria-associated cell death [ [94](#B94-ijerph-16-03543)]. Mutations involving a loss of retinol dehydrogenase (RDH12) have been linked to severe retinal dystrophy involving light-induced retinal apoptosis in cone and rod photoreceptors. RDH12 acts as a retinaldehyde reductase, shifting the retinoid balance toward increased levels of retinol and decreased levels of bioactive retinoic acid. This activity protects against retinaldehyde-induced cell death and correlates with lower levels of retinoic acid in RDH12-expressing cells. Disease-associated mutants of RDH12 are unable to control retinoic acid levels in photoreceptor cells. RDH12 thus acts as a regulator of retinoic acid biosynthesis, protecting photoreceptors against overproduction of retinoic acid all-trans-retinaldehyde [ [95](#B95-ijerph-16-03543)]. [91](#B91-ijerph-16-03543), [96](#B96-ijerph-16-03543)]. Abrupt arrest of embryonic growth is also a known effect of retinoic acid and a characteristic feature of hypervitaminosis A [ [57](#B57-ijerph-16-03543), [91](#B91-ijerph-16-03543), [97](#B97-ijerph-16-03543)]. Growth arrest has also been observed in rats fed retinoic acid [ [98](#B98-ijerph-16-03543)]. [99](#B99-ijerph-16-03543)]. Vitamin A supplementation or therapy using synthetic retinoids are also associated with seizures [ [100](#B100-ijerph-16-03543), [101](#B101-ijerph-16-03543)]. Interestingly, however, direct infusion of retinoic acid into the brain can reduce seizure activity. Noting that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays an important role in the induction and control of seizures, Sayyah et al. reported that in amygdala-stimulated rats, the effect of intra-BLA infusion of retinoic acid had a rapid anti-seizure effect [ [102](#B102-ijerph-16-03543)]. Intra-BLA infusion of retinoic acid also prevented the proconvulsant effect of trimethylamine, a drug known to enhance seizure susceptibility. The anti-seizure effect of exogenous retinoic acid may be due to feedback inhibition of retinoic acid synthesis, since brief isotretinoin treatment is known to lower serum retinol levels [ [103](#B103-ijerph-16-03543), [104](#B104-ijerph-16-03543)]. [105](#B105-ijerph-16-03543)]. However, sensorineural hearing loss is documented in many case reports as a complication of treatment with synthetic retinoids. For instance, an infant who had been exposed to 10 mg/day of acitretin, an aromatic retinoid analog of vitamin A, from the beginning of pregnancy until the 10th gestational week showed bilateral sensorineural deafness at term [ [106](#B106-ijerph-16-03543)]. Serious ear malformations or absent external ears and/or auditory canals in infants were reported in mothers consuming 25,000 IU or more of vitamin A per day during pregnancy or were exposed prenatally to isotretinoin. Such exposures interfere with cranial neural crest cells, which contribute to development of the ear [ [88](#B88-ijerph-16-03543), [107](#B107-ijerph-16-03543), [108](#B108-ijerph-16-03543)]. [88](#B88-ijerph-16-03543)]. Several studies have reported associations between high vitamin A dietary and/or supplement intakes and cardiac defects [ [89](#B89-ijerph-16-03543)]. The results have been somewhat inconsistent, possibly due to differences in methods of assessing exposure to vitamin A intake. Two studies have reported increased risks of congenital heart defects associated with supplement intakes greater than or equal to 10,000 IU retinol [ [109](#B109-ijerph-16-03543), [110](#B110-ijerph-16-03543)]. The use of isotretinoin in pregnancy has been specifically linked to patent ductus arteriosus [ [90](#B90-ijerph-16-03543)]. [106](#B106-ijerph-16-03543), [111](#B111-ijerph-16-03543), hydrocephalus, microphthalmia, and small, malformed, low-set, undifferentiated ears whose mothers had taken isotretinoin in the first trimester of pregnancy [ [113](#B113-ijerph-16-03543)]. A Dandy-Walker malformation (involving the cerebellum and fourth ventricle), hypertelorism, small ear canals, cleft palate, small mouth, and congenital heart disease were also observed. [106](#B106-ijerph-16-03543)]. The role of retinoic acid metabolism in normal brain development and in embryopathy has also been proposed to explain reported cases of Zika virus-associated microcephaly in [118](#B118-ijerph-16-03543), [119](#B119-ijerph-16-03543)]. Retinoid receptors are abundant in the brain structures involved in behavioral and cognitive functions, notably the striatum and hippocampus. In mice and rats, using maze running to assess memory functions, chronic exposure to a clinical dose (1 mg/kg/d) of 13-cis-RA suppressed hippocampal neurogenesis, disrupted hippocampal-dependent memory and impaired spatial learning [ [120](#B120-ijerph-16-03543), [121](#B121-ijerph-16-03543), [122](#B122-ijerph-16-03543)]. In rats, chronic oral treatment with isotretinoin resulted in enduring memory deficits at doses that induce blood levels comparable to those used to treat acne in humans [ [123](#B123-ijerph-16-03543)]. However, another study found that chronic 13-cis-RA treatment in male and female rats had little impact on measures of spatial learning and memory [ [124](#B124-ijerph-16-03543)]. These inconsistent results may be due to differences in age, species, dose and route of administration [ [118](#B118-ijerph-16-03543)], but many patients taking 13-cis-RA show signs of accumulation of perisinusoidal lipocytes, associated fibrosis, obstruction of sinusoids and terminal venules, sclerosis of central veins, atrophy of adjacent hepatocytes, and an increase in basement membrane-like material and collagen within the perisinusoidal space in association with lipid-filled Ito cells [ [127](#B127-ijerph-16-03543), [128](#B128-ijerph-16-03543)]. [75](#B75-ijerph-16-03543)], chronic and excessive vitamin A intake causes inhibition of bone growth, progressive ligament calcification, modeling abnormalities of long bones, metaphyseal irregularities and osteoporosis [ [60](#B60-ijerph-16-03543), [129](#B129-ijerph-16-03543)]. Bone pain, refusal to walk, and fatigue are well-documented symptoms of hypervitaminosis A [ [92](#B92-ijerph-16-03543), [130](#B130-ijerph-16-03543)]. [31](#B31-ijerph-16-03543)]. Indeed, are strongly implicated in diabetes [ [41](#B41-ijerph-16-03543), [93](#B93-ijerph-16-03543), [131](#B131-ijerph-16-03543)]. Here it is suggested that that exposure of the fetus and infant to toxic circulating concentrations of retinoids resulting from liver damage in turn damage the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, thereby increasing the risk of type 1 diabetes in early life. [132](#B132-ijerph-16-03543)]. Infection of thyroid tissue by rubella was demonstrated in a case of congenital rubella with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (hypothyroidism) [ [133](#B133-ijerph-16-03543)]. Thyroiditis encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by thyroid inflammation. Autoimmune thyroid disease includes Hashimoto's thyroiditis, characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and the presence of serum anti-thyroperoxidase antibody (TPOAb) and/or anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb). In the follow-up study of Gregg's original patients, 60 years after their intrauterine infection, the prevalence of thyroid disorders (and of diabetes and menopause) was higher in patients with congenital rubella than in the general population, yet 41% of the subjects had undetectable levels of rubella antibodies [ [75](#B75-ijerph-16-03543)]. Most reports have shown no evidence of active rubella infection at the time of thyroid dysfunction. The mechanisms suggested for thyroid dysfunction have included destruction of thyroid cells by local persistent rubella virus infection and/or precipitation of an autoimmune reaction [ [134](#B134-ijerph-16-03543)]. We have argued that drug-induced hepatocellular damage causes, firstly, a spillage of retinoids into the circulation (and hence a direct toxic effect on the brain and other target organs); and secondly, disruption of the liver-thyroid axis and hence a pattern of specific bipolar symptoms such as is often seen in thyroid disease [ [135](#B135-ijerph-16-03543)]. Rubella-induced hepatocellular damage may likewise disrupt the liver-thyroid axis, giving rise to the thyroid sequelae of rubella that have been commonly described in the literature. Consistent with the retinoid toxicity hypothesis, pharmacologic doses of vitamin A adversely affect multiple aspects of thyroid function, e.g., decreasing total T4 and T3 levels, possibly by increasing peripheral clearance of thyroxine, but without altering basal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) or its response to thyroid-releasing hormone. Vitamin A decreases tissue responsiveness to thyroid hormones and decreases thyroid gland size; it also modulates thyroid gland metabolism, peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormone and production of thyrotropin (TSH) by the pituitary [ [136](#B136-ijerph-16-03543)]. [137](#B137-ijerph-16-03543)]. [138](#B138-ijerph-16-03543)]. Second, vitamin A intoxication creates a syndrome that includes pseudotumor cerebri, psychosis, papilledema, and acute encephalitis [ [139](#B139-ijerph-16-03543), the related condition of measles encephalopathy, serum retinol concentrations are low and are assumed to indicate vitamin A deficiency. For instance, among 21 patients with newly diagnosed subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and 20 age-matched controls, serum was observed in 6 of the SSPE patients but in none of the controls (p < 0.05) [ [141](#B141-ijerph-16-03543)]. As noted, however, low serum vitamin A concentrations can imply a state of impaired hepatic mobilization and secretion of vitamin A, with the associated possibility of the entry of unbound retinyl esters and retinoic acids directly into the circulation, resulting in vitamin A toxicity. On this hypothesis, retinoids pass the blood-brain barrier and likewise induce the symptoms and signs of encephalopathy. 11. Preventing CRS [1](#B1-ijerph-16-03543)]. Some women, mainly those who were not vaccinated, will continue to acquire rubella infection in the first trimester of pregnancy, so their unborn fetus will be at risk of CRS. In many countries, this is an indication for elective abortion. For those who do not wish to take this step, the following simple measures\u2014proposed by us earlier in a different clinical context [ [135](#B135-ijerph-16-03543)]\u2014could be taken by the mother to reduce the expression of excess retinoids and hence lower the risk of fetal CRS. - stopping all alcohol for a period of at least 4 weeks; - stopping all liver-damaging drugs that are not essential to life (e.g., anabolic steroids, recreational drugs, antidepressants, anxiolytics and hypnotics); - maintaining good hydration by drinking plain, non-fluoridated water (and not through drinking coffee or tea, both of which are dehydrating); - eliminating vitamin A from the diet for one month (the main dietary source is liver, but vitamin A is also found in milk, cheese, egg yolks and fish oils); - (optional) reducing circulating retinoids, under medical supervision, through phlebotomy, plasmapheresis or hirudotherapy. 12. Retinoid Hypothesis of Regressive Autism [22](#B22-ijerph-16-03543)]. [142](#B142-ijerph-16-03543)], p. 1). On the other hand, from 30% to 40% or more children with ASD today have a regressive form of autism [ [143](#B143-ijerph-16-03543)] in which an initial phase of normal development is followed between ages 1 and 2 years by the loss of acquired language skills and speech, and withdrawal of interest in the social environment [ [144](#B144-ijerph-16-03543)]. [145](#B145-ijerph-16-03543), [146](#B146-ijerph-16-03543)], few vaccines or vaccine combinations or their ingredients have been subjected to randomized controlled trials, observational studies or other types of tests for long-term safety. The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is one of few vaccines studied to date in relation to autism [ [147](#B147-ijerph-16-03543), - The vaccination schedule has been expanded and accelerated during the same period of rapid increase in rates of autism and other chronic illnesses. The schedule now involves 69 doses of 16 vaccines between the day of birth and age 18, with 50 doses before age six [ [155](#B155-ijerph-16-03543)], which is over three times the number of vaccinations recommended in 1983 [ [156](#B156-ijerph-16-03543)]. The clinical outcomes of this expanded schedule on children's health, where many vaccinations are administered at the same time or in close succession, are virtually unknown [ [157](#B157-ijerph-16-03543)]. - Vaccines are known on occasion to cause severe adverse effects, including immune system disorders, brain damage and death [ [164](#B164-ijerph-16-03543)]. These outcomes are considered so rare that vaccines are believed safe to administer to all healthy infants and children [ [165](#B165-ijerph-16-03543), [166](#B166-ijerph-16-03543)]. However, the extent of serious injury from vaccines remains uncertain. One study of infants who were hospitalized or had died after receiving vaccinations, based on 38,801 reports to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), showed a linear relationship between the number of vaccine doses administered at one time and the rate of hospitalization and death; furthermore, the younger the infant at the time of vaccination, the higher was the rate of hospitalization and death. The rate of hospitalization for two vaccine doses was 11% and increased to 23.5% for eight doses (r2 = 0.91). The case fatality rate increased from 3.6% for 1-4 doses, increasing to 5.4% among those receiving 5-8 doses [ [167](#B167-ijerph-16-03543)]. [168](#B168-ijerph-16-03543)]. To address this gap in knowledge, the first author and colleagues collaborated with the National Home Education Research Institute, Salem, Oregon, to compare vaccinated and unvaccinated homeschooled children on a broad range of health outcomes based on mothers' anonymous reports [ [169](#B169-ijerph-16-03543)]. Four states were selected for the online survey: Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oregon. Mothers were asked to provide information on their 6- to 12-year-old biological children. The requested information included pregnancy-related conditions and exposures, birth history, vaccinations, physician-diagnosed illnesses, medications, and the use of health services. The survey yielded fully completed questionnaires on 666 children, among whom 261 (39%) were unvaccinated. As expected, the vaccinated were significantly less likely than the unvaccinated to have been diagnosed with chickenpox and whooping cough. However, the vaccinated were significantly more likely to have been diagnosed with the following conditions: allergic rhinitis (Odds Ratio (OR 4.2; 14.5); and a CI: 1.6, 17.4). [170](#B170-ijerph-16-03543)]. [171](#B171-ijerph-16-03543), [172](#B172-ijerph-16-03543)], could be contributing to increases in autism and related chronic diseases in children. Follow-up studies are urged to confirm or refute these findings. [173](#B173-ijerph-16-03543), [174](#B174-ijerph-16-03543)]. A recent study assessed metabolic disorders (obesity, diabetes, nonalcoholic and 48,762 individuals with ASD and 243,810 matched controls, identified through the Military Health System database [ [175](#B175-ijerph-16-03543)]. Children with ASD were significantly more likely than controls to be diagnosed with NAFLD/NASH (OR 2.74; 95% CI: 2.06, 3.65) OR 1.85; 95% CI: 1.78, 1.92), Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and tended to have more severe disease than controls. 13. Could Other Risk Factors Be Involved? [169](#B169-ijerph-16-03543), [170](#B170-ijerph-16-03543)], these factors do not fully explain the growing nationwide epidemic of ASD. The model presented here suggests that other factors may be contributing to autism and associated outcomes, similarly via liver dysfunction and/or hypervitaminosis A in infants and pregnant women. [176](#B176-ijerph-16-03543)]. The VAS group also had poorer weight gain and smaller lower arm circumference. A prospective birth cohort study in Japan showed that supplemental vitamin A intake prior to and/or during pregnancy was significantly associated with disturbed behavior at three years of age, after adjustment for numerous factors (age, number of deliveries, infertility treatment, consumption of fast food, smoking status, maternal and paternal education and income, gestational age at birth, infant's weight, height, head circumference and body circumference, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory at age three) [ [177](#B177-ijerph-16-03543)]. [178](#B178-ijerph-16-03543)], even though putative vitamin A deficiency is associated with increased mortality. Severe vitamin A deficiency is commonly defined as a serum retinol concentration <0.7 \u00b5mol/L [ [38](#B38-ijerph-16-03543), [179](#B179-ijerph-16-03543)]. However, as noted, a low serum retinol concentration does not necessarily indicate low overall vitamin A nutritional status; it may instead indicate vitamin A accumulation and toxicity in the liver due to impaired hepatic mobilization and secretion, and an overall state of vitamin A toxicity due to the spillage of unbound retinyl esters and retinoic acids into the circulation. [180](#B180-ijerph-16-03543)], ranging from increased intracranial pressure, bone demineralization and growth restriction, to mental retardation and death [ [181](#B181-ijerph-16-03543), [182](#B182-ijerph-16-03543)]. In a review of 21 studies evaluating the effect of vitamin A supplementation in community settings on all-cause mortality, 12 also reported cause-specific mortality for diarrhea and pneumonia and six reported measles-specific mortality. Combined results from six studies showed that neonatal vitamin A supplementation reduced all-cause mortality by 12% (Relative risk (RR) 0.88; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.98) but had no effect on reducing all-cause mortality in infants 1-6 months of age (RR 1.05; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.26). Pooled results showed that vitamin mortality by 0.88) in children 6-59 months of had no effect on measles (RR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.67, 1.30) [ [183](#B183-ijerph-16-03543)]. [184](#B184-ijerph-16-03543)]. A systematic review of the safety and efficacy of high-dose vitamin A supplementation for treating severe acute malnutrition also found, in mainly well-nourished children, that high-dose vitamin A supplementation was associated with respiratory infection, diarrhea and growth restriction [ [185](#B185-ijerph-16-03543)]. Interactions between vitamin A supplements and vaccines have also been reported in which the effects were harmful. For instance, children who received vitamin A with diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) vaccine were at greater risk of death than children who received vitamin A alone or received nothing [ [186](#B186-ijerph-16-03543)]. Given these data, a reassessment is warranted of the concept of vitamin A deficiency, the role of vitamin A in ophthalmic disorders and overall health, and the public practice of vitamin A supplementation. [187](#B187-ijerph-16-03543)]. Consistent with the present model, a survey of the parents of 861 children with autism and 123 control children found that use of infant formula versus exclusive breastfeeding was associated with a four-fold increase in the odds of autism when all cases were considered (OR 4.41; 95% CI: 1.24, 15.7). However, when the analysis was restricted to cases in whom regression had occurred during development, the odds of autism rose to 12.96 (95% CI: 1.27, 132.0) [ [188](#B188-ijerph-16-03543)]. [189](#B189-ijerph-16-03543)]. The suggestion that the Western diet itself could be contributing to the epidemic of childhood autism was supported by a study in which WD-treated female mice exhibited social avoidance, decreased body-body contacts, hyper-locomotion, and deficits in memory, compared to controls. Noting that the induced behaviors were reminiscent of the symptoms of autism, the authors suggested that the WD could exacerbate ASD [ [190](#B190-ijerph-16-03543)]. 14. Nutritional Implications of the Model [191](#B191-ijerph-16-03543)]. [192](#B192-ijerph-16-03543)]. However, some GFCF diets include vitamin A [ [187](#B187-ijerph-16-03543)]. It is therefore difficult to determine what aspect of the diet could be having a salutary effect; furthermore, sensitivity to gluten-containing foods could be a consequence rather than a cause of autism. Tests of the present hypothesis involving nutritional interventions should therefore focus on determining the impact of removing preformed vitamin A itself from experimental diets. [193](#B193-ijerph-16-03543)], involving 67 U.S. children and adults ages 3-58 years and 50 non-sibling neurotypical controls of similar age and gender, treatment began with a special vitamin/mineral supplement that included vitamin A. Later treatments included a GFCF diet added sequentially over a 12-month period. A significant improvement in nonverbal intellectual ability occurred in the treatment group as well as significant improvement in autism symptoms and developmental age. Results also showed a significant increase in serum vitamin A concentrations, suggesting improved liver function and vitamin A metabolism and thus the elimination of vitamin A toxicity. [194](#B194-ijerph-16-03543)]. Latherosterolosis, a rare metabolic disease associated with liver failure and autism, is attributed to a defect in cholesterol synthesis characterized by multiple congenital anomalies, mental retardation, and progressive liver disease. The case report is reminiscent of CRS and describes the only living patient with the condition. When diagnosed at age 2, she exhibited autistic behavior, was unable to walk without assistance, and her vision was impaired by cataracts. At age 7, she developed end-stage liver disease and received a liver transplant. Only one year later she was walking unaided, interacting with her caregivers, and her cholesterol synthesis was normal. By age 12, mental deterioration had ceased and she had a normal everyday life, albeit with limitations. While the authors speculated that her central nervous system had benefited from the normalization of cholesterol levels after liver transplantation, the present model suggests that the beneficial outcomes may have resulted from the normalization of vitamin A metabolism and function. In summary, just as measures taken by pregnant women infected with rubella virus to lower retinoid exposure and expression might lower the risk of fetal damage and CRS, a low vitamin A diet could be similarly beneficial for children with ASD. 15. Environmental Factors\u2014Herbicides [195](#B195-ijerph-16-03543)]. In one study, an offspring's risk of ASD with intellectual disability was increased following prenatal exposure to ambient glyphosate within 2000 m of their mother's residence during pregnancy, compared with the offspring of women from the same agricultural region without such exposure (OR 1.33; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.69) [ [196](#B196-ijerph-16-03543)]. It has been suggested that glyphosate, acting as a non-coding amino acid analogue of glycine, could be erroneously incorporated into protein synthesis in place of glycine, producing a defective product that resists proteolysis and leads to autism and other autoimmune diseases through the mechanism of molecular mimicry [ [197](#B197-ijerph-16-03543)]. [198](#B198-ijerph-16-03543)]. This evidence of teratogenicity and its impact on retinoic acid expression suggests that exposure to glyphosate could contribute to ASD via retinoid toxicity. 16. Discussion and Conclusions - The signs and symptoms of rubella may be due to virus-induced alterations in vitamin A metabolism and its accumulation in the liver, leading to mild hepatic inflammation and dysfunction and to the spillage of stored vitamin A compounds into the circulation in correspondingly low concentrations and hence mild toxicity. - RS and associated autism due to rubella infection in the early weeks of pregnancy may similarly result from maternal liver dysfunction and exposure of the fetus to excess endogenous vitamin A, resulting in embryopathy and long-term metabolic and neurodevelopmental disorders. - Increasing rates of regressive autism result primarily from post-natal factors to which almost all children are exposed, causing liver dysfunction and both acute and chronic forms of hypervitaminosis A. - These post-natal factors may include: multiple vaccinations and their ingredients administered together or in close succession, especially when combined with the physiological impact of preterm birth; the intake of high vitamin A-containing and vitamin A-fortified foods such as dairy products, infant formula, and vitamin A supplements; and exposure to certain ubiquitous herbicides that may influence retinoid metabolism. Further studies are awaited on the overall safety and health outcomes of the current vaccination schedule, with a view to optimizing the beneficial impact of vaccines on children's health. - An early diagnosis of ASD and CRS-like features in infants may be due to maternal exposures of a liver-damaging nature in the early weeks of pregnancy. - Young children with liver-related conditions that include preterm birth and metabolic disorders, as well as genetic factors associated with alterations in vitamin A metabolism, may be especially susceptible to autism and related neurodevelopmental disorders.
