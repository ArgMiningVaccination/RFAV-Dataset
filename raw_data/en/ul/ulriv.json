Do you regret eating spicy foods, tomatoes, coffee or chocolate? If so, then you may have a common problem called heartburn, or gastroesophageal reflux. Reflux happens when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) does not close properly or completely after swallowing, allowing acid from the stomach to reflux into the esophagus where it doesn't belong. This causes discomfort and irritation to the esophagus and the symptoms of heartburn. There are several reasons why heartburn may occur, including the counterintuitive reason of LOW stomach acid. Low stomach acid tends to occur with age, and also with stress to the digestive tract, especially with consumption of processed foods, foods that upset your stomach, and if you have food intolerances. The tone or tightness of the lower esophageal sphincter is triggered by the acid in your stomach. Normal stomach pH is between 1 and 4. If the pH rises, or becomes less acidic, then this sphincter does not have the stimulation it needs to function properly. Using antacids, or acid blocking medication, decreases the amount of stomach acid, which is helpful to reduce irritation to the esophagus. However, now you understand why this could lead to more reflux! Long term use of antacids is associated with health problems such as low B12, osteoporosis, and, more seriously, GI infections, such as SIBO or C. Diff. They may also affect your cardiovascular system by interfering with Nitrous oxide production. It is important to address the underlying cause of any condition, and so it is the case with reflux. Other causes of heartburn can be eating too quickly, stress, excess abdominal weight, maldigestion or other digestive issues. There is also evidence that up to 40% of reflux could be caused by candida (yeast, that also causes thrush) that is present in the esophagus! This is more likely if you have taken antibiotics multiple times, eat lots of sugar, or have struggled with other yeast issues. The esophageal yeast is accentuated by the antacids, as well, and is very difficult to diagnose. [What can you do to resolve reflux? First, and foremost, nutrition is the place to start. Adding more fiber found in vegetables and whole grains, and nutrient packed foods, like fruits and veggies, encourages healthy digestion. Second, \"meal hygiene\" is important and starts with chewing. Each bite of food should be chewed thoroughly, to a nearly liquid consistency, before swallowing. Eating more slowly also helps. It takes about 20 minutes for your brain to catch up to your stomach, so eating slowly, and chewing, well helps to avoid overeating and aggravating the stomach. Try to drink water between meals, and less during the meal, to avoid diluting stomach acid while eating. Digestive bitters, made from bitter tasting plants, help to stimulate the stomach and pancreas and tonify digestion.](https://yncnaturally.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/natural-heartburn-relief-during-pregnancy-f.jpg) Heartburn may be common, but that doesn't mean healthy or optimal. It doesn't have to cause lifelong discomfort and pain - it can be treated by improving the overall function of your gastrointestinal tract. And your whole body will benefit. Say goodbye to heartburn, Billings! Becoming Pain-Free by Dr. Shelah Deans, ND Are aches and pains keeping you from living your best life? Struggling with nagging, old injuries that still bother you? This article will be a brief discussion on the science behind pain followed by various strategies at becoming pain-free. Why does the body have pain and what is the purpose? To answer this, let's use the analogy of a car. When something is wrong with the engine, what happens? The check engine light goes on, which lets the driver know that engine should be checked in order to prevent damage. Snipping the wire for the check engine light will remove the annoyance of having the light on, but that could increase the risk of destroying the engine. A better option is to open the hood and run diagnostics to figure out what is happening with the engine then appropriately address the concern. Likewise, pain is your body's check engine light. When discussing musculoskeletal pain, several chemicals are released and are linked to the sensation of pain, such as: histamines, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and most notably, Substance P. These chemicals cause nerves to fire and alert the body of injury, sending continuous, unrelenting pain signals. Thus a reasonable strategy to reduce or relieve pain is to alter these chemicals, while simultaneously addressing the underlying reason pain signals are being sent in the first place. Since pain is complex and quite variable, there is no one-size-fits-all, so it's important to have the correct diagnostics run (just as one would for their vehicle). Assessing musculoskeletal pain involves an evaluation of the joints and consideration of system-wide contributing factors. Once the underlying cause is determined, one can begin the strategic and individualized approach to relieving pain. As for treatment, the options are seemingly endless and can include anything from vitamins to surgery. Here is a list of effective strategies for addressing pain: nutrition, exercise and corrective movements/physical therapy, and other physical modalities that are useful, such as: hydrotherapy, cold laser, infra-red light/laser, cranial sacral and visceral sound therapy, perineural injections, and regenerative injection therapy (prolotherapy, platelet rich plasma, stem cells and stem cell derived products). There are also supplements that aid in pain relief, which include vitamins and herbal medicine. And not to forget, homeopathy. So, as u can see, there are endless options. Not sure where to start? Wondering what's right for you? This is a vast topic, which can be discussed with your health care provider and naturopathic doctor. As always, wishing you joy on the journey and may you find the right path for you in becoming pain-free! Seasonal allergies: The cause and what to do about it We are amidst the time of year that seasonal allergies are ripe for blooming. Many people deal with this year after year with a barrage of symptoms, such as runny nose, watery eyes, sinus congestion, and generally not feeling well. What are seasonal allergies? Common sources of seasonal allergies are typically related to the growth of new plant life in the spring. Whether it be the pollen from that blossoming tree in your front yard, that wonderful aroma of freshly cut grass, the dust created from pulling weeds, or that bouquet of wildflowers from your secret admirer, the effects of allergies can be felt from a myriad of different triggers. When someone who is vulnerable comes in contact with the offending source, certain compounds bind to the immune protein called immunoglobulin E (IgE). IgE receptors are commonly found on mast cells, but are also found on other types of immune cells, such as basophils and eosinophils. When allergic compounds bind to IgE receptors, this activates the mast cells, and thus signals the release of inflammatory mediators from these cells, such as histamine. People with chronic allergies develop an increased number of IgE receptors, which equates to increased sensitivity to allergens, thus having a lower threshold at which inflammatory mediators are released. Mast cells can be thought of metaphorically in terms of a busy seaway with lots of sailboats sailing to and fro. The mast cells are the ships in this scenario, with their masts representing the IgE receptors. The ocean represents mucosal and epithelial cells, which are commonly found on the surface of our mouth, throat, respiratory, and digestive tracts- a common home for mast cells. When there is a lot of weather, birds, and other debris in the air, affecting the masts of these ships- the passage can be cumbersome and tumultuous- but is usually manageable. For the average ship there is no problem because they were built to handle the ocean life. Yet for the ships that have too many masts and debris on their bow or sterns, even the smallest wind can cause the ship to become topside, and thus spill its contents overboard. What can you do? In terms of this ship analogy, it's important to not only clean up the air and environment to avoid the things that will affect the sailing efficacy of the ship, but also to secure the ship in the event that there is some adverse weather that would otherwise causes its contents to spill overboard. In your life this would involve minimizing outdoor activity when pollen is high and striving to keep the inside of your house as clean as possible. Air filters are useful here. It is also helpful to minimize foods that have higher levels of histamine, such as yogurt, cheese, wine, beer, tuna, pork, and spinach. There are foods and herbs that can be helpful to stabilize the ship in stormy weather by down-regulating masts cells. Examples include nettles, watercress, turmeric, chamomile, Brazil nuts, and apples- think of these as the cargo on the ship. So next time you feel some allergy symptoms coming on try a cup of chamomile and nettle tea, spiced with some turmeric. There are other options to reduce the mast cell effect and the severity of your reactions. These are best individualized according to your personal health history and general health. Some effective natural options include mast cell stabilizing substances such as Cromolyn sodium, quercitrin and homeopathic drops for seasonal pollens, trees, grasses, dust and grasses. Don't suffer needlessly through the beautiful spring. There are more solutions to keep your ship sailing comfortably than you may know. Dark Cocoa for Heart Month What do you think of when you hear \"chocolate\" or \"cocoa\"? Smooth? Decadent? Rich? What about \"bitter\"? Cocoa was first developed as a crop in many ancient South American cultures, the most well-known being the Aztecs and Mayans. There is evidence of cocoa-based food dating back several thousand years, and it is estimated that chocolate consumption reached 7.7 million metric tons in 2019! Chocolate comes from the seeds of the fruit of a small evergreen tree called Theobroma cacao. Theobroma means 'food of the gods' in Latin, and cacao is derived from the Nahuatl (Aztec language) word xocolatl, from xococ (bitter) and atl (water). This name makes sense, because the seeds of the cacao tree are extremely bitter and must be fermented to develop flavor. Once fermented, the beans are dried and roasted. The shell is used to make cacao nibs, which are then ground to make cocoa mass. Nibs contain both nonfat cocoa solids and cocoa butter - this is what is referred to as \"percent cacao\" on food packaging. Chocolate liquor is the paste made from liquefying the cocoa mass/nibs. The liquor can then be processed into cocoa solids (non-fat, powder) and cocoa butter (oil from the cocoa bean). Solid chocolate has been known around the world since the mid-1800s and is made by adding some cocoa butter to the powder. The presence of cocoa butter and powder along with the addition of sugar or condensed milk determines if the chocolate is dark, milk or white. Dark chocolate is known for being bitter, and that is because it is less processed and therefore maintains more of its original flavors. Due to processing and addition of sugars into our food chain, most of us are not too acquainted with this flavor. Bitter is like a lost art, important in many cultures and comes with plenty of health benefits. Bitterness stimulates our digestive system, to produce and balance our stomach acid and digestive enzymes. Wouldn't it be great if we became more familiar with this flavor? The bitterness of cocoa is due to \"poly-phenols,\" which are plant compounds that act as antioxidants, and include flavonoids - these flavonoids are responsible for the bitter flavor. Most of the bitterness is processed out, yet you can appreciate this favor in the darkest of dark chocolate such as 90% cocoa. Don't despair - there are processing techniques and several Fair-Trade brands ensure that dark cacoa is smooth and decadent as well. Other than flavonoids, chocolate also contains fatty acids, minerals, and fiber. The trouble is, we typically consume milk chocolate which contains less of the raw goods. Some companies even use \"chocolate flavoring\" to cut down on production costs, and while it may taste similar, the health benefits of these make-believe chocolates are absent. The minerals in cocoa beans include magnesium, copper and iron. Magnesium is a cofactor in protein synthesis, muscle relaxation, heart function, and energy production. Copper is required by the body for processes like glucose (sugar) metabolism, brain development and iron transport. Iron is needed to transfer oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Per 100 grams of 70-85% dark chocolate, it provides 228mg of magnesium, 1.76mg of copper, and 11.9mg of iron. The bran of the cocoa bean is also high in fiber, nearly 2 grams per tablespoon, and consuming it has been shown to improve cholesterol. Bitterness can be so sweet after all! February is American Heart Month and Valentine's Day. Wouldn't it be great to bring back health with a bit of dark chocolate? Cryotherapy - Cool Trend or Real Science? Wondering how to get an edge in athletic performance? Or perhaps, life in general? This article will be a brief introduction to Cyrotherapy and a discussion of recent research, followed by a few practical tips on incorporating cold therapy should one choose to do so. So, what exactly is Cryotherapy? The word \"cryo-\" comes from the Greek, meaning cold or icy, whereas, the word \"therapy\" simply refers to a medical treatment. Thus, cryotherapy is the use of very low temperatures as a form of medical treatment. Cyrotherapy can be used locally, as an ice pack on a recent injury or when liquid nitrogen is used to remove a wart, and it can be used on the whole body, such as when an athlete immerses into a freezing ice bath after a strenuous training session. Now at this point, one might be wondering, \"Why in the world would someone dunk themselves into a freezing ice bath?\" This is a very valid question, which leads to a little dive into understanding how cold impacts the human body and the respective research. Cold can influence the body in many ways. The best way to understand this is to consider how all the hormones and biochemical processes going on continually within the body are simply responses to signals from the immediate environment. For example, a walk in the desert at mid-day when temperatures are over 110 degrees Fahrenheit will likely cause a person to sweat. This is the body realizing it is hot out, and in order to keep from overheating, sweat is created to cool down. Sweating is a way of transferring heat away from the body (via evaporation and convection). Likewise, when the body senses a dramatic drop in temperature, it sends a signal to the brain, which in turn, tells muscles to start shivering. Shivering creates heat and keeps the vital organs warm. This is only one of the many mechanisms the body does in response to cold. Let's look at the research to see what other things the body is capable at doing in response to freezing temperatures. A recent literature review1 of using whole-body cryotherapy (WBC) on athletes revealed the following: Whole body cryotherapy mobilizes white blood cells leading to overall reduced delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS). There are temporary changes in blood chemistry (hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, erythropoietin), which all except erythropoietin, return back to baseline after 20 sessions of one 3-minute session per day. Erythropoietin remained elevated by 10.1% even after 30 sessions. WBC did not affect the resting metabolic rate and energy expenditure during exercise, but did have benefits on blood lipids (decreased triglycerides, LDL, total cholesterol; increased HDL). Lipid profile improvements were seen after 10-20 sessions of WBC. WBC helps to counteract the inflammation-induced bone resorption in endurance athletes by increasing osteoprotegerin. WBC reduces inflamation by influencing the immune system (increased IL-6, IL-10, IL-1Ra; reduced IL-1b, IL-1a). Results were mixed though, depending on fitness capacity. WBC exposure induces an oxidative stress but does not decrease the antioxidant capacity. WBC can have a positive effect on hormones (decreased cortisol, DHEA, estradiol; increased testosterone), albeit results varied among athlete groups. WBC may improve muscular tiredness, pain, and well-being after strenuous exercise. Practical tips for incorporating whole-body cryotherapy: Check with your physician FIRST to make sure it is safe for you. Some medical conditions are a contraindication to cryotherapy. Learn about different types of cryotherapy offered in your area and choose a method that is carefully supervised. Determine your goal for using cryotherapy and when/how to best apply it in order to achieve those goals (pre-workout, post-workout, in morning or evening, and so on). Carefully cover sensitive areas to protect from injury due to freezing temperatures (ears, face, genitalia, hands, feet, etc). CAUTION when using liquid nitrogen chambers/saunas. Typically, liquid nitrogen is heavy and will stay close to the ground, but nonetheless, you will want to make sure you avoid breathing it. Wearing a surgical mask or mouth covering is also recommended to prevent moisture escaping from the mouth, leading to injury. Allow for adaptation time. Consider starting with short time periods (30sec-1min) and work up to longer times (2-3min), depending on the type of cryotherapy. Focus on breathing and mindset. Know that cold is a stressor to the body and focusing on breathing can help to overcome the stress. Box-breathing is a simple, yet effective strategy to reduce stress (inhale for 3 seconds, hold breath for 3 seconds, exhale for 3 seconds, then hold breath for 3 seconds - this completes 1 box. Repeat 3-5 times). Until next time, stay safe and enjoy the cool benefits of cryotherapy! 1Lombardi G, Ziemann E, Banfi G. Whole-Body Cryotherapy in Athletes: From Therapy to Stimulation.

New Technology Could Help Identify Fatty Liver Sooner According to the American Liver Foundation, approximately 25% of the US population meets the criteria for a spectrum of conditions called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This spectrum ranges from benign deposition of fat in the liver to fibrosis (scarring) and cirrhosis (irreversible damage). Of the more than 100 million Americans who have NAFLD, approximately 80% have benign fatty liver and will not progress to the more serious stages of the disease. It is important to identify those who are at risk of progressing to the more serious stages of NAFLD, so an appropriate treatment course can be determined. Fat deposition in the liver is multifactorial. One major factor is the body having too much fuel, in the form of sugars. These sugars are packaged in the form of fatty molecules called triglycerides and deposited in the liver tissue. As the condition progresses, the fatty deposition is accompanied by significant inflammation and insulin resistance, which is a hallmark of metabolic disease. The major risk factors for developing NAFLD are obesity, type two diabetes, unmanaged celiac disease, insulin resistance, and elevated lipids. Other potential contributors are an imbalance in the gut microbiome and rapid weight loss. The most common cause of death in those with NAFLD is cardiovascular disease. This is not surprising, given the increased spilling of lipids into the blood and the presence of significant inflammation, which causes damage to the blood vessels. The progression of NAFLD from fatty deposition to fibrosis, or scarring, is reversible, to a point. Making lifestyle changes like limiting added sugars and refined flours, increasing antioxidants in the diet through a variety of plant foods, and developing a regular exercise routine are some of the most important first steps. As imbalance in the gut microflora has been linked to NAFLD, maintaining healthy digestion and a vibrant microbiome is another target for treatment. Initiating treatments to prevent or manage diabetes or other underlying health conditions as early as possible may help prevent future complications from this disease. Though it is increasingly common, NAFLD can be difficult to diagnose because a person can be symptom free for many years. In some instances, lab values may be abnormal, but the \"gold standard\" for diagnosing and evaluating NAFLD is a liver biopsy. As one might imagine, this procedure is invasive and expensive. MRI and ultrasound are also used but each has its own limitations in terms of cost and accuracy. A newer type of ultrasound, called the FibroScan utilizes a technology called transient elastography. FibroScan is being used more commonly due to its ability to accurately measure fat in the liver and determine the degree of fibrosis. This is hugely important, as it is the best technology for identifying if a person simply has fatty deposition, or if he or she has a progressed stage of NAFLD and needs more aggressive treatment. The FibroScan takes a small amount of time, is noninvasive, and is very affordable. NAFLD affects one in four Americans and the rates are increasing. Utilizing this minimally invasive and inexpensive technology, the FibroScan, is crucial for early diagnosis and management of this wide-reaching condition. Naturopathic Medicine: Keys for Successful Digestion by Jennifer Krieger, ND Many of my patients report that they struggle with heartburn and indigestion. With new research focusing on the adverse effects of chronic proton pump inhibitor use, patients may wish to learn that there are other ways to help promote proper digestion without the lifelong use of a medication. The following are guidelines that support proper food hygiene. Environment It may seem obvious, but where and how we eat our meals plays a key role in how we digest our food. In an idyllic setting, one would enjoy a meal in calm and relaxed environment free of distractions. A few suggestions are: - Eat at a dining table without the television on! - Avoid eating on the run or in your car. - Sit upright - do not lie down while eating. - Play calm and relaxing music during mealtimes. - Enjoy an evening dinner on the patio as weather permits. - After eating, allow yourself to relax and avoid stressful and strenuous activities for about 30 minutes to promote your parasympathetic nervous system (this is the nervous system that helps you \"rest and digest\"). - Allow at least two hours before lying down to go to sleep. Prepping the Stomach Believe it or not, indigestion is often the result when there is too little stomach acid. Stomach acid is crucial in helping us break down our food in order to prepare and absorb nutrients. Most patients are shocked to learn that drinking water with their meals can actually be promoting indigestion. Water dilutes the stomach acid secreted as we eat, so as a rule of thumb, try to avoid drinking any water with meals and for one to two hours after eating, depending on the type and quantity of the meal. Small amounts of water taken to swallow medications or supplements are fine. If you are drinking sufficient amounts of water between or before meals you will not be exceptionally thirsty. Bitter herbs or apple cider vinegar can be used to prep the stomach for a meal. Tinctures of bitter herbs are preferred over apple cider vinegar because they stimulate the digestive tract and help you to make your own stomach acid, whereas apple cider vinegar acts as a substitute for stomach acid. If you choose to use herbal bitters or apple cider vinegar, sip a small amount in water 10-15 minutes before mealtime. Sipping water with lemon throughout the day also gently promotes mild stomach acid production. The Art of Eating Itself Does it surprise you to learn that digestion actually begins in the mouth? Our saliva is essential in supplying us with enzymes to help break down certain foods, and this is another reason to avoid drinking water with meals. Many people use water as a substitute for saliva and are missing out on the vital function that the salivary enzymes supply to digest starches prior to reaching the stomach. In addition, bite-sized portions are optimal - eating too much per forkful promotes indigestion and causes your stomach to work harder to break down large pieces of food. And listen up! The most valuable information of all is that it is best to chew each bite of food 31 times! That's right. You read that correctly, 31 times! With 31 chews, each bite of food is properly broken down and prepared for further digestion by the pancreatic enzymes in the small intestine. You will also tend to eat slower, which fills you up faster and helps to sate your appetite. As you can see, there are many tips and tricks to promote healthy digestion. Give a few a try and say goodbye to indigestion. Bon app\u00e9tit, Billings! Improving your Fertility Naturally by Dr. Audrey Schenewerk Nine months of pregnancy can be challenging for some and for others the greatest challenge is becoming pregnant at all. Fertility is becoming more of a concern, and many factors can contribute to your ability to become pregnant. Women and men can each contribute 40% to the overall cause of infertility, while the remaining 20% of infertility has unknown origin or is multifaceted. Common causes of infertility include: - Women: irregular menstrual cycles or amenorrhea, anatomical abnormalities, hypothyroidism, or poor egg quality - Men: poor sperm movement, quality, or low sperm count There are many things to consider when planning a pregnancy. Most important is identifying if and when the woman is ovulating. This is the time when an egg is released from the ovary and descends through the fallopian tube towards the uterus. Ovulation is the only time when sperm may fertilize an egg. There are several different ways to track ovulation. Your licensed healthcare provider can help you decide which is best for you. For Women\u2014 soon your body will provide all the resources needed to support the life and development of another human. However, optimizing your health prior to conception can greatly impact the quality of your pregnancy, both your own health and the health of your growing baby. Three or four months before conception is the optimal time to begin preconception care. It is best that both the male and female partner begin to make diet and lifestyle changes. This window of time is ideal for healthy maturation of egg and sperm. What can be done to optimize health? - Eat a diet low in processed foods and sugar, high in whole foods such as vegetables, fruits, grass-fed beef, wild fish and game, healthy fats, and whole grains - Decrease exposure to toxins, including drinking filtered water, eating organic foods, removing sources of heavy metals from your life, avoiding BPA and parabens, smoking cessation, physician directed medication adjustment, minimize alcohol and caffeine - Initiate a sustainable exercise program that includes at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly, and 300 minutes if either partner need to lose weight, including strength, cardio and stretching routines - Establish stress reduction practices such as meditation, yoga, counseling, tai chi, mindfulness practices, mindbody interventions, acupuncture, massage - Consider supplementation for both female and males including multi-vitamin or pre-natal, Omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidant support These recommendations will significantly benefit anyone preparing for natural pregnancy as well as those utilizing conventional fertility treatments including intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization. If you need additional support with conception seeking the help of a licensed health professional is beneficial. As naturopathic physicians we treat the whole person, supporting both the female and male's body in performing the natural function of conception. We help regulate the menstrual cycle and enhance sperm motility and seek to remove other obstacles to optimize conception. Additional support may include: - Determining the cause of infertility - Regulating hormones and menstrual cycles - Specific nutrient and botanicals for sperm health including zinc and selenium - Treating hypothyroidism - Providing anti-oxidant support - Decreasing inflammation - Optimizing the microbiome with probiotics and gut healing - Detoxification support Individualized recommendations can be found by consulting with a health care provider educated in prenatal health and nutrition. Everything you do to improve your health prior to conception ultimately improves the health of your fetus and then newborn, giving them a great start in life. NeurOptimal by Patricia Holl Do you have trouble sleeping at night? Are you having difficulty focusing at work or on responsibilities at home? Is anxiety interfering with your life? Has it become almost impossible to relax? If so, you're not alone. Every activity we do throughout the day demands a certain degree of consciousness and awareness. Our brain, the 'administrator' of these activities, requires an enormous amount of flexibility to manage and multi-task these everyday endeavors, as well as the ability to efficiently transition from one event to the next. When stress, anxiety or emotional distress occurs, the agitation and alarm we experience can start to overwhelm us. NeurOptimal is a cutting edge neurofeedback system designed to train the brain to enhance your wellbeing and unlock cognitive potential. This technology monitors brainwaves through a process known as entrainment, which refers to our brain's 'electrical response to rhythmic sensory stimulation, such as pulses of sound or light.' A rhythmic stimulus, such as pulses of sound, can begin to productively alter our brainwave patterns, synchronizing our electric cycles and guiding us to useful and constructive mental states. Brain health is important throughout our lives, but becomes particularly critical as we age when degenerative changes can adversely affect our brains. Memory loss, insomnia, anxiety and even the physical challenges of chronic pain are all brain-based conditions. As Dr Datis Kharazian, author of 'Why Isn't My Brain Working' points out, 'the functions of posture and balance, muscle tone, spinal stability, pain perception and athletic performance are all related to 'brain function'. These functions are specific to pathways in the brain and when they are not working, patients suffer from dizziness, chronic pain, spinal instability, abnormal muscle tone/tightness, etc.' NeurOptimal training provides individuals with coping mechanisms to deal with the challenges of everyday life, as well as strengthens and conditions our brains to decelerate the detrimental effects of brain aging and decline. By focusing on the central nervous system, NeurOptimal monitors brainwaves and alerts the brain when it isn't functioning optimally. As the brain adjusts to this training, it reorganizes itself and improves function by becoming more elastic and resilient. This can improve our nervous system's ability to recover from adverse conditions, such as anxiety, insomnia and depression. Rather than suffering from the deleterious effects of long term trauma or loss, a flexible and durable brain can return to a healthy baseline and resume a happier and more peaceful way of life. Remember that your brain is living tissue, and can be affected by stress, insomnia, depression and any of the myriad influences experienced in daily life. And, as living tissue, it can reorganize, rebuild and recover. So, if you think your brain could use a workout, NeurOptimal is an excellent option. A stronger brain, "}
