Medicine and [surgery](https://www.britannica.com/science/surgery-medicine) before 1800 [Early](https://www.britannica.com/topic/primitive-culture) medicine and folklore Unwritten history is not easy to interpret, and, although much may be learned from a study of the drawings, bony remains, and surgical tools of early humans, it is difficult to reconstruct their mental attitude toward the problems of disease and death. It seems probable that, as soon as they reached the stage of reasoning, they discovered by the process of trial and error which [plants](https://www.britannica.com/plant/plant) might be used as foods, which of them were poisonous, and which of them had some medicinal [value](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/value). [Folk medicine](https://www.britannica.com/science/folk-medicine) or domestic medicine, consisting largely in the use of vegetable products, or [herbs](https://www.britannica.com/plant/herb-culinary-and-medicinal-plant), originated in this fashion and still persists. But that is not the whole story. Humans did not at first regard death and disease as natural phenomena. Common maladies, such as colds or [constipation](https://www.britannica.com/science/constipation), were accepted as part of existence and dealt with by means of such herbal remedies as were available. Serious and disabling diseases, however, were placed in a very different category. These were of [supernatural origin](https://www.britannica.com/topic/indigenous-religion). They might be the result of a spell cast upon the victim by some enemy, visitation by a [malevolent](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/malevolent) demon, or the work of an offended [god](https://www.britannica.com/topic/supernaturalism) who had either projected some object\u2014a dart, a stone, a worm\u2014into the body of the victim or had abstracted something, usually the [soul](https://www.britannica.com/topic/soul-religion-and-philosophy) of the patient. The treatment then applied was to lure the errant soul back to its proper habitat within the body or to extract the evil intruder, be it dart or demon, by counterspells, incantations, potions, suction, or other means. One curious method of providing the disease with means of escape from the body was by making a hole, 2.5 to 5 cm across, in the skull of the victim\u2014the practice of trepanning, or trephining. Trepanned skulls of prehistoric date have been found in Britain, France, and other parts of Europe and in Peru. Many of them show evidence of healing and, presumably, of the patient's survival. The practice still exists among some tribal people in parts of Algeria, in Melanesia, and perhaps elsewhere, though it is fast becoming extinct. [ Britannica Quiz Is There a Doctor in the House? Firsts in Medicine Quiz ](/quiz/is-there-a-doctor-in-the-house-firsts-in-medicine-quiz) [Magic](https://www.britannica.com/topic/magic-supernatural-phenomenon) and [religion](https://www.britannica.com/topic/religion) played a large part in the medicine of prehistoric or early human society. Administration of a vegetable [drug](https://www.britannica.com/science/drug-chemical-agent) or remedy by mouth was accompanied by incantations, dancing, [grimaces](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/grimaces), and all the tricks of the magician. Therefore, the first doctors, or \"medicine men,\" were [witch doctors](https://www.britannica.com/topic/witch-doctor) or sorcerers. The use of charms and talismans, still prevalent in modern times, is of ancient origin. Apart from the treatment of wounds and broken [bones](https://www.britannica.com/science/bone-anatomy), the folklore of medicine is probably the most ancient aspect of the art of healing, for primitive physicians showed their wisdom by treating the whole person, soul as well as body. Treatments and medicines that produced no physical effects on the body could nevertheless make a patient feel better when both healer and patient believed in their [efficacy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/efficacy). This so-called [placebo effect](https://www.britannica.com/science/placebo-effect) is applicable even in modern clinical medicine. The ancient Middle East and Egypt The establishment of the [calendar](https://www.britannica.com/science/calendar) and the invention of writing marked the dawn of recorded history. The clues to early knowledge are few, consisting only of clay tablets bearing [cuneiform](https://www.britannica.com/topic/cuneiform) signs and seals that were used by physicians of ancient [Mesopotamia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mesopotamia-historical-region-Asia). In the [Louvre Museum](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Louvre-Museum) in France, a stone pillar is preserved on which is [inscribed](https://www.britannica.com/topic/inscription) the [Code of Hammurabi](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Code-of-Hammurabi), who was a [Babylonian](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babylonia) king of the 18th century bce. This code includes laws relating to the practice of medicine, and the penalties for failure were severe. For example, \"If the doctor, in opening an abscess, shall kill the patient, his hands shall be cut off\"; if, however, the patient was a slave, the doctor was simply [obliged](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/obliged) to supply another slave. Greek historian [Herodotus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Herodotus-Greek-historian) stated that every Babylonian was an amateur physician, since it was the custom to lay the sick in the street so that anyone passing by might offer advice. [Divination](https://www.britannica.com/topic/divination), from the inspection of the [liver ](https://www.britannica.com/science/liver)of a sacrificed animal, was widely practiced to foretell the course of a disease. Little else is known regarding Babylonian medicine, and the name of not a single physician has survived. When the medicine of [ancient Egypt](https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Egypt) is examined, the picture becomes clearer. The first physician to emerge is [Imhotep](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Imhotep), chief minister to King Djoser in the 3rd millennium bce, who designed one of the earliest [pyramids](https://www.britannica.com/technology/pyramid-architecture), the Step Pyramid at aqqrah, and who was later regarded as the Egyptian god of medicine and identified with the Greek god [Asclepius](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Asclepius). Surer knowledge comes from the study of Egyptian papyri, especially the [Ebers papyrus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ebers-papyrus) and [Edwin Smith papyrus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Edwin-Smith-papyrus) discovered in the 19th century. The former is a list of remedies, with appropriate spells or incantations, while the latter is a surgical [treatise](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/treatise) on the treatment of wounds and other injuries. Contrary to what might be expected, the widespread practice of embalming the dead body did not stimulate study of human [anatomy](https://www.britannica.com/science/anatomy). The preservation of mummies has, however, revealed some of the diseases suffered at that time, including [arthritis](https://www.britannica.com/science/arthritis), tuberculosis of the bone, [gout](https://www.britannica.com/science/gout), [tooth decay](https://www.britannica.com/science/caries), bladder stones, and [gallstones](https://www.britannica.com/science/gallstone); there is evidence too of the [parasitic disease](https://www.britannica.com/science/parasitic-disease) [schistosomiasis](https://www.britannica.com/science/schistosomiasis), which remains a scourge still. There seems to have been no [syphilis](https://www.britannica.com/science/syphilis) or [rickets](https://www.britannica.com/science/rickets). The search for information on ancient medicine leads naturally from the papyri of Egypt to [Hebrew](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hebrew) literature. Though the [Bible](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bible) contains little on the medical practices of ancient Israel, it is a mine of information on social and personal [hygiene](https://www.britannica.com/science/hygiene). The Jews were indeed pioneers in matters "}
