Like healthcare institutions across the country, we faced new and significant challenges this year brought on by the pandemic. But our group of committed and compassionate caregivers worked to maintain a sense of normalcy while adopting new practices to maintain patient and staff safety. We have focused on minimizing risk of exposure for patients and staff while still offering essential care to improve patient outcomes. We continue to leverage our strengths with our advanced molecular pathology and diagnostics laboratory capabilities, and we're developing a comprehensive immunotherapy program to ensure that our patients benefit from the latest technology and sophisticated treatment options. As NorthShore has become a national leader in the integration of complex genomic information into clinical care, we're now establishing a groundbreaking program to incorporate the latest in genomic testing and science for our advanced cancer patients. The Kellogg Cancer Genomic Initiative reflects our commitment to personalized medicine and superior care. Our academic affiliation with the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine enables us to help train the next generation of physician leaders and brings benefits to patients through shared clinical and research initiatives.

Winchester For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer or call (847) 570-21121DDelivering lifesaving cancer care in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic required important adaptations and flexibility for the entire Kellogg Cancer Center team. New workflows and practices were quickly put in place to limit exposure and protect both patients and staff. Patients were screened with calls before visits to the Kellogg Cancer Center, and clinical spaces were decompressed with some staff working from home and empty exam rooms used for staff nurses and treatment. A no-visitor policy was implemented\u2014and while initially very difficult for patients, it was ultimately well received as patients and families understood the importance of protecting their safety and limiting exposure to the virus. Patients were individually assessed to determine the need for ongoing/immediate treatment versus the risks associated with potential exposure in a clinic visit as well as the risk of chemotherapy or radiation treatment for patients with COVID-19. When possible, physician visits were conducted via telehealth and video calls with expanded virtual education efforts from the K ellogg Cancer Center nursing team. Video visits also enabled family members to be \"present\" and involved in their loved one's care. An education video was developed to help patients safely disconnect infusion pumps at home, and many other services\u2014including simple injections and prescription pick-ups\u2014were offered as a drive-thru option. Blood draws and lab work were done the day before treat - ment to minimize wait time at the cancer center. Bolstering staff resilience was another important element of care during the pandemic. Regular staff well-being check-ins were initiated, and stress management techniques were offered by licensed clinical social workers. \"Breathe\" sessions became part of staff meetings, and Kellogg Cancer Center leadership and many grateful patients and families provided countless lunches and healthy snacks for physicians, nurses and the entire Kellogg Cancer Center team. Elective operations and many cancer screening procedures were put on hold or canceled, creating another major challenge for oncology caregivers and patients. Various algorithms were used to weigh the risk of treatment with delaying treatment for individual patients. To optimize the care of patients when operations had to be delayed, hormone therapy or sometimes chemotherapy was used to bridge the gap until surgery could be safely performed. Cancer Care During a Pandemic Just hours after the governor announced the stay-at-home order in March, Dr. Brockstein pulled together a coalition of Chicago-area leaders in cancer care to meet virtually and brainstorm best practices to keep patients and staff safe while also optimizing cancer-related outcomes. The \"C5\" (Chicago Cancer Center COVID-19 Coalition) met through tele- or videoconference on Sunday mornings\u2014and when necessary, by email. They continue to communicate collaboratively sharing important advances, data and advice to best serve patients in the One of the most important initiatives was developed by Kellogg Cancer Center Medical Director Bruce Brockstein, MD.While ongoing research and COVID-19-related studies were a challenge, most clinical trials and studies continued throughout the pandemic, with the emphasis on therapeutic interventions that show the greatest promise for patients. As the Kellogg Cancer Center multidisciplinary team continues to rise to the many challenges associated with COVID-19, some of the new COVID-initiated processes are now being implemented long term, leveraging the learning from the pandemic. Collectively, the Kellogg Cancer Center team learned how to implement and adapt novel processes efficiently and effectively, remaining dedicated to patient safety and best outcomes. Metropolitan Chicago area. C5 participants are from large academic medical centers and large hospital based community practices, including Advocate Aurora Health, Edwards-Elmhurst Health, Loyola University Medical Center, Northwestern Medicine, Rush University Medical Center, The University of Chicago Medicine and The University of Illinois joined NorthShore in C5. The spirit of collaboration was celebrated by Dr. Brockstein and his colleagues who continue to use the group resource as the pandemic persists.Medical Oncology continues to see 85% of cancer patients in person and is operating at 95% of pre-COVID capacity, with extra safety precautions in place.

Immunotherapy drugs harness the power of the body's own immune system to identify and eradicate cancer cells. While expert physicians at NorthShore have leveraged the power of immunotherapy for nearly a decade, the Kellogg Cancer Center is establishing a premier immunotherapy program ensuring maximum benefits for our patients in this rapidly evolving sphere.Novel testing and sophisticated programs like our Pharmacogenomics Clinic and Genomic Health Initiative (GHI) have helped establish NorthShore as a leader in the integration of complex genomic information into ongoing clinical care. In collaboration with the Neaman Center for Personalized Medicine, Kellogg Cancer Center is now developing a gr oundbreaking program to incorporate the latest in genomic testing for patients diagnosed with cancer. The Kellogg Cancer Genomic Initiative (KCGI) uses next-generation sequencing to characterize tumor mutations for each new Kellogg patient with advanced or metastatic cancers where tumor genomics may help determine the best course of therapy. This advanced genetic testing of tumors identifies precise markers for more targeted therapies. The genomic data is used to both refine diagnoses and Kellogg Cancer Genomic Initiative Harnessing the Power of Immunotherapyidentify molecular targets for specific treatments. At the same time, pharmacogenomic assessment for new cancer patients contributes to a more advanced understanding of the appropriate therapeutic drugs and doses for each individual patient. An initial pilot study of 500 Kellogg Cancer Center patients representing multiple tumor and disease types will begin in 2021, as COVID-19 delayed its planned start in 2020. Data from this critical study will be used to fully integrate genomics into a new routine standard of care for cancer patients. Additional outcomes research projects, expanded testing and more complete analysis of liquid biopsy testing for patients whose metastases cannot be biopsied ar e all part of KCGI future initiatives. Immunotherapy has had a positive impact on a growing majority of cancers including lung, melanoma, head and neck, genitourinary and specific blood cancers. One form of immunotherapy\u2014CAR T, which involves extracting disease-fighting T cells from the patient's body, reengineering in a lab and then infusing back into the body \u2014has been especially effective with leukemia. CAR T is very expensive, but demonstrated r esults have led to more private insurance companies and Medicare covering its use. While its use has been largely relegated to a few specialized university-based centers, we aim to incorporate these and similar therapies as they move into community-based cancer centers. The extreme costs of many immunotherapy treatments have made Kellogg Cancer Center's patient financial advocates critical members of care teams as they work to secure coverage or industry donations for patients. Kellogg Cancer Center nurses, pharmacy teams and more have been specially trained in the complex therapies. Immunotherapy efforts at NorthShore have been led by Kellogg Cancer Center Medical Director Bruce Brockstein, MD, and Thoracic Oncology Co-Director Thomas Hensing, MD, MS. By the end of 2021, close to a third of Kellogg Cancer Center patients will be treated with immunotherapy. And research, often in collaboration with major cancer centers and leading physician scientists across the country, continues to be an important part of the program to ensure that patients have access to life-changing and lifesaving therapies. Today, more than a third of Kellogg Cancer Center's clinical research activities are immunotherapy-focused.In collaboration with the Mark R. Neaman Center for Personalized Medicine, Kellogg Cancer Center is now developing a groundbreaking pr ogram to incorporate the latest in genomic testing for patients diagnosed with cancer.

While the chemotherapy initially stopped the rare cancer's growth, it began growing again when the treatment was completed. Fortunately, Medel has joined the growing number of patients who are successfully treated with immunotherapy drugs that have not only kept his cancer at bay, but have come with minimal to no side effects. \"I've been very, very lucky,\" said Medel who receives regular infusions at the NorthShore Highland Park Hospital Kellogg Cancer Center for nearly two years and is cared for by oncologist and Kellogg-Scanlon Chair of Oncology Bruce Brockstein, MD. Medel was referred to Dr. Brockstein from University of Chicago Medicine orthopaedic oncologist Rex Haydon, MD. \"We thought very highly of him, and he spoke very highly of Dr . Brockstein,\" said Medel. \"There was no doubt that I was with the right doctor.\" \"Immunotherapy is providing lots of new options for treatment, and in many cases helping us cure patients or give them many years of quality life,\" said Dr . Brockstein. \"In the past, sometimes our only option was to give chemotherapy as a palliative treatment or in hopes of buying some time.\" \"It' s gratifying to see patients like John doing so well and able to live life to the fullest,\" said Dr. Brockstein, who is impressed by Medel's drive. \"It's been great to see him doing so well and tolerating treat - ment so well that we can concentrate much of our time together Innovative research continues to drive improvements in clinical care and outcomes for patients at Kellogg Cancer Center. NorthShore patients have access to a broad range of clinical trials and potentially lifesaving treatments. As immunotherapy remains a growing source of optimism in the battle against cancer, research is particularly crucial in optimizing the evolving field of treatment. Oncologist Thomas Hensing, MD, MS, was the principal investiga- tor for the NorthShore-led multisite national trial that evaluated the sequencing of immunotherapy medication and standar d chemo - therapy in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. \"One of the key challenges in this patient population has been deciding who will most benefit fr om immunotherapy and whether Advancing Vital Research Multidisciplinary Team Supports New Studies Dr. Hensing (pictured left) leads NorthShore's COVID-19 Clinical Trials Scientific Review Committee, which has followed the paradigm established with our clinical research in oncology\u2014namely, focusing on the studies that will best benefit patients today. In addition to oncology , the multidisciplinary group includes representation from infectious disease, pulmonary care, intensive care, hospitalists and more. \"We've been able to leverage our experience at Kellogg where we've developed a very effective way for our patients to quickly have access to important trials,\" said Dr. Hensing. Lifesaving Treatments Keep Him in the Gameit should be combined with traditional chemotherapy,\" explained Dr. Hensing. Findings from the study have proved beneficial for patients at NorthShor e and beyond. Further insights related to the specific biology of individual patient tumors have also helped improve our cancer care, said Dr. Hensing, who presented results of the study at the American Society of Clinical Oncology inter national conference and expects to expand the findings with further research. Oncologist Nicholas Campbell, MD, helped enroll many of the patients involved in the study and continues to champion clinical research as a way to provide the best possible care for Kellogg Cancer Center patients. on important things like curing the flaws of Chicago sports teams.\" An avid bowler, Medel had to teach himself to bowl with his left hand following surgery to remove the first tumor in his arm. He also taught himself to pitch with his left hand and hopes someday to coach his grandson's Little League team. Medel has high praise for the entire Kellogg Cancer Center team and is also grateful for help he received in securing his treatment drugs from the pharmaceutical company after being denied by his insurance. Patient Financial Advocate Kendall Ward works with patients like Medel and has the critical role of coordinating efforts with insurance companies and manu - facturers to ensure that patients get the right treatment without delay. \"It's really a joy\u2014I get to call patients and give them good news,\" said Ward. \"It's a blessing to be part of the Kellogg team, and I enjoy work - ing with patients and knowing that they can focus on getting better without worrying about the financial aspects of care.\" Patient Financial Advocate Kendall Ward For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer or call (847) 570-21124K When Sandra McPherson decided to take advantage of the DNA-10K test offered by NorthShore, she looked forward to finding out about her ancestry . She never expected to learn that she carried a genetic mutation that put her at higher risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Her first instinct was to ignore the results and the fact that she had the BRCA2 mutation, but her 24-year-old daughter Ali Oliveros insisted she take action. Following meetings with a genetic counselor and medical oncologist Allison DePersia, MD, who specializes in caring for high-risk patients with genetic mutations, McPherson quickly decided to undergo a bilateral mastectomy and a hyster ectomy to dramatically reduce her risk of developing cancer. Dr . DePersia walked McPherson, a fourth grade teacher and mother of three, through the options including increased mammography screening and surveil - lance or preemptive surgery. \"While there ar e clear guidelines that take into account other factors, including a patient's age and family history, it's also a very personal decision,\" noted Dr . DePersia. On the other side of both successful operations at NorthShore, 49-year-old McPherson is grateful for the lifesaving information and the opportunity to secure her future. \"With surgery, I don't have to worry about getting cancer,\" said McPherson. \"I'm a proactive person. If there's a problem, I find the solution.\" Dr. DePersia suggested that Oliveros also consider genetic testing. While Oliveros knew her odds, she admitted it was still a bit of a shock to learn that she has the BRCA2 mutation. \"I was hoping for better results, but I'm glad to know and can do Defeating Cancer with Genetic TestingKellogg Cancer Center patients benefit from multidisciplinary teams of experts, including fellowship-trained surgeons performing the most sophisticated and minimally invasive techniques. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is an advanced organ-sparing surgical pr ocedure to remove gastrointestinal tumors or precancerous lesions in the esophagus, stomach or colon. This surgical procedure is currently being performed by NorthShore's Monika Krezalek, MD, and Louis W. Biegler Chair of Surgery Michael Ujiki, MD. Leading-Edge Training Our team of talented surgeons continues to have a national and international reach through development of and refinement of novel applications of minimally invasive surgery and natural orifice proce - dures. The Grainger Center for Simulation and Innovation (GCSI) is a state-of-the-art facility that enables advanced training for our team as well as surgeons fr om around the country and world who are drawn to the world-class resource and faculty.Advanced Surgical Expertise Mindfulness Interventions Surgical Oncology Division Head Katharine Yao, MD, is dedicated to transforming breast cancer care \u2014and in addition to her efforts focused on women at high risk for the disease, she's now leading a novel mindfulness study. Dr. Yao and her team have worked to help patients make the best care decisions, including surgery, when faced with a diagnosis. She is now taking next steps to provide patients and their families minfulness resources to help them make the best individual choice, hoping to help alleviate overwhelming anxiety and fear that often accompanies the stressful journey and often makes it difficult to understand treatment plans. The study in partnership with Northwestern University Associate Professor of Medical Social Sciences and mindfulness expert David Victorson, PhD, includes development of mindfulness videos tailored to newly diagnosed patients, those currently undergoing treatment and survivors. All address overcoming and coping with cancer. Dr. Yao will study the impact of the mindfulness intervention on overall patient emotional well-being, anxiety and str ess biomarkers. The study is funded in part by a grant from the John Wayne Cancer Foundation and the Myra Rubenstein Weis Foundation. something about it,\" she said. Dr. DePersia said Oliveros is young enough to follow guidelines for annual MRIs and breast exams every six months for now. One of seven children born and raised in Colombia, South America, McPherson shared her DNA results with her siblings in the hope they, too, will consider genetic testing. This knowledge is powerful,\" she said. \"I try to live in the moment, but I need to do what I can to pr otect my future and my family's future.\" Personalized Medicine patient Sandra McPherson Dr. Allison DePersiacontinued > For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer or call (847) 570-21125Compassionate, Comprehensive Support for Patients Our Myra Rubenstein Weis (MRW) Living in the Future (LIFE) Cancer Survivorship Program helps ensure the long-term health and quality of life for cancer survivors. Psychosocial Support Kellogg Cancer Center's Psychosocial Oncology Program provides services to help patients and their families navigate a myriad of emotional and practical needs brought on by a cancer diagnosis. The COVID-19 pandemic created further challenges for many cancer patients, and the psychosocial team worked tirelessly to provide additional support. Patients struggled with increased financial challenges, emotional isolation (including being alone for treatments due to necessary visitor restrictions at Kellogg Cancer Center), parenting, and anxiety due to COVID-19 vulnerability. A middle-aged male patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who lost his job during the COVID-19 pandemic was one of the patients to benefit from the team's additional support. Patient financial advocate Marrissa Wiley was able to help the patient secure help with his hospital bills while the team also secured him a patient grant to help with expenses, all of which reduced his anxiety and led him to express his gratitude for all the support he received. An elderly, lower income female patient with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was connected to reliable transportation to treatment and to the North Shore Senior Center for additional help at home. Anxious at tr eatment without the support of her husband who was unable to accompany her due to COVID-19, the woman was comforted with regular, supportive check-ins from the Social Work intern.Additionally , the psychosocial team provided ongoing support to Kellogg Cancer Center staff during the COVID-19 crisis. This support was both informal and structured with things like staff meditation sessions and deep breathing exercises at team meetings. Kellogg Cancer Center support groups were switched to virtual meetings this year due to COVID-19 allowing these groups to continue to offer support while maintaining safety. Integrative Medicine Benefit Success The third annual benefit concert supporting integrative medicine services for Kellogg Cancer Center patients was the biggest success to date, raising close to $70,000. The January 2020 sold-out event at Metro in Chicago featured the acclaimed band, Sons of the Silent Age performing David Bowie's \"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\" and \"Station to Station.\" The band was once again joined on stage by actor Michael Shannon. The benefit helps provide scholarships for integrative medicine services including acupuncture, massage therapy, nutrition guidance, talk therapy, and integrative physician consults for pediatric and oncology patients who would not otherwise have access to these important treatments. Kellogg Cancer Center patients benefit from a range of integrative medicine services including acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine and bodywork that can help offset side effects, increase energy and r elaxation, and add to the healing process. Acupuncturist Rena Zaid (left) is one of the Integrative Medicine team members who works with patients throughout their cancer journey.CCancer patients and their families need more than expert diagnosis and treatment of their disease. At NorthShore, a full range of support services help patients throughout their cancer journey. Fr om social workers to specially trained dietitians and patient financial advocates to an entire Integrative Medicine team, Kellogg Cancer Center offers a comprehensive array of programs to help patients heal and thrive during and after treatment. Specialized oncology nurses are a critical element of Kellogg Cancer Center's ability to provide compassionate care. Advanced Nurse Practitioner Anisha Patel and Dr. Carol Rosenberg help cancer survivors with customized survivorship care plans, ongoing educa-tion and more, enabling them to thrive beyond their treatment.For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer or call (847) 570-21126 Your Support Makes a Real DifferenceCommunity Partners Kellogg Cancer Center maintains an important array of partnerships and collabora- tions with community organizations. The staff assists with virtual programs and support gr oups and stays connected in the immediate community and beyond to ensure that ongoing education and advocacy efforts have stayed strong even during the pandemic. Kellogg Cancer Center team members participated in many virtual community outreach events this year with Cancer Wellness Center, Imerman Angels, American Cancer Society, Lungevity Foundation, Respiratory Health Association, Lung Cancer Research Foundation, Us TOO and others as a way to come together safely as a community. Patients and caregivers were supported throughout COVID-19 with access to cancer- related webinars, support groups, classes and tips on staying connected virtually. A partnership with Niles Township High School District 219 brought virtual cancer prevention and education classes to students. Carol Rosenberg, MD, Director of Preventive Health Initiatives at NorthShore, taught \"Top 10 Real Truths about Cancer Prevention\" designed to help participants learn to differentiate science from rumor regarding the role that food, body weight, supplements, alcohol, smoking and other lifestyle strategies play in cancer prevention. AAt the Kellogg Cancer Center, our dedicated team of outstanding physicians, nurses and other care providers aggressively pursue the latest in novel treatments and highly effective care plans\u2014ones that are equal to or rival nationally recognized cancer centers across the country.

During the pandemic, scholarship patients have continued to receive therapies to help manage their symptoms while also optimizing their immune function and the relaxation response. Oncology Nutrition Services Kellogg Cancer Center dietitians continued to expand their reach with the \"Healthy Eating During Treatment\" presentation on NorthShore's website while also providing additional information through the Healthy You blog. Registered dietitian-nutritionists (RDNs) with expertise in oncology support patients and their families as maintaining good nutrition helps improve patient outcomes, as well as managing symptoms such as unintended weight gain or loss, nausea, taste changes and bowel changes. Phone consultations were implemented during the pandemic to ensure that patients had continued access to critical information and nutrition counseling during treatment. Kellogg Cancer Center RDNs also work with support groups and patients beyond treatment. This year, our dietitians presented at a survivorship program in March, a SPOHNC (Support for People with Oral and Head and Neck Cancer) support group in June, and the NorthShore Prostate Education and Us TOO Support Group in October.For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer or call (847) 570-21127 continued > 2020 Clinical Trials EA8163 Cabazitaxel with Abiraterone versus Abiraterone Alone Randomized Trial for Extensive Disease Following Docetaxel; The CHAARTED 2 Trial Johns Hopkins J1557 Overcoming Drug Resistance in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer with Novel Combination of TGF-B Receptor Inhibitor LY2157299 and Enzalutamide: A Randomized Multi-Site Phase II Study A8143 A Phase 3 Randomized Study Comparing Perioperative Nivolumab vs. Observation in Patients with Renal Cell Carcinoma Undergoing Nephrectomy (PROSPER RCC)Gynecologic CancerNRG-GY005 A randomized Phase II/III study of the combination of cediranib and olaparib compared to cediranib or olaparib alone, or standard of care chemotherapy in women with recur -
