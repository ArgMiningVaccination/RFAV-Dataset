I study, I research, I write about it, and I teach a - 0:22 - 0:28course every summer on the topic. How many of you have been to the course? - 0:28 - 0:36I see some hands up. So, you know what it is. Curanderismo comes from the word - 0:36 - 0:42\"curar,\" which means \"to heal.\" A curandero is a male healer; a curandera a female - 0:42 - 0:50healer. And think about this: in earlier years, there were few medical doctors, - 0:50 - 0:57there were few ministers, priests, no counselors. So the curandero played all - 0:57 - 1:09these roles using a holistic approach to healing the body, mind and spirit. Now, - 1:09 - 1:16my mom was not a curandera, but she should have been one. She would tell us, - 1:16 - 1:25all six of us, Children, she would say, don't you dare get sick. [laughter] - 1:25 - 1:33And if you do, I'll take care of your illness. And she did. Using medicinal - 1:33 - 1:43plants. Using rituals. She kept us healthy. I'll give you an example. She loved the - 1:43 - 1:51aloe vera plant -- \"sabila.\" And she would call it la plantita milagrosa -- the - 1:51 - 1:57miraculous plant. And she would say, this plant heals everything from pimples to - 1:57 - 2:05wrinkles. Indeed, she used it on her wrinkles and on our pimples. But she also - 2:05 - 2:13used it for burns and sunburns. And my dad had serious digestive problems. So she - 2:13 - 2:19gave him papaya. Every day, she gave him papaya for breakfast. And she would ask us, - 2:19 - 2:23please take your papaya, eat your papaya. Of course, you know how kids are. We - 2:23 - 2:30didn't eat papaya. Until recently. I was diagnosed with diverticulitis. And the - 2:30 - 2:35physician said, you will need surgery. So immediately I got on the phone, I called - 2:35 - 2:41Rita, my curandera friend from Mexico, I said, Rita, I'm having surgery. She said, - 2:41 - 2:49no you're not. She said, take papaya! [laughter] - 2:49 - 2:53Three times a day if you have to. I said, that's what my mom used to say to us. - 2:53 - 3:00And she said, did you listen to your mom? Mother always knows best. - 3:00 - 3:08And then there were those wonderful rituals. For example, the ritual of the seven knots. - 3:08 - 3:13In Spanish it's called el ritual de los siete nudos. How many of you have problems? - 3:13 - 3:20Come on! All of us have problems. And this ritual -- it's amazing how the curanderos - 3:20 - 3:27use simple things to deal with serious illnesses. All you need is ribbon, a red - 3:27 - 3:31ribbon, about a foot and a half in length. And you think of seven problems. And if - 3:31 - 3:36you think you don't have seven problems, you do. [laughter] - 3:36 - 3:42You take the ribbon, you take half of the ribbon, and you tie a knot for your first - 3:42 - 3:48problem. And you think about your problem, and you can pray if you'd like. Move a - 3:48 - 3:52couple of inches to the right, you tie your second knot for your second problem. - 3:52 - 3:55And then you go to the left and then to the right and to the left and to the right - 3:55 - 4:00until you get to the seventh knot, for your seventh problem. - 4:00 - 4:05So you've already tied the circle with seven knots. You take the ribbon, with the - 4:05 - 4:10seven knots, and you find an empty jar, like an empty peanut butter jar or a - 4:10 - 4:14mason jar. You put your ribbon with your knots in the jar, you close it, go to the - 4:14 - 4:18backyard -- be careful the neighbors aren't watching, they'll think you're digging - 4:18 - 4:26money. So, you dig a hole, you bury the jar with the ribbon, and therefore you get - 4:26 - 4:30rid of your seven problems. Isn't that interesting? Very simple. Now, this - 4:30 - 4:34reminds me of another ritual a friend of mine told me. He's a curandero. He said, - 4:34 - 4:40when we were kids, my dad was an alcoholic. And he would come home, and he would - 4:40 - 4:46insult us and he would curse at my mom and we were miserable. But there were - 4:46 - 4:51times that our dad would come home, and he would go to the backyard. And we - 4:51 - 4:57would sneak behind him, and we would hide in the shrubs. And then he would lie on the - 4:57 - 5:01ground, lie on his stomach, and he would take out his pocketknife, and he would - 5:01 - 5:06dig a hole. And then he would curse at that hole, and he would yell obscentities - 5:06 - 5:11at that hole, and then he would cover it. And then he would come home, and he would - 5:11 - 5:16be as sweet as ever. What was he doing? What was the dad -- he was getting rid of - 5:16 - 5:21all that anger, all that stress that's in a lot of us, all that garbage that sometimes - 5:21 - 5:26we need to get rid of. In a very simple way. And then there was the ritual of - 5:26 - 5:35susto, which means \"fright.\" Sociologists refer to susto as magical fright. - 5:35 - 5:42Whenever you have a traumatic experience, an accident, maybe a fire, or maybe you - 5:42 - 5:49come back from a war, you may be suffering from PTSD -- post-traumatic stress disorder. - 5:50 - 5:56And I remember my cousin came back from Vietnam, and I'm sure he had PTSD, but I - 5:56 - 6:02don't even think we had a label for it back then. And he would have flashbacks. He'd - 6:02 - 6:09have migraines. He'd have suicidal thoughts. And my mother and my aunt said, - 6:09 - 6:15he's got susto, susto pasado. It's a serious susto. So what they did is they - 6:15 - 6:24took plants, just not any plants. They took basil, they took rue, and rosemary. - 6:24 - 6:30And they swept his body from head to toe three times in prayer. And I remember they - 6:30 - 6:36would whisper, may the spirit of Juan return to its body. Three times. Three - 6:36 - 6:42times a week, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday for a month. And they asked us to be part - 6:42 - 6:47of the rituals. The neighbors would come in support. At the end of the month, my - 6:47 - 6:56cousin was normal. Isn't it amazing, how these wonderful things can cure a person? - 6:56 - 7:03Now, my belief is that we can create a new health care model that will bring both - 7:03 - 7:16traditional medicine and modern allopathic medicine together. [applause] - 7:16 - 7:22In fact, I've seen this model work very effectively in Mexico, at a place called - 7:22 - 7:27CEDEHC -- Centro de Desarrollo Humano hacia or a human development - 7:27 - 7:33center. It's really a school for curanderos. And hundreds if not thousands of curanderos - 7:33 - 7:36go through that school. And usually, it's a certificate program that lasts about - 7:36 - 7:42three years. I was there about three years ago, and I had a terrible pain. - 7:42 - 7:49I had sciatica. I could hardly walk. And one of the curanderos who's also a professor - 7:49 - 7:53there said, Cheo, what's wrong with you? I said, well, I have sciatica, and I've - 7:53 - 7:57had it for years. She said, can I work on you? I said, of course! So she said, first - 7:57 - 8:02we're going to a temazcal, which is a Mexican sweat lodge. And we did for about - 8:02 - 8:07an hour. And then she gave me an herbal tea. And then she said, take a nap. She - 8:07 - 8:12wrapped me in a blanket, and I napped for about thirty, forty minutes. Afterwards, - 8:12 - 8:19she worked on my leg. She massaged, she pulled, she stretched. And after about an - 8:19 - 8:24hour, hour and a half, she said, go to sleep. I slept -- like a baby. The next - 8:24 - 8:29morning, not only was I walking, I was running! And I have been pain-free for - 8:29 - 8:36three years, folks. It's just incredible. [applause] - 8:36 - 8:41At this, at this school, CEDEHC, they teach curanderos, that are actually the - 8:41 - 8:48doctors of their villages, things like healthy lifestyles, diets, juice therapy, - 8:48 - 8:52acupressure, acupuncture. They make their own medicine with herbs. They make - 8:52 - 8:59tinctures in alcohol base. They make microdoses with water base. And they - 8:59 - 9:07teach laugh therapy, risoterapia. Did you hear me? Laugh therapy. Now Nino Fidencio, - 9:07 - 9:11a famous curandero in the 1920s, was already doing laugh therapy. And now Rita, - 9:11 - 9:16my friend Rita, does laugh therapy. She teaches laugh therapy even here at the - 9:16 - 9:20University of New Mexico, during the summers. Now, I think Rita has already - 9:20 - 9:28realized that laugh activates endorphines, the natural body painkillers, and it - 9:28 - 9:34suppresses epinephrines, the stress hormone. It also helps the immune system. - 9:34 - 9:40It circulates the blood. It relieves anxiety. And I'd like to try an exercise with you - 9:40 - 9:44that she taught me. Could you please stand, all of you, for a second? - 9:47 - 9:51Now I want you to go along with what I say, OK? - 9:51 - 10:03Start by saying: Hee hee hee hee [laughing] Audience: Hee hee hee hee .... - 10:03 - 10:15Torres: Now, OK, now heh, heh heh heh ... Audience: Heh heh heh heh ... - 10:15 - 10:20Torres: [laughing, with audience] Now hah hah hah hah follows] 10:20 - 10:24[All are ho ho hohohohohoho [audience follows and laughs] - 10:32 - 10:41Please sit down. [audience still laughing] Now, if any of you were experiencing pain, - 10:41 - 10:45you will be pain-free for the next thirty to forty minutes. [audience laughs] - 10:45 - 10:52I'm serious. Going back to the model, let's dream big, and let's bring both forms of - 10:52 - 10:56medicine. Now, we're beginning to do this at our own University of New Mexico - 10:56 - 11:00Health Sciences Center, thanks to Dr. Arti Prasad, who has the Center for Life - 11:00 - 11:08here. [applause] Yes. But this has to exist all over the country, - 11:08 - 11:13in fact, all over the world. And I'll tell you what, this is what we need to meet the - 11:13 - 11:18needs of those that are uninsured, especially those 11 million immigrants that live here. - 11:18 - 11:23The only time they go to the hospital is when they're really sick, and they go to - 11:23 - 11:27an emergency room, which is overcrowded and understaffed. So let's come up with - 11:27 - 11:31a new model, and stay healthy. Eat papaya and laugh a lot. "}
