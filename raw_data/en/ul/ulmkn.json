These panels are composed of a thin layer of natural wood applied on a technical wood backing. We perform a thorough selection of the raw material and we carry out a process of manual assembly studied and tested before any industrial manufacturing. Thus we achieve a finish that offers a decorative surface that connects us with the essence of wood: aesthetics, touch and warmth. Applications and recommendations For surfaces used vertically and horizontally: Kitchen fronts, doors, custom-made furniture, coatings, etc. The panels are delivered with their surfaces pre-sanded with 120 grit paper, so before varnishing it is advisable to sand them with a finer grit. As a general rule, it is recommended to follow the instructions recommended by the coating manufacturers to find the most suitable products and processes for each application.
