Goodenough, and presents the most recent progress on abundant and non-toxic materials for batteries. In 1997, Nobel Laureate John B. Goodenough and his team reported lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) as a promising cathode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with abundant raw materials, low cost, and environmental friendliness. Especially with the widespread use of energy storage devices in electric vehicles, portable devices, and home battery storage, there is an urgent call for abundant and non-toxic materials. Therefore, new types of rechargeable batteries, such as sodium-ion, potassium-ion, aluminum-ion, magnesium-ion, calcium-ion, and zinc-manganese oxide batteries, are regarded as the next generation energy storage systems. Recent developments mainly focus on inorganic and organic materials for cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes (liquid, solid, semisolid, high-temperature molten salts), aqueous and nonaqueous battery systems, electrochemical analysis, and corresponding synthesis and characterization methods. Researchers have made great efforts on the development of low-cost and ecofriendly energy storage systems, and interdisciplinary fusion is the trend in the field, including materials science, energy storage, biology, chemistry, physics, nanotechnology, information science, etc. Topics covered include, but are not limited to: - Sodium- and potassium-ion batteries - Zinc-ion batteries - Calcium-ion batteries - Aqueous and nonaqueous batteries - Large-scale energy storage and applications - Inorganic electrode materials - Polyanion materials - 2D electrode Magnesium-ion batteries - Aluminum-ion batteries - Enzyme biofuel cells - Electrochemical energy storage - Synthesis and characterization - Organic electrode materials - Carbon materials in energy storage - Electrolytes Guest Editors Wei (Alex) Wang, Beihang University Sian Dutton, University of Cambridge Gao Liu, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Arumugam Manthiram, The University of Texas at Austin "}
