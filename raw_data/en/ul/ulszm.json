They got into arguments because her husband thought that she didn t desire him anymore. Anita was very distressed. On one hand she wanted to connect with her husband and didn t want to lose him, and on the other, she couldn t muster up any desire for sex. Why? Is it self-esteem? Stress? Some disorder? Sexual desire disorders are difficult to identify because then the question arises what is normal sexual desire? There is no scale to measure the normalcy of libido. Each person is different from the other in their morphology, physiologic reaction and psychological constitution. In their book titled Principles and practice of sex therapy , authors Carol Ellison and Bernie Zilbergeld, state To say that there is more or less of something . . . necessitates a standard of comparison . . . But there are no standards of sexual desire; we do not know what is right, normal, or healthy, and it seems clear that such standards will not be forthcoming . [1] Researchers at Kinsey Institute classified hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) into 4 categories How does homeopathy work to boost libido? Sexual function is a complex interaction involving a number of neurotransmitters and hormones, and you are turned on only when there is a balance between inhibitory and excitatory pathways in the brain. Researchers have found that dopamine, oestrogen, progesterone, and testosterone play an excitatory role, whereas, serotonin and prolactin are inhibitory. So, your decreased sexual desire could be due to a reduced level of excitatory activity, an increased level of inhibitory activity, or both.[2] But if we delve deeper, we may find that the imbalance can also be caused by underlying diseases such as thyroid problems, diabetes, erectile dysfunction in men, or depression and anxiety disorders. Homeopathy seeks to treat any underlying disease you may have in relation to low sex drive. Homeopathy works by stimulating the body s own healing system. Your homeopath will prescribe medicines only after a thorough evaluation of your case to find out the cause and extent of your loss of libido. They will definitely ask you questions regarding your intimacy with your partner. For example, they may ask you questions like Do you feel lazy to initiate sex? or How s your relationship with your partner? or even Does your partner work hard to arouse you? You may have to get tests done to rule out diseases such as [diabetes](https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/diabetes/), [thyroid](https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/world-thyroid-day-2012-facts-you-should-know-12303/), or hormonal imbalance. Significant loss of erection in men and neurological symptoms in women need further investigations. Low sex drive can be present even without underlying diseases. Homeopathy can treat such cases also.

So, for whatever reason you have a low sexual desire, homeopathy has a remedy for you. How soon can you expect to see results?

This is because, the remedy you are given has to match the symptoms you experience and your state of mind. Since homeopathic prescriptions are individualized, you need to ask your homeopath as to when you can expect to see results. However, once relief is felt you should stop taking them.
