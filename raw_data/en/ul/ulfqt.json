PROGRAM OBJECTIVES Grants for Supportive Services and Senior Centers The objective of this program is to assist States and area agencies on aging in facilitating the development and implementation of a comprehensive, coordinated system for providing long - term care in home and community -based settings, in a manner responsive to the needs and preferences of older individuals and their family caregivers, by \u2014 (A) collaborating, coordinating activities, and consulting with other local public and private agencies and organizations responsible for administering programs, benefits, and services related to providing long -term care; (B) conducting analyses and making recommendations with respect to strategies for modifying the local system of long -term care to better \u2014 (i) respond to the needs and preferences of older individuals and family caregivers; (ii) facilitate the provision, by service providers, of long -term care in home and community -based settings; and (iii) target services to older individuals at risk for institu tional placement, to permit such individuals to remain in home and community -based settings; (C) implementing, through the agency or service providers, evidence -based programs to assist older individuals and their family caregivers in learning about and making behavioral changes intended to reduce the risk of injury, disease, and disability among older individuals; and (D) providing for the availability and distribution (through public education campaigns, Aging and Disability Resource Centers, the area age ncy on aging itself, and other appropriate means) of information relating to \u2014 (i) the need to plan in advance for long -term care; and June 2012 Aging Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.044 -2 (ii) the full range of available public and private long -term care (including integrated long -term care) programs, options , service providers, and resources (O lder Americans Act [OAA] Section 305(a)(3)). The target population for these supportive services is individuals with greatest economic and social need (with particular attention to low -income older individuals, includin g low -income minority older individuals, older individuals with limited English proficiency, and older individuals residing in rural areas) , and older individuals at risk for institutional placement (OAA Section 306(a)(1)) ; however; proof of age (or income ) is not required as a condition of receiving services. Supportive services may include a full range of economic and social services, including , but not limited to : (1) access services (transportation, health services [including mental health services ] outreach, information and assistance ); (2) legal assistanc e and other counseling services; (3) health screening services (including mental health screening) ; (4) ombudsman services ; (5) provision of services and assistive devices (including provision of as sistive technology services and assistive technology devices); (6) services designed to support States, area agencies on aging, and local service providers in carrying out and coordinating activities for older individuals with respect to mental health serv ices, including outreach for, education concerning, and screening for such services, and referral to such services for treatment; (7) activities to promote and disseminate information about life -long learning programs, including opportunities for distance learning; and (8) services designed to assist older individuals in avoiding institutionalization and to assist individuals in long -term care institutions who are able to return to their communities any other services necessary for the general welfare of ol der individuals (OAA Section 321) . Nutrition services are provided under a separate authorization as described below. Organizations funded under this program and the nutrition services program (see below) also receive funds from other Federal sources as well as from non -Federal sources. Grants for Nutrition Services The purpos es of this grant program are to : (1) reduce hunger and food insecurity; (2) promote socialization of older individuals; and (3) promote the health and well -being of older individuals by helping them gain access to nutrition and other disease prevention and health promotion services to delay the onset of adverse health conditions resulting from poor nutritional health or sedentary behavior (OAA Section 330). Services are provided thro ugh this program to individuals aged 60 or older, in a congregate setting or in -home. These services include meals, nutrition education, nutrition counseling, and nutrition screening and assessment, as appropriate (OAA Sections 331, 336 , and 339). This program is clustered with the grants for supportive services and senior centers for purposes of this program supplement since these services, although separately earmarked, fall under the overall State planning process and process for allocation of funds. June 2012 Aging Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.044 -3 Nutrition Services Incentive Program The objective of this grant program is to provide resource incentives to encourage and reward effective and efficient performance in the delivery of nutritious meals to older individuals. The Administration on Aging (A oA) is responsible for this program (previously included in the Supplement as the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Nutrition Services Incentive Program (CFDA 10.570)) as described in II, \"Program Procedures - Administration and Services.\" This program i s included as part of this cluster because of its direct relationship to the nutrition services program. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Administration and Services The AoA , a component of the Department of Health and Human Services, administers the supportive services and senior centers program and the nutrition services program in cooperation with States, sub -State agencies, and other service providers. The States receive a formula grant from AoA, which is used by the State Unit on Aging (State Agency) both for its planning, administration, and evaluation of these programs as well as to pass through to other entities. Planning and Service Areas (PSAs) are designated by th e State Agency in accordance with AoA guidelines after considering the geographical distribution of the service populations, location of available services, available resources, other service area boundaries, location of units of general -purpose local gove rnment, and other factors. An Area Agency on Aging (Area Agency) is then designated by the State for each PSA after considering the views of affected local governments (States that had a single statewide planning and service area in place prior to fiscal year (FY) 1981 had the option to continue that method of operation; there are currently eight States in this category). A single Area Agency may serve more than one PSA. The Area Agencies, which may be public or private non -profit agencies or organizatio ns, develop and administer counterpart area aging plans, as approved by the State Agency, and, in turn, provide subgrants to or contract with public or private service providers for the provision of services. June 2012 Aging Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.044 -4 With limited exceptions (e.g. , ombudsman s ervic es, information and assistance, case management1), the State Agency and the Area Agencies are precluded from the direct provision of services, unless providing the services is necessary to ensure an adequate supply of services, the services are related to the agency's administra tive functions, or where services of comparable quality can be provided more economically by the agency. Federal funds may pay for only a portion of the costs of administration and services with the State and subrecipients required to provide a matching share from other sources. AoA administers NSIP in cooperation with States, sub -State agencies, and other service providers. Under Section 311(b) (1) and (d) (1) of the OAA, States receive a cash grant from AoA, based on the formula i n the OAA. The amount of a State's grant is determined by dividing the number of meals served to eligible persons in the State during the preceding Federal fiscal year by the number of such meals served in all States and Tribes , and applying the resulting ratio to the amount of funds available. Under OAA Section 311(d)(1), a State may choose to use all or any part of its grant to obtain commodities distributed by the USDA through State Distributing Agencies. The amount a State chooses to use in commoditi es, as well as administrative costs from USDA associated with the purchase of commodities are deducted from the State's grant from AoA . AoA transfers funds to USDA. USDA remains responsible for the overall management of the commodities program, including ordering, purchase, and delivery of the reques ted commodities. (Also see \"IV, Other Information.\") State Plan and Area Plans A State plan, approved by AoA, is a prerequisite to funding of the supportive services and nutrition programs; however, the State Plan covers the totality of AoA programs for which the State is the recipient under the OAA . The State Plan is developed on the basis of input from the Area Agencies as well as input from the affected populations as a result of public hearings. The State Plan addresses how the State intends to comply with the various requirements of the OAA and, specifically for Title III, its program objectives, designation of Planning and Service Areas (PSAs), and specification of the intrastate allocation formula for distribution of funds to each PSA. The State Plan also contains assurances required by the Act and implementing regulations. 1 The term \"case management service\" means a service provided to an older individual, at the direction of the older individual or a family member of the individual (i) by an individual who is trained or experienced in the case management skills that are required to deliver the services and coor dination described below ; and (ii) to assess the needs, and to arrange, coordinate, and monitor an optimum package of services to meet the needs, of the older individual. Case management includes se rvices and coordination such as (i) comprehensive assessment of the older individual (including the physical, psychological, and social needs of the individ ual); (ii) development and implementation of a service plan with the older individual to mobilize the formal and informal resources and services identified in the assessment to meet the needs of the older individual, including coordinatio n of the resources and services with any other plans that exist for various formal services, such as hospital discharge plans; and with the information and assistance services provided under the OAA ; (iii) coordination and monitoring of formal and informal service delivery, including coordination and monitoring to ensure that services specified in the plan are being provided; (iv) periodic reassessment and revision of the status of the older individual with the older individual or, if necessary, a primary caregiver or family member of the older individual; and (v) in accordance with the wishes of the older individual, advocacy on behalf of the older individual for needed services or resources (OAA Section 102(11)) . June 2012 Aging Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.044 -5 Unless a State is not in compliance with Title III requirements, the State Plan may be submitted on a two -, three -, or four -year c ycle, at the option of the State, with annual amendments, as appropriate; however, AoA funding is provided annually. States found to be in noncompliance may be required to submit their State Plans annually until they are determined to be in compliance. A rea plans are prepared and submitted to the State for approval for either two, three, or four years, with annual adjustments, as necessary. Source of Governing Requirements These programs are authorized under Parts B and C, respectively, of Title III of th e OAA , as amended, which is codified at 42 USC 3021 -3030 . These programs may also be referred to as Part B (supportive services and senior centers) and Part C1(congregate nutrition services) and C2 (home -delivered nutrition services). Grants to Indian tr ibes for similar purposes are authorized under another title of the OAA and are not included in this Supplement. Implementing regulations are published at 45 CFR part 1321. The Nutrition Services Incentive Program (NSIP) is authorized in Title III of the OAA, as amended, which is codified at 42 USC 3030a. There are no implementing regulations. Availability of Other Program Information Additional information about nutrition and supportive services as amended in 2006 is available at the AoA web site at http://aoa.gov/AoARoot/AoA_Programs/index.aspx III. COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS In developing the audit procedures to test compliance with the requirements for a Federal program, the auditor should first look to Part 2, Matrix of Compliance Requirements, to identify which of the 14 types of compliance requirements described in Part 3 are applicable and then look to Parts 3 and 4 for the details of the requirements.

Eligibility for Subrecipients Service providers may include profit -making organizations excep t that providers of case management services must be public or non -profit agencies (42 USC 3026(a)(8)(C)). June 2012 Aging Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.044 -8 G. Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking 1. Matching a. State (1) States must contribute from State or local sources at least 25 percent of the cost of State Plan administration as their matching share. This may include cash or in -kind contributions by the State or third parties (42 USC 3028 (a)(1) and 42 USC 3029 (b); 45 CFR section 1321.47). (2) All services, whether provided by the State Agency, an Area Agency or other service provider (including any ombudsman services provided under the authority of 42 USC 3024 (d)(1)(D)) must be funded with a non -Federal match of at least 15 percent. This percentage must be met on a statewide basis. Funds for ombudsman services provided under the authority of 42 USC 3024 (d)(1)(B) are not required to be matched (42 USC 3024 (d)(1)(D); 45 CFR section 1321.47). b. State and Area Agencies Area Agencies, in the aggregate, must contribute at least 25 percent of the costs of administration of area plans (42 USC 3024 (d)(1)(A); 45 CFR section 1321.47). (1) State - Since this match is computed based on the aggregate of all Area Agencies in the State, the auditor's testing of the amount of this match is performed at the State Agency. (2) Area Agencies - The auditor's testing of the allowability of the matching (e.g., from an allowable source and in compliance with the administrative requirements and allowable costs/cost principles requirements) should be performed at the Area Agencies. 2.1 Level of Effort - Maintenance of Effort State - The State Agency must spend for both services and administration at least the average amount of State funds it spent under the State plan for these activities for the three previous fiscal years. If the State Agency spends less than this amount, the Assistant Secretary for Aging reduces the State's allotments for supportive and nutrition services under this part by a percentage equal to the percentage by which the State reduced its expendi tures (42 USC III. L.1, \"Reporting - Financial Reporting ,\" for the reporting requirement regarding maintenance of effort. 2.2 Level of Effort - Supplement Not Supplant - Not Applicable June 2012 Aging Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.044 -9 3. Earmarking a. State (1) Overall expenditures for administration are limited to the greater of five percent (or $300,000 or $500,000 depending on the aggregate amount appropriated or a lesser amount for the U.S. territories) of the overall allotment to a State under Title III unl ess a waiver is granted by the Assistant Secretary on Aging (42 USC 3028 (b)(1), (2), and (3)). (2) After a State determines the amount to be applied to State plan administration under 42 USC 3028 (b), the State may: (a) Make up to (and including) 10 perce nt of that amount available for the administration of Area Plans. The State may either calculate the 10 percent based on the total allotment from AoA or on the amount remaining after deducting the amount to be applied to State Plan administration (42 USC 3024(d)(1)(A)); and (b) Use any amounts available to the State for State plan administration which the State determines are not needed for that purpose to supplement the amount available for administration of Area Plans (42 USC 3028(a)(2)). (3) Any State which has been designated as a single planning and service area may elect to be subject to the State Plan administration limit (five percent) or the Area Plan administration (10 percent) limit (42 USC 3028(a)(3)). (4) A State may transfer: (a) Up to 40 percent of a State's separate allotments for congregate and home -delivered nutrition services between those two allotments without AoA approval (42 USC 3028 (b)). (b) Not more than 30 percent between programs under Part B and Part C (Parts C1 and/o r C2) for use as the State considers appropriate (42 USC 3028(b)). (c) An additional 10 percent may be transferred between C1 and C2 with an AoA waiver (42 USC 3028(b)). (d) A waiver may be requested to transfer an amount which is above the allowable 30 pe rcent between Parts B and C (42 USC 3030c -3(b)(4)). June 2012 Aging Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.044 -10 A State Agency may not delegate to an Area Agency or any other entity the authority to make such transfers (42 USC 3028(b)(6)). (5) The State agency will not fund program development and coordinated acti vities as a cost of supportive services for the administration of area plans until it has first spent 10 percent of the total of its combined allotments under this program on the administration of area plans (45 CFR section 1321.17(f)(14)). b. Area Agency As provided in agreements with the State Agency, Area Agencies earmark portions of their allotment. The typical earmarks are: (1) A maximum amount or percentage for program development and coordination activities by that agency (42 USC 3024(d)(1)(D); 45 CFR section 1321.17(f)(14)(i)). (2) A minimum amount or percentage for services related to access, in-home services, and legal assistance (42 USC 3026(a)(2) ). H. Period of Availability of Federal Funds Funds are made available to the State annually and must be obligated by the State by the end of the Federal fiscal year in which they were awarded. The State has two years to liquidate all obligations for its administration of the State Plan and for awards to the Area Agencies consistent with its intrastate a llocation formula. Therefore, in any given year, multiple years of funding are being used to provide services statewide. Whenever the Assistant Secretary on Aging determines that any amount allotted to a State under Parts B or C for a fiscal year will not be used to carry out the purpose for which the allotment was made, the funds may be reallotted to one or more other States. Any amount made available to a State as the result of a reallotment shall be regarded as part of the State's allotment for the sam e fiscal year in which the funds were appropriated, but shall remain available for obligation by the State until the end of the succeeding fiscal year (42 USC 3024 (b)). J. Program Income 1. Service providers are required to provide an opportunity to individuals being served under all Part B and C services program to make voluntary contributions for services received. These voluntary contributions are to be added to the amounts made available by the State or Area Agency and must be used to expand the service from which they are collected (42 USC 3030c -2(b)). June 2012 Aging Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.044 -11 2. Cost-sharing fees may be collected from Title III -B services except information and assistance, outreach, benefits counseling, or case management services. Cost sharing is not allowed for Title III-C services or Title VII Elder Rights Services (Ombudsman, legal services, elder abuse prevention or other consumer protection services) (42 USC 3030c -2(a)(2)). L. Reporting 1. Financial Reporting a. SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement - Not A pplicable b. SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs - Not Applicable c. SF-425, Federal Financial Report - Applicable 2. Performance Reporting - Not Applicable 3. Special Reporting - Not Applicable 4. Section 1512 ARR A Reporting - Applicable 5. Subaward Reporting under the Transparency Act - Applicable for non - ARRA funds M. Subrecipient Monitoring 1. State Agency The State Agency is required to develop policies governing all aspects of programs operated under the State Plan and to monitor their implementation, including assessing performance for quality and effectiveness and specifying data system requirements to collect necessary and appropriate data (45 CFR sections 1321.11 and 1321.17(f)(9)). 2. Area Agencies Area Agencies are required to oversee the activities of service providers with respect to provision of services, reporting, voluntary contributions, and coordination of services (45 CFR section 1321.65). N. Special Tests and Provisions Distribution of Cas h Compliance Requirement - States are required to promptly and equitably distribute NSIP cash to recipients of grants or contracts under OAA Title C1 and C2 (42 USC 3030a(d)( 4)). June 2012 Aging Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.044 -12 Audit Objective - Determine whether States are distributing cash promptly and equitably. Suggested Audit Procedures a. Review the State's procedures for handling NSIP cash to determine whether there is a documented process for distributing cash, including established time frames. b. Review a sample of transactions during the audit period in which the State received NSIP cash and determine whether the State complied with its established process, including time frames. IV. OTHER INFORMATION The NSIP program may include both cash payments and use of cash to purchase commodities from US DA and for USDA administrative expenses . Assistance in the form of commodities is considered Federal awards expended in accordance with the OMB Circular A -133, \u00a7___.105, definition of Federal financial assistance and should be valued in accordance with \u00a7_ __.205(g). Therefore, both cash expenditures for the purchase of food and the value of commodities received from the State Distribution Agencies should be (1) used when determining Type A programs and (2) included in the Schedule of Expenditures of Federa l Awards in accordance with \u00a7__.310(b). June 2012 Guardianship Assistance HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.090 -1 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CFDA 93.090 GUARDIANSHIP ASSISTANCE I. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The objective of the Guardianship Assistance Program (GAP) is to help agencies authorized to administer title IV -E programs to provide kinship guardianship assistance payments under title IV-E of the Social Security Act, as amended, for relatives taking le gal guardianship of children who have been in foster care . II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Administration and Services The Guardianship Assistance program is administered at the Federal level by the Children's Bureau, Administration on Children, Youth and Families , Administration for Children and Families (ACF), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Funding is available (at the option of the title IV -E agency) to the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and federally recogni zed Indian Tribes, Indian Tribal organizations , and Tribal consortia (hereinafter referred to as Tribes) with approved title IV -E plans , based on a IV -E plan and amendments, as required by changes in statutes, rules, and regulations submitted to and approv ed by the ACF Children's Bureau Associate Commissioner. This funding became available beginning on October 7, 2008 with the enactment of amendments to the Social Security Act through the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 20 08 (Pub. L. No. 110 -351). The State or Tribal title IV -E agency may implement and claim allowable guardianship assistance program costs beginning on the first day of the quarter in which an approvable title IV -E plan amendment is submitted to ACF to imple ment the GAP (45 CFR section 1356.20(d)(8)). The program is considered an open -ended entitlement program and allows the State (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) or Tribe to be funded at a specified percentage (Federal financial participa tion (FFP)) for program costs for eligible children. The designated IV-E agency for this program also administers ACF funding provided for other title IV -E programs, e.g., Adoption Assistance (CFDA 93.659); Foster Care (CFDA 93. 658) and Independent Living Services (CFDA 93.674), as well as the Child Welfare Services (CFDA 93.645) and Promoting Safe and Stable Families (CFDA 93.556) programs (title IV -B of the Social Security Act, as amended); and (States only) the Social Services Block Grant program (CFDA 93.667) (title XX of the Social Security Act, as amended). The IV -E agency may either directly administer the GAP or supervise its administration by local level agencies. Where the program is administered by a State, in accordance with the approved IV -E plan, it must be in effect in all political subdivisions of the State, and, if administered by them, program requirements must be mandatory upon them. Where the program is administered by a Tribe, it must be in effect in all political subdivisions within the Tribal service area(s) and for all populations to be served under the plan. If the program is administered by a political subdivision of a Tribe, program requirements must be mandatory upon them (42 USC 671(a)(1 -4) and 42 USC 679B(c)(1)(B)) . June 2012 Guardianship Assistance HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.090 -2 Source of Governing Requirements The GAP is authorized by title IV -E of the Social Security Act, as amended (42 USC 670 et seq.). Implementing regulations are at 45 CFR parts 1355, 1356, and 1357. Section 5001 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. L. No. 111 -5, 123 Stat 496), as amended by section 201 of Pub. L No. 111 -226, provide d for temporary increase s in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage ( FMAP ) rates for expenditure periods between October 1, 2008 and June 30, 2011 to provide additional funding to IV-E agencies (see paragraph III.G.1.b of this program supplement). An interim final rule to implement statutory provisions related to the Tribal title IV -E program was published in the Federal Register on January 6, 2012 (77 FR 896 et seq .). The rule is effective on February 6, 2012; comments were invited until March 6, 2012. Awards under the GAP are subject to the HHS implementation of the A -102 Common Rule. This program also is subject to 45 CFR part 95 (Subpart E Cos t Allocation Plans is applicable to States) and the cost principles under Office of Management and Budget Circular A -87 (as provided in Cost Principles and Procedures for Developing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Agreements with the Fede ral Government , HHS Publication ASMB C -10, available on the Internet at http://rates.psc.gov/fms/dca/asmb%20c -10.pdf ). States and Tribes are required to adopt and adhere to their own statutes and regulations for program implementation, consistent with the requirements of title IV -E and an approved IV -E plan. Availability of Other Program Information The Children's Bureau manages a policy issuance system that provides further clarification of the law and guides States and Tribes in implementing the Guardianship Assistance program. This information may be accessed on the Internet at http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/laws_polic ies/index.htm . III. COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS In developing the audit procedures to test compliance with the requirements for a Federal program, the auditor should look first to Part 2, Matrix of Compliance Requirements, to identify which of the 14 types of compliance requirements described in Part 3 are applicable and then look to Parts 3 and 4 for the details of the requirements . A. Activities Allowed or Unallowed 1. Kinship Guardianship Assistance Payments - Funds may be expended for kinship guardianship a ssistance payments made on behalf of eligible children (see III.E.1 below) in the amount (subject to limitations in this paragraph) and manner prescribed in a negotiated, written and binding kinship guardianship assistance agreement entered into with the p rospective relative guardian (42 USC 673(d)(1)(A)(i)). Kinship guardianship assistance payments are made to relative guardians (as defined in an approved IV -E plan) based on the circumstances of June 2012 Guardianship Assistance HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.090 -3 the relative guardian and the needs of the child (42 USC 673 (d)(1)(B)(i)). Kinship guardianship assistance payments cannot exceed the amount of the foster care maintenance payment the child would have received in a foster family home; however, the amount of the payments may be up to 100 percent of the foster care maintenance payment rate which would have been paid on behalf of the child if the child had remained in a foster family home (42 USC 673(d)(2)). 2. Administrative Costs a. Program Administration - Funds may be expended for costs directly related to the adm inistration of the program. Approved public assistance cost allocation plans (States) or approved cost allocation methodologies (Tribes) will identify which costs are allocated and claimed under this program (45 CFR section 1356.60(c)). b. Nonrecurring Co sts - Funds may be expended as specified in a kinship guardianship assistance agreement for the total cost of nonrecurring expenses associated with obtaining legal guardianship of the child (if the child meets program eligibility requirements) , to the extent the total cost does not exceed $2,000 (42 USC 673(d)(1)(B)(iv)). c. Guardianship Placement Costs - Funds expended by the IV -E agency for guardianship placements (including nonrecurring costs) are considered an administrative expenditure and are su bject to the matching requirements in section III.G.1.e(42 USC 67 4(a)(3)(E) ). 3. Training a. Funds may be expended for training (including both short - and long -term training at educational institutions through grants to such institutions or by direct finan cial assistance to students enrolled in such institutions) of personnel employed or preparing for employment by the agency administering the plan (42 USC 674(a)(3)(A)). b. Funds may be expended for short -term training of: relative guardians; State/Tribe -licensed or State/Tribe -approved child welfare agencies providing services to children receiving title IV -E assistance; child abuse and neglect court personnel; agency, child or parent attorneys; guardians ad litem; and, court appointed special advocates (42 USC 674(a)(3)(B) ). B. Allowable Costs/Cost Principles Both States and Tribes are subject to the requirements of OMB Circular A -87 (2 CFR part 225). States also are subject to the cost allocation provisions and rules governing allowable costs of equipment of 45 CFR part 95, which references OMB Circular A -87 at 45 CFR section 95.507(a)(2) (45 CFR sections 1355.57, 95.503, and 95.705). 2012 Guardianship Assistance HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.090 -4 E. Eligibility 1. Eligibility for Individuals a. Kinship guardianship assistance payments may be paid on behalf of a child only if program eligibility is established through one of the following methods: (1) General Eligibility All of the following requirements must be met to establish general eligibility: (a) Removal from Home - The child was removed from his or her home pur suant to a voluntary placement agreement or as a result of a judicial determination to the effect that continuation in the home would be contrary to the welfare of the child (42 USC 673(d)(3)(A)(i)(I)). (b) Title IV -E Foster Care Connection - The child was eligible for foster care maintenance payments under 42 USC 672 while residing for at least 6 consecutive months in the home of the prospective relative guardian (42 USC 673(d)(3)(A)(i)(II)). (c) Non-Availability of Other Permanency Options - The IV-E agen cy determined that being returned home or adopted are not appropriate permanency options for the child (42 USC 673(d)(3)(A)(ii)). (d) Family Dynamics - The IV-E agency determined that the child demonstrates a strong attachment to the prospective relative guardian and the relative guardian has a strong commitment to caring permanently for the child (42 USC 673(d)(3)(A)(iii)). (e) Child Consultation - With respect to a child who has attained 14 years of age, the child has been consulted regarding the kinshi p guardianship arrangement (42 USC 673(d)(3)(A)(iv)). (f) Kinship Guardianship Assistance Agreement - The kinship guardianship assistance agreement must be a written and binding document entered into through negotiat ions with the prospective relative guar dian and contain information concerning; the amount of, and manner in which, each kinship guardianship assistance payment will be provided under the agreement, and the manner in which the payment June 2012 Guardianship Assistance HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.090 -5 may be adjusted periodically, in consultation with the relative guardian, based on the circumstances of the relative guardian and the needs of the child (42 USC 673(d)(1)(A)(i) and 673(d)(1)(B)(i)). (g) Legal Guardianship - A kinship guardianship assistance agreement that meets, or is amended to meet, all the requirements of 42 USC 673 (d)(1) must be in place with a prospective relative guardian prior to the establishment of the legal guardianship . Payments may only begin o nce the relative guardian has committed to care for the child and has assumed legal guardians hip for the child for whom they have cared as foster parents and for whom they have committed to care on a permanent basis (42 USC 671(a)(28) and 675(7) ). (h) Safety Requirements - Any relative guardian must satisfactorily have met a criminal records check, including a fingerprint -based check s of national crime information databases (as defined in section 534(e)(3)(A) of title 28, United States Code), and for checks described in 42 USC 671(a)(20) (B) on any relative guardian and any other adult living in the home of any relative guardian, before the relative guardian may receive kinship guardianship assistance payments on behalf of the child (42 USC 671(a)(20)(C)). (i) Age of Child - Once a child is determined eligible to receive title IV -E kinship guardianship a ssistance payments , he or she remains eligible in accordance with the terms of the kinship guardianship assistance agreement and the payments can continue until: ( i) attainmen t of the age of 18 (or attainment of age 21 if the IV-E agency determines that the child has a mental or physical disability which warrants the continuation of assistance); ( ii) the IV-E agency determines that the relative guardian(s) is no longer legally responsible for the support of the child, or ( iii) the IV-E agency determines the child is no longer receiving any support from the relative guardian(s) (42 USC 673(a)(4) (A) and (B)). Beginning on October 1, 2010, a title IV -E agency may amend its title IV -E plan to provide for a definition of a \"child\" as an individual who has not attained 19, 20, or 21 years old (as the IV -E agency may elect) (42 USC 675(8)(B)(iii)). This definition of a child will then permit payment of kinship guardianship assistance for a child who June 2012 Guardianship Assistance HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.090 -6 is over age 18 (where the IV -E agency does not determine that the child has a mental or physical disability which warrants the continuation of assistance up to age 21) only if such a youth is part of an kinship guardianship assis tance agreement that is in effect under section 473 of the Social Security Act and the youth had attained 16 years of age before the agreement became effective. As an additional requirement, a youth over age 18 must also (as elected by the IV -E agency) be : (i) completing secondary school (or equivalent); (ii) enrolled in post -secondary or vocational school; (iii) participating in a program or activity that promotes or removes barriers to employment; (iv) employed 80 hours a month; or (v) incapable of any of these due to a documented medical condition (42 USC 675(8)(B)). (2) Sibling Eligibility (a) The child and any sibling of the eligible child (established under the General Eligibility requirements listed in item E.1.a.(1) above) may be placed in the sam e kinship guardianship arrangement if the State/Tribal agency and the relative agree on the appropriateness of the arrangement for the siblings (42 USC 673(d)(3)(B)(i) and 42 USC 671(a)(31 ); and (b) Kinship guardianship assistance payments may be paid pursuant to a kinship guardianship assistance agreement (in accordance with requirements in item E.1.a.(1)(f)) on behalf of each sibling so placed . If kinship guardianship assistance payments are paid on behalf of the sibling, the IV-E agency must pay (in accordance with a kinship guardianship assistance agreement ) the total cost of nonrecurring expenses associated with obtaining legal guardianship of the child, to the extent the total cost does not exceed $2,000 . The sibling does not have to meet the eligibility criteria in 42 USC 6 73(d)(3)(A) to receive kinship guardianship assistance payments or for the legal guardian to be reimbursed for the nonrecurring expenses related to costs of the legal guardianship (42 USC 673(d)(3)(B)(ii)) . (c) Siblings of an eligible child must also individually meet the requirements specified in items E.1.a.(1)(g), and (i) above (42 USC 6 71(a)(28) ; 675(7) 42 USC (B); and 42 USC 675(8)(B) ). June 2012 Guardianship Assistance HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.090 -7 (3) Title IV -E Guardianship Waiver Post-Demonstration Projects (a) After the termination of a demonstration project relating to guardianship conducted by a State under section 1130 of the Social Security Act , children who, as of September 30, 2008, were receiving assistance or services under the project are deemed to be eligible under the approved title IV-E State plan for the same assistance and services under the same terms and conditions that applied during the conduct of the project (42 USC 674(g)) . (b) Post-demonstration assistance and services to eligi ble children assisted in accordance with terminated guardianship related demonstration projects as noted above in item E.1.a.(3)a is eligible for title IV -E claiming whether or not the State opts to operate a G AP pursuant to 42 USC 673(d) (42 USC 674(g)) . 2. Eligibility for Group of Individuals or Area of Service Delivery - Not Applicable 3. Eligibility for Subrecipients - Not Applicable F. Equipment and Real Property Management Equipment that is capitalized and depreciated or is claimed in the period acqui red and charged to more than one program is subject to 45 CFR section 95.707(b) in lieu of the requirements of the A -102 Common Rule (applies to States only). G. Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking 1. Matching The percentage of required State/tribal fun ding and associated Federal funding (\"Federal financial participation\") varies by type of expenditure as follows: a. Third party in -kind contributions cannot be used to meet the State's cost sharing requirements (Child Welfare Policy Manual Section 8.1F.Q# 2 8/16/02). 45 CFR section 92.24 is not applicable to this program (45 CFR sections 1355.30(c) and 1355.30(n)(1); 45 CFR section 201.5(e )). Tribes directly operating a title IV -E program are permitted to use in -kind funds from third -party sources as match for a portion of administrative and training costs consistent with statutory limits (unless further defined through applicable regulatory limits under regulations that are currently pending ) on the per centage of in -kind expenditures and allowable third -party sources (42 USC 679c(c)(1)(D) ; 45 CFR section 1356.68 ). June 2012 Guardianship Assistance HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.090 -8 b. Kinship Guardianship Assistance Payments - The percentage of title IV -E funding in kinship guardianship assistance payments will be the FMAP percentage. This percentage varies by State and is available on the Internet at http://www.aspe.hhs. gov/health/fmap.htm (42 USC 674(a)(1); 45 CFR section 1356.60(a)). ARRA provides for a temporary increase in FMAP percentages to provide additional funding to IV-E agencies (ARRA, Section 5001 as amended by Section 201 of the Education, Jobs and Medicaid Assistance Act , Pub. L No. 111 -226) . These temporary increases will affect rates for FYs 2009 and 2010 and the first three quarter s of FY 2011 only (i.e., October 1, 2008 - June 30, 2011 ). Generally, aside from the possible applicability of a hold harmle ss provision, an increase of 6.2 percent will be added to the FMAP percentage rate of every State for quarters from October 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010 . In accordance with Section 201 of Pub. L. No. 111 -226, t he ARRA temporary FMAP percentage rate increase was extended for an additional 6 months, but the level of increase is modified as follows: 3.2 percent for the quarter ending March 31, 2011 and 1.2 percent for the quarter ending June 30, 2011 . Effective October 1, 2009, separate Tribal FMAP rates , which are based upon the Tribe's service area and population, apply to Guardianship Assistance program assistance payments incurred by Tribes that are participating in title IV -E programs through either direct operation of an approved title IV -E plan or through operation of a title IV -E agreement or contract with a State title IV -E agency. The methodology for calculating Tribal FMAP rates was provided through a final notice in the Federal Register that is available on the internet as follows: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR -2011 -08-01/pdf/2011 -19358.pdf . The calculated FMAP rate for each Tribe includes any statutory temporary percentage increase applicable to State FMAP rates and applies unless it is exceeded by the FMAP rate for any State in which the Tribe is located (42 USC 679B(d) and 42 USC 6 79B(e)). c. Staff Training - The percentage of Federal funding in expenditures for short - and long -term training at educationa l institutions of employees or prospective employees (including travel and per diem) is 75 percent (42 USC 674(a)(3)(A) and (B); 45 CFR section 1356.60(b)). d. Professional Partner Training - The percentage of Federal funding in expenditures for short -term training of: relative guardians; State/Tribe - licensed or State/Tribe -approved child welfare agencies providing services to children receiving title IV -E assistance; child abuse and neglect court personnel; agency, child or parent attorneys; guardians ad l item; and, court appointed special advocates is subject to an increasing FFP rate for these additional trainee groups as follows: 55 percent in FY 2009; 60 percent in FY 2010; 65 percent in FY 2011; 70 percent in FY 2012; 75 percent 2013 and thereaft er (42 USC 674(a)(3)(B )). June 2012 Guardianship Assistance HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.090 -9 e. Administrative Costs (1) The percentage of Federal funding for non -recurring IV -E agency kinship guardianship placement expenditures (not to exceed $2,000 for each kinship guardianship) is 50 percent (42 USC 674(a)(3)(E)). (2) The percentage of Federal funding of all other allowable administrative expenditures is 50 percent (42 USC 674(a)(3)(E)). 2. Level of Effort - Not Applicable 3. Earmarking - Not Applicable H. Period of Availability of Federal Funds GAP operates on a cash accounting basis and each year's funding and accounting is discrete. To be eligible for Federal funding, claims must be submitted to ACF within 2 years after the calendar quarter in which the IV -E agency made the expenditure. This limitation does not app ly to prior period decreasing adjustments and any claim qualifying for a time limits exception in accordance with 45 CFR section 95.19 (42 USC 1320b -2; 45 CFR sections 95.7, 95.13, and 95.19).

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The objective of this program is to improve access to primary medical care, research, and support services for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) -infected women, infants, children and youth, and affected fam ily members, through the provision of coordinated, comprehensive, culturally and linguistically competent, family -centered services. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Administration and Services This program is administered at the Federal level by the HIV/Acquired I mmunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services. The Coordinated Services for Women, Infants, Children, and Youth (CSWICY) networks of health care and s upport services programs provide family -centered outpatient ambulatory health care for women, infants, children and youth with HIV/AIDS. Grantees can also provide additional support services to patients and affected family members. Grants under this pro gram are awarded to public and non -profit private entities, including health facilities operated by or pursuant to a contract with the Indian Health Service (42 USC 300ff - 71(a)). Services may be provided directly by the grantee or through contractual agre ements with other service providers. Many of these grantees/providers receive other Federal funding, e.g., other Ryan White HIV/AIDS program funding, community and migrant health centers, but this categorical funding allows them to provide adequate fundin g for these services. Source of Governing Requirements The CSWICY grant program is authorized under Part D of Title XXVI of the PHS Act , as amended by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006 (Pub. L. No. 109 - 415), and the Ryan White H IV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 200 9 (Ryan White Program) (Pub. L. No. 111 -87), and is codified at 42 USC 300ff -71. The program has no specific program regulations. Availability of Other Program Information Further information about this program is a vailable at http://www.hab.hrsa.gov/ .

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The objective of this program is to \"impr ove and perpetuate the government -to-government relationship between Indian tribes and the United States and to strengthen tribal control over Federal funding and program management\" by enabling tribes to assume programs, services, functions, and activitie s (or portions thereof) (PSFAs) of the Indian Health Service (IHS), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that are otherwise available to Indian tribes (tribes) or Indians. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Title V of the Indian Self -Determination and Education Act (ISDEAA) (Pub. L. No. 106 -260), which was signed into law August 18, 2000, provided permanent self -governance authority within the Indian Health Service. A Self -Governance compact is a legally binding and mutually enforceable written agreeme nt, including such terms as the parties intend shall control year after year, that affirms the government -to-government relationsh ip between a Self -Governance Tribe and the United States . As a result, the provisions of compacts vary significantly, with only minimal cross -cutting compliance requirements. A funding agreement (FA) is a legally binding and mutually enforceable written agreement that identifies the PSFAs that the Self -Govern ance Tribe will carry out, th e funds being transferred from Service Unit, Area and H eadquarte rs levels in support of those PSF As, and such other terms as are required , or may be agreed upon , pursuant to Title V. Funding under FAs may be multi -year agreeme nts. Tribal compactors may provide health care services directly at facilities operated by the compactor or by operating a contract health services program as part of the FA. Contract health services are services provided to IHS -eligible beneficiaries b y private sector health -care providers, such as hospitals and physicians, under contract with the tribal compactor. Source of Governing Requirements Title V of the ISDEAA, as amended, is codified at 25 USC 458aaa. Regulations concerning the general adminis tration of Indian health programs are found at 42 CFR part 136. Regulations implementing ISDEAA Title V and establishing the IHS Tribal Self-Governance Program are found at 42 CFR part 137.

COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS In developing the audit procedures t o test compliance with the requirements for a Federal program, the auditor should first look to Part 2, Matrix of Compliance Requirements, to identify which of the 14 types of compliance requirements described in Part 3 are applicable and then look to Part s 3 and 4 for the details of the requirements . A. Activities Allowed or Unallowed 1. Funds may be used to carry out and deliver the health services PSFA. The FA generally identifies the PSFAs to be performed or administered by the tribe (25 USC 458aaa -4(d)). 2. A Self -Governance Tribe may incur costs that are reasonable in amount and appropriate to the investment responsibilities of the Self -Governance Tribe (42 CFR section 137.1 01(c) ). 3. Funds may be used to meet matching or cost participation requiremen ts under any other Federal or non -Federal program; when used in this manner they are considered non -Federal funds (42 CFR section 137.217). B. Allowable Costs/Cost Principles 1. A Self -Governance Tribe must apply the cost principles of the applicable OMB circular, generally OMB Circular A -87, except as modified by 25 U.S.C. 450j -1, other provisions of law, or any exemptions to applicable OMB circul ars subsequently granted by OMB (42 CFR section 137.167 ) . 2. For contract health services, the Tribal compacto r is the paye r of last resort. Before seeking payment from the Tribal compactor, the contract provider must first seek payment from all alternate resources, such as health care providers and institutions; health care programs including programs under the Social Security Act (i.e., Medicare or Medicaid); State or local health care programs; and, private insurance. Where a third -party liability is established after the claim is paid, reimbursement from the third party should be sought (42 CFR section 136.61 ). C. Cash Management A Self -Governance Tribe may retain and spend interest earned on any funds paid unde r a compact or FA (25 USC 458aaa -7(h); 42 CFR section 137.100).

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The purpose of the Family Planning - Services Project Grant (FPSPG) program is to provide funds for education, counseling, and comprehensive medical and social services necessary to enable individuals to freely determine the number and spacing of their children; and, by doing so, to help improve pregnancy outcomes, reduce infertility and promote the health of females, males and their families. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES The FPSPG program is administered by the Office of the Secretary (OS), a component of the Department of Health and Hum an Services (HHS). Within the OS, the Office of Family Planning/Office of Population Affairs is responsible for the program. The program has no statutory funds allocation formula; HHS makes discretionary grant awards whose amounts are based on estimates of the amounts necessary for successful project performance. Any public or non -profit private entity in a State (which includes each of the 50 States, District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Commonwealth of the Northern Mari ana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, Republic of Palau, Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands) may apply for a project grant under the program. The entity applying for the grant must follow Public Health System Reporting Requirements and submit to the State a plan for a coordinated and comprehensive program of family planning services. Family planning services under the FPSPG program must be voluntary and must be made available without coercion and with respect for the priv acy, dignity, and social and religious beliefs of the individuals being served. To the extent possible, entities that receive grants shall encourage family participation in projects assisted under this program. Source of Governing Requirements The FPSPG i s authorized under Title X of the Public Health Service Act, as amended (42 USC 300 et seq.) . The implementing regulations are at 42 CFR part 59.

COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS In developing the audit procedures to test compliance with the requirements for a Federal program, the auditor should first look to Part 2, Matrix of Compliance Requirements, to identify which of the 14 types of compliance requirements described in Part 3 are applicable and then look to Parts 3 and 4 for the details of the requirements. A. Activities Allowed or Unallowed 1. Activities Allowed a. Provision of services - A project supported by the FPSPG must provide a broad range of family planning methods and services, including infertility services and services for adolescents. Services that may be funded for a particular project are identifie d in the grant application. They may include: (1) Medical services - These include providing information on all FDA -approved methods of contraception (including natural family planning methods); counseling services; physical examinations, including cancer detection and laboratory tests; issuance of contraceptive supplies; periodic follow -up examinations; and referral to other medical facilities when medically indicated. (2) Social services - These include counseling, referral to and from other social and m edical service agencies, and such ancillary services as are necessary to facilitate clinic attendance. (3) Information and education - These activities are designed to achieve community understanding of the program's objectives, inform the community of the availability of program services, and promote continued participation in the project by persons likely to benefit from its services (42 CFR sections 59.5(a)(1) and (b)). b. Purchase of services - If the grantee obtains services for its clients by contract or other arrangements with service providers, it must do so according to agreements with the providers that specify payment rates and procedures (42 CFR section 59.5(b)(9)). 2. Activities Unallowed - No Title X funds shall be used in programs where abort ion is a method of family planning (42 CFR section 59.5(a)(5)). June 2012 FPS HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.217 -3 G. Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking 1. Matching The Federal share of a FPSPG project's cost may never equal 100 percent nor be less than 90 percent (with certain exceptions). The Federal and non -Federal shares are stated in the Notice of Grant Award issued to the grantee (42 CFR sections 59.7(b) and (c)). 2. Level of Effort - Not Applicable 3. Earmarking - Not Applicable J. Program Income A grantee must charge for family planning services according to the client's ability to pay. A person's inability to pay according to the prescribed fee schedule must not be a barrier to receiving services. A person from a low -income family may not be charged, except to the extent that payment will be ma de by a third party (such as an insurer or a government agency) which is authorized or under legal obligation to pay such charge. Individuals from other than low -income families are charged according to an established fee schedule which is based on the co st of services. For individuals from families with incomes between 101 and 250 percent of the published Income Poverty Guidelines, such a schedule must provide discounts based on ability to pay. Fees for individuals from families with higher incomes are set to recover the reasonable cost of providing the services (42 CFR sections 59.5(a)(7) and (8)). A \"low -income family\" is one whose total annual family income does not exceed 100 percent of the most recent Income Poverty Guidelines published by HHS in th e Federal Register . These guidelines may be found on the HHS web site at http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/ . \"Low -income family\" also includes members of families whose annual family income exceeds the poverty level, but who the project director has determined are unable, for good reasons, to pay for family planning services. For example, unemancipated minors who wish to receive services on a confidential basis must be considered on the basis of their own resources (4 2 CFR sections 59.2 and 59.5(a)(6)). The Notice of Grant Award provides guidance on the use of program income. Generally the addition method is used for this program. L. Reporting 1. Financial Reporting a.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES In general, the objective of the Consolidated Health Centers Program (CHCP) is to provide to populations that would ordinarily not have access to health care (1) primary and preventive health services, (2) refer rals to other services, such as hospital and substance abuse services, and (3) case management and other services designed to assist health center patients in establishing eligibility and gaining access to Federal, State, and local programs that provide ad ditional medical, social, or educational support or enabling services, such as transportation, translation and outreach services, and patient education services. The CHCP typically provides family -oriented primary and preventive health care services for people living in rural and urban medically underserved communities, e.g., those where economic, geographic or cultural barriers limit access to such services for a substantial portion of the population. Some health center delivery sites serve vulnerable po pulations, including homeless individuals, migrant farm workers, residents of public housing, and school children at risk of poor health outcomes. Required health services for health centers include services related to family medicine, internal medicine, p ediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, lab and radiology services, and cancer screening; well -child services; immunizations; screenings for elevated blood lead, communicable diseases, and cholesterol; pediatric eye, ear, and den tal screenings; voluntary family planning services; preventive dental services; emergency medical services; referrals to providers of medical services; and, as appropriate, pharmaceutical services. Some exceptions and special provisions for certain compon ents of the CHCP are: Health Care for the Homeless (HCH) - In addition to services required of all consolidated health centers, recipients of HCH funding must provide substance abuse services, including detoxification, risk reduction, outpatient treatment, residential treatment, and rehabilitation for substance abuse provided in settings other than hospitals. Specific provisions of governance requirements for HCH funding can be waived by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) under a deleg ation from the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (see II, \"Program Procedures - Administration and Services\"). These requirements also may be waived under Public Housing Primary Care (PHPC) and Migrant Health Centers (MHC) component s (42 USC 254b(k)(3)(H)(iii)). June 2012 Health Centers Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.224 -2 Migrant Health Centers - The requirement for an MHC to provide all the primary care services can be waived, and an MHC also may receive approval to provide certain required primary health care services during certain periods of the year only. An MHC may provide health services other than primary care services due to the health needs of the population it serves. These services may include environmental health services, screening for and control of infectious diseases, and injury prevention programs. The objective of the program for new and expanded services (CFDA 93.527) under the health centers program , authorized by the Affordable Care Act, is t o provide for expanded and sustained national investment in community health . This program also is referred to as \"new access points\" or NAP. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Planning Grants The purpose of these grants is to assess the health care needs of the population to be served and to plan and develop a health center program that will serve medically underserved populations. This includes efforts to obtain financial and professional support, develop linkages with other health -care providers, and involve the community. Planning grants also may be awarded to health centers to plan or de velop a managed care network. Operational Grants The purpose of these grants is to support the costs of operating health centers that serve medically underserved populations. Operational grants also may include the operation of managed care and practice management networks and plans. Administration and Services CHCP grants are awarded and administered at the Federal level by the Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC), HRSA, HHS. Based on applications submitted to and approved by HRSA, grants are provided t o public and private non -profit organizations including tribal, faith -based and community -based organizations . Factors considered include the population to be served and the current availability of services in the geographical area to be served. Unless t he requirement is waived, grantees are required to have a governing board that is composed of individuals, a majority of whom are being served by the center, and, who, as a group, represent the individuals being served by the center (except in the case of an entity operated by and Indian tribe or tribal or Indian organization under the Indian Self -Determination Act or an urban Indian organization under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act). The responsibilities of the governing board include, among other things, selecting the services to be provided, determining the center's hours of operation, and approving the selection of the center director. Grantees may enter into service and care arrangements with vendors to expand their service networks. June 2012 Health Centers Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.224 -3 The annua l level of HRSA funding for the operation of a health center is determined on the basis of the center's approved scope of services, projected total costs of operation, and expected revenues from program income and funding from non -Federal sources. This in cludes all State, local, and other operational funding received by or allocated to the approved project, and all premiums, fees, and third -party reimbursements received (adjusted for uncollectible amounts). The Federal dollars awarded are intended to make up the expected difference between the projected costs and revenues. Source of Governing Requirements The CHCP and NAP are authorized under Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by Section 10503 of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P ub. L. No. 111- 148) . The statutory provisions are codified at 42 USC 254b. The implementing program regulations for Community Health Centers (CHC) and MHCs are 42 CFR parts 51c and 56, respectively. The HCH and PHPC components do not have pro gram -specific regulations.

Ascertain if the center has by -laws or other internal policies addressing the required elements of the board and its operation. b. Review meeting minutes to ascertain if the board approved the annual budget. c. As of the end of the year preceding the audit, determine the board membership, services provided, operating hours, and center director. Ascertain if changes occurred in any of these areas during the audit period and, if so, whether the governing board had the type of involvement required by th e statute and acted in compliance with the center's by -laws/internal operating procedures. 2. Section 340B Drug Pricing Program Section 602 of Public Law 102 -585, the \"Veterans Health Care Act of 1992,\" enacted section 340B of the Public Health Service Act (\"PHS Act\"), \"Limitation on Prices of Drugs Purchased by Covered Entities.\" Section 340B limits the cost of covered outpatient drugs to certain federal grantees, federally qualified health center look -alikes and qualified hospitals. Drugs purchased from participating drug manufacturers by covered entities through the 340B Program may not be sold or transferred to anyone other than the patients of the covered entities. In addition, drugs purchased through the 340B Program are not entitled to rebates unde r the Medicaid program because this would result in duplicate discounts. While an organization is eligible to participate in the program, it must notify the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Office of Pharmacy Affairs ( OPA ) of its int ention to participate by registering for the 340B Program. Participation in the 340B Program normally begins on the first day of a quarter. It is the entity's responsibility to tell its wholesaler or manufacturer that it is registered for 340B discount p rices when it places an order. All organizations receiving 340B prices are required to maintain records of purchases of covered outpatient drugs and of any claims for reimbursement submitted for such drugs under title XIX of the Social Security Act (Med icaid program, CFDA 93.778). Guidance for the 340B program is found in the following documents available at http://www.hrsa.gov/opa/federalregister.htm : \"Guidance Regarding Section 602 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 Limitation on Prices of Drugs Purchased by Covered Entities\" 5 8 FR 27289 (May 7, 1993 ) \"Final Notice Regarding Section 602 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 Duplicate Discounts and Rebates on Drug Purchases (58 FR 34 058-34059), June 23, 1993. \"Final Notice Regarding Section 602 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 Entity Guidelines \" 59 FR 25110 (May 13, 1994 ). Additional information is available at http://www .hrsa.gov/opa/introduction.htm . June 2012 Health Centers Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.224 -10 Compliance Requirements - Organizations participating in the 340B Program must ensure that (1) their organizational information is accurate in the 340B database maintained by OPA; (2) outpatient drugs purchased under the 34 0 B Program are not being given to individuals who are not eligible patients (diversion ); and (3) discounts are not being received from both Medicaid rebates and 340B discounts (duplicate discounts). Accurate Information Section 340B of the PHSA requires OPA to maintain accessible data on the iden tity of participating entities. Covered entities are required to ensure the accuracy of the information in the database by regularly updating (at least annually) their informatio n, including the covered entity's exact name and street address , through submission of change request forms to OPA. Diversion Section 340B(a)(5)(B) of the PHSA prohibits covered entities from selling, transferring , or giving covered outpatient drugs to anyone other than patients of the covered entity. The statute does not define the term \"patient\" in section 340B and in 1996, HRSA issued a guideline regarding the definition of a \" patient\" under the 340B program . An individual is a ''patient'' of a covered entity (with the exception of State -operated or funded AIDS drug purchasing assistance programs) only if: (1) the covered entity has established a relationship with the individual, such that the covered entity mai ntains records of th e individual's health care; (2) the individual receives health care services from a health care professional who is either employed by the covered entity or provides health care under contractual or other arrangements (e.g. referral for consultation) such that responsibility for the care provided remains w ith the covered entity; and (3) the individual receives a health care service or range of services from the covered entity which is consistent with the service or range of services for which grant funding is provided. Additional information is available at ftp://ftp.hrsa.gov/bphc/pdf/opa/FR10241996.pdf . \"Final Notice Regarding Section 602 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 199 2 Patient and Entity Eligibility. \" Duplicate Discounts Section 340B(a)(5)(A) of the PHSA required the Secret ary of HHS to establish a mechanism to ensure that manufacturers did not pay a \"duplicate discount\" on a drug claim. A \"duplicate discount\" woul d occur if a n entity received a 340B discount and a Medicaid rebate were provided on the same drug. The mechanism that the Secretary established to comply with the legislation's mandate to prohibit duplicate discounts is a part of the OPA database called the Medica id Exclusion File (58 FR 34058 (June 23, 1993) and 59 Fed. Reg. 25110 (May 13, 1994)). Additional information is available at http://www.hrsa.gov/opa/medicaidexclusion.htm . If this program includes a \"payer of last resort\" provision , a patient 's Medic aid eligibility will require the return of rebate funds to manufacturers so as not to incur double recovery. June 2012 Health Centers Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.224 -11 Audit Objectives - To determine if (1) a grantee's records are correct in th e 340B database; (2) drugs were diverted to individuals who are not eligible patients; and (3) if the organization received duplicate discounts. Suggested Audit Procedures a. Determine if the grantee is participating in the 340B Program and, if so, continue with the remaining audit procedures. b. Review the grantee's latest change form submitted to OPA and compare it with the organization's actual physical location and other current information about the entity. c. Test a sample of drugs purchased for use under t he funding program (CFDA 93.xxx) during the audit period to determine whether 340B drugs were properly identified through out the p rocurement process, including (1 ) paymen t at the discounted price and (2 ) proper identification as a 340B drug upon receipt. d. Test a sample of records of 340B drugs purchased for use under the funding program and released from inventory during the audit period to determine whether required authorizations were received, to whom the drugs were dispensed, and if the grantee determin ed that such individuals were eligible patients before dispensing the drugs . e.

June 2012 Immunization Grants Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.268 -1 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CFDA 93.268 IMMUNIZATION GRANTS CFDA 93.712 ARRA - IMMUNIZATION I. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The objective of the immunization grant program is to reduce and ultimately eliminate vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) by increasing and maintaining high immunization coverage. Emphasis is placed on populations at highest risk for un der-immunization and disease, including children eligible under the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES The Immunization Grants program consists of two parts: discretionary Section 317 immunization grants and VFC financed with mand atory Medicaid (CFDA 93.778) funding. The objective of the discretionary Section 317 immunization grant program is to reduce and ultimately eliminate VPDs by increasing and maintaining high immunization coverage. Emphasis is placed on populations at highe st risk for under -immunization and disease, which includes VFC -eligible children. The statute refers to development of programs for all individuals for whom vaccines are recommended, including infants, children, adolescents and adults. The intent of the d iscretionary Section 317 immunization grant program is to supplement, not supplant, each grantee's immunization effort at the State/local level. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), through its grant guidance, has identified the following areas of activity for programmatic emphasis and funding prioritization: reduce the number of indigenous cases of vaccine -preventable diseases; ensure that all children are appropriately vaccinated; improve vaccine safety surveillance; increase routine va ccination coverage levels for adolescents; and increase the proportion of adults who are vaccinated annually against influenza and who have ever been vaccinated against pneumococcal disease. VFC, which is authorized by and financed through Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid), is activity -based financial assistance and direct assistance in the form of vaccine - purchase funds and program operations funds to support implementation of the VFC program. VFC is administered by CDC and is funded entirel y by the Federal government. VFC funds are provided to eligible grantees to develop and operate programs designed to ensure effective delivery of vaccination services to eligible children through enrolled providers of medical care. Grantees are required to encourage a variety of providers to participate in the VFC program and to administer vaccines in an appropriate cultural context. Grantees also are required to ensure that providers comply with the requirements of the VFC program. Other criteria, deta iled in annual grant application guidance documents, may also apply. Under VFC, children from birth through 18 years of age are eligible for VFC -purchased vaccine if they are Medicaid -eligible, American Indian/Alaskan Native, or without health insurance. Children who are insured but whose insurance does not cover vaccination also are eligible to receive VFC vaccine at Federally Qualified Health Centers or Rural Health Clinics. The intent of the VFC program is to increase vaccination coverage levels by red ucing financial barriers to vaccination. The VFC program ensures that all eligible children receive the benefits of all June 2012 Immunization Grants Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.268 -2 recommended vaccines, thus strengthening immunity levels in their communities. The program also ensures that access to newly recommend ed vaccines for children in low -income and uninsured families does not lag behind that for children in middle - and upper -income families. In addition, the program helps to ensure that there is an adequate supply of routinely recommended vaccines when publ ic health emergencies occur, including vaccine supply shortages. The VFC program authorizes participating immunization providers in all States to receive publicly purchased vaccine for administration to VFC -eligible children. The goal is to ensure that no child contracts a VPD because his or her parent cannot afford to pay for the vaccine or its administration. VFC and Section 317 financial assistance (FA) is provided/obligated directly to immunization grantees for administrative and operations costs. Sim ilarly, Section 317 FA is obligated to grantees for the purchase of vaccines not available through federal contracts. Funds for direct assistance (DA) vaccines are maintained at CDC, and are periodically obligated to manufacturer contracts. Grantees are given estimated target budgets for their DA vaccine purchase needs. CDC uses these budgets as a control mechanism for vaccine orders. Vaccines will be maintained by a federally contracted third -party distributor that receives orders from and ships vaccin e to providers. Periodically, when the federal distributors' inventory reaches certain minimum thresholds, the distributor makes a request to CDC for replenishment vaccines. CDC reviews these requests and assigns funding sources to them (VFC or 317) base d on the aggregate of grantee submitted spend plans. Orders for the vaccines are processed and sent to the appropriate manufacturer(s), referencing funds that were previously obligated to the manufacturer contracts. The manufacturer fulfills the order an d ships the vaccines to the federally contracted distributor. Source of Governing Requirements These programs are authorized under 42 USC 247b, 42 USC 42 USC 1396s, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Ac t of 2009 (Pub. L. No . 111-5) (ARRA) . Regulations specific to discretionary Section 317 grants may be found at 42 CFR part 51b. III. COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS In developing the audit procedures to test compliance with the requirements for a Federal program, the auditor should first look to Part 2, Matrix of Compliance Requirements, to identify which of the 14 types of compliance requirements described in Part 3 are applicable and then look to Parts 3 and 4 for the details of the requirements. A. Activities A llowed or Unallowed 1. Discretionary Section 317 grant funds may be used to establish and maintain a preventive health service program, including: June 2012 Immunization Grants Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.268 -3 a. Research into the prevention and control of diseases that may be prevented through vaccination; b. Demonst ration projects for the prevention and control of such diseases; c. Public information and education programs for the prevention and control of such diseases; d. Education, training, and clinical skills improvement activities in the prevention and control of such diseases for health professionals; and e. Operational activities associated with the conduct of a successful immunization program (42 USC 247b(k)(1)). 2. The VFC program is intended primarily as a vaccine purchase and supply program for eligible children. VFC funds may be expended to support costs associated with the following: a. VFC vaccine ordering; b. VFC vaccine distribution for grantees that have not transitioned to a federally contracted vaccine distributor; and c. Direct VFC program opera tions, such as provider recruitment and enrollment, overall VFC program coordination, vaccine management and accountability, VFC provider accountability and site visit assessments, and VFC program evaluation (42 USC 1396s). J. Program Income Grantees provi ding direct immunization services may generate program income from fees or donations. Vaccine administration fees may be charged under VFC, however, they may not exceed the maximum reimbursement schedule established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicai d Services, the delegated authority. This cap does not apply to discretionary Section 317 grants. However, no one may be denied immunization services due to the inability to pay a fee or donation (42 USC 1396s(c)(2)(C)). L. Reporting 1.

Control, Accountability, and Safeguarding of Vaccine Compliance Requirement - Effective control and accountability must be maintained for all vaccine under the VFC program. Vaccine must be adequately safeguarded and used solely for authorized purposes (42 USC 1396s). This includes administration only to VFC program -eligible children, as defined in 42 USC 1396s(b)(2)(A)(i) through (A)(iv), regardless of the child's parent's ability to pay (42 USC 1396s(c)(2)(C)(iii)). Audit Objective - Determine whether the grantee provides oversight of program - enrolled providers to en sure that proper control and accountability is maintained for vaccine, vaccine is properly safeguarded (based on guidance provided by CDC), and VFC -eligibility screening is conducted. Suggested Audit Procedures a. Determine if the grantee has a written procedure for overseeing program -enrolled providers that allows for sampling of provider's inventory records and assessment of storage procedures. Grantees are not required to sample the records of all providers . b. Determine if the grantee sampled the provider's inventory records to ensure proper recording of receipt, transfer, and usage of vaccine. c. Determine if the grantee reviewed the provider's storage of vaccine for proper safeguarding, including risks of loss from theft, expiration, or improper storage temperature. d. Determine if the grantee reviewed a sample of provider medical r ecords for documentation of eligibility screening . e. Determine if necessary follow -up procedures were followed if any deficiencies were identified. 2. Record of Immunization Compliance Requirement - A record of vaccine administered shall be made in each person's permanent medical record (or in a permanent office log or file to which a legal representative shall have access upon reque st) (42 USC 300aa -25) which includes: a. Date of administration of the vaccine; June 2012 Immunization Grants Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.268 -5 b. Vaccine manufacturer and lot number of the vaccine; and c. Name and address and, if appropriate, the title of the health care provider administering the vaccine. Audit Objec tive - Determine whether the grantee provides oversight of vaccinating providers to ensure that the required information has been recorded for va ccine recipients. Suggested Audit Procedures a. Determine if the grantee has a written procedure for ensuring t hat the required information has been recorded for vaccine recipients. b. Determine if the grantee tested a sample of vaccination records to ascertain if the required information was maintained. c. Determine if the grantee took any follow -up action if the required records and information were not maintained. IV. OTHER INFORMATION After the end of each month and after the end of each Federal fiscal year, CDC advises each grantee of the value of all federally funded vaccine , including ARRA -funded vaccine , which was distributed, in lieu of cash, directly to the grantee and/or on behalf of the grantee to vaccinating providers located in the grantee's geographical area. The annual dollar value of federally funded vaccine , including ARRA -funded vaccine , should be treated by the grantee as grant expenditure for purposes of determining audit coverage and reporting on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards. Vaccinating providers and vaccinated individuals are not considered subrecipients; therefore, the valu e of vaccine received is not grant expenditure for purposes of determining audit coverage and reporting for those entities.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) program provides funds to States and federally recognized Indian Tribes (Tribes and Tribal consortia) to prevent the unnecessary separation of children from their families, improve the quality of care and services to children and their families, and ensure permanency for children by reuniting them with their parents, by adoption or by another permanent living arrangement. The program includes: family support, family preservation, time -limited family reunification, and adoption promotion and support services. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Administration and Se rvices The Children's Bureau, Administration on Children, Youth and Families, Administration for Children and Families (ACF), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), administers the PSSF. To be eligible for funds, each State and Tribe must submit a five - year comprehensive plan, the Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP). This plan encompasses planning and service delivery for the full child welfare services spectrum. This includes: child welfare services under Title IV -B, Subpart s 1 and 2; a child welfare staff development and training plan; a diligent recruitment of foster and adoptive families plan that reflects the ethnic and racial diversity of children in the State for whom foster and adoptive homes are needed; and child abus e and neglect prevention, foster care, adoption, and foster care independence services, including an education and training voucher program for foster care youth. An Annual Progress and Services Report (APSR) is required that identif ies the specific accom plishments and progress made in the past fiscal year toward meeting each goal and objective in the 5-year comprehensive plan and any revisions in the statement of goals and objectives or to the training plan, if necessary, to reflect changed circumstances . The Associate Commissioner of the ACF Children's Bureau has approval authority for the title IV-B plans. Following ACF approval, allotments are based on the number of children in the States who received food stamps in the previous three years. Grants ma y also be made to Tribes that qualify under the allotment formula; no Tribe may be funded if its allotment is less than $10,000. PSSF services are based on several key principles. The welfare and safety of children and of all family members should be mai ntained while strengthening and preserving the family. It is advantageous for the family as a whole to receive services, which identify and enhance its strengths while meeting individual and family needs. Services should be easily accessible, often deliv ered in the home or in community -based settings, and they should respect cultural and community differences. In addition, they should be flexible, responsive to real family needs, and linked to other supports and services outside the child welfare system. Services should involve community organizations and residents, including parents, in their design and delivery.

June 2012 Promoting Safe and Stable Families HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.556 -5 8. Funds awarded under Title I V-B, Subpart 2, may not be used for the purchase or construction of facilities (45 CFR section 1357.32(e)). G. Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking 1. Matching Funds are federally reimbursed at 75 percent of allowable expenditures. The IV- B agency's contribution may be in cash, donated funds, and non -public third party in-kind contributions (45 CFR section 1357.32(d)). 2.1 Level of Effort - Maintenance of Effort - Not Applicable 2.2 Level of Effort - Supplement Not Supplant a. States and Tribes (42 USC 629c) may not use Federal funds under title IV-B, Subpart 2, to supplant Federal or non -Federal funds for existing services. (1) \"Non -Federal\" funds are defined at 42 USC 629a(a)(9) as \"State funds, or at the option of a State, State and local funds.\" Although State match ing may be in the form of cash, donated funds , or non- public third party in -kind contributions, the \"supplement not supplant\" requirement is limited to non-Federal funds as defined in 42 USC 629a (a)(9). (2) The base year for determining compliance with this requirement is the amount of funds that the State expended for services in the State's fiscal year 1992 (42 USC 629b(a)(7); 45 CFR section 1357.32(f)). The regulations have not been updated to reflect the amendments to the Social Secu rity Act made by the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) that added two new service categories (i.e., time -limited family and reunification services and adoption promotion and support services) to those specified in 45 CFR section 1357.32(f); however, th e base year (1992) remains the same for all four service areas under title IV -B, subpart 2 (42 USC 629b(a) and (b)(1); ACYF -CB-PI-99-07). b. The State may not use the amount specified in III.G.3.c. below to supplant any Federal funds paid to the State under part E that could be used for monthly caseworker visitation with children who are in foster care and activities designed to improve caseworker retention, recruitment, training, and ability to access th e benefits of technology (Pub. L. No. 109 -288, section 3(c)(2)(B)). June 2012 Promoting Safe and Stable Families HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.556 -6 3. Earmarking a. Unless approved by ACF, States must expend a significant portion of their grant, defined as 20 percent, on each of the following: (1) programs of family preservation serv ices, (2) community -based family support services, (3) time -limited family reunification services, and (4) adoption promotion and support services (42 USC 629b(a)(4); 45 CFR section 1357.15(s); ACYF -CB-PI-10-09 (found at http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/laws_policies/policy/pi/2010/pi1009. htm). b. States may not expend more than 10 percent of Federal funds for administrative costs (42 USC 629b(a)(4)). There is no lim itation on the percentage of administrative costs that may be reported as State match. c. A State shall use the special allocation provided pursuant to Pub. L. No. 109 -288 to support monthly caseworker visits with children who are in foster care with a pr imary emphasis on activities designed to improve caseworker retention, recruitment, training, and ability to access the benefits of technology (42 USC 629f(b)(4)). H. Period of Availability of Federal Funds Funds must be expended by September 30 of the f iscal year following the fiscal year in which the funds were awarded (45 CFR section 1357.32(g)), with the exception of those FY 2006 funds provided by the special allocation pursuant to Pub.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The objectives of the State and Tribal TANF programs are to provide time -limited assistance to needy families with children so that the children can be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives; end dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work, and marriage; prevent and reduce out -of-wedlock pr egnancies, including establishing prevention and reduction goals; and encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families. This program replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JO BS), and Emergency Assistance (EA) programs. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Administration and Services The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), administers the TANF program on behalf of the Federal Government. To be eligible for the TANF block grant, a State (including the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States (U.S.) Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa) must periodically submit a State plan contain ing specified information and assurances. Following ACF review of the State Plan and determination that it is complete, ACF awards the basic \"State Family Assistance Grant\" (SFAG) to the State using a formula allocation derived from funding levels under t he superseded programs. The SFAG is a fixed amount to the State subject to reductions based on any penalties assessed. In addition, amounts may be adjusted on the basis of separate Federal funding of counterpart Indian Tribal programs within the State. States meeting the qualifying criteria may also receive supplemental grants and payments from the contingency fund. As long as the minimum requirements are met, States have significant flexibility in designing programs and determining eligibility requirem ents. While States have flexibility and discretion, there are provisions to ensure accountability for results, including requirements for data about expenditures and individuals receiving benefits under the program, and monetary penalties for failure to m eet programmatic requirements such as work participation. The Federal TANF block grant program also has an annual cost -sharing requirement, known as maintenance -of-effort (MOE). If a State fails to meet the required minimum all -family or two - parent work participation rate for a Federal fiscal year (FY), then the State must spend at least 80 percent of its fiscal year historic State expenditures to provide benefits and services to eligible clientele. If the State meets both minimum work participation rat e requirements, then the June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -2 required spending level decreases to 75 percent of its FY 1994 historic State expenditures. \"Historic State expenditures\" means the State's FY 1994 share of expenditures in the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) , AFDC -EA (Emergency Assistance), AFDC - Related Child Care, Transitional Child Care, At -Risk Child Care and Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) programs. States may not use more than 15 percent of the total amount of countable expenditures for the fi scal year for administrative activities. Tribes Tribal Family Assistance Plans (TFAP) are developed for a 3 -year period and submitted to ACF for review and approval. The Tribal Family Assistance Grant (TFAG) is derived from an amount equal to the Federal share of expenditures, other than child care cos ts, by the State or States under the former AFDC, EA, and JOBS programs for FY 1994 for all American Indian families residing in the service area identified in the TFAP. The TFAG is a fixed amount, subject to reductions based on any penalties assessed. A s long as the minimum requirements are met, Indian tribes (Tribes) have significant flexibility in designing programs and determining eligibility requirements and may use grant funds to provide cash or non -cash assistance, including direct services, and fo r administrative activities. Tribal TANF grantees may operate the program under a consolidated Pub. L. No. 102 -477 demonstration project. Pub. L. No. 102 -477 refers to the Indian Employment, Training and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992, the pu rpose of which is to provide for the integration of employment, training and related services to improve the effectiveness of those services. Tribes operating a consolidated Pub. L. No. 102 -477 project must still submit a TFAP to the Secretary of HHS for review and approval prior to consolidation of the Tribal TANF program into a Pub. L. No. 102 -477 plan. Tribal TANF data collection and performance reporting requirements identified or referenced elsewhere in this program supplement apply. However, Tribes that integrate their Tribal TANF program into the Pub. L. No. 102 -477 project may submit TANF financial reports annually as an attachment to their Pub. L. No. 102 -477 financial report, the Tribal TANF Financial Addendum Report (12g). Under Pub. L. No. 10 2- 477, funds received from a program must be used and spent in accordance with the applicable rules for that program, subject to any waivers granted by the Secretary of HHS; however, during the period covered by this Supplement in which Federal partners an d Tribes are participating in a working group process to address a set of issues relating to plans, reporting, and accountability in Pub. L. No. 102 -477 projects, this Supplement provides that auditing of funds should be based on determining that the funds were spent in compliance with the applicable approved plan. Other Considerations Funding Methods - States States have different funding options to expend Federal grant funds and State maintenance -of- effort (MOE) funds. This includes the following: 1. Federal Only - Under this option, Federal grant funds are segregated from MOE funds that are expended in the TANF program operated by the State. June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -3 2. Commingled Federal/State - Under this option, States commingle their MOE funds with Federal grant funds expend ed in the TANF program operated by the State. A commingled funding structure means that all expenditures are subject to all Federal funding restrictions, TANF requirements, and MOE limitations. 3. Segregated State - Under this option, MOE funds are segreg ated from the Federal grant funds and expended in the TANF program operated by the State. 4. Separate State Program - Under this option, States spend their MOE funds in separate State programs, operated outside of the TANF program operated by the State. Federal grant funds and MOE funds must both be used for \"expenditures.\" A definition of the term \"expenditure\" is found in 45 CFR section 260.30. In addition, section 260.33 explains the circumstances under which certain State tax relief provisions would c ount as expenditures. Funding Methods - Tribes Tribes have different funding options under which to expend Federal grant funds and, where applicable, State MOE funds as follows. 1. Federal Only - Under this option, Federal grant funds are segregated from any State - donated MOE funds or tribal funds that are expended in the TANF program operated by the Tribe. 2. Commingled Federal/State -donated MOE - Under this option, Tribes commingle their State -donated MOE funds with Federal grant funds expended in the TANF program operated by the Tribe. A commingled funding structure means that all expenditures are subject to all Federal funding restrictions and MOE limitations. 3. Segregated Tribal - Under th is option, MOE funds are segregated from the Federal grant funds and expended separately in the TANF program operated by the Tribe. See IV, \"Other Information,\" for guidance on State MOE expended by Tribes. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Section 2 101 of Subtitle B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. L. No. 111 -5) established the Emergency Contingency Fund (Emergency Fund) for the State TANF (CFDA 93.714) Program at section 403(c) of the Social Security Act. In accord ance with section 2101(c)(6) of ARRA, for qualifying States, Tribes, and Territories, Emergency Fund awards may be used for the same types of expenditures as SFAG or TFAG grant funds. Policy Announcement TANF -ACF -PI-2009 -05 provides additional detail regarding eligibility for the Emergency Fund for State TANF; it is available on the Office of Family Assistance (OFA) website at http://www.acf .hhs.gov/programs/ofa/policy/pa - ofa/2009/pa200901.htm. June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Supplement 4-93.558 -4 ARRA made additional changes to TANF, such as extending supplemental grants (CFDA 93.716) through FY 2010 (Section 2102 of Subtitle B of Pub. L. No. 111 -5), expanding flexibility in the use of TANF f unds carried over from one fiscal year to the next (Section 2103 of Subtitle B of Pub. L. No. 111 -5), and adding a hold -harmless provision to the caseload reduction credit for States and Territories serving more TANF families. Source of Governing Require ments These programs are authorized under Title IV -A of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) (Pub. L. No. 104 -193), and subsequent amendments thereto, and ARRA , and are codified at 42 USC 601 - 619. PRWORA was signed into law on August 22, 1996, and required State implementation no later than July 1, 1997. On April 12, 1999, ACF published final regulations for the TANF program. These final rules took effect October 1, 1 999 (April 12, 1999, Federal Register (64 FR 17720 et seq .)). ACF also published technical and correcting amendments to the final rule on July 26, 1999, which were also effective on October 1, 1999 (July 26, 1999, Federal Register (64 FR 40290 et seq .)). Thus, the obligations and expenditures of Federal TANF funds on or after October 1, 1999, and any State actions occurring on or after October 1, 1999, are subject to the provisions in the final rules, as amended (see 45 CFR Parts 260 - 265 for the TANF re gulations applicable to States). The Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005 (Pub. L. No. 109 -171), enacted February 8, 2006, included provisions to reauthorize the TANF program. On June 29, 2006, ACF published interim final regulations implementing the chan ges to the TANF program required by the DRA (June 29, 2006, Federal Register (71 FR 37454 et seq. ), which is available at http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/tanfregs/tfinrule.pdf ). On February 5, 2008, ACF published the final regulations implementing the changes to the TANF program required by the DRA of 2005 (February 5, 2008, Federal Register (73 FR 6772 et seq. ), which is available at http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/ . The final rule is effective October 1, 2008. PRWORA also authorized any federally recognized Tribe in the lower 48 states, 13 specified Alaskan Native entities, and con sortia of eligible Tribes to apply for funding under section 412 of the Act to administer a Tribal TANF program beginning July 1, 1997. The Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 (Pub. L. No. 106 -169, December 14, 1999) also included technical amendments to the Act, which affected program regulations. Implementing regulations for Tribal TANF are in 45 CFR part 286 and were published in the Federal Register on February 18, 2000 (65 FR 8477 et seq. ). State and all Tribal TANF programs (i.e., including Tribal TANF programs in Pub. L. No. 102 - 477 projects) are subject to the provisions in 45 CFR part 92, the HHS implementation of the A-102 common rule, and OMB Circular A -87, Cost Principles for State, Local, and Indian Tribal Governments [2 CFR part 225]) .

COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS In developing th e audit procedures to test compliance with the requirements for a Federal program, the auditor should look to Part 2, Matrix of Compliance Requirements, to identify which of the 14 types of compliance requirements described in Part 3 are applicable and the n look to Parts 3 and 4 for the details of the requirements. This program makes references to States, however, in some cases, subrecipients of States (e.g., local governments) may be responsible for compliance requirements that are referred to in this Sup plement as \"State.\" The auditor should adjust accordingly for the entity being audited. A. Activities Allowed or Unallowed 1. Federal Only a. Funds may be used for expenditures for activities that are not permissible under 42 USC 601, but for which the St ate was authorized to use IV -A or IV-F funds under prior law. The previously authorized activities must have been included in a State's approved State AFDC plan, JOBS plan, or Supportive Services Plan, as in effect on September 30, 1995, or at the State's option, on August 21, 1996. Examples of such activities are authorized juvenile justice and foster care activities (42 USC 604(a)(2); 45 CFR section 263.11(a)(2)). b. A State may transfer up to 30 percent of the combined total of current fiscal year fun ds (not prior fiscal year funds carried into the current fiscal year) received under the State family assistance grant, and supplemental grant for population increases for a given fiscal year to carry out programs under the Social Services Block Grant (Tit le XX) (CFDA 93.667) and/or the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CFDA 93.575). However, no more than 10 percent may be transferred to Title XX, and such amounts may be used only for programs or services to children or their families whose income is less than 200 percent of the poverty level. Neither contingency funds under 42 USC 603(b) nor emergency funds under 42 USC 603(c) (Pub. L. No. 111 -5) can be transferred under this authority June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -6 (Pub. L. No. 109 -171, Sec. 7101(a); Pub. L. No. 110 -161 (Consoli dated Appropriations Act, 2008 (Social Services Block Grant); 42 USC 604(d); 45 CFR section 263.11(b); and 45 CFR section 264.72(e)). The poverty guidelines are issued each year in the Federal Register and HHS maintains a web site that provides the povert y guidelines (http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/index.shtml ). 2. Federal Only and Commingled Federal/State - Funds may not be used to provide medical services other than pre -pregnancy family planning services (42 USC 608(a)(6)). 3.

A State may contract with charitable, religious and private organizations to provide administrative and programmatic services and may provide beneficiaries of assistance with certificates, vouchers, or other forms of disbursement which are redeemable with such organization (42 USC 604a(b),42 USC 604a(k), and 45 CFR section 260.34). However, funds provided directly to participating organizations may not be used for inherently religious activities, suc h as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization (42 USC 604a(j); 45 CFR section 260.34(c)). 4. Tribes: Federal Only a. Funds may be used for expenditures for activities that are not permissible under 42 USC 601, but for which the State or Tribe wa s authorized to use IV-A or IV -F funds under prior law. The previously authorized activities must have been included in a State's approved State AFDC plan, JOBS plan, or Supportive Services Plan, as in effect on September 30, 1995, or at the State's optio n, on August 21, 1996. Examples of such activities are authorized juvenile justice and foster care activities (42 USC 604(a)(2); 45 CFR section 263.11(a)(2)). Use of such funds in the Tribal TANF program is allowed if the geographic area of the Tribal TA NF program is within the State(s) having had an approved AFDC State plan(s) under Title IV -A that included these activities. If the Tribe plans to exercise this option, these activities must be included in the approved Tribal TFAP. b. Tribes may not transfer any Federal TANF funds to the Social Services Block Grant (Title XX) (CFDA 93.667) or the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CFDA 93.575).

Funds may b e used to implement an electronic benefits transfer system (42 USC 604(g)). e. Funds may be used to carry out a program to fund individual development accounts (42 USC 604(h)(2)) established by individuals eligible to receive assistance under Tribal TANF ( 42 USC 604(h); 45 CFR section 286.40). f. A Tribe may contract with charitable, religious and private organizations to provide administrative and programmatic services and may provide beneficiaries of assistance with certificates, vouchers, or other forms of disbursement which are redeemable with such organization (42 USC 604a(b) and 42 USC 604a(k)). However, Tribes that operate their own TANF program under section 412 of the Social Security Act are not required to follow the Charitable Choice rules becaus e the statutory provisions on Charitable Choice apply only to State and local governments (42 USC 604a(j); September 30, 2003, Federal Register , (68 and 56463)). g. Tribal TANF grantees that expend Federal funds on economic development activities must adhere to the instructions contained in the TANF Program Instruction, TANF -ACF -PI-2005 -02, dated April 19, 2005, pertaining to economic development expenditures. This program instruction is available at http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/policy/tanf -pi.htm (45 CFR section 286.35(a)(1)). June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -9 h. Unlike States, Tribes are not prohibited from expending funds for medical expenses, if the expenditure is in the context of removing barriers to employment, training, or job -related education. However, funds cannot be used for general medical expenses for families. The expenditure of TANF funds is not intended to subsidize, contribute to, or supplant other available medical services or funding - i.e., Indian Health Service, Public Health Service, tribal health services, state, county, and local health services, or other services covered by Medicaid, Medicare, or private health insurance (42 USC 608(a)(6), 45 CFR section 286.45(b)). C. Cash Manage ment Tribal TANF grantees are not eligible for any cash management provisions applicable to Pub. L. No. 93-638 Indian Self -Determination contracts or Self-Governance compacts, including the interest exemption. As described in Special Tests and Provisions, III.N.6, \"Accountability, Deposit , and Investment of Lump -Sum Drawdown s,\" special provisions apply to Tribal TANF grantees participating in Pub. L. No. 102 -477 demonstration projects. E. Eligibility 1. Eligibility for Individuals The State or Tribal Plan provides the specifics on how eligibility is determined in each State or tribal service area. Whenever used in this section, \"assistance,\" has the meaning in 45 CFR section 260.31(a) of the TANF regulations for States and 45 CFR s ection 286.10 of the Tribal TANF regulations for federally recognized Tribes operating an approved Tribal TANF program. Plan and eligibility requirements must comply with the following Federal requirements: a. Federal Only, Commingled Federal/State, Segre gated State, and Separate State Program (1) Only a financially needy family that consists of, at a minimum, a minor child living with a parent or other caretaker relative, or a pregnant woman may receive TANF \"assistance\" or most maintenance -of-effort (MO E)-funded benefits, services, or \"assistance\" regardless of the TANF purpose that the expenditure is reasonably calculated to accomplish (see III.A.3.a, \"Activities Allowed or Unallowed - Federal Only, Commingled Federal/State, Segregated State, Separate S tate Program\"). The child must be less than 18 years old, or, if a full -time student in a secondary school (or the equivalent level of vocational or technical training), less than 19 years old. (With respect to segregated or separate State MOE funds, the State could use the definition for minor child given in section 419(2) of the Act or some other definition applicable in State law provided the State can articulate a rationale June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -10 basis for the age it chooses.) Financially \"needy\" means financially eligible according to the State's quantified income and resource (if applicable) criteria to receive the benefit (42 USC 602, 602(a)(1)(B)(iii), 42 USC See \"Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking - Level of Effort\" - Maintenance -of-Effort,\" for the limited MOE pro -family exception to this requirement. Note: A State may continue to provide federally funded ( Federal Only ) TANF \"assistance\" pursuant to 42 USC 604(a)(2) using the financial eligibility criteria contained in the State's approved AFDC, EA, JOBS, or Supportive Services plan as of September 30, 1995 (or at State option, as of August 21, 1996). A State may also continue this assistance notwithstanding the family composition requ irement described above. (See III A.1.a, \"Activities Allowed or Unallowed.\") Only the financially \"needy\" are eligible for services, benefits, or \"assistance\" pursuant to TANF purpose 1 or 2 (see III.A.3.a, \"Activities Allowed or Unallowed - Federal Only, Commingled Federal/State, State, Separate State (42 USC 601(a)(1) (2); 45 CFR sections 260.20(a) and (b)). Financially \"needy\" for TANF and MOE purposes means financial deprivation, i.e., lacking adequate income and resources. F or example, a needy family or a needy parent is one who is financially eligible according to the State's quantified financial eligibility criteria (income and resource (if applicable) standards, April 12, 1999, Federal Register (64 FR 17825), 45 CFR sectio n 263.2(b)(3)). States may choose to use Federal only TANF funds to provide benefits that do not constitute \"assistance\" to the non -needy pursuant to TANF purpose 3 or 4 only (see III.A.3.a, \"Activities Allowed or Unallowed - Federal Only, Commingled Fed eral/State, Segregated State, Separate State Program\") (42 USC 601(a)(3) and (4); 45 CFR sections 260.20(c) and (d)). States may also choose to use MOE funds to provide certain pro -family non -assistance benefits to the non -needy under TANF purpose 3 or 4 (See III.G.2.1, \"Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking - Level of Effort\" - Maintenance of Effort,\" for the limited MOE pro -family exception to this requirement). (2) Qualified aliens, as defined in 8 USC 1641(b), are the only non - citizens who may receive a T ANF public benefit, as defined in 8 USC 1611(c)), using Federal TANF or commingled funds. Qualified aliens are lawful permanent residents, asylees, refugees, aliens paroled into the U.S. for at least one year, aliens whose June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -11 deportations are being withheld, aliens granted conditional entry, Cuban/Haitian entrants, and certain battered aliens. Victims of severe forms of trafficking and certain family members are also eligible for federally funded or administered public benefits and services to the same exten t as refugees. Qualified aliens, nonimmigrants under the Immigration and Nationality Act, and individuals paroled into the U.S. for less than a year are the only noncitizen groups that are eligible for a non - commingled State or local MOE -funded public bene fit, as defined in 8 USC 1621(c). Aliens that are not lawfully present in the U.S. may also be eligible for a State or local MOE -funded public benefit if the State has enacted a law after August 22, 1996 affirmatively providing for such eligibility. (8 U SC 1621(d)) All expenditures must meet all MOE requirements at 45 CFR part 263, Subpart A. See III.G.2.1, \"Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking - Level of Effort\" - Maintenance of Effort.\" States have the authority to decide whether or not to provide a Federal TANF public benefit or a MOE -funded public benefit to otherwise qualified aliens (including nonimmigrants and individuals paroled in the U.S. for less than a year in the case of a noncommingled State or local MOE -funded public benefit) (8 USC 1612( b)(1) and 8 USC 1622(a)). If a State has decided not to help eligible aliens, then the State may not deny eligibility to refugees, asylees, aliens whose deportation has been withheld, Amerasians, and Cuban/Haitian entrants for a period of 5 years after th e date of entry into the U.S. or the date asylum or withholding of deportation was granted. Also, such States may never deny eligibility to legal permanent residents who have worked 40 qualifying quarters after December 31, 1996 and have not received any Federal means -tested public benefit during such period (once the 5 -year bar has expired for a qualified alien entering the U.S. on or after August 22, 1996 as described in the next paragraph), or to aliens who are veterans, members of the military on activ e duty, and their spouses and unmarried dependents (8 USC 1612(b)(2)(A)(ii) 8 USC 1621(2)(B) and (C), 8 USC 1622(b)(1) - (3)) In other words, Congress did not give States the authority to deny eligibility to all eligible aliens. If the State elects to help all otherwise eligible aliens (as described in the preceding two paragraphs), then this paragraph does not apply. Unless exempt under 8 USC 1613(b), qualified aliens, as defined in 8 USC 1641(b), entering the U.S. on or after August 22, 1996, are not elig ible for a Federal means -test public benefit (e.g., federally funded TANF assistance), as defined in 8 USC 1611(c), for a period of 5 years (8 USC 1613(a)). The 5 -year bar begins June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -12 either on the date of the alien's entry into the U.S. as a qualified alien o r on the date the alien residing in the U.S. becomes a qualified alien, whichever is later. If the alien entered the U.S. on or after August 22, 1996, but does not have an immigration status that qualifies (as defined in 8 USC 1641(b)), the individual is not eligible for a Federal public benefit (as defined in 8 USC 1611(c)). The following qualified aliens are exempt from the 5 -year bar: refugees, asylees, aliens whose deportation is being withheld, Amerasians, Cuban/Haitian entrants, as well as veterans , members of the military on active duty, and their spouses and unmarried dependent children (8 USC 1613(b)). If a noncash Federal or State and local public benefit meets the specifications in the Attorney General's Final Order (Order No. 2353 -2001 publish ed January 16, 2001 at 66 FR 3613), then the State may provide the benefit regardless of immigration status (8 USC 1611 (b)(1)(D) and 8 USC 1621(b)(4)). b. Federal Only and Commingled Federal/State (1) Any family that includes an adult or minor child head of household or a spouse of the head of household who has received assistance under any State program funded by Federal TANF funds for 60 months (whether or not consecutive) is ineligible for additional federally funded TANF assistance. However, the State may extend assistance to a family on the basis of hardship, as defined by the State, or if a family member has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty. In determining the number of months for which the head of household or the spouse of the head of household has received assistance, the State must not count any month during which the adult received the assistance while living in Indian country or in an Alaskan Native Village and the most reliable data available with respect to that month (or a perio d including that month) indicate at least 50 percent of the adults living in Indian country or in the village were not employed (42 USC 608(a)(7); 45 CFR sections 264.1(a), (b), and (c)). (See III.G.3, \"Matching, Earmarking, Level of Effort - Earmarking,\" for testing the limits related to the number of exemptions.) (2) A State may not provide assistance to an individual who is under age 18, is unmarried, has a minor child at least 12 weeks old, and has not successfully completed high school or its equivalen t unless the individual either participates in education activities directed toward attainment of a high school diploma or its equivalent, or participates in an alternative education or training program June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -13 approved by the State (42 USC 608(a)(4); 45 CFR secti on 263.11(b)). (3) A State may not provide assistance to an unmarried individual under 18 caring for a child, if the minor parent and child are not residing with a parent, legal guardian, or other adult relative, unless one of the statutory exceptions appl ies (42 USC 608(a)(5)). (4) A State may not provide assistance for a minor child who has been or is expected to be absent from the home for a period of 45 consecutive days or, at the option of the State, such period of not less than 30 and not more than 180 consecutive days unless the State grants a good cause exception, as provided in its State Plan (42 USC 608(a)(10)). (5) A State may not provide assistance for an individual who is a parent (or other caretaker relative) of a minor child who fails to notify the State agency of the absence of the minor child from the home, as in paragraph e. immediately above, within five days of the date that it becomes clear to that individual that the child will be absent for the specified period of time (42 USC 608(a)( 10)(C)). (6) A State may not use funds to provide cash assistance to an individual during the 10 -year period that begins on the date the individual is convicted in Federal or State court of having made a fraudulent statement or representation with respect to place of residence in order to simultaneously receive assistance from two or more States under TANF, Title XIX, or the Food Stamp Act of 1977, or benefits in two or more States under the Supplemental Security Income program under Title XVI of the Social Security Act. If the President of the United States grants a pardon with respect to the conduct that was the subject of the conviction, this prohibition will not apply for any month beginning after the date of the pardon (42 USC 608(a)(8)). (7) A State m ay not provide assistance to any individual who is fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after conviction, for a felony or attempt to commit a felony (or in the State of New Jersey, a high misdemeanor), or who is violating a condition of probation or parole imposed under Federal or State law (42 USC 608(a)(9)(A)). c. Federal Only, Commingled Federal/State, Segregated State (1) A State shall require, as a condition of providing assistance, that a member of the family assign to the State the rights the family member may have for support from any other person. This June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -14 assignment does not exceed the amount of assistance provided (42 USC 608(a)(3)). (2) An individual convicted under Federal or State law of any offense which is classified as a felo ny and which involves the possession, use, or distribution of a controlled substance (as defined the Controlled Substances Act (21 USC 802(6)) is ineligible for assistance if the conviction was based on conduct occurring after August 22, 1996. A State sha ll require each individual applying for TANF assistance to state in writing whether the individual or any member of their household has been convicted of such a felony involving a controlled substance. However, a State may by law enacted after August 22, 1996, exempt any or all individuals from this prohibition or limit the time period that this prohibition applies to any or all individuals 21 USC 862a). (3) If an individual in a family receiving assistance refuses to engage in required work, a State must reduce assistance to the family, at least pro rata, with respect to any period during the month in which the individual so refuses, or may terminate assistance. Any reduction or termination is subject to good cause or other exceptions as the State may est ablish (42 USC 607(e)(1); 45 CFR sections 261.13 and 261.14(a) and (b)). However, a State may not reduce or terminate assistance based on a refusal to work if the individual is a single custodial parent caring for a child who is less than 6 years of age i f the individual can demonstrate the inability (as determined by the State) to obtain child care for one or more of the following reasons: (a) the unavailability of appropriate care within a reasonable distance of the individual's work or home; (b) unavail ability or unsuitability of informal child care; or (c) unavailability of appropriate and affordable formal child care (42 USC 607(e)(2); 45 CFR sections Eligib for Tribal TANF in the approved TFAP. See IV, \"Other Information,\" for guidance on State MOE expended by Tribes. The approved TFAP includes the Tribe's proposal for time limits for the receipt of TANF assistance (45 CFR section 286.115), as well as the percentage of the caseload to be exempted from the time limit. These proposed time limits must be approved by ACF (45 CFR section 286.115). 2. Eligibility for Group of Individuals or Area of Service Delivery - Not Applicable June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -15 3. Eligibility for Subrecipients - Not Applicable G. Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking 1. Matching - Not Applicable 2.1 Level of Effort - Maintenance of Effort See IV, \"Other Information,\" for guidance on State MOE expended by Tribes. The following MOE provisions apply to any State funds that are counted towards the maintenance of effort requirements for TANF, whether such State funds are expended under the Commingled Federal/State, Segregated State, or Separate State Program funding op tions. a. State Basic MOE - Every fiscal year, a State must maintain an amount of \"qualified State expenditures\" (as defined in 42 USC 609(a)(7)(B) and 45 CFR section 263.2) for eligible families (as defined in 42 USC 609(a)(7)(B)(i)(IV) and 45 CFR section 263.2(b)) at least at the applicable percentage of the State's historic State expenditures. Therefore, all amounts claimed for or on behalf of eligible families, including amounts that result from State tax provisions, must be the result of expenditure (42 USC 609(a)(7)(A) and (B)(i)(I); 45 92.3, and 45 CFR section 92.24). States may claim qualified expenditures for eligible family members who are citizens or aliens. However, the particular aliens for whom a State may claim qualified expenditures will depend on the State funds used to provide the benefit or service (See III.E.1.a.(2), \"Eligibility for Individuals, Federal only , Commingled Federal/State, Segregated State, or Separate State Pro gram \") and whether the benefit or service is a Federal, State, or local public benefit (8 USC 1611, 1612(b), 1613, 1621 - 1622, and 1641(b)). Effective October 1, 2005, for their FY 2006 awards and ending with their FY 2008 awards, States may also claim ex penditures on pro -family activities if the expenditure is reasonably calculated to prevent and reduce the incidence of out -of-wedlock births (TANF purpose 3 \u2014see III.A.3.a, \"Activities Allowed or Unallowed - Federal Only, Commingled Federal/State, Segregate d State, Separate State Program\"), or encourage the formation and maintenance of two parent families (TANF purpose 4 \u2014 see III.A.3.a , \"Activities Allowed or Unallowed - Federal Only, Commingled Federal/State, Segregated State, Separate State Program\"). This new provision allows States to claim for MOE purposes all qualified pro-family expenditures for non-assistance benefits and services provided to or on behalf an individual or family, regardless of financial need or family composition, as long as the acti vity is reasonably calculated to accomplish TANF purpose 3 or TANF purpose 4. Non -assistance benefits June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -16 and services refer to activities that do not constitute \"assistance,\" as defined in 45 CFR section 260.31(a) (45 CFR sections 263.2(a)(4)(ii) and 263.2(b )). Effective October 1, 2008 (i.e., FY 2009 awards), States may only claim certain pro-family non -assistance expenditures that are reasonably calculated to accomplish TANF purpose 3 or TANF purpose 4. These pro-family expenditures consist of the allowa ble healthy marriage promotion and responsible fatherhood non -assistance activities enumerated in Title IV -A of the Social Security Act, sections 403(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 403(a)(2)(C)(ii), unless a limitation, restriction or prohibition under45 CFR part 263, Subpart A applies (45 CFR section 263.2(a)(4)(ii); TANF -ACF -PI-2008 dated October 23, 2008, available at http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/policy/tanf -pi.htm ). States may claim for MOE purposes the qualified pro -family healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood expenditures for non-assistance benefits and services provided to or on behalf an individual or family, regardless of financial need or family composition. States must limi t the provision of all other qualified MOE -funded assistance and non -assistance benefits to eligible families as defined at 45 CFR section 263.2(b), regardless of the TANF purpose that the expenditure is reasonably calculated to accomplish. The applicable percentage for each fiscal year is 80 percent of the amount of non -Federal funds the State spent in FY 1994 on AFDC or 75 percent if the State meets the Act's work participation rate requirements (42 USC 607(a)) for the fiscal year. This is termed \"basic MOE\" and the requirement is based on the Federal fiscal year. Qualified expenditures with respect to eligible families may come from all programs, i.e., the State's TANF program as well as programs separate from the State's TANF program. This requiremen t may be met through allowable State or local cash expenditures for goods and services, expenditures for allowable costs incurred by other non -Federal third parties (e.g., a non -profit organization, corporation, or other private party), cash donations by n on- Federal third parties or the value of third party in -kind contributions (42 USC 609(a)(7)(A) and 609(a)(7)(B)(i)(I); 45 CFR sections 263.1 and 263.2(e)). Section 409(a)(7)(B)(iv)(IV) of the Social Security Act allows States to count expenditures made as a condition of receiving Federal funds under Title IV, part A of the Social Security Act toward their MOE requirement. The DRA of 2005 (Pub. L. No. 109 -171), enacted February 8, 2006, added the Healthy Marriage Promotion and Responsible Fatherhood Grants and placed these provisions under Title IV, part A of the Social Security Act. If grantees are required to contribute a matching share of the total approved costs of Health Marriage Promotion and Responsible Fatherhood projects (discretionary grants awar ded for 5 -year project period beginning June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -17 in FFY 2007 under CFDA 93.086) under subsections 403(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 403(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Social Security Act, then State expenditures made to meet any required non -Federal share may count toward the State's MOE requirement, provided the expenditure also meets all applicable MOE requirements, restrictions, and limitations (45 CFR section 263.2(g)). If a State does not meet the basic MOE requirement, a penalty results. The penalty consists of a reduction of the S tate's Federal TANF grant for the following fiscal year in the amount of the difference between the State's qualified expenditures and the State's basic MOE (42 USC 609(a)(7)(A) and 45 CFR section 263.8). If application of a penalty results in a reduction of Federal TANF funding, a State is required in the immediately succeeding fiscal year to spend from State funds an amount equal to the total amount of the reduction, in addition to the otherwise required basic MOE. The additional funds must be spent in the TANF program, not under \"separate State programs.\" Such expenditures may not be claimed toward the basic MOE (42 USC 609(a)(12); 45 CFR sections 263.6(f) and 264.50). b. Limitations on \"Qualified State Expenditures\" - Expenditures under pre - existing prog rams, other than those that would have been previously authorized and allowable under the former AFDC, JOBS, Emergency Assistance, Child Care for AFDC recipients, At -Risk Child Care, or Transitional Child Programs may not count toward the State's MOE requi rement for the current year except to the extent that the current year's expenditures with respect to eligible families exceed the expenditures made under the State or local program in FY 1995. Exception: If the expenditures are for non -assistance pro -family activities as addressed in paragraph a. immediately above for FYs prior to October 1, 2008 and FYs beginning on or after October 1, 2008, then current year expenditures are not limited to those made with respect to eligible families. If total current fiscal year expenditures for allowable pro -family activities within TANF purpose three or TANF purpose 4 exceed total State expenditures in the program during FY 1995, then the State may claim the excess toward the State's MOE requirement. Thus, to be considered as \"exceeding\" the FY 1995 level, the expenditures must be new or additional expenditures. (42 USC 609(a)(7)(B)(i)(II)(aa) and 45 CFR section 263.5). In addition, expenditures by the State from amounts that originated from Federal funds may not c ount toward meeting a MOE requirement even if the expenditures \"qualify\" (42 USC 609(a)(7)(B)(iv)(I)). Except for child -care expenditures, double counting of expenditures to meet the basic MOE requirement is prohibited (42 USC June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -18 609(a)(7)(B)(iv)(II -IV); 45 C FR section 263.6). States may count State funds expended to meet the requirements of the Child Care Development Fund Matching Fund (CFDA 93.596) as basic MOE expenditures as long as such expenditures meet the requirements of 42 USC 609(a)(7). The maximum amount of child care expenditures that a State may double - count under this provision is the State's Matching Fund MOE amount under CFDA 93.596 (42 USC 609(a)(7)(B)(iv); 45 CFR sections 263.3 and 263.6). Expenditures for educational services/activities for eligible families to increase self -sufficiency, job training, and work count if the activities or services are not generally available to other State residents without cost and without regard to their income (42 USC 609(a)(7)(B)(i)(I)(cc); 45 CFR section 263.4, at http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/policy/tanf -pi.htm ). Administrative costs in connection with the activities that corre spond to the qualified expenditures may not exceed 15 percent of the total amount of countable expenditures for the fiscal year (42 USC 609(a)(7)(B)(i)(I)(dd); 45 CFR section 263.2(a)(5)). The basic MOE requirement expressly does not count expenditures for services or activities that only fall under 42 USC 604 (a)(2) (see III.A.1.a, \"Activities Allowed or expenditures\" (42 USC 609(a)(7)(B)(i)(I); 45 CFR section 263.2(a)(4)). c. Contingency Fund M OE - A State must spend more than 100 percent of its historic State expenditures for FY 1994 to keep any of the Federal contingency funds it received (42 USC 603(b), and 45 CFR sections 264.72(a)(2) and 264.70 through 77). This is termed \"Contingency Fund MOE.\" The Contingency Fund MOE requirement may be met only through qualified expenditures under the State's TANF program. Qualified expenditures consist of those defined and provided under 42 USC 609(a)(7)(B )(i) and 45 hrough (a)(5), and excludes expenditures described in 42 USC 609(a)(7)(B)(i)(I)(bb) and 45 CFR section 263.2(a)(2) (42 USC 603(b)(6)(B)(ii)(I) and 609(a)(10)). d. 1108(b) Territorial Matching Fund MOE Requirement - See IV, \"Other Infor mation,\" for guidance on the spending requirements applicable to the receipt of Matching Grant funds under section 1108(b) of the Social Security Act (section 1108(b)) (42 USC 1308(b)). 2.2 Level of Effort - Supplement Not Supplant - Not Applicable June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -19 3. Earm arking a. Federal Only and Commingled Federal/State A State may not spend more than 15 percent for administrative purposes, excluding expenditures for information technology and computerization needed for required tracking and monitoring, of the total combined amounts available under the State family assistance grant, supplemental grant for population increases, contingency funds, and emergency funds (42 USC 604(b)(1) and (2); 45 CFR sections 263.0 and 263.13). b. Federal Only and Commingled Federal/Sta te The average monthly number of families that include an adult or minor child head of household, or the spouse of the head of household, who has received assistance under any State program funded by Federal TANF funds for more than 60 countable months (wh ether or not consecutive) may not exceed 20 percent of the average monthly number of all families to which the State provided assistance during the fiscal year or the immediately preceding fiscal year (but not both), as the State may elect. To make this d etermination for a fiscal year, the average monthly number of families with a head of household or spouse of a head of household who received assistance for more than 60 months would be divided by the average monthly number of families that received assist ance in that fiscal year, or, if the State chooses, in the previous fiscal year (42 USC 608(a)(7)(C)(ii); 45 CFR sections 264.1(c) and (e)). (See III.E.1, \"Eligibility - Eligibility for Individuals,\" for related eligibility testing.) c. Tribes: Federal On ly and Commingled Federal/State -donated MOE The approved TFAP includes a negotiated administrative cost rate for that Tribe for that particular year. As approved in the TFAP, no Tribal TANF grantee may expend more than 35 percent of the total combined Federal TANF funds \u2014i.e., TFAG plus any emergenc y funds received by the Tribe for FY 2009 and FY 2010 \u2014for administrative costs during the first year, 30 percent during the second year, and 25 percent for the third and all subsequent grant periods. The approved tribal administrative cost rate may be fou nd in a letter of approval issued by the ACF/Division of Tribal Services and/or in the approved TFAP. The Tribal administrative cost cap is determined by multiplying the TFAG by the negotiated administrative rate for the fiscal year being tested (45 CFR s ection 286.50). Indirect costs may be applied to the Federal TANF funds based on the indirect cost rate negotiated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Department of Health and Human Services' Division of Cost Allocation, or another Federal agency. Howeve r, indirect costs applied to TANF June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -20 funding are subject to and included within the administrative cap limits (45 CFR section 285.55(d)). H. Period of Availability of Federal Funds 1. States Funds, other than contingency funds, are available to the State unti l expended for the purpose of providing assistance under the TANF program; contingency funds may be used for qualified expenditures only in the fiscal year for which the funding is provided (42 USC 603(b) and 604(e); 45 CFR sections 263.11(b) and 265.3(c)) . Current year TANF funds may be expended on assistance or non - assistance activities during the current fiscal year. However until FY 2009, the following restrictions to unobligated balances and current year obligations on non-assistance apply to the TAN F program. a. Unobligated Balances Reported on a State Fourth Quarter Financial Report For the Immediately Preceding Fiscal Year - Pursuant to 42 USC section 604(e) , a State may reserve amounts awarded to the State under section 403 (excluding Contingency Funds), without fiscal year limitation, to provide assistance under the State TANF program. Prior to October 1, 2008, any Federal unobligated balances carried forward into a fiscal year from a prior fiscal year may only be expended on benefits that meet the definition of assistance at 45 CFR section 260.31(a) and related administrative costs associated with providing such assistance. Effective October 1, 2008, States may use any Federal TANF funds carried forward into a fiscal year from a prior fiscal y ear to provide, without fiscal year limitation, any benefit or service provided under the State's TANF program (42 USC 604(e), as amended by ARRA). States have several options for claiming administrative costs when providing assistance with prior year unob ligated balances. The State may charge administrative costs related to providing the assistance to the prior year grant if the State has not expended 15 percent of the prior year's Adjusted SFAG on administrative costs previously. If the State has an unobligated balance and has expended the maximum 15 percent on administrative cost previously, the State may charge the administrative costs associated with providing the assistance to current year administrative costs. If the State chooses this option the a dministrative costs associated with providing assistance with prior year unobligated balances will be included within the 15 percent administrative cost cap for the current fiscal year. The Federal TANF 15 percent administrative cost cap is based on: (1) For States, the Adjusted SFAG (reported in Line 4, Column (A) on the ACF -196, TANF Financial Report) plus the Federal June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -21 Contingency Award (reported in Line 1, Column (D)) for States that receive Federal Contingency funds for the fiscal year, and Line 1, Colu mn (E) if a State received Federal emergency funds for fiscal year 2009 and 2010 divided by the total amount entered in Line 6j, Columns (A), (D) and (E); and (2) For Territories, the Adjusted SFAG (reported in Line 4, Columns (A) and (G) (if a Territory receives federal emergency TANF funds for fiscal year 2009 and 2010 on the ACF -196-TR, Territorial Financial Report) divided by the total amount entered in Line 6j, Column s (A) and (G) . . The administrative cost cap is tracked by the fiscal year for whic h the funds were awarded and not by the total the State expends on administrative costs in a given fiscal year. States may only charge administrative costs to a prior year grant when it is administering assistance with a prior year unobligated balance. b. Current Fiscal Year Federal Expenditures on Non -Assistance -Prior to October 1, 2008, the State must obligate by September 30 of the current fiscal year any funds for expenditures on non -assistance. Non -assistance expenditures are reported on Line 6 cate gories on the ACF -196 TANF Financial Report and the ACF -196-TR, Territorial Financial Report. The State must liquidate these obligations by September 30 of the immediately succeeding Federal fiscal year for which the funds were awarded. If the final liqu idation amounts are lower than the original amount obligated, this difference must be included in the Unobligated Balance Line Item for the year in which they were awarded. Unobligated balances from previous fiscal years may only be expended on benefits t hat meet the definition of assistance at 45 CFR section 260.31(a) and related administrative costs associated with providing such assistance. Effective October 1, 2008, States may use Federal TANF funds carried forward into a fiscal year from a prior fisca l year to provide, without fiscal year limitation, any benefit or service provided under the State's TANF program (42 USC 604(e), as amended by ARRA). June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -22 2. Tribes Prior to October 1, 2008, a Tribe may reserve amounts awarded to it, without fiscal year limita tion, to provide assistance under the Tribal TANF program. However, a Tribe may only expend funds beyond the fiscal year in which awarded on benefits that meet the definition of assistance at 45 CFR section 286.10 or on the administrative costs directly a ssociated with providing that assistance (45 CFR section 286.60). Effective October 1, 2008, Tribes may use Federal TANF funds carried forward into a fiscal year from a prior fiscal year to provide, without fiscal year limitation, any benefit or service p rovided under the Tribe's TANF program (42 USC 604(e), as amended by ARRA). a. Unobligated Balances Reported on a Tribal Annual SF -269 Financial Report For the Immediately Preceding Fiscal Year - Pursuant to section 404(e) of the Act (as amended by Pub. L . No. 106 -169, the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999), a Tribe may reserve amounts awarded to the Tribe under section 412, without fiscal year limitation, to provide assistance under the Tribal TANF program. Tribes have several options for claiming adm inistrative costs when providing assistance with prior year unobligated balances. The Tribe may charge administrative costs related to providing the assistance to the prior year grant if the Tribe has not exceeded its negotiated administrative cap for tha t fiscal year, on administrative costs previously. If the Tribe has an unobligated balance and has exceeded the negotiated administrative cap for the previous fiscal year, the Tribe may charge the administrative costs associated with providing the assista nce to current year administrative costs. If the Tribe chooses this option, the administrative costs associated with providing assistance with prior year unobligated balances will be included within the negotiated administrative cost cap for the current f iscal year. b. Current Fiscal Year Federal Expenditures on Non -Assistance - Prior to October 1, 2008, a Tribe must obligate by September 30 of the current fiscal year any funds for expenditures on non -assistance. The Tribe must liquidate these obligations by September 30 of the immediately succeeding Federal fiscal year for which the funds were awarded. If the final liquidation amounts are lower than the original amount obligated, this difference must be included in the Unobligated Balance Line Item for the year in which they were awarded, on the SF -269 report. Effective October 1, 2008, Tribes may use Federal TANF funds carried forward into a fiscal year from a prior fiscal year to provide, without fiscal year limitation, any benefit or service provided u nder the Tribe's TANF program (42 USC 604(e), as amended by ARRA). TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -23 ARRA Emergency Contingency Funds - Once a jurisdiction receives emergency funds for which it has qualified, the funds are available until expended and may be used in the same manner as Fede ral TANF funds, except that they may not be transferred to the Social Services Block Grant (Title XX) (CFDA 93.667) or the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CFDA 93.575). L. Reporting 1. Financial Reporting a. SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement - Not Applicable b.

No. 102 -477 demonstration project. Beginning with the FY 2009 Award, Tribes must use this form to repor t TANF expenditures quarterly. This form must be used for reporting both regular TANF grant funds and ARRA -Emergency Fund for TANF Tribal Programs funds. e. Form 12g, Tribal TANF Financial Addendum Report (OMB Control No. Applicable to Triba l TANF grantees administering TANF programs under a Pub. L. No. 102 -477 demonstration project. Not applicable to States. This report must be filed with the Tribe's annual Pub. L. No. 102 -477 financial report ( OMB Control No. 1076 -0135 ). This report is r equired to be submitted annually and the information must be reported on a FY basis, which runs from October 1 through September 30. The report must cover the entire immediately preceding FY and include all expenditures, obligations, and unliquidated obli gations of Federal funds for the period. In addition, the report must be based on and account for the entire Federal Tribal TANF award that was issued for the fiscal year. A separate 12g report is to be submitted for each fiscal year where Federal funds have not been completely expended. For example, Tribes must submit a report regarding the expenditure of FY 2008 funds in FY 2009 separately from the report on the use of FY 2009 funds in FY 2009. Until the Tribe reports that all of the Federal funds awa rded for a given fiscal year have been expended, Tribes must continue to submit reports on the use of funds from that fiscal year. Further, a narrative report is to be prepared that describes the activities and services covered under the category \"Total N on-Assistance Expenditures\" (see line 4 of the report). June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -24 f. Tribal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) ACF -196T, Financial Report For 102 -477 Tribes (OMB approval number pending ) - Applicable to Tribes administering TANF programs under a Pub. L.

This report is required to be submitted quarterly to the Division of Workforce Devel opment in the Office of Indian Energy and Economic Development, Department of the Interior with a copy to ACF. g. ACF -196, TANF Financial Report (OMB No. 0970 -0247) - States are required to submit this report quarterly in lieu of the SF -425, Federal Financ ial Report (financial status ). Each State files quarterly expenditure data on the State's use of Federal TANF funds, State TANF MOE expenditures, and State expenditures of MOE funds in separate State programs. If a State is expending Federal TANF funds r eceived in prior fiscal years, it must file a separate quarterly TANF Financial Report for each fiscal year that provides information on the expenditures of that year's TANF funds. This form must be used for reporting both regular TANF grant funds and ARR A-Emergency Fund for TANF State Programs funds. h. ACF -196-TR, Territorial Financial Report - Territories report their expenditures and other fiscal data in this report (45 CFR section 265.3(c)). The Territories must report quarterly on their use of Federa l TANF funds, Territorial TANF MOE expenditures, expenditures of MOE funds in separate \"State\" programs, expenditures made as a result of receiving matching grant funds under 42 USC 1308(b), and expenditures made under the Federal Adult Assistance Programs (Titles I, X, XIV, and XVI of the Social Security Act) (42 USC subchapters I, X, XIV, and XVI and 42 USC 1308(a)). This form must be used for reporting both regular TANF grant funds and ARRA -Emergency Fund for TANF Territorial Programs funds . See III.G.2 .1, \"Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking - Level of Effort - Maintenance of Effort,\" and IV, \"Other Information,\" for additional guidance on Territories' spending levels. 2. Performance Reporting a. ACF -199, TANF Report No. 0970 -0215 ). One of the critical areas of this reporting is the work participation data, which serve as the basis for ACF to determine whether States and Tribes have met the required work participation rates. A penalty may apply for failure to meet the required rates. June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -25 States Work Participation Rates State agencies must meet or exceed their minimum annual work participation rates. The minimum work participation rates are 50 percent for the overall rate and 90 percent f or the two -parent rate. A State's minimum work participation rate may be reduced by its caseload reduction credit. HHS may penalize the State by an amount of up to 21 percent of the SFAG for violation of this provision (42 USC 609(a)(4); 45 CFR section 2 62.1(a)(4)). ACF -199 (TANF Data Report) Key Line Items - The following line items contain critical information for making the preceding determinations and for other program purposes.

Tribal TANF agencies have the June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -26 option to negotiate and choose from among a number of work participation rates (e.g., separate rates for one - and two -parent families or an \"all -families with parents\" rate where one - and two -parent families are combined). HHS may penalize the Tribe by a maximum of five percent of the TFAG for the first violation of this provision. The penalty increases by an additional two percent for each subsequent violation up to a maximum of 21 percent (42 USC 612(c) and 612(g)(2); (65 FR 8545, Appendix A, February 18, 2000) Key Line Items - The following line items contain critical information used in making a d etermination of a Tribe's Work Participation Rates. Review the Tribe's TANF plan for a fiscal year to identify the type of family required to participate in work activities and the minimum number of hours per week that the adults and minor heads of house hold in the family must participate in work activities (45 CFR section 286.80).

Subaward Reporting under the Transparency Act -Applicable June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -29 N. Special Tests and Provisions Special Tests and Provisions 1 through 5 apply to a State's TANF program, not to a Tribal TANF program. 1. Child Sup port Non -Cooperation Compliance Requirement - If the State agency responsible for administering the State plan approved under Title IV -D of the Social Security Act determines that an individual is not cooperating with the State in establishing paternity, o r in establishing, modifying or enforcing a support order with respect to a child of the individual, and reports that information to the State agency responsible for TANF, the State TANF agency must (1) deduct an amount equal to not less than 25 percent f rom the TANF assistance that would otherwise be provided to the family of the individual, and (2) may deny the family any TANF assistance. HHS may penalize a State for up to five percent of the SFAG for failure to substantially comply with this required S tate child support program (42 USC 608(a)(2) and 609(a)(8); 45 CFR sections 264.30 and 264.31). Audit Objective - Determine whether, after notification by the State IV -D agency, the TANF agency has taken necessary action to reduce or deny TANF assistance. Suggested Audit Procedures a. Review the State's TANF policies and operating procedures concerning this requirement. b. Test a sample of cases referred by the IV -D agency to the TANF agency to ascertain if benefits were reduced or denied as required. 2. Income Eligibility and Verification System Compliance Requirements - Each State shall participate in the Income Eligibility and Verification System (IEVS) required by section 1137 of the Social Security Act as amended. Under the State Plan the State is req uired to coordinate data exchanges with other federally assisted benefit programs, request and use income and benefit information when making eligibility determinations, and adhere to standardized formats and procedures in exchanging information with other programs and agencies. Specifically, the State is required to request and obtain information as follows (42 USC 1320b -7; 45 CFR section 205.55): a. Wage information from the State Wage Information Collection Agency (SWICA) should be obtained for all appl icants at the first opportunity following receipt of the application, and for all recipients on a quarterly basis. b. Unemployment Compensation (UC) information should be obtained for all applicants at the first opportunity, and in each of the first three months in which the individual is receiving aid. This information should also be obtained in each of the first three months following any recipient -reported loss of employment. If June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -30 an individual is found to be receiving UC, the information should be requested until benefits are exhausted. c. All available information from the Social Security Administration for all applic ants at the first opportunity (See Federal Tax Return Information below). d. Information from the Immigration and Naturalization Service and any other information from other agencies in the State or in other States that might provide income or other useful information. e. Unearned income from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (See Federal Tax Return Information below). Federal Tax Return Information - Information from the IRS and some information from the Social Security Administration (SSA) is Federal tax return information and subject to use and disclosure restrictions by 26 USC 6103. Individual data received from the SSA's Beneficiary Earnings Exchange Record (BEER), consisting of wage, self -employment, and certain other income information is considered Federal tax return information. However, benefits payments such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) are SSA data and not Federal tax return information. Under 26 USC 6103, disclosure of Federal tax return information from IEVS is restricted to officer s and employees of the receiving agency. Outside (non -agency) personnel (including auditors) are not authorized to access this information either directly or by disclosure from receiving agency personnel. The State is required to review and compare the in formation obtained from each data exchange against information contained in the case record to determine whether it affects the individual's eligibility or level of assistance, benefits or services under the TANF program, with the following exceptions: a. The State is permitted to exclude categories of information items from follow -up if it has received approval from ACF after having demonstrated that follow -up is not cost effective. b. The State is permitted, with ACF approval, to exclude information item s from certain data sources without written justification if it followed up previously through another source of information. However, information from these data sources that is not duplicative and provides new leads may not be excluded without written j ustification. The State shall verify that the information is accurate and applicable to the case circumstances either through the applicant or recipient, or through a third party, if such determination is appropriate based on agency experience or is requir ed before taking adverse action based on information from a Federal computer matching program subject to the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act (45 CFR section 205.56). For applicants, if the information is received during the application process , the State must use the information, to the extent possible, to determine eligibility. For recipients or individuals for whom a decision could not be made prior to authorization of benefits, the June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -31 State must initiate a notice of case action or an entry in the case record that no case action is necessary within 45 days of its receipt of the information. Under certain circumstances, action may be delayed beyond 45 days for no more than 20 percent of the information items targeted for follow -up (45 CFR sectio n 205.56). HHS may penalize a State for up to two percent of the SFAG for failure to participate in IEVS (42 USC 1320b -7; 45 CFR sections 264.10 and 264.11). Audit Objective - Determine whether the State has established and implemented the required IEVS system for data matching, and verification and use of such data. (This audit objective does not include Federal tax return information as discussed in the compliance requirements.) Suggested Audit Procedures a. Review State operating manuals a nd other instructions to gain an understanding of the State's implementation of the IEVS system. b. Test a sample of TANF cases subject to IEVS to ascertain if the State: (1) Used the IEVS to determine eligibility in accordance with the State Plan. (2) Requested and obtained the data from the State Wage Information Collection Agency, the State unemployment agency, the Social Security Administration (excluding Federal tax return information as discussed in the compliance requirements), the Immigration and Na turalization Service, and other agencies, as appropriate, and performed the required data matching. (3) Properly considered the information obtained from the data matching in determining eligibility and the amount of TANF benefits. 3. Penalty for Refusal t o Work Compliance Requirement - State agency must reduce or terminate the assistance payable to the family if an individual in a family receiving assistance refuses to work, subject to any good cause or other exemptions established by the State. HHS may penalize the State by an amoun t not less than one percent and not more than five percent of the SFAG for violation of this provision (42 USC 609(a)(14); 45 CFR sections 261.14, 261.16, and 261.54). Audit Objective - Determine whether the State agency is reducing or terminating the assistance grant of those individuals who refuse to engage in work and are not subject to good cause or other exceptions established by the State. June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -32 Suggested Audit Procedures a. Review the State's TANF policies and operating procedures concerning this requireme nt. b. Test a sample of TANF cases where the individual is not working, and ascertain if benefits were reduced or denied to individuals who are not exempt under State rules or do not meet State good cause criteria. 4. Adult Custodial Parent of Child under Six When Child Care Not Available Compliance Requirement - If an individual is a single custodial parent caring for a child under the age of six, the State may not reduce or terminate assistance for the individual's refusal to engage in required work if the individual demonstrates to the State an inability to o btain needed child care for one or more of the following reasons: (a) unavailability of appropriate child care within a reasonable distance from the individual's home or work site; (b) unavailability or unsuitability of informal child care by a relative or under other arrangements; or (c) unavailability of appropriate and affordable formal child care arrangements. The determination of inability to find child care is made by the State. HHS may penalize a State for up to five percent of the SFAG for violati on of this provision (42 USC 609(a)(11); 45 CFR sections 261.15, 261.56, and 261.57). Audit Objective - Determine whether the State has improperly reduced or terminated assistance to single custodial parents who refused to work because of ina bility to obtain child care for a child under the age of six. Suggested Audit Procedures a. Gain an understanding of the criteria established by the State to determine benefits for a single custodial parent who refused to work because of inability to obtai n child care for a child who is under the age of six. b. Select a sample of single custodial parents caring for a child who is under 6 years of age whose benefits have been reduced or terminated. c. Ascertain if the benefits were improperly reduced or term inated because of inability to obtain child care. 5. Penalty for Failure to Comply with Work Verification Plan Compliance Requirement - The State agency must maintain adequate documentation, verification, and internal control procedures to ensure the accur acy of the data used in calculating work participation rates. In so doing, it must have in place procedures to: determine whether its work activities may count for participation rate purposes; determine how to count and verify reported hours of work; iden tify who is a work - eligible individual; and control internal data transmission and accuracy. Each State agency must comply with its HHS -approved Work Verification Plan in effect for the June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -33 period that is audited. HHS may penalize the State by an amount not less than one percent and not more than five percent of the SFAG for violation of this provision (42 USC 601, 602, and 261.65). Audit Objective - Determine whether the State agency is complying with its Work Verification Plan, including adequate documentation, verification, and internal control procedures. Suggested Audit Procedures a. Review the State's Work Verification Plan and operating proc edures concerning this requirement. b. Test a sample of TANF cases that have been reported to HHS under 45 CFR sections 265.3(b)(1) and 265.3(d)(1) and ascertain if the work participation rate data have been documented, verified, and reported in accordance with the State's Work Verification Plan. 6. Accountability, Deposit, and Investment of Lump -Sum Drawdowns Compliance Requirement - Effective October 1, 2011 , once program funds are available, Tribal TANF grantees participating in a Pub. L. No. 102 -477 demonstration project may draw down the full amount of available Pub. L. No. 102-477 TANF demonstration project funding . Lump -sum drawdown/ payments must be retained in clearly identifiable cash or investment accounts which are readily accessible for payment of allowable expenditures in accordance with the approved Pub. L. No. 102 -477 plan from which it was derived and i n compliance with applicable requirements and, to the extent practical, earn interest. This does not require a Tribal TANF grantee to open a separate account with a financial institution or an investment manager. All eligible funds deposited in an appropriate account and earmarked as Pub. L. No. 102-477 demonstration funds must be identified as such. Investments of lump -sum payments must comp ly with 25 USC 450e -3, \"Investment of Advance Payments: Restrictions.\" All interest earned must be used on allowable expenditures in accordance with the approved Pub.

(Tri-Agency 477 Tribal Leader Letter 9 -30-11, Tri -Agency Letter to Committee on Appropriations 10-7-11, and Frequently Asked Questions Regarding P.L. 102 -477 (Questions 2 through 4) found at http://www.indianaffairs.gov/WhoWeAre/AS IA/IEED/DWD/index.htm ) Tribal TANF grantees receiving lump -sum drawdown/payments under a Pub. L. No. 102-477 demonstration project may inve st these payments (some recipients refer to these advance payments as \"deferred revenue\") before such funds are expended in accordance with the approved Pub. L. No. 102 -477 plan , so long as such funds are (1) invested only in obligations of the United Stat es or in obligations or securities that are guaranteed or insured by the United States, or mutual (or other) funds registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and which only invest in obligations of the United States or June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -34 securities that are guara nteed or insured by the United States, or (2) deposited only in accounts that are insured by an agency or instrumentality of the United States, or are fully collateralized to ensure protection of the advance funds, even in the event of a bank failure (25 U SC 450e -3). Audit Objective - Determine whether the Tribal TANF grantee participating in a Pub. L. No. 102-477 demonstration project has properly accounted for, deposited, and invested lump -sum drawdowns/payments received under a Pub. L. No. 102 -477 demons tration project and unexpended funds are identifiable and readily accessible for use to carry out the approved Pub. L. No. 102 -477 plan . Suggested Audit Procedures a. Obtain and review the Tribal TANF grantee policies and procedures and verify that those proc edures comply with the requirements for lump -sum drawdowns/payments under a Pub. L. No. 102 -477 demonstration project. b. Test lump -sum drawdowns/payments and ascertain if they were properly accounted for, deposited, and invested throughout the audit period. c. Review unused/unexpended TANF lump -sum drawdowns/payments at year -end, and verify that they are properly invested/deposited and are identifiable and readily accessible to carry out the work outlined in the approved Pub. L. No. 102 - 477 plan . IV. OTHER INFOR MATION Transfers out of TANF As described in III.A.1.b, \"Activities Allowed or Unallowed,\" States (not Tribes) may transfer a limited amount of Federal TANF funds into the Social Services Block Grant (Title XX) (CFDA 93.667) and the Child Care and Developm ent Block Grant (CFDA 93.575). These transfers are reflected in lines 2 and 3 of both the quarterly TANF Financial Report ACF -196, and the quarterly Territorial Financial Report ACF -196-TR. The amounts transferred out of TANF are subject to the requireme nts of the program into which they are transferred and should not be included in the audit universe and total expenditures of TANF when determining Type A programs. The amount transferred out should not be shown as TANF expenditures on the Schedule of Exp enditures of Federal Awards, but should be shown as expenditures for the program into which they are transferred. ARRA TANF funds may not be transferred out of TANF. State MOE Expended by Tribes A State may provide a Tribe State -donated MOE funds that are expended by the Tribe. For the Tribe, State -donated MOE funds are not Federal awards expended, shall not be considered in determining Type A programs, and shall not be shown as expenditures on t he Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards. However, State -donated MOE funds expended by a Tribe shall June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -35 be included by the auditor of the State when testing III.G.2.1, \"Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking - Level of Effort - Maintenance of Effort.\" Under the Commingled Federal/State -donated MOE option, Tribes may commingle their State - donated MOE funds with Federal grant funds. Because of the commingling, the audit of the Tribe will include testing of the State -donated MOE and the auditor of the State should consider relying on this testing in accordance with auditing standards and OMB Circular A -133. However, the State -donated MOE is not considered Federal awards expended by the Tribe. Tribal TANF Grantees under a Pub. L. No. 102 -477 Demonstration Pr oject Effective October 1, 2011, the requirements contained in the 2009, 2010, and 2011 Compliance Supplements in the BIA Cross -Cutting Section page 4 -15.000 -4, IV , \"Other Information, \" were suspended. The auditor is not required to consider audit finding s or modifications of audit opinions for completed audits which were based solely on the page suspended when the auditor is performing the risk based approach under OMB Circular A -133 in the two subsequent year audits. Tribal TANF grantees are not required to take corrective action and the respective Federal agencies will not follow -up on audit findings based solely on the page suspended. For example, a material non -compliance or material weakness in internal control over compliance based solely on the page suspended would not preclude a program from being low risk or an entity from qualifying as a low risk auditee in the two subsequent yea r audits. For T ribal TANF grantees participating in Pub. L. No. 102-477 demonstration projects during the period covered by this Supplement : (1) the auditor should use the approved P ub. L. No. 102-477 plan in determining compliance requirements to be tes ted; (2) the auditor is permitted to audit the P ub. L. No. 102-477 demonstration project as a cluster of programs; (3) the Tribal TANF grantee may present demonstrati on project expenditures in its Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA) in the sa me manner in which it had been presenting these expenditures in the period immediately prior to this Supplement or in the same manner in which it had been presenting these expenditures in the period immediately prior to the 2009 Compliance Supplement. (Tri-Agency 477 Tribal Leader Letter 9 -30-11, Tri -Agency Letter to Committee on Appropriations 10 -7-11, and Frequently Asked Questions Regarding P.

June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -36 Spending Levels of the Territories A funding ceiling applies to Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa and Puerto Rico. The programs subject to the funding ceiling are the Adult A ssistance programs under Titles I, X, XIV, and XVI of the Social Security Act; TANF; Foster Care (CFDA 93.658); Adoption Assistance (CFDA 93.659) Independent Living (CFDA 93.674) programs under Title IV -E of the Social Security Act; and the matching gr ant under section 1108(b). Total payments to each territory may not exceed the following: Guam - $4,686,000; Virgin Islands - $3,554,000; Puerto Rico - $107,255,000; and American Samoa - $1,000,000. However, the TANF Family Assistance Grant cannot exceed the territory's fixed annual amount (42 USC 1308(a) and (c)). Territorial Matching Grant Funding Stream The Matching Grant under section 1108(b) of the Social Security Act (42 USC 1308(b)) is an optional funding stream for the Territories. Each fiscal ye ar, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam may receive a Matching Grant in an amount that equals 75 percent of the amount, if any, by which the territory's total expenditures during the fiscal year under the TANF program (including transfers to the CCDF (CFDA 93.575 and 93.596) and SSBG (CFDA 93.667) programs) and the Foster Care program exceed the total of: (1) the amount that equals the territory's Federal TANF grant payable (without regard to any applicable penalties; and (2) the amount that equals t he sum expended by the territory during fiscal year 1995 in the AFDC and JOBS programs (other than for child care). Thus, each territory receiving a Matching Grant has two expenditure requirements: (1) expend an amount that equals the territory's Federal T ANF block grant amount; and (2) expend an amount that equals the territory's share of expenditures in the AFDC and JOBS programs (other than for child care) during FY 1995. This latter requirement is the territory's Matching Grant MOE expenditure requirem ent. Territorial expenditures used to receive section 1108(b) Federal Matching Grant funds are expenditures that exceed the sum of these two expenditure requirements. Territorial expenditures in the TANF program in excess of the total spending requiremen t that are used to receive section 1108(b) Federal Matching Grant funds may be reported in either column (C) or column (D) of the ACF -196-TR, but not in both (45 CFR section 264.80(a)(1)). The amounts of the two expenditure requirements are as follows: Territory Federal TANF Block Grant Spending Amount (FGA)2 Matching Grant MOE Spending Amount3 Total Spending Requirement Puerto Rico $71,562,501 $0 $0 2 Amount reported in Column (C) of the ACF -196-TR. 3 Amount r eported in Column (D) of the ACF -196-TR. June 2012 TANF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.558 -37 See 45 CFR section 264.82 for the types of expenditures using Federal and Territorial funds that may count toward meeting the required block grant spending amount. 45 CFR section 264.81 specifies the types of expenditures that may count toward meeting the Matching Grant MOE requirement. Territorial expenditures may count only once, i.e., to meet either expenditure requirement or as an excess expenditure to receive Federal Matchin g Grant funds under 1108(b). (45 CFR sections 264.80 through 264.85 include the requirements pertinent to receipt of matching funds under section 1108(b)). June 2012 Child Support Enforcement HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.563 -1 DEPARTME NT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CFDA 93.563 CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT I. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The objectives of the Child Support Enforcement programs are to: (1) enforce support obligations owed by non -custodial parents, (2) locate absent parents, (3) establish paternity, and (4) obtain child and spousal support. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Administration and Services The Child Support Enforcement programs are administered at the Federal level by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Under the State Child Support Enforcement program (State program), funding is provided to the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam, based on a State plan and amendments, as required by changes in statutes, rules, regulations, interpretations, and court decisions, submitted to and approved by OCSE. Under the Tribal Child Support Enforcement program (tribal program), funding is provided to federally recognized tribes and tribal organizations based on applications, plans, and amendments, as required by changes in statutes, rules, regulations, and interpretations, submitted to and approved by the ACF Central Office. The State program is an open -ended entitlement program that allows the State to be funded at a specified percentage, Federal financial participation (FFP), for eligible program costs. Under the tribal program, tribes receive funding for a specified percentag e of program costs. State child support agencies are required to conduct self -reviews of their programs. The first round of self -assessments was required to be completed by March 31, 1999 ( 42 USC 654(15) and 45 CFR part 308). Source of Governing Requireme nts The Child Support Enforcement programs are authorized under title IV -D of the Social Security Act, as amended. This includes amendments as the result of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) (Pub. L. No. 109 -171) and the American Recovery and Reinve stment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. L. No. 111 -5, Section 2104, 123 Stat 449 ). The State program is codified at 42 USC 651 through 669. Implementing program regulations for the State program are published at 45 CFR parts 301 through 308. In addition, with r egard to eligibility and other provisions, these programs are closely related to programs authorized under other titles of the Social Security Act, including the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program (CFDA 93.558), the Medicaid program (C FDA 93.778), and the Foster Care (title IV -E) program (CFDA 93.658). June 2012 Child Support Enforcement HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.563 -2 The tribal program is authorized under title IV -D of the Social Security Act, as amended, at 42 USC 655. Implementing program regulations are published at 45 CFR part 309 ( Federal Register, March 30, 2004, 69 FR 16639). These regulations are available at http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cse/pol/AT/2004/at -04-01a.pdf . Awards made under the State program with funding periods beginning on or after October 1, 2003, are subject to the HHS implementation of the A -102 Common Rule, 45 CFR part 92 (Federal Register , September 8, 2003, 68 FR 52843 -52844). The State program also is subject to 45 CFR part 95. The triba l program is subject to the administrative requirements of 45 CFR part 92 (45 CFR part 309. Both programs are subject to the cost principles under 2 CFR PART 225 - Cost Principles for State, Local, and Indian Tribal Governments (OMB Circular A -87,) as provided in Cost Principles and Procedures for Developing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Agreements with the Federal Government , HHS Publication ASMB C -10, available on the Internet at http://rates.psc.gov/fms/dca/asmb%20c -10.pdf ). States and tribes are required to adopt and adhere to their own statutes and regulati ons for program implementation, consistent with the requirements of title IV -D and the approved State plan/tribal plan and application. III. COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS In developing the audit procedures to test compliance with the requirements for a Federal program, the auditor should look first to Part 2, Matrix of Compliance Requirements, to identify which of the 14 types of compliance requirements described in Part 3 are applicable and then look to Parts 3 and 4 for the details of the requirements. A. Activities Allowed or Unallowed 1. Activities Allowed Consistent with the approved title IV -D plan, allowable activities include the following. A more complete listing of allowable types of activities, with examples, as appropriate, is included at 45 CFR sec tions 304.20 through 304.22 for the State program and 45 CFR sections 309.145(a) through (o) for the tribal program. a.

G. Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking 1. Matching State programs The Federal share of program costs related to determining paternity, including those related to the planning, design, de velopment, installation and enhancement of the statewide computerized support enforcement system is 66 percent. For costs incurred on or before September 30, 2006, the Federal share of laboratory costs for determining paternity was 90 percent (42 USC 655( a)(1)(C) and (a)(2)(C); 45 CFR sections 304.20(c) and 304.30 ). Effective October 1, 2006, the Federal share of laboratory costs for determining paternity is 66 percent (DRA, Section 7308). A Federal match of 66 percent is available for State administrativ e costs of carrying out child support enforcement program activities under title IV -D of the Social Security Act. ARRA temporarily changed the child support authorization language to allow States to use Federal incentive payments provided to States in acc ordance with Section 458 of the Social Security Act as their State share of expenditures eligible for Federal match. This change is effective October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2010. This change is in effect for any incentive funds expended during FY 2009 and FY 2010, including incentives earned and not expended in prior years (i.e., prior to October 1, 2008). Incentive payments expended during FY 2008 (October 1, 2007 -September 30, 2008) are not eligible for additional Federal funds. The requirement s of Section 458(f) of the Social Security Act and 45 CFR section 305.35 regarding \"reinvestment\" of incentive funds remain in effect. Tribal programs The Federal share of program costs is 90 percent for the first 3 years and 80 percent thereafter. Unless waived by the Secretary, the tribe or tribal organization must provide the 10 percent and 20 percent share, respectively (45 CFR sections 309.130(c), (d), and (e)). 2.

State programs - This program operates on a cash accounting basis and each year's funding and accounting is discrete; i.e., there is no carry -forward of unobligated funds. To be eligible for Federal funding, claims must be submitted to ACF within two years after the calendar quarter in which the State made the expenditure. This limitation does not apply to any claim for an adjustment to prior year costs or resulting from a court -ordered retroactive adjustment (45 CFR sections 95.7, 95.13, and 95.19). 2. Tribal programs - A tribe or tribal organization must obligate its Federal title IV - D grant funds no later than the last day of the funding period (equivalent to the Federal fiscal year) for which they were awarded (\"obligation per iod\") or the funds must be returned to ACF. Unless an extension is granted by ACF, valid obligations must be liquidated no later than the last day of the 12 -month period immediately following the obligation period or the funds must be returned to ACF (45 CFR sections 309.135(b), (c), and (e)).

Under AT -09-02, the reporting instructions for the OCSE -396A report, \"Child Support Enforcement Program Ex penditure Report, \" were revised to reflect the change in ARRA which temporarily allows States to use Federal incentive payments provided to States in accordance with Section 458 of the Act as their State June 2012 Child Support Enforcement HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.563 -7 share of expenditures eligible for Federal match. This temporary change is effective October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2010. See also III.L.4 below.) 2. Performance Reporting - Not Applicable 3. Special Reporting - Not Applicable 4. Section 1512 ARRA Reporting - Not Applicable There have been no substantive changes in the expenditure reporting burden for States (or Territories) and subrecipients (e.g., counties) as a result of ARRA. As before, State expenditures are reported quarterly to the Federal government on the OCSE -396A form. Also consistent with existing requirements, claims for administrative expenditures, including administrative expenditures using incentive payments, must be adequately documented for regular audit purposes. Procedures involving subrecipient expendit ure reporting within each State or Territory are unaffected by ARRA. Subrecipient reporting practices remain under the jurisdiction of the State or Territory and are subject to that State or Territory's rules and regulations. 5. Subaward Reporting Under the Transparency Act - Applicable June 2012 Refugee and Entrant Assistance HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.566 -1 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CFDA 93.566 REFUGEE AND ENTRANT ASSISTANCE \u2014STATE -ADMINISTERED PROGRAMS I. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The objective of the Refugee and Entrant Assistance Program is to provide States with funds to assist refugees and Cuban/Haitian entrants in attaining economic and social self -sufficiency as soon as possible after their initial placement in U.S. communities. (The term \"refugee\" is used to mean an individual who meets the immigration status requirements under 45 CFR section 400.43.) II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Administration and Services The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), administers the Refugee and Entrant Assistance Program on behalf of the Federal Government. ORR provides funds to Stat es through two grant programs: (1) Cash/Medical/Administration (CMA) and (2) Refugee Social Services (RSS). CMA Grants CMA grants are made to States upon submittal of an approved State plan and Annual State estimate. CMA grants reimburse States for the c osts of providing: 1. Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA) - monthly cash benefits for refugees who do not meet the eligibility requirements of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs; 2. Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA) - medical assistance to refugees who do not meet all eligibility requirements for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and medical screening to all refugees if done within the refugees' first 90 days upon arrival to the U.S.; 3. Refugee Unaccompanied Minor (RUM) Assistance - Child welfare services and foster care to unaccompanied refugee minors (until age 18 or higher age as the State's Title IV - B plan prescribes); and 4. Administrative costs associated with providin g RCA, RMA, and RUM, and costs incurred for the overall management of the State's refugee program. June 2012 Refugee and Entrant Assistance HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.566 -2 Refugee Social Service Grants Refugee Social Services grants are made to States upon submittal of an approved State plan and an Annual Services Plan. RSS gr ants are allocated to States by formula according to each State's percentage of the national refugee and entrant population for the most recent three years. States are required to use these funds to help refugees become economically self -sufficient as qui ckly as possible, primarily through the provision of employment services. A State may administer the program as a publicly State -administered program, or may form a public/private partnership by engaging non -profit organizations to deliver program service s and benefits. A State administered program must follow the TANF rules on financial eligibility and payment levels unless the State receives an approved waiver under 45 CFR section 400.300 to continue administering RCA according to the rules of the forme r Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) Program. Subject to certain limitations, a public/private program may operate according to its own rules.

(c) They meet the financial eligibility requirements of the applicable type of RCA program: AFDC -type (45 CFR State -administered (45 CFR section 400.66). In all three types, the administering agency may not treat the following as income or resources available to the applicant: resources remaining in the applicant's country of origin, income earned by the applicant's sponsor, or cash a ssistance the applicant may have received under reception and placement programs administered by the Department of State or Justice (45 CFR sections 400.45(f)(2), 400.59(b) through (d), and 400.66(b) through (d)). (d) They are not full -time students in ins titutions of higher education (45 CFR section 400.53). June 2012 Refugee and Entrant Assistance HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.566 -7 (e) If they are mandatory work registrants, they have not, without good cause, failed or refused to meet the work requirements of 45 CFR section 400.75(a), or voluntarily quit a job or refused an offer of appropriate employment within 30 consecutive calendar days immediately prior to the application for assistance. The payment of RCA assistance to an otherwise eligible client must be terminated if the client fails to meet this requirement (45 CFR secti ons 400.77 and 400.82(a)). (2) Benefit Level - Benefit payments in a State -administered AFDC - type RCA program must be based on the AFDC rate (45 CFR section 400.45(f)(2)). Benefit payments in a State -administered TANF -type RCA program must be based on the TANF rate (45 CFR section 400.66(a)). Benefit payments in a public/private RCA program may neither exceed the rate described in 45 CFR section 400.60(a), nor be less than the State's TANF payment rate (45 CFR section 400.60(b)). c. Refugee Medical Assis tance (1) Eligibility Criteria Eligibility for RMA is limited to newly arrived refugees who meet one of the following sets of conditions: (a) They are not eligible for Medicaid or CHIP but currently receive RCA (45 CFR section 400.100(d)); or (b) They meet all of the following criteria: (i) They have met the same time eligibility requirement stated above for RCA (45 CFR section 400.100(b)). (ii) They are determined ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP (45 CFR section 400.100(a)(1)). (iii) They meet one of the f ollowing financial eligibility requirements: (A) In a State with a Medicaid medically needy program, they meet the State's Medicaid medically needy financial eligibility standards or a financial eligibility standard established at 200 percent of the nation al poverty level (45 CFR section 400.101(a)).

(2) Earnings from employment do not affect refugees' eligibility for RMA. They remain eligible for RMA through the remainder of the time eligibility period after receiving ear nings from employment. Refugees who become ineligible for Medicaid due to employment earnings and have resided in the U.S. less than the time eligibility period will become eligible for RMA for the remainder of the time eligibility period (45 CFR section 400.104) without an additional eligibility determination. States may not require that a refugee actually receive or apply for RCA as a condition of eligibility for RMA (45 CFR section 400.100(d)). (3) Benefit Level - In providing medical assistance servi ces to eligible refugees, a State must provide at least the same services in the same manner and to the same extent as under the State's Medicaid program (45 CFR section 400.105).

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The Low -Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a block grant program in which States (including territories and Indian tribes) design their own programs, within very broad Federal guidelines. There are fou r components of LIHEAP: (1) block grants, (2) energy emergency contingency funds, (3) leveraging incentive awards, and (4) the Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Program (REACH). The objectives of LIHEAP are to help low -income people meet the costs o f home energy (defined as heating and cooling of residences) increase their energy self -sufficiency, and reduce their vulnerability resulting from energy needs. A primary purpose is meeting immediate home energy needs. The target population is low -income households, especially those with the lowest incomes and the highest home energy costs or needs in relation to income, taking into account family size. Additional targets are low -income households with members who are especially vulnerable, including the elderly, persons with disabilities, and young children. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES LIHEAP Block Grants The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Community Services, administers the LIHEAP prog ram at the Federal level. LIHEAP block grant funds are distributed by formula to the States, the District of Columbia, and the territories. In addition, federally or State -recognized Indian tribes (including tribal consortia) have the option of requestin g direct funding from ACF, rather than being served by the State in which they are located. Tribes that are directly funded by HHS statutorily receive a share of the funds that would otherwise be allotted to the States in which they are located, based on the number of eligible households in the tribal service area as a percentage of the eligible households in the State, or a larger amount agreed upon in a State/tribe agreement. Over half the States agree to give the tribes located within their State a lar ger amount than required by the statute. Each grantee is required to submit a plan/application annually in order to receive block grant funding. The plan contains two parts: (1) an application to describe how the grantee's LIHEAP program will be administ ered and (2) a program integrity supplement in which the grantee must describe the systems in place to detect and deter fraud and abuse in its LIHEAP program. State grantees are required to hold a public hearing each year. All grantees must allow for public participation in the development of their annual plans. A separate application is required for those LIHEAP grantees that wish to apply for a leveraging incentive award or a REACH grant. June 2012 LIHEAP HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.568 -2 Energy Emergency Contingency Funds In addition to appropriati ons for the LIHEAP block grant program, funds may be awarded to meet the additional home energy assistance needs of States for a natural disaster or other emergency. Contingency funds that are awarded generally must be used under the normal statutory and regulatory requirements that apply to the LIHEAP block grants, unless special conditions are placed upon their use at the time of the award. Leveraging Incentive Awards Of the funds appropriated for LIHEAP each year, HHS is required to earmark a portion t o reward those LIHEAP grantees that have acquired non -Federal resources to help low -income persons meet their home heating and cooling needs, as an incentive to augment the Federal dollars. This could involve the grantee or private organizations putting s ome of their own funds into LIHEAP or similar State or private programs, buying fuel at reduced or discount prices through bulk purchases or negotiated agreements, obtaining donations of weatherization materials or fuels, waiving utility fees, or any numbe r of other activities. Awards in the current year are based on leveraging activities carried out during the previous year. Leveraging grants are subject to special terms and conditions, which are specified in the grant awards. Residential Energy Assistan ce Challenge Program Up to 25 percent of the funds earmarked for leveraging incentive awards each year may be set aside for the REACH program to make competitive grants to LIHEAP grantees to help LIHEAP - eligible households reduce their energy vulnerability . The purposes of REACH are: (1) to minimize health and safety risks that result from high energy burdens on low -income households; (2) to prevent homelessness as a result of inability to pay energy bills; (3) to increase efficiency of energy usage by low -income families; and (4) to target energy assistance to individuals who are most in need. REACH grants are to be administered through community - based organizations. REACH grants are subject to special terms and conditions, which are specified in the gra nt awards. Source of Governing Requirements The LIHEAP program is authorized under Title XXVI of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, as amended (Pub. L. No. 97 -35, as amended, also known as OBRA 1981), which is codified at 42 USC 8621 -8629. Imp lementing regulations for this and other HHS block grant programs authorized by OBRA 1981 are published at 45 CFR part 96. Those regulations include general administrative requirements for the covered block grant programs in lieu of CFR part 92 (the HHS i mplementation of the A -102 Common Rule)). Requirements specific to LIHEAP are in 45 CFR sections 96.80 through 96.89. In addition, grantees are to administer their LIHEAP programs according to the plans that they have submitted to HHS. Under the block gr ant philosophy, each State is responsible for designing and implementing its own LIHEAP program, within very broad Federal guidelines. States must administer their LIHEAP programs according to their approved plan and any amendments and in conformance with their own implementing rules and policies. States must establish appropriate systems and June 2012 LIHEAP HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.568 -3 procedures to prevent, detect and correct waste, fraud and abuse, by clients, vendors, and administering agencies. As discussed in Appendix I of this Supplement, F ederal Programs Excluded from the A -102 Common Rule, States are to use the fiscal policies that apply to their own funds in administering LIHEAP. Procedures must be adequate to assure the proper disbursal of and accounting for Federal funds paid to the gr antee, including procedures for monitoring the assistance provided (42 USC 8624(b)(10); 45 CFR section 96.30). Availability of Other Program Information The ACF LIHEAP page on the Internet ( http://www.ac f.hhs.gov/programs/liheap ) provides general information about this program. III. COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS In developing the audit procedures to test compliance with the requirements for a Federal program, the auditor should first look to Part 2, Matrix of C ompliance Requirements, to identify which of the 14 types of compliance requirements described in Part 3 are applicable and then look to Parts 3 and 4 for the details of the requirements. A. Activities Allowed or Unallowed The following guidelines apply to LIHEAP block grants and leveraging incentive award funds, unless noted otherwise. Energy emergency contingency funds generally are subject to the LIHEAP block grant requirements, but the contingency grant award letter should be reviewed to see if differe nt requirements apply. REACH grants are subject to special rules described in the award. 1. LIHEAP funds may be used to assist eligible households to meet the costs of home energy, i.e., heating or cooling their residences (42 USC 8621(a) and 8624(b)(1)). 2. LIHEAP funds may be used to intervene in energy -related crisis situations, as defined by the grantee (42 USC 8623(c) and 8624(b)(1)). 3. LIHEAP funds may be used to conduct outreach activities (42 USC 8624(b)(1)). 4. Leveraging incentive aw ards must be used to increase or maintain heating, cooling, energy crisis, and weatherization benefits for low -income persons (45 CFR section 96.87(j)). 5. Leveraging incentive award funds may not be used for planning, developing, or administering the LIHEAP program (45 CFR section 96.87(j)). 6. LIHEAP funds may be used to provide low -cost residential weatherization and other cost -effective energy -related hom e repair (42 USC 8624(b)(1)). June A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.568 -4 7. LIHEAP grantees may use some or all of the rules applicable to the Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance for Low -Income Persons program (CFDA 81.042) LIHEAP weatherization (42 USC 8624(c) (1)(D)). 8. LIHEAP funds may be used to provide services that encourage and enable households to reduce their home energy needs and thereby the need for energy assistance, including needs assessments, counseling, and assistance with energy vendors (42 USC 8624 (b)(16)). 9. LIHEAP funds (other than leveraging incentive award funds) may be used to identify, develop, and demonstrate leveraging programs (45 CFR section 96.87(c)). 10. No LIHEAP funds may be used for the purchase or improvement of land, or the purchase, construction, or permanent improvement (other than low -cost residential weatherization or other energy -related home repairs) of any building or other facility (42 USC 8628). B. Allowable Costs/Cost Principles As discussed in Appendix I of this Sup plement, Federal Programs Excluded from the A-102 Common Rule, LIHEAP is exempt from the provisions of the OMB cost principles circulars. State cost principles requirements apply to LIHEAP. E. Eligibility 1.

Grantees may establish lower income eligibility criteria, but no household may be ex cluded solely on the basis of income if the household income is less than 110 percent of the State's poverty level. Grantees may give priority to those households with the highest home energy costs or needs in relation to income (42 USC 8624(b)(2)). 2. Eligibility for Group of Individuals or Area of Service Delivery - Not Applicable 3. Eligibility for Subrecipients To the extent it is necessary to designate local administrative agencies, the grantee is to give special consideration to local public or priva te non -profit agencies (or their successor agencies) which were receiving energy assistance or weatherization funds under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 or other laws, June 2012 LIHEAP HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.568 -5 provided that the grantee finds that they meet program and fiscal requirements set by the grantee (42 USC 8624(b)(6)). G. Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking 1. Matching - Not Applicable 2. Level of Effort - Not Applicable 3. Earmarking The following limitations apply to LIHEAP block grants and leveraging incentive award funds, as noted. Energy emergency contingency funds generally are subject to the requirements applicable to LIHEAP block grant funds, but the contingency grant award let ter should be reviewed to see if different requirements were applied. REACH grants are subject to special rules described in the award. a. Planning and Administrative Costs (1) No more than 10 percent of the LIHEAP funds payable to the State for a Federa l fiscal year may be used for planning and administrative costs, including both direct and indirect costs. This limitation applies, in the aggregate, to planning and administrative costs at both the State and subrecipient levels (42 USC 8624(b)(9)(A); 45 CFR section 96.88(a)). (2) A tribal or territorial grantee may spend up to 20 percent of the first $20,000 and 10 percent of the amount above $20,000 for administration and planning (45 CFR section 96.88(b)). (3) Leveraging incentive award funds may not be used for planning and administrative costs. However, either in the award year or the following fiscal year, they may be added to the base on which the maximum amount allowed for planning and administration is calculated (45 CFR section 96.87(j)). b. Weatherization (1) No more than 15 percent of the greater of the funds allotted or the funds available to the grantee for a Federal fiscal year may be used for low -cost residential weatherization or other energy -related home repairs. The Secretary may grant a waiver, and the grantee may then spend up to 25 percent for residential weatherization or energy -related home repairs (42 USC 8624(k)). June 2012 LIHEAP HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.568 -6 (2) Leveraging incentive award funds may be used for weatherization without regard to the weatherization maximum in th e statute. However, they cannot be added to the base on which the weatherization maximum is calculated (45 CFR section 96.87(j)). c. Energy Need Reduction Services - No more than five percent of the LIHEAP funds payable to the grantee may be used to prov ide services that encourage and enable households to reduce their home energy needs and thereby the need for energy assistance. Such services may include needs assessments, counseling, and assistance with energy vendors (42 USC 8624(b)(16)). d. Identifyi ng and Developing Leveraging Programs (1) The greater of 0.08 percent of a State's LIHEAP funds (other than leveraging incentive award funds) or $35,000 may be spent to identify, develop, and demonstrate leveraging programs, without regard to the limit on planning and administering LIHEAP (42 USC 8626a(c)(2); 45 CFR section 96.87(c)(2)). (2) Indian tribes/tribal organizations and territories may spend up to the greater of two percent or $100 on such activities (45 CFR section 96.87(c)(1)). H. Period of Av ailability of Federal Funds At least 90 percent of the LIHEAP block grant funds payable to the grantee must be obligated in the fiscal year in which they are appropriated. Up to 10 percent of the funds payable may be held available (or \"carried over\") for obligation no later than the end of the following fiscal year. Funds not obligated by the end of the following fiscal year must be returned to ACF. There are no limits on the time period for expenditure of funds (42 USC 8626). Leveraging incentive award funds and REACH funds must be obligated in the year in which they are awarded or the following fiscal year, without regard to the carryover limit. However, they may not be added to the base on which the carryover limit is calculated (45 CFR sections 96.8 7(j)(1) and (k)). Funds not obligated within these time periods must be returned to ACF (45 CFR section 96.87(k)). LIHEAP emergency contingency funds are generally subject to the same obligation and expenditure requirements applicable to the LIHEAP block grant funds, but the contingency award letter should be reviewed to see if different requirements were imposed.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The objective of the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) program is to provide assistance to a network of community -based organizations for programs and services to ameliorate the causes and consequences of poverty and to revitalize low -income communities. CSBG can be used to fund programs and other activities that assist low -income individuals and families attain self-sufficiency; provide emergency assistance; s upport positive youth development; promote civic engagement; and improve the organization infrastructure for planning and coordination among multiple resources that address poverty conditions in the community. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Administration and Services The CSBG program is administered at the Federal level by the Office of Community Services (OCS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). CSBG funds are awarded to States, t erritories, and federally and State -recognized Indian tribes and tribal organizations. Funds are distributed in accordance with a pre -established formula after submission of an application to OCS and acceptance of that application as complete in accordanc e with statutory requirements. In turn, States subgrant the CSBG funds according to statewide formulae to designated community -based non -profit organizations (and, in special circumstances, public organizations) that plan, develop and implement, and evalu ate local programs. Source of Governing Requirements The CSBG program was reauthorized under the Community Services Block Grant Act of 1998 (Pub. L. 105 -285), and is codified at 42 USC 9901 -9920. The implementing regulations for this and other block grant programs are published at 45 CFR part 96. Those regulations include both specific requirements and general administrative requirements for the covered block grant programs in lieu of 45 CFR part 92 (the HHS implementation of the A -102 Common Rule). Requ irements specific to CSBG are in 45 CFR sections 96.90 through 96.92. Separate regulations governing religious organizations as nongovernmental providers of service (Charitable Choice) are codified at 45 CFR part 1050. III. COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS In deve loping the audit procedures to test compliance with the requirements for a Federal program, the auditor should look first to Part 2, Matrix of Compliance Requirements, to identify which of the 14 types of compliance requirements described in Part 3 are applicable and then look to Parts 3 and 4 for the details of the requirements. June 2012 CSBG Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.569 -2 A. Activities Allowed or Unallowed 1. Activities Allowed a.

B. Allowable Costs/Cost Principles As discussed in Appendix I of this Supplement, Fede ral Programs Excluded from the A-102 Common Rule, the CSBG program is exempt from the provisions of OMB cost principles circulars at the State level. As a block grant, State cost principles requirements apply to CSBG at the State level. However, OMB admi nistrative requirements and cost principles circulars do apply to subgrantees receiving CSBG funds (42 USC 9916(a)(1)(B)). E. Eligibility 1. Eligibility for Individuals The official poverty guideline as revised annually by HHS shall be used to determine el igibility. The poverty guidelines are issued each year in the Federal Register and on the HHS web site ( http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/ ). A State may adopt a revised poverty guideline but it may not exceed 125 perc ent of the HHS - determined poverty guidelines (42 USC 9902(2)). 2. Eligibility for Group of Individuals or Area of Service Delivery - Not Applicable June 2012 CSBG Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.569 -4 3. Eligibility for Subrecipients Subgrants may be made to the following entities, based on receipt of a comm unity plan (42 USC 9908(b)(11): a. A private non -profit organization (including migrant farm worker organization) with a pre -existing designation as an \"eligible entity\" immediately prior to enactment of the new CSBG Act on October 27, 1999, and with a governance mechanism meeting the tripa rtite governing board requirement specified in 42 USC 9910(a)). b. A subdivision of State government with a pre -existing designation as an \"eligible entity\" immediately prior to enactment of the new CSBG Act, with a governance mechanism meeting either th e \"tripartite\" board requirements or otherwise assuring decision -making and participation by low-income individuals in the development, planning, implementation, and evaluation of CSBG -funded programs (42 USC 9910(b)) c. A private non -profit organization o r subdivision of State government newly designated by the State after October 27, 1999 as an \"eligible entity\" to provide services in an unserved area, in accordance with the criteria, requirements, and procedures specified by 42 USC 9909. G. Matching, Lev el of Effort, Earmarking 1. Matching - Not Applicable 2. Level of Effort - Not Applicable 3. Earmarking a. States must use at least 90 percent of the allotted funds for subgrants to eligible entities (42 USC 9907(a)(1)). See III.H.2, \"Period of Availabili ty of Federal Funds,\" for period of availability of funds to subgrantees. b. State administrative expenses, including monitoring activities, may not exceed the greater of $55,000 or 5 percent of CSBG funds. Such expenditures must be made from the portion of funds remaining to a State after subgranting at least 90 percent of funds to eligible entities (42 USC 9907(b)(2)). H. Period of Availability of Federal Funds 1. Amounts unobligated by the State at the end of the fiscal year in which they were first all otted shall remain available for obligation during the succeeding fiscal year (45 CFR section 96.14(a)). June 2012 CSBG Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.569 -5 2. CSBG funds granted by the State to subgrantees are available to the subgrantee for obligation during the Federal fiscal year that the grant was made and in the following Federal fiscal year (42 USC 9907(a)(2)). However, beginning on October 1, 2000, if more than 20 percent of the funds granted by the State to a subgrantee in one fiscal year remain unobligated at the end of that fiscal year, a State ma y recapture and redistribute those funds. A State must either (a) redistribute the recaptured funds to an eligible entity located within the community served by the original subgrantee, or (b) require the original subgrantee to distribute the funds to a p rivate non -profit organization within that community. Activities undertaken with redistributed funds must conform with the activities allowed under the CSBG Act (42 USC 9907(a)(3)). L. Reporting 1. Financial Reporting a. SF-270, Request for Advance or Re imbursement - Not Applicable b. SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs - Not Applicable c. SF-425, Federal Financial Report - Applicable for financial status; Not Applicable for cash status 2. Performance Reports - Not Applicable 3. Special Reports - Not Applicable 4. Section 1512 ARRA Reporting - Applicable 5. Subaward Reporting under the Transparency Act - Applicable for non - ARRA funds M. Subrecipient Monitoring States must conduct full on -site reviews of each eligible subgrantee once every 3 years to check conformity with performance goals, administrative standards, financial management rules, and other requirements. States must conduct an onsite review of each newly designated entity immediately after the completion of the first year in which such entity receives CSBG funding. Follow -up reviews, including prompt return visits to eligible entities and their programs, are required for entities that fail to meet t he goals, standards, and requirements established by the State (42 USC 9914(a)). If a State finds a need for corrective action, the State must (1) inform the subgrantee of the deficiency and require correction; (2) offer training and technical assistance a nd report to OCS on that assistance, or explain why providing such assistance was not appropriate; (3) and receive an improvement plan from the subgrantee within 60 days, June 2012 CSBG Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.569 -6 and approve (42 USC 9915). If the subgrantee fails to remedy the deficiency, the Sta te may initiate proceedings to terminate the subgrantees eligibility or reduce its funding (42 USC 9908(b)(8) and 42 USC 9915(a)(5)). N. Special Tests and Provisions Subgrant Award and Administration Compliance Requirements - States must (1) use at least 9 0 percent of their allotted funds under this program for subgrants to eligible entities, (2) subgrant funds in a timely manner to allow subgrantees a sufficient opportunity to obligate the funds to accomplish program purposes, and (3) adhere to expense lim its for administrative activities performed (42 USC 9907(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (b)(2)). There is a concern that some States are (1) not allotting the funds to subgrantees, either to the required level or early enough to allow a full period of perform ance by subgrantees without the possibility of recapture, resulting in unobligated balances of funds, and (2) inappropriately claiming administrative expenses for subgrant award and monitoring. Audit Objectives - To determine if the State (1) complied with the requirement to subgrant 90 percent of its allotted funds in a timely manner and (2) claimed appropriate administrative expenses. a. Determine the State's procedures, including any standards for administrative lead time, for issuance of subgrant awards . b. Determine if the subgrants were made in a timely manner, consistent with CSBG requirements and the State's own procedures. c. Determine if the State tracks, by each individual subgrant, the issuance date, expenditure by the subgrantee, and the associa ted administrative costs. d. Determine if the State is appropriately claiming administrative costs in relation to its award and administration of subgrants. e. Select a sample of subgrantees and match State -maintained records of disbursement of funds with subgrantee records of receipt of funds from the State. IV. OTHER INFORMATION As described in Part 4, Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) program (CFDA 93.667), III.A. \"Activities Allowed or Unallowed ,\" a State may transfer up to 10 percent of its annual allotment under SSBG to CSBG and other specified block grant programs for support of health services, health promotion and disease prevention activities, low -income home energy assistance, or any combi nation of these activities. Amounts transferred into the CSBG program are subject to the requirements of the CSBG program when expended and should be included in the audit universe and total expenditures of this program when determining Type A programs. On the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards, the amounts transferred in should be shown as expenditures of this program when such amounts are expended. June 2012 CCDF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.575 -1 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CFDA 93.575 CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT CFDA 93.596 CHILD CARE MANDATORY AND MATCHING FUNDS OF THE CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT FUND I. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The Child Care and Development Fund ( CCDF) provides funds to States Territories, and Indian Tribes (Tribe) .to increase the availability, affordability, and quality of child care services. Funds are used to subsidize child care for low -income families where the parents are working or attendin g training or educational programs, as well as for activities to promote overall child care quality for all children, regardless of subsidy receipt. The CCDF consolidates the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) and funding formerly provided to States through the child care programs under Title IV -A of the Social Security Act. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) repealed the child care programs under Title IV -A of the Socia l Security Act, i.e., Aid to Families with Dependent Children Child Care, Transitional Child Care and At -Risk Child Care, and required that all Federal child care funds be spent in accordance with the provisions of the amended Child Care and Development Bl ock Grant program. While these Federal child care programs have been consolidated under a single set of eligibility requirements, there are three distinct funding sources. The three sources are the Discretionary Fund (CFDA 93.575), Mandatory Fund (CFDA 9 3.596), and the Matching Fund (CFDA 93.596). Additionally, under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program (CFDA 93.558), a State may transfer TANF funds to CCDF and, if so, the funds transferred in are treated as Discretionary Funds (42 USC 606(d); 45 CFR section 98.54(a)). Administration and Services The Office of Child Care (OCC) (formerly the Child Care Bureau), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), administers the CCDF. To rece ive funds a State, Territory, or Tribe must submit a plan containing specific information and assurances. The plan serves as the application for funding for States and Territories and is effective for a two -year period. Tribes, in contrast, must submit a yearly application indicating child counts as well as a tribal plan. A Tribe's plan is also effective for two years. Tribes are generally subject to the same program requirements as States and Territories, except as specifically noted below. Following ACF approval of the plan (and application, in the case of Tribes), funds are awarded to the designated State, territorial or tribal entity ( generally referred to as the lead agency) based on statutory/regulatory formulas. State awards are not adjusted by separate direct Federal funding of counterpart tribal programs within the State. As long as statutory and regulatory requirements are met (e.g., that the States, Territories, and th ose Tribes receiving grants over $500,000 offer parents certificates for the purchase of child care services), grantees have broad June 2012 CCDF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.575 -2 flexibility in designing programs and offering services. For example, CCDF funds may be used in collaborative efforts with H ead Start (CFDA 93.600) programs to provide comprehensive child care and development services for children who are eligible for both programs. In fact, the coordination and collaboration between Head Start and the CCDF is mandated by sections 640(g)(2)(D) and (E), and 642(c) of the Head Start Act (42 USC 9835(g)(2)(D) and (E); 42 USC 9837(c)) in the provision of full working day, full calendar year comprehensive services (42 USC 9835(a)(5)(v)). In order to implement such collaborative programs, which shar e, for example, space, equipment or materials, grantees may blend several funding streams so that seamless services are provided. Tribes may operate the CCDF program under a consolidated Pub. L. No. 102 -477 demonstration project. Pub. L. No. 102 -477 refer s to the Indian Employment, Training, and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992, the purpose of which is to provide for the integration of employment, training, and related services to improve the effectiveness of those services . Under Pub. L. No. 10 2-477, funds received from a program must be used and spent in accordance with the applicable rules for that program, subject to any waivers granted by the Secretary of HHS; however, during the period covered by this Supplement in which Federal partners an d Tribes are participating in a working group process to address a set of issues relating to plans, reporting, and accountability in Pub. L. No. 102 -477 projects, this Supplement provides that auditing of funds should be based on determining that the funds were spent in compliance with the applicable approved plan. Tribes participating under a Pub. L. No. 102 -477 project submit alternative plans and reports to the Department of the Interior, which serves as the lead Federal agency for Pub. L. No. 102 -477 Source of Governing Requirements The Discretionary Fund (CFDA 93.575) is authorized by the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990, as amended by Title VI of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 ( Pub. L. No. 104 -193), and subsequent amendments thereto, and codified at 42 USC 9858 -9858q. The Mandatory and Matching Funds (CFDA 93.596) are authorized under section 418 of Title IV -A of the Social Security Act as amended by PRWORA and the Deficit Reduc tion Act of 2005 (Pub. L. No. 109 -171), and codified at 42 USC 618. The CCDF (i.e., CFDAs 93.575 and 93.596) is subject to the implementing regulations at 45 CFR parts 98 and 99. CCDF is not subject to 45 CFR part 92, the HHS implementation of the A -102 C ommon Rule, or to 2 CFR part 225 (formerly OMB Circular A -87). Availability of Other Program Information OCC's web site ( http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/occ/ ) provides general information on this program. III. COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS In developing the audit procedures to test compliance with the requirements for a Federal program, the auditor should first look to Part 2, Matrix of Compliance Requirements, to June 2012 CCDF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.575 -3 identify which of the 14 types of compliance requ irements described in Part 3 are applicable and then look to Parts 3 and 4 for the details of the requirements. A. Activities Allowed or Unallowed 1. Funds may be used for child care services in the form of certificates, grants, or contracts (42 USC 9858c( c)(2)(A)). 2. Funds may be used for activities that improve the quality or availability of child care services, consumer education, and parental choice (42 USC 9858e). 3. Funds may be used for any other activity that the State deems appropriate to promotin g parental choice, providing comprehensive consumer education information to help parents and the public make informed choices about child care, providing child care to parents trying to achieve independence from public assistance, and implementing the hea lth, safety, licensing, and registration standards established in State regulations (42 USC 9858c(c)(3)(B)). 4. No funds may be expended through any grant or contract for child care services for any sectarian purpose or activity, including sectarian worshi p or instruction (42 USC 9858k(a)). 5. With regard to services to students enrolled in grades 1 through 12, no funds may be used for services provided during the regular school day, for any services for which the students receive academic credit toward gra duation, or for any instructional services that supplant or duplicate the academic program of any public or private school (42 USC 9858k(b)). 6. Except for Tribes, no funds can be used for the purchase or improvement of land, or for the purchase, construction, or permanent improvement (other than minor remodeling) of any building or facility (42 USC 9858d(b)). Tribes may use funds for the constru ction and major renovation of child care facilities with ACF approval (42 USC 9858m(c)(6); 45 CFR section 98.84). \"Construction \" is defined as the erection of a facility that does not currently exist. \"Major renovation \" is considered permanent improvement and is defined as : (1) structural changes to the foundation, roof, floor, exterior or load -bearing walls of a facility, or the extension of a facility to increase its floor area; or (2) extensive alteration of a facility such as to significantly change i ts function and purpose, even if such renovation does not include any structural change (45 CFR section 98.2). Improvements or upgrades to a facility which are not specified under the definition s of construction or major renovation may be considered minor remodeling and are, therefore , allowable. 7. Except for sectarian organizations, funds may be used for the minor remodeling of child care facilities. For sectarian organizations, funds may be used for the renovation or repair of facilities only to the ex tent that it is necessary to bring the June 2012 CCDF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.575 -4 facility into compliance with the health and safety standards required by 42 USC 9858c(c)(2)(F) (42 USC 9858d(b)). B. Allowable Costs/Cost Principles As indicated in Appendix I of this Supplement, Federal Programs Excluded from the A - 102 Common Rule, grantees (lead agencies) shall expend and account for CCDF funds in accordance with the laws and procedures they use for expending and accounting for their own funds (45 CFR section 98.67). C. Cash Management For the Ma tching Fund's (CFDA 93.596) requirement, the drawdown of Federal cash should not exceed the federally funded portion of the State's Matching Funds, taking into account the State matching requirements. For example, the total Matching Fund expenditures for a year \u2014both State and Federal shares \u2014for a fiscal year are $100. Of this $100, the State share of the Matching Fund is $40. For any period, the amount of Federal funds drawn down should not exceed 60 percent of the total expenditures for that period (31 CFR section 205.15(d)). As described in Special Tests and Provisions, III.N.3., \"Accountability, Deposit , and Investment of Lump -Sum Drawdowns,\" special provisions apply to Tribal CCDF grantees participating in Pub. L. No. 102 -477 demonstration projects. E. Eligibility 1. Eligibility for Individuals Lead Agencies must have in place procedures for documenting and verifying eligibility in accordance with the following Federal requirements, as well as the specific eligibility requirements selected by each Stat e/Territory/Tribe in its approved Plan . a. Children must be under age 13 (or up to age 19, if incapable of self care or under court supervision), who reside with a family whose income does not exceed 85 percent of State/territorial/tribal median income for a family of the same size, and reside with a parent (or parents) who is working or attending a job -training or education program; or are in need of, or are receiving, protective services. Tribes may elect to use State or tribal median income (42 USC 9858n(4 ); 45 CFR sections 98.20(a) and 98.80(f)). b. Lead Agencies shall establish a sliding fee scale, based on family size, income, and other appropriate factors, that provides for cost sharing by families that receive CCDF child care services (45 CFR section 98. 42). Lead Agencies may exempt families below the poverty line from making copayments and shall establish a payment rate schedule for child care providers caring for subsidized children (45 CFR section 98.43). June 2012 CCDF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.575 -5 2. Eligibility for Group of Individuals or Area of Service Delivery The award of CCDF funds to an Indian Tribe shall not affect the eligibility of any Indian child to receive CCDF services in the State or States in which the Tribe is located (45 CFR section 98.80(d)). 3. Eligibility for Subrecipients - Not Applicable G. Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking The matching and MOE requirements apply only to the Matching Fund (CFDA 93.596). The State's matching and MOE expenditures are closely related. For a St ate to receive the allotted share of the Matching Fund, the State must meet the MOE requirement and obligate the Mandatory Fund by year end (see III.H, \"Period of Availability of Federal Funds\"). The matching and MOE amounts are reported on the CCDF Finan cial Report (ACF -696) (see III.L.1, \"Reporting - Financial Reporting\"). 1. Matching a. A State is eligible for Federal matching funds (limit specified in 42 USC 618 and 45 CFR section 98.63) only for those allowable State expenditures that exceed the State 's MOE requirement, provided all of the Mandatory Funds (CFDA 93.596) allocated to the State are also obligated by the end of the fiscal year (45 CFR section 98.53). b. State expenditures will be matched at the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate for the applicable fiscal year. This percentage varies by State and is available on the Internet at http://www.aspe.hhs.gov/health/fmap.htm . To be eligible an activity must be allowable and be de scribed in the approved State plan (45 CFR section 98.53). c. Private or public donated funds may be counted as State expenditures for this purpose subject to the limitations in 45 CFR section 98.53. d. No more than 30 percent of State matching claims may be for pre - kindergarten services (45 CFR section 98.53(h)(3)) . The same expenditure may not be used for both MOE and matching purposes (45 CFR sections 98.53(d) and 98.53(h)). 2.1 Level of Effort - Maintenance of Effort If a State requests Matching Funds (CFDA 93.596), State MOE (non -Federal) funds for child care activities must be expended in the year for which Matching Funds are claimed in an amount that is at least equal to the State's share of expenditures for FY 1994 or 1995 (whichever is greater) und er former Sections 402(g) and (i) of the Social Security Act (42 USC 618). Private or public donated June 2012 CCDF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.575 -6 funds may be counted as State expenditures for this purpose (45 CFR section 98.53). No more than 20 percent of the MOE requirement may be met with State expenditures for pre -kindergarten services. The same expenditure may not be used for both MOE and matching purposes (45 CFR sections 98.53(d) and 98.53(h)). 2.2 Level of Effort - Supplement Not Supplant - Not Applicable 3. Earmarking a. Administrative Ear mark - A State/Territory may not spend on administrative costs more than five percent of total CCDF awards expended (i.e., the total of CFDAs 93.575 and 93.596) and any State expenditures for which Matching Funds (CFDA 93.596) are claimed (42 USC 9858c(c)( 3)(C); 45 CFR section 98.52). Tribes are allowed 15 percent of the amount expended under CFDAs 93.575 and 93.596 for administrative costs. Tribes with at least 50 children under age 13 are provided a base amount of $20,000, which may be expended for any purpose consistent with the purpose and requirements of the CCDF. Tribes with fewer than 50 children who are members of a consortium receive a pro rata amount of the $20,000 in proportion to the number of children under age 13 in relation to 50. The base amount is not included in the amount against which the administrative earmark is calculated (45 CFR sections 98.61(c), 98.83(e), and 98.83(g)). As explained in the preamble to 45 CFR part 98 and the Conference Agreement for PRWORA (H.R. Rep. 104 -725 at 411) http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ occ/law/finalrul/fr072498.pdf , the following activities are not considered administrative costs (63 FR 39962): (1) Eligibility determination and redetermination. (2) Preparation and participation in judicial hearings. (3) Child care placement. (4) Recruitment, licensing, inspection, review and supervision of child care placements. (5) Rate-setting. (6) Resource and referral services. (7) Training of child care staff. June 2012 CCDF Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.575 -7 (8) Establishment and maintenance of computerized child care information systems. (9) Establishment and operation of a certificate program. b. Quality Earmark - States and Territories must s pend on quality and availability activities, as provided in the State/territorial plan, not less than 4 percent of CCDF funds expended (i.e., the total of CFDAs 93.575 and 93.596 funds) and any State expenditures for which Matching Funds (CFDA 93.596) are claimed (45 CFR section 98.51). Only those Tribes receiving grants over $500,000 must spend at least four percent of CCDF funds expended on quality activities as described in the tribal plan/application. The $20,000 base amount is not included in the amou nt against which the quality earmark is calculated (45 CFR sections 98.51(a), 98.83(e), and 98.83(f)). c. Targeted Funds - Congress may also specifically target funds for certain purposes. For example, in the FY 2011 HHS appropriation, Congress specified thr ee types of targeted funds: (1) resource and referral and school -aged activities (States, Territories, and Tribes); (2) activities to increase the quality of child care for infants and toddlers (States and Territories); and (3) quality improvement activities (States a nd Territories). H. Period of Availability of Federal Funds 1. Discretionary Funds (CFDA 93.575) must be obligated by the end of the succeeding fiscal year after award, and expended by the end of the third fiscal year after award (42 USC 9858h(c); 45 CFR section 98.60). 2. Mandatory Funds (CFDA 93.596) for States must be obligated by the end of the fiscal year in which they are awarded if the State also requests Matching Funds (CFDA 93.596). If no Matching Funds are requested for the fiscal year, then t he Mandatory Funds (CFDA 93.596) are available until liquidated (45 CFR section 98.60(d)). 3.

OTHER INFORMATION Under the TANF program (CFDA 93.558), a State may transfer TANF fun ds to CCDF and the funds transferred are treated as Discretionary Funds under CCDF (42 USC 604(d); 45 CFR section 98.54(a)). The amounts transferred into CCDF should be included in the audit universe and in total expenditures of CCDF when determining Type A programs. On the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA), the amount transferred in should be shown as CCDF expenditures when expended. Tribal CCDF Grantees under a Pub. L. No. 102 -477 Demonstration Project Effective October 1, 2011, the requ irements contained in the 2009, 2010, and 2011 Compliance Supplements in the BIA Cross -Cutting Section page 4 -15.000 -4, IV, \"Other Information, \" were suspended. The auditor is not required to consider audit findings or modifications of audit opinions for completed audits which were based solely on the page suspended when the auditor is performing the risk based approach under OMB Circular A -133 in the two subsequent year audits. Tribal CCDF grantees are not required to take corrective action and the respec tive Federal agencies will not follow -up on audit findings based solely on the page suspended. For example, a material non -compliance or material weakness in internal control over compliance based solely on the page suspended would not preclude a program from being low risk or an entity from qualifying as a low risk auditee in the two subsequent year audits.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The objectives of the Head Start and Early Head Start programs are to promote the school readiness of low -income preschool children (ages 3 to 5), including children of federally recognized Indian tribes, Alaska Natives, and migratory seasonal and farm workers, and infants and toddlers (birth through age 3) by enhancing their cognitive social and emotional development in learning environments that support their growth in language, literacy, mathematics, science, social and emotional functioning, creative art, physical skills, and approaches to learning. Parents receive social services and par ticipate in various decision - making processes related to the operation of the program. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Administration and Services The Office of Head Start (OHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), a component of the Department of Healt h and Human Services (HHS), administers the Head Start program. OHS provides financial assistance to organizations that are eligible for designation as a Head Start agency for a period not -to-exceed 5 years for the planning, administration, and evaluation of a Head Start program. Head Start /Early Head Start programs operate in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. territories, and the Republic of Palau. Grants are awarded to public, non -profit, and for -profit organizations directl y by ACF's 10 Regional Offices and, for awards to Tribes, Alaska Native organizations, and organizations serving migrant and seasonal workers, as well as replacement grants, by the OHS Headquarters office in Washington, DC. Under the Early Head Start progr am, grants for services to eligible infants, toddlers, and pregnant women are made to Head Start grantees, school systems, universities, colleges, and other public and private entities. Early Head Start grants are subject to most of the same program perfo rmance standards and compliance requirements as Head Start grants; therefore, references to Head Start apply to both. For Early Head Start grantees that are also Head Start grantees, the Early Head Start program is not a separate grant; instead, Early Hea d Start is a separate program account under the same grant award. A Head Start agency may subgrant operational responsibilities to one or more \"delegate agency,\" but the Head Start agency governing body retains legal and fiscal responsibility for the gra nt. Delegate agencies may be public, non -profit, or for -profit organizations. Head Start agencies must collaborate with other entities carrying out early childhood education and child -care programs in the community, including those funded by the Child Car e and Development Fund (CCDF) (CFDA 93.575 and CFDA 93.596) and Temporary Assistance to June 2012 Head Start Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.600 -2 Needy Families (CFDA 93.558). The coordination and collaboration between Head Start and the CCDF entity is mandated by sections 640(a)(5)(E), 640(g)(2)(D) and (E) and 642(c) of the Head Start Act (42 USC 9837(c)) in the provision of full -working day, full calendar -year comprehensive services (42 USC 9835(a)(5)(C)(v)). In serving families and local communities, Head Start agencies must provide for the regular and direc t participation of parents and community residents in the implementation of the Head Start program including decisions that influence the character of such program. As long as the statutory and regulatory performance requirements are met, including requir ements for reporting data about expenditures and children and families receiving services, Head Start agencies have significant flexibility and discretion in designing programs to meet local community and family needs. The Head Start program provides serv ices in the following areas: Early Childhood Development and Health - Head Start's educational program is designed to meet the needs of each child and family, including those children who are dual -language learners and families who have limited English pro ficiency, and the local community served, taking into account its ethnic and cultural characteristics. Every child receives a variety of learning experiences to foster intellectual, social, and emotional growth. Head Start also emphasizes the importance of the early identification of health problems. Every child, including children with disabilities, is involved in a comprehensive health program in collaboration with parents, which includes immunizations, medical, dental, mental health, and nutritional s ervices. Head Start agencies are responsible for ensuring that they have qualified staff to implement educational programs that support classroom instructional practices, are able to identify children with special needs, and institute other practices rel ated to school readiness and children's later success in school. Head Start emphasizes the importance of the early identification of health problems or potential health concerns. Head Start agencies are required to provide timely referrals to State or lo cal agencies providing services under the Individuals with Disabilities Act to ensure the provision of special education and related services to meet the special needs of children with disabilities. Head Start agencies assess and prioritize the nutrition s tatus and nutritional needs of enrolled children, work in collaboration with each child's parents to ensure that children receive needed preventive nutrition and/or treatment services, provide food to help meet children's daily nutritional needs, provide m eals that meet U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) dietary guidelines for children in settings that are relaxed and promote learning, demonstrate the connection of nutrition to other Head Start activities and its contribution to the child's cognitive, social, emotional, and physical development, provide nutrition education to staff, parents, and children, and involve all staff, parents, and other community agencies, as appropriate, in meeting the child's nutritional needs. Mental health services must be provided in partnership with families and include on -site consultations with mental health professionals that support the efforts of staff and parents to promote children's mental health. June 2012 Head Start Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.600 -3 Family and Community Partnerships - An essential part of the Head Start program is the involvement of parents in parent education, program planning, and operating activities. Many parents serve as members of policy councils and committees and have a voice in Head Start program operations. Participation in classes and workshops on child development and staff visits assist parents in identifying the needs of their children and about educational activities that can take place at home. Specific services are geared to each family after its needs are determined. They inclu de community outreach; referrals; family need assessments; recruitment and enrollment of children; and emergency assistance or crisis intervention. Grantees engage in a process of collaborative partnership -building with parents to establish mutual trust an d to identify family goals, strengths, and necessary services and other supports. Parents are offered opportunities to develop and implement individualized family partnership agreements that describe family goals, responsibilities, timetables and strategie s for achieving these goals as well as progress in achieving them. Grantees take an active role in community planning to encourage strong communication, cooperation, and the sharing of information among agencies and their community partners and to improve the delivery of community services to children and families. In addition, grantees take affirmative steps to establish ongoing collaborative relationships with community organizations to promote the access of children and families to community services th at are responsive to their needs, and to ensure that Early Head Start and Head Start programs respond to community needs. Program Design and Management - Upon receiving designation as a Head Start agency, the organization must establish and maintain a form al structure for program governance, oversight of quality services for children and families, and decision -making related to program design and implementation. Such a structure must include a governing body, a policy council, and, if there is a delegate a gency, a policy committee for each such subrecipient. Policy councils are responsible for aspects of program design and operation and long -and short - term planning and goals and objectives. Policy councils are composed of parents of children who are currently enrolled in the Head Start program, as well as mem bers at large of the community served by the Head Start agency. Policy committees at the delegate agency level are responsible for aspects of the delegate agency's program design and operation and long -and short -term planning and goals and objectives. T hese committees are composed of parents of children who are currently enrolled in the Head Start program served by the delegate agency, as well as members at large of the community served by the Head Start delegate agency. Source of Governing Requirements Head Start began in 1965 under the Office of Economic Opportunity and is now administered by OHS, ACF, HHS. Head Start programs are currently authorized under the Head Start Act (Pub. L. No. 110 -134), as amended by the Improving Head Start for School Rea diness Act of 2007 (42 USC 9831 -9852. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) June 2012 Head Start Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.600 -4 (Pub. L. No 111 -5, 123 Stat 178) added funding for these programs.

D. Davis -Bacon Act The Davis -Bacon Act applies to construction or major renovation of facilities under the Head start program. 'Major renovation' means the extensive alteration of an existing facility, such as to significantly change its function and purpose , even if such renovation does not include any structural change to the facility. Major renovation also includes a renovation of any kind which has a cost exceeding the lesser of $200,000, adjusted annually to reflect the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) beginning one year after June 2, 2003, or 25 percent of the total annual direct costs approved for the grantee by ACF for the budget period in which the application is made (42 USC 9839(g)(3); 45 CFR sections 1309.3 and 1309.54).

In addition to the general income eligibility rule, homeless children and children in foster care are categorically eligible t o enroll in Head Start programs. Once the needs of these groups are met, then (u p to 10 percent of the children who are enrolled may be from families that are not income -eligible (45 CFR section 1305.4 USC 9840(a)(1)(B)(iii)(II)). b. For tribal grantees, the income -eligible percentage that may be enrolled in the programs may be as low as 51 percent, providing certain conditions are met (45 CFR section 1305.4(b)(3)). c. The family income must be verified by the Head Start grantee before determining that a child is income -eligible (45 CFR section 1305.4(c)). Homeless children may be enrolled while required documentation is obtained within a reasonable amount of time. Verification must include examination of any of the following: Individual Income Tax Form 1040, W-2 forms, pay stubs, pay envelopes, written statements from employers, or documentation showing current status as recipients of public assistance (45 CFR section 1305.4(d)) . Although copies of income verification documents need not be retained by grantees, the child or family record must include a statement, signed by an employee of the grantee (Head Start program), identifying which income verification document was examine d and stating that the child is income -eligible (45 CFR section 1305.4(e)).

Development and administrative costs include, but are not limited to, the cost of organization -wide planning, coordination and general purpose direction, accounting and auditing, purchasing and personnel functions, and the cost of operating and maintaining sp ace for these purposes (42 USC 9839(b)(2); 45 CFR section 1301.32). b. Targeted earmark . Each Head Start agency must enroll 100 percent of its funded enrollment (42 USC 9387(g)). For Fiscal Year 2009 and thereafter, not less than 10 percent of the total number of children actually enrolled by each Head Start Agency and each delegate agency must be children with disabilities determined to be eligible for special education and related services unless a waiver has been approved by ACF (42 USC 9835(d)). c. Required percentage of income eligibles (1) For grantees other than Indian tribes/tribal organizations, at least 90 percent of the enrollees must come from families whose income is below the official Federal poverty guidelines or who are receiving public ass istance (income -eligible). Up to 10 percent of the children who are enrolled may be from families that are not income -eligible (45 CFR section 1305.4) . The Head Start agency may also enroll up to 35 percent of children from families with income 130 perce nt below the poverty line as specified in III.E.1.a, Eligibility - Eligibility for Individuals, above . June 2012 Head Start Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.600 -10 (2) For tribal grantees, the income -eligible percentage may be as low as 51 percent, providing certain conditions are met (45 CFR section 1305.4(b)(3)). (3) The family income must be verified by the Head Start grantee before determining that a child is income -eligible (45 CFR section 1305.4(c)). (4) Verification must include examination of any of the following: Individual Income Tax Form 1040, W -2 forms, pay stubs, pay envelopes, written statements from employers, or documentation showing current status as recipients of public assistance (45 CFR section 1305.4(d)). (5) Although copies of income verification documents need not be retained by grantees, the child or family record must include a statement, signed by an employee of the grantee (Head Start program), identifying which income verification docu ment was examined and stating that the child is income -eligible (45 CFR section 1305.4(e)). The poverty guidelines are issued each year in the Federal Register and HHS maintains a web page that provides the poverty guidelines (http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/ ). J. Program Income Head Start programs may not charge fees for participation in the program nor solicit, encourage, or in any way condition a child's enrollment or participation upon the payment of a fee. If the family of an eligible child volunteers to pay part or all of the costs of the child's participation, the Head Start agency may accept the voluntary payments and record the payments as program income. Such program income must be used for purposes rela ted to the Head Start grant (45 CFR section 1305.9). A Head Start agency that provides full -working -day services in collaboration with other agencies or entities may collect a family co -payment to support extended day services if a co-payment is required in co njunction with the collaborating agency or entity . The co - payment charged to families receiving services through the Head Start program shall not exceed the co -payment charged to families with similar incomes and circumstances who are receiving the s ervices through participation in a program carried out by another agency or entity (42 USC 9840(b)).

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The purpose of the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services (CWS) program is to promote State and Tribe flexibility in the development and expansion of a coordinated child and family services program that utilizes community -based agencies and ensures all children are raised in safe, loving fa milies . II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Administration on Children, Youth and Families, Children's Bureau, administers the CWS program on the Federal level. Funds are awarded directly to States and tribes. State agencies can have agreements and contracts with other public agencies and with private agencies for provision of appropriate services. Each State receives a base amount of $70,000. Additional funds are di stributed in proportion to the State's population of children under age 21 multiplied by the complement of the State's average per capita income. The funds must go to, and be administered only by, the State child welfare agency, federally recognized Tribes, Tribal Organizations , or Tribal Consortia (hereafter \"Tribe\") . To be eligible for funds, each State and Tribe must submit a five -year comprehensive plan, the Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP). This plan encompasses planning and service delivery for the full child welfare services spectrum. This includes: Child Welfare Services, services promoting safe and stable families under t itle IV -B, Subpart 2; a child welfare staff development and training plan; a diligent recruitment of foster and adoptive f amilies plan that reflects the ethnic and racial diversity of children in the State for whom foster and adoptive homes are needed; and child abuse and neglect prevention, foster care, adoption, and foster care independence services. The plan must include how the State or Tribe intends to meet specific goals, provide services, and coordinate services. The Children' s Bureau has approval authority for the CFSP. An Annual Progress and Services Report (APSR) is required that identif ies the specific accomplish ments and progress made in the past fiscal year (FY) toward meeting each goal and objective in the 5-year comprehensive plan and any revisions in the statement of goals and objectives or to the training plan, if necessary, to reflect changed circumstances . The Associate Commissioner of the ACF Children's Bureau has approval authority for the title IV -B plans. As required by the Child and Family Service Improvement Act of 2006 (Pub. L. No. 109 -288), which amended Part B of title IV of the Social Security Ac t, States, in consultation with HHS , were required to establish by June 30, 2008, an outline of steps to be taken to ensure that 90 percent of children in foster care are visited by their caseworkers on a monthly basis by October 1, 2011, and that the majo rity of the visits occur in the residence of the child (Pub. L. No. 109 - 288, Section 6(c) (42 USC 622 (b)(17))) . HHS must reduce the Federal share of participation in expenditures under the State's t itle IV -B, subpart 1 , program by a certain statutory per centage if June 2012 Child Welfare Services HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.645 -2 the State does not meet its annual progress toward the 90 percent caseworker visit standard. The law requires the State to submit FY 2007 data , which will be used as a baseline in determining annual progress toward the 90 percent standard (Pub. L. No. 109 -288, Section 6(b)(2) (42 USC 623(e)(1) and (2))). The law also requires that States establish target percentages for the children in foster care who w ill be visited during each and every calendar month for FY 2008 through 2011 . If these target percentages are not achieved for a FY, the Federal match rate for title IV -B, subpart 1 funds will be reduced in the subsequent FY in proportion to the amount that the State failed to reach its target (section 424(e)(2)(B) of the Act). Source of Go verning Requirements The C WS program is authorized under t itle IV -B, Subpart 1 (sections 421 - 428) of the Social Security Act as amended, and is codified at 42 USC 620 -628a. Implementing program regulations are published at 45 CFR parts 1355 and 1357. III. Compliance Requirements In developing the audit procedures to test compliance with the requirements for a Federal program, the auditor should first look to Part 2, Matrix of Compliance Requirements, to identify which of the 14 types of compliance requirements described in Part 3 are applicable and then look to Parts 3 and 4 for the details of the requirements. A. Activities Allowed or Unallowed 1. Prior to fiscal year (FY) 2007, f unds for CWS could be used to accomplish the following purposes: a.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The objective of the Foster Care program is to help agencies authorized to administer title IV -E programs to provide safe, appropriate, 24 -hour, substitute care for children who are under the jurisdiction of the administering IV -E agency and need temporary placement and care outside their homes. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Administration and Services The Foster Care program is administered at the Federal level by the Children's Bureau, Administration on Children, Youth and Families, Administration for Children and Families (ACF), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Fundin g is provided to the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and federally recognized Indian Tribes, Indian tribal organizations and tribal consortia with approved title IV -E plans , based on a IV-E plan and amendments, as required by changes in statutes, rules, and regulations submitted to and approved by the ACF Children's Bureau Associate Commissioner. This program is considered an open -ended entitlement program and allows the Sta te or Tribe to be funded at a specified percentage (Federal financial participation) for program costs for eligible children. The designated State or tribal agency for this program, which is authorized under title IV -E of the Social Security Act, as amend ed, also administers ACF funding provided for other title IV -E programs, e.g., Adoption Assistance (CFDA 93.659); Guardianship Assistance (CFDA 93.090) at agency option and Independent Living Services (CFDA 93.674), as well as Child Welfare Services (CFDA 93.645) and Promoting Safe and Stable Families (CFDA 93.556) programs (title IV -B of the Social Security Act, as amended); and (States only) the Social Services Block Grant program (CFDA 93.667) (title XX of the Social Security Act, as amended). The IV -E agency may either directly administer the Foster Care program or supervise its administration by local level agencies. Where the program is administered by a State, in accordance with the approved IV -E plan, it must be in effect in all political subdivisi ons of the State, and, if administered by them, program requirements must be mandatory upon them. Where the program is administered by a Tribe, it must be in effect in all political subdivisions within the Tribal service area(s) and for all populations to be served under the plan. If the program is administered by a political subdivision of a Tribe, program requirements must be mandatory upon them. (42 USC 671(a)(1 -4) and 42 USC 679B(c)(1)(B)) Source of Governing Requirements The Foster Care program is aut horized by title IV -E of the Social Security Act, as amended (42 USC 670 et seq. ). This includes those amendments made by the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (Pub. L. No. 110 -351). Implementing regulations are at 45 CFR parts 1355, 1356, and 1357. Section 5001 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. L. No. 111 -5, 123 Stat 496 ) as amended by section June 2012 Foster Care \u2014Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.658 -2 201 of Pub.

Awards under the Foster Care program with funding periods begi nning on or after October 1, 2003, are subject to the HHS implementation of the A -102 Common Rule, 45 CFR part 92 (Federal Register , September 8, 2003, 68 FR 52843 -52844). Previously, this program and other HHS entitlement programs described in the Supple ment (as noted under the applicable program description) were excluded from this coverage. This program also is subject to 45 CFR part 95 (Subpart E Cost Allocation Plans is applicable to States) and the cost principles under Office of Management and Budg et Circular A -87 (as provided in Cost Principles and Procedures for Developing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Agreements with the Federal Government , HHS Publication ASMB C -10, available on the Internet at http://rates.psc.gov/fms/dca/asmb%20c -10.pdf ). States and Tribes are required to adopt and adhere to their own statutes and regulations for program implementation, consistent with the requirements of title IV -E and the approve d IV-E plan. Availability of Other Program Information The Children's Bureau manages a policy issuance system that provides further clarification of the law and guides States and Tribes in implementing the Foster Care program. This information may be acce ssed on the Internet at http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/laws_policies/index.htm . III.

Allowable Costs/Cost Principles Both States and Tribes are subject to the requirements of OMB Circular A -87 (2 CFR part 225). States also are subject to the cost allocation provisions and rules governing allowable costs of equipment of 45 CFR part 95, which references OMB Circular A -87 at 45 CFR section 95.507(a)(2) (45 CFR sections 1355.57, 95.503, and 95.705). E. Eligibility 1. Eligibility for Individuals Foster Care benefits may be paid on behalf of a ch ild only if all of the following requirements are met: a. Foster Care maintenance payments are allowable only if the foster child was removed from the home of a relative specified in section 406(a) of the Social Security Act, as in effect on July 16, 1996, and placed in foster care by means of a judicial determination, as defined in 42 USC 672(a)(2), or pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement, as defined in 42 USC 672(f), (42 USC 672(a)(1) and (2) and 45 CFR section 1356.21). (1) Judicial Determination (a) Contrary to the welfare determination - A child's removal from the home (unless removal is pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement) must be in accordance with a judicial determination to the effect that continuation in the home would be contrary to the child's welfare, or that placement in foster care would be in the best interest of the child. The judicial determination must be explicitly stated in the court order and made on a case by case basis. The precise language \"contrary to the welfare\" do es not have to be included in the removal court order, but the order must include language to the effect that remaining in the home will be contrary to the child's welfare, safety, or best interest (45 CFR section 1356.21(c)). June 2012 Foster Care \u2014Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.658 -5 (i) Prior to March 27, 2000 - For a child who entered foster care before March 27, 2000, the judicial determination of contrary to the welfare must be in a court order that resulted from court proceedings that are initiated no later than 6 months from the date the child is removed fr om the home, consistent with Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) Decision Number 1508 (DAB 1508). The Departmental Appeals Board, through Decision Number 1508, ruled that a petition to the court stating the reason for the State agency's request for the child 's removal from home, followed by a court order granting custody to the State agency is sufficient to meet the contrary to the welfare requirement (Federal Register . January 25, 2000, Vol. 65, Number 16, pages 4020 and 4088 -89). (ii) On or after March 27, 2000 - For a child who enters foster care on or after March 27, 2000, the judicial determination of contrary to the welfare must be in the first court ruling that sanctions the child's removal from home (45 CFR section 1356.21(c )). Acceptable documentation is a court order containing a judicial determination regarding contrary to the welfare or a transcript of the court proceedings reflecting this determination (45 CFR section 1356.21( d)). For the first 12 months that a Tribe's title IV -E plan is in effect, the Tribe may use nunc pro tunc orders and affidavits to verify reasonable efforts and contrary to the welfare judicial determinations for title IV -E foster care eligibility ( 42 USC 679c(c)(1)(C)(ii)(I) , as added by Section 301, Pub. L. No. 110-351). (b) Reasonable efforts to prevent removal determination - Within 60 days from the date of the removal from home pursuant to 45 CFR section 1356.21(k)(ii), there must be a judicial determination as to whether reasonable efforts were made or were not required to prevent the removal (e.g., child subjected to aggravated circumstances such as abandonment, torture, chronic abuse, sexual abuse, parent convicted of murder or voluntary manslaughter or aiding or abetting in such activities) (45 CFR section s 1356.21(b)(1) and (k)). The judicial determination must be explicitly documented, i.e., so stated in the court order and made on a case by case basis. June 2012 Foster Care \u2014Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.658 -6 (i) Prior to March 27, 2000 - For a child who entered care foster care before March 27, 2000, the judi cial determination that reasonable efforts were made to prevent removal or that reasonable efforts were made to reunify the child and family satisfies the reasonable efforts requirement ( Federal Register : January 25, 2000, Vol. 65, Number 16, pages 4020 and 4088). (ii) On or after March 27, 2000 - For a child who enters foster care on or after March 27, 2000, the judicial determination that reasonable efforts were made to prevent removal or were not required must be made no later than 60 days from the date of the child's removal from the home (45 CFR section 1356.21(b)(1)). Acceptable documentation is a court order containing a judicial determination regarding reasonable efforts to prevent removal or a transcript of the court proceedings reflecting this determination (45 CFR section 1356.21(d )). For the first 12 months that a Tribe's title IV -E plan is in effect, the Tribe may use nunc pro tunc orders and affidavits to verify reasonable efforts and contrary to the welfare judicial determinations for title IV -E foster care eligibility ( 42 USC 6 79c(c)(1)(C)(ii)(I)) , as added by Section 301, Pub. L. No. 110 -351) . (c) Reasonable efforts to finalize a permanency plan - A judicial determination regarding reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan must be made within 12 months of the date on which the child is considered to have entered foster care and at least once every 12 months thereafter wh ile the child is in foster care. The judicial determination must be explicitly documented and made on a case by case basis. If a judicial determination regarding reasonable efforts to finalize a permanency plan is not made within this timeframe, the chil d is ineligible at the end of the 12th month from the date the child was considered to have entered foster care or at the end of the month in which the subsequent judicial determination of reasonable efforts was due, and the child remains ineligible until such a judicial determination is made (45 CFR section 1356.21(b)(2)). (i) Prior to March 27, 2000 - For a child who entered foster care before March 27, 2000, the judicial determination of reasonable efforts to finalize the June 2012 Foster Care \u2014Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.658 -7 permanency plan must be made no later than March 27, 2001, because such child will have been in care for 12 months or longer (January 25, 2000, Federal Register, Vol. 65, Num 16, pages 4020 and 4088). (ii) On or a fter March 27, 2000 - For a child who enters foster care on or after March 27, 2000, the judicial determination of reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan must be made no later than 12 months from the date the child is considered to have entered foster care (45 CFR section 1356.21(b)(2). Acceptable documentation is a court order containing a judicial determination regarding reasonable efforts to finalize a permanency plan or a transcript of the court proceedings reflecting this determination (45 CFR section 1356.21(d )). For the first 12 months that a Tribe's title IV -E plan is in effect, the Tribe may use nunc pro tunc orders and affidavits to verify reasonable efforts and contrary to the welfare judicial determinations for title IV -E foster care eligibility ( 42 USC 679c(c)(1)(C)(ii)(I) , as added by Section 301 Pub. L . No. 110 -351). (2) If the removal was by a voluntary placement agreement, it must be followed within 180 days by a judicial determination to the effect that such placement is in the best interests of the child (42 USC 672(e); 45 CFR section 1356.22(b)). b. The child's placement and care are the responsibility of either the IV -E agency administering the approved title IV -E plan or any other public agency under a valid agreement with the cognizant IV -E agency (42 USC 672(a)(2)). c. A child must meet the elig ibility requirements of the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program (i.e., meet the State - established standard of need as of July 16, 1996, prior to enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act) (42 USC 672(a )). Tribes must use the title IV -A State plan (as in effect as of July 16, 1996) of the State in which the child resided at the time of removal ( 42 USC 679c(c)(1)(C)(ii)(II)). Program eligibility is limited to an individual defined as a \"child.\" This classification ordinarily ceases at the child's 18th birthday (42 USC 672(a)(3) , and 42 USC 675(8)(A) ). If, however, the State in which the child was living at removal had as a title IV-A State plan option (as in effect as of July 16, 1996) , a title IV -E agency may provide foster care maintenance payments on behalf of youth who have attained age 18, but are under the age of 19, and who are full - time students expected to complete their secondary school ing or June 2012 Foster Care \u2014Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.658 -8 equivalent vocational or technical training before reaching age 19 (45 CFR section 233.90(b)(3)). Beginning on October 1, 2010, a title IV -E agency may also amend its title IV-E plan to provide that an individual in foster care who is over age 18 (where an existing eligibility age extension provision for a full -time student expected to complete secondary schooling prior to attaining age 19 is not applicable) and has not attained 19, 20, or 21 years old (as the IV -E agency may elect) remains eligible as a child when the youth meets prescribed conditions for continued maintenance payments. A youth over age 18 must also (as elected by the IV -E agency) be (1) completing secondary school (or equivalent), (2) enrolled i n post -secondary or vocational school, (3) participating in a program or activity that promotes or removes barriers to employment, (4) employed 80 hours a month, or (5) incapable of any of these due to a documented medical condition (42 USC 675(8)(B)). Effective on April 8, 2010, the requirement to conduct annual AFDC redeterminations for purposes of determining continuing title IV -E eligibility has been eliminated to ease an administrative burden , The title IV-E agency must (for periods beginning on or after April 8, 2010) establish AFDC eligibility only at the time the child is removed from home or a voluntary placement agreement is entered (42 USC 672(a)(3)(A) and section 8.4A, QA#24 of the Child Welfare Policy Manual ). d. The provider, whether a fost er family home or a child -care institution must be fully licensed by the proper State or Tribal foster care licensing authority responsible for licensing such homes or child care institutions. The term \"child care institution\" as defined in 45 CFR sectio n 1355.20 includes a private child care institution, or a public child care institution which accommodates no more than 25 children, which is licensed by the State in which it is situated or has been approved, by the agency of such State responsible for li censing or approval of institutions of this type, as meeting the standards established for such licensing, but does not include detention facilities, forestry camps, training schools, or facilities operated primarily for the purpose of detention of childre n who are determined to be delinquent (42 USC 671(a)(10) and 672(c)). Effective October 1, 2010, the existing statutory definition of a child care institution includes a supervised setting in which an individual who has attained 18 years of age is living independently, consistent with conditions the Secretary establishes in regulations (42 USC 672(c)(2)). e. The foster family home provider must satisfactorily have met a criminal records check, including a fingerprint -based check, with respect to prospectiv e foster and adoptive parents (42 USC 671(a)(20)(A)). This involves a determination that such individual(s) have not committed any June 2012 Foster Care \u2014Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.658 -9 prohibited felonies in accordance with 42 USC 671(a)(20)(A)(i) and (ii). The requirement for a fingerprint -based check took effect on October 1, 2006 unless prior to September 30, 2005 the State has elected to opt out of the criminal records check requirement or State legislation was required to implement the fingerprint -based check, in which case a delayed implementation is p ermitted until the first quarter of the State's regular legislative session follow ing the close of the first regular session begin ning after October 1, 2006 . The requirement applies to foster care maintenance payments for calendar quarters beginning on or after the State's effective date for implementation (Pub. L. No. 109 -248, section 152(c)(1) and (3)). States that opted out of the criminal records check requirement at section 471(a)(20) of the Social Security Act prior to September 30, 2005 had until O ctober 1, 2008 to implement the fingerprint -based check requirement. Effective October 1, 2008, a State is no longer permitted to opt out of the fingerprint -based check requirement. The opt -out provision does not impact Tribes since they only became eligible to administer a title IV -E plan effective on October 1, 2009. The statutory provisions apply to all prospective foster parents who are newly licensed or approved after the IV -E agency's authorized date for implementation of the fingerprint -based back ground check provisions (42 USC 671(a)(20)(B); Pub. L. No. 109 -248, section 152(c)(2)). f. A IV-E agency must check, or request a check of , a State -maintained child abuse and neglect registry in each State the prospective foster and adoptive parents and an y other adult(s) living in the home have resided in the preceding 5 years before the State can license or approve a prospective foster or adoptive parent . This requirement became effective on October 1, 2006 unless the State requires legislation to implem ent the requirement, in which case a delayed implementation is permitted until the first quarter of the State's regular legislative session follow ing the close of the first regular session begin ning after October 1, 2006 . The requirement applies to foster care maintenance payments for calendar quarters beginning on or after that date. Tribes first became eligible to administer a title IV -E plan effective October 1, 2009 and must, therefore, comply with this requirement (42 USC 671(a)(20)(C); Pub. L. No. 1 09-248, section 152(c)(2) and (3)). g. The licensing file for the child -care institution must contain documentation that verifies that safety considerations with respect to staff of the institution have been addressed (45 CFR section 1356.30(f)). June 2012 Foster Care \u2014Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.658 -10 h. Foste r care administrative costs for the provision of child -placement services generally are allowable only when performed on behalf of a foster child that is eligible to receive title IV -E foster care maintenance payments (42 USC 674(a)(3)(E) and 45 CFR sectio n 1356.60). The following exceptions apply: (1) Activities specifically associated with the determination or redetermination of title IV -E eligibility are allowable regardless of the outcome of the eligibility determination (DAB Decision No. 844). (2) Otherwise allowable activities performed on behalf of title IV -E eligible foster children placed in unallowable facilities and unlicensed relative homes can be allowable under limited circumstances as follows: (a) For the lesser of 12 months or the average length of time it takes the State or Tribe to issue a license or approval of the home when the child, otherwise title IV -E eligible, is placed in the home of a relative who has an application pending for a foster family home license or approval (42 USC 672(i)(1)(A)). (b) For not more than one calendar month for an otherwise title IV-E eligible child transitioning from an unlicensed or unapproved facility to a licensed or approved foster family home or child care i nstitution (42 USC 672(i)(1)(B)). (3) In the case of any other child not in foster care who is potentially eligible for benefits under a title IV -E plan approved under this part and at imminent risk of removal from the home, only if - (a) Reasonable efforts are being made in accordance with 42 USC 471(a)(15) to prevent the need for, or if necessary to pursue, removal of the child from the home; and (b) The title IV -E agency has made, not less often than every 6 months, a determination (or redetermination) as to whether the child remains at imminent risk of removal from the home (42 USC 672(i)(2)). 2.

G. Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking 1. Matching The percentage of required State/Tribe funding and associated Federal funding (\"Federal financial participation\" (FFP)) varies by type of expenditure as follows: a. Third party in -kind contributions c annot be used to meet the State's cost sharing requirements (Child Welfare Policy Manual 8.1F.Q#2 8/16/02). The non -applicability of the matching and cost sharing provisions of 45 CFR part 74 to this program conveys to the similar provisions of 45 CFR sec tion 92.24 (as a result of the inclusion of HHS' entitlement programs under 45 CFR part 92) ( 45 sections 1355.30(c) and 1355.30(n)(1); CFR section 201.5(e )). Tribes receiving title IV -E funds are permitted to use in -kind funds from third -party sour ces as match for a portion of administrative and training costs . The statute places specific limits on the amount of in -kind expenditures and types of third - party sources ( 42 USC 6 79c(c)(1)(D) , as added by Section 301, Pub. L. No. 110 -351). b. The percent age of Federal funding in Foster Care maintenance payments will be the Federal Medical Assistance Program (FMAP) percentage. This percentage varies by State and is available on the Internet (http://www .aspe.hhs.gov/health/fmap.htm ) (42 USC 674(a)(1); 45 CFR provides for a temporary increase in FMAP rates to provide additional funding to IV-E agencies (ARRA, Section 5001 as amended by Section 201 of the Education, Jobs and Medi caid Assistance Act , Pub. L No. 111 -226). These temporary increases will affect rates for FY 2009, FY 2010 , and the first three quarter s of FY 2011 only (i.e., October 1, 2008 - June 30, 2011 ). Generally, aside from the possible applicability of a hold -harmless provision, an increase of 6.2 percent will be added to the FMAP percentage rate of every State for quarters from October 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010 . In accordance with section 201 of Pub. L. No. 111 -226, t he ARRA temporary FMAP percen tage rate increase is extended for an additional 6 months, but the level of increase is modified as follows: 3.2 percent for the quarter ending March 31, 2011 and 1.2 percent for the quarter ending June 30, 2011 . June 2012 Foster Care \u2014Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.658 -12 Effective October 1, 2009, separate Tribal FMAP rates, which are based upon the Tribe's service area and population, apply to Foster Care program maintenance payments incurred by Tribes that are participating in title IV - E programs through either direct operation of an approved title IV -E plan or through operation of a title IV -E agreement or contract with a State title IV-E agency. The methodology for calculating Tribal FMAP rates was provided through a final notice in the Federal Register that is available on the internet as follows: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR -2011 -08- 01/pdf/2011 -19358.pdf . The calculated FMAP rate for each Tribe includes any statutory temporary percentage increase applicable to State FMAP rates and applies unless it is exceeded by the FMAP rate for any State in which the Tribe is located (42 USC 679B(d) and 42 USC 679B(e)). c. The percentage of Federal funding in expenditures for short - and long - term training at educational institutions of employees or prospective employees, and short -term training of current or prospective foster or adoptive parents and members of staff of State/Tribe -licensed or State/Tribe -approved child -care institutions (including travel and per diem) is 75 percent (42 USC 674(a )(3)(A) and (B); 45 CFR section 1356.60(b)). d. The percentage of Federal funding in expenditures for short -term training of: relative guardians; State/Tribe -licensed or State/Tribe -approved child welfare agencies providing services to children receiving t itle IV -E assistance; child abuse and neglect court personnel; agency, child or parent attorneys; guardians ad litem; and, court appointed special advocates is subject to an increasing FFP rate for these additional trainee groups as follows: 55 percent in FY 2009; 60 percent in FY 2010; 65 percent in FY 2011; 70 percent in FY 2012; 75 percent in FY 2013 and thereafter ( 42 USC 674(a)(3)(B), as added by Section 203(b), Pub. L. No. 110-351). e. The percentage of Federal funding for expenditures for planning, d esign, development, and installation and operation of a statewide or tribal service area-wide automated child welfare information system meeting specified requirements (and expenditures for hardware components for such systems) is 50 percent (42 USC 674(a) (3)(C) and (D); 45 CFR sections 1355.52 and 1356.60(d)). f. The percentage of Federal funding of all other allowable administrative expenditures is 50 percent (42 USC 674 (a)(1)(E); 45 CFR section 1356.60(c)). 2. Level of Effort - Not Applicable 3.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The objective of the Adoption Assistance program is to facilitate the placement of children with special needs in permanent adoptive homes and thus prevent long, inappropriate stays in foster care. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Administration and Services The Adoption Assistance program is ad ministered at the Federal level by the Children's Bureau, Administration on Children, Youth and Families, Administration for Children and Families (ACF), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Adoption Assistance program pro vides Federal matching funds to title IV -E agencies with approved title IV-E plans that provide subsidy payments to parents who adopt eligible children with special needs and enter into an adoption assistance agreement. Depending on the circumstances, the child may also need to meet the eligibility requirements of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program (i.e., meet the State -established standard of need as of July 16, 1996, prior to enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work Oppor tunity Reconciliation Act [PRWORA]) or the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. In cases where program eligibility requires an assessment of SSI program eligibility, the child will need to meet either all criteria or for an applicable child [define d in III.E.1,a.(1)(a), Eligibility for Individuals, of this program supplement] only the medical and disability criteria. Tribes must use the title IV -A State plan (as in effect as of July 16, 1996) of the State in which the child resided at the time of removal in determining the child's AFDC eligibility (42 USC 679c(c)(1)(C)(ii)(II) ). An adoption assistance agreement is a written agreement between the adoptive parents, the IV -E agency, and other relevant agencies (such as a private adoption agency) speci fying the nature and amount of assistance to be given on a monthly basis to parents who adopt eligible special needs children. A child with special needs is defined as a child who the IV -E agency has determined cannot or should not be returned home; has a specific factor or condition, as defined by the State or Tribe, because of which it is reasonable to conclude that the child cannot be adopted without financial or medical assistance; and for whom a reasonable effort has been made to place the child witho ut providing financial or medical assistance (42 USC 673(a)(2)). Funding is provided to the 50 States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. F ederally recognized Indian Tribes, Indian tribal organizations and tribal consortia may also apply for title IV-E funding via the submission of a title IV -E plan. Funding is based on an approved IV -E plan and amendments, as required by changes in statutes, rules, and regulations, submitted to and approved by the ACF Children's Bureau Associate Commissioner. The Adoption Assistance program is an open -ended entitlement program. Federal financial participation in State or tribal expenditures for adoption assistance agreements is provided at the Medicaid match rate for medical assistance payments, which varies amon g States and Tribes. Monthly payments to families made on behalf of eligible adopted children also vary from IV -E agency to IV -E agency. June 2012 Adoption Assistance Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.659 -2 Federal financial participation (FFP) is made at an open -ended 50 percent match rate for administrative expenditures and at an open -ended 75 percent for most categories of State/tribal IV-E training expenditures. In addition, the program authorizes Federal matching funds for IV -E agencies that reimburse the non -recurring adoption expenses of adoptive parents of special needs children (regardless of AFDC or SSI eligibility) as administrative expenditures at an open -ended 50 percent FFP rate. The designated IV -E agency for this program also administers ACF funding provided for other Social Security Act programs (e.g., Fost er Care (CFDA 93.658), Guardianship Assistance (CFDA 93.090) at agency option and Independent Living Services (CFDA 93.674) programs (Title IV -E of the Social Security Act); Child Welfare Services (CFDA 93.645) and Promoting Safe and Stable Families (CFDA 93.556) programs (Title IV -B of the Social Security Act, as amended); and (States only) the Social Services Block Grant program (CFDA 93.667) (Title XX of the Social Security Act, as amended)). The IV -E agency may either directly administer the Adoption A ssistance program or supervise its administration by local level agencies. Where the program is administered by a State, in accordance with the approved IV -E plan, it must be in effect in all political subdivisions of the State, and, if administered by th em, program requirements must be mandatory upon them. Where the program is administered by a Tribe, it must be in effect in all political subdivisions within the Tribal service area(s) and for all populations to be served under the plan. If the program is administered by a political subdivision of a Tribe, program requirements must be mandatory upon them. (42 USC 671(a)(1 -4) and 42 USC 679B(c)(1)(B)) Source of Governing Requirements The Adoption Assistance program is authorized by Title IV -E of the Social Security Act, as amended (42 USC 670 et seq. ). This includes those amendments made by the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (Pub. L. No. 110 -351). Implementing regulations are published at 45 CFR parts 1355 and 1356. States and Tribes are to implement the program according to their IV -E plan, which is submitted to ACF for approval. Section 5001 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. L. No. 111 -5, 123 Stat 496 ) as amended by Section 201 of P ub. L No. 111 -226, provide d for temporary increase s in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage ( FMAP ) rates for expenditure periods between October 1, 2008 and June 30, 2011 to provide additional funding to IV-E agencies (see paragraph III.G.1.b , Matching, of this program supplement). Awards made under the Adoption Assistance program with funding periods beginning on or after October 1, 2003, are subject to the HHS implementation of the A -102 Common Rule, 45 CFR part 92 ( Federal Register , Septemb er 8, 2003, 68 FR 52843 -52844). Previously, this program and other HHS entitlement programs described in the Compliance Supplement (as noted under the applicable program description) were excluded from this coverage. This program also is subject to 45 CF R part 95 (Subpart E Cost Allocation Plans is applicable to States) and the cost principles under Office of Management and Budget Circular A -87 (as provided in Cost Principles and Procedures for Developing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Agreements with the Federal Government , HHS Publication ASMB C -10, available on the Internet at http://rates.psc.gov/fms/dca/asmb%20c -10.pdf ). States and Tribes are required to June 2012 Adoption Assistance Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.659 -3 adopt and adhere to their own statutes and regulations for program implementation, consistent with the requirements of Title IV -E and the approved IV -E Plan. Availability of Other Program Information The Children's Bureau manages a policy issuance system that provides furthe r clarification of the law and guides States and Tribes in implementing the Adoption Assistance program. This information may be accessed on the Internet at http://www.acf .dhhs.gov/programs/cb/laws _policies/laws /cwpm/index.jsp . III. COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS In developing the audit procedures to test compliance with the requirements for a Federal program, the auditor should first look to Part 2, Matrix of Compliance Requirem ents, to identify which of the 14 types of compliance requirements described in Part 3 are applicable and then look to Parts 3 and 4 for the details of the requirements. A. Activities Allowed or Unallowed 1. Adoption Assistance Subsidies - Funds may be expended for adoption assistance agreement subsidy payments, in accordance with the State's or Tribe's foster care maintenance payment rate schedule. Subsidy payments are made to adoptive parents based on the need(s) of the child (i.e. dev elopmental, cognitive, emotional behavioral) and the circumstances of the adopting parents (42 USC 673(a)(2)). Subsidy payment amounts cannot be based on any income eligibility requirements of the prospective adoptive parents (45 CFR section 1356.41(c)). Adoption assistance subsidy payments cannot exceed the foster care maintenance payment the child would have received in a foster family home; however, the amount of the subsidy payments may be up to 100 percent of the foster care maintenance payment rate (42 USC 673(a)(3)). 2. Administrative Costs a. Program Administration - Funds may be expended for costs directly related to the administration of the program. Approved public assistance cost allocation plans (States) or approved cost allocation methodolog ies (Tribes) will identify which costs are allocated and claimed under this program (45 CFR section 1356.60(c)). b. Nonrecurring Costs - Funds may be expended by a IV -E agency under an adoption assistance agreement for nonrecurring expenses up to $2,000 (gross amount), for any adoptive placement (45 CFR section 1356.41(f)(1)). Nonrecurring adoption expenses are defined as reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees and other expenses that are directly related to the legal adoption of a child with special needs. Other expenses may include those costs of adoption incurred by or on behalf of the adoptive parents, such as, the adoptive home study, health and psychological examination, supervision of the placement prior to June 2012 Adoption Assistance Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.659 -4 adoption, trans portation and the reasonable costs of lodging and food for the child and/or the adoptive parents when necessary to complete the placement or adoptions process (45 CFR section 1356.41(i)). c. Adoption Placement Costs - Funds expended by the IV -E agency fo r adoption placements (including nonrecurring costs) are considered an administrative expenditure and are subject to the matching requirements in section III.G.3.c (45 CFR section 1356.41(f)(1)). 3. Training a. Funds may be expended for short -term training of current or prospective adoptive parents and members of the staff of State/Tribe -licensed or State/Tribe -approved child care institutions (including travel and per diem) at the initiation of or during their period of care (42 USC 674(a)(3)(B) and 45 CFR section 1356.60(b)(1)(ii)). b. Funds may be expended for short -term training of: relative guardians; State/Tribe -licensed or State/Tribe -approved child welfare agencies providing services to children receiving title IV -E assistance; child abuse and neglec t court personnel; agency, child or parent attorneys; guardians ad litem; and, court appointed special advocates (42 USC 674(a)(3)(B) , as amended by section 203 of Pub. L. No. 111 -351). c. Funds may be expended for training (including both short - and long -term training at educational institutions through grants to such institutions or by direct financial assistance to students enrolled in such institutions) of personnel employed or preparing for employment by the agency administering the plan (42 USC 674(a) (3)(A)). B. Allowable Costs/Cost Principles Both States and Tribes are subject to the requirements of OMB Circular A -87. States also are subject to the cost allocation provisions and rules governing allowable costs of equipment of 45 CFR part 95, which references OMB Circular A -87 at 45 CFR section 95.507(a)(2) (45 CFR sections 1355.57, 95.503, and 95.705). E. Eligibility 1. Eligibility for Individuals a. Adoption assistance subsidy payments may be paid on behalf of a child only if all of the following requirements are met: (1) Categorical Eligibility (a) Applicable and Non -Applicable Children - An applicable child is a child for whom an adoption assistance agreement June 2012 Adoption Assistance Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.659 -5 was entered into in fiscal year (FY) 2010 or later and who meets the applicable age requirement (differs over a 9 fiscal year phase -in period beginning in FY 2010) , or a child who has been in foster care under the responsibility of the title IV-E agency for at least 60 consecutive months, or a sibling to either such child if both are to h ave the same adoption placement (42 USC 673(e)(2 ) and (e)(3)). The applicable age requirement is met only if the child has attained that age any time before the end of the Federal fiscal year during which the adoption assistance agreement is entered into . The applicable age for FY 2010 agreements includes children who will turn age 16 or older in that FY. In each subsequent FY, the age to apply the revised \"applicable child\" program rules decreases by 2 years (e.g., children who turn 14 or older in FY 2011 and children who turn 12 or older in FY 2012) until children of any age may be eligible according to the revised criteria in FY 2018 (42 USC 673(e)(1)(B), as amended by Section 402, Pub. L. No. 110 -351). A child who is referred to as \"not an applicabl e child \" is one for whom an adoption assistance agreement was entered into in FY 2009 or earlier or in a later FY if the applicable child requirements pertinent to the FY in which the adoption assistance agreement was entered into are not satisfied. In th is instance the revised \"applicable child\" eligibility criteria do not apply and the eligibility requirements in place prior to October 1, 2009 apply (42 USC 673(a)(2)(A)(i)). (b) Adoption agreements entered into prior to the beginning of FY 2010 , or agreements entered into during FY 2010 or thereafter for a \"non -applicable child\" - The child is categorically eligible if: (i) the child was eligible, or would have been eligible, for the former AFDC program (i.e., met the State - established standard of need as of July 16, 1996, prior to enactment of the PRWORA ( Tribes must use the title IV -A State plan in effect as of July 16, 1996 of the State in which the child resided at the time of removal in determining the child's AFDC eligibility (42 USC 679c(c)(1)(C)(ii )(II))) except for his/her removal from the home of a relative pursuant to either a voluntary placement agreement or as a result of a judicial determination to the effect June 2012 Adoption Assistance Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.659 -6 that continuation in the home of removal would have been contrary to the welfare of the child; or (ii) the child is eligible for SSI; or (iii) the child is a child whose costs in a foster family home or child care institution are covered by the foster care maintenance payments being made with respect to his/her minor parent (42 USC 673(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) ). (c) Adoption agreements entered into during FY 2010 or thereafter for an \"applicable child\" - The child is categorically eligible if the child: (i) at the time of the initiation of adoption proceedings , was in the care of a public or private child placement agency by way of a voluntary placement, voluntary relinquishment or a court -ordered removal with a judicial determination that remaining at home would be contrary to the child 's welfare; or (ii) meets the disability or medical r equirements of the SSI program; or (iii) was residing with a minor parent in foster care (who was placed in foster care by way of a voluntary placement, voluntary relinquishment or court - ordered removal); or, (iv) was eligible for adoption assistance in a previous adoption in which the adoptive parents have died or had their parental rights terminated ( 42 USC 673(a)(2)(A)(ii)(I) and 673(a)(2)(C)(ii)) ; and (v) does not fit within the following prohibited class for the payment of an adoption assistance payme nt (including payments of non -recurring expenses under 42 USC 6 73(a)(1)(B)(i)) , i.e., a n \"applicable child \" who is not a citizen or resident of the U.S. and was either adopted outside the U.S. or brought to the U.S. for the purpose of being adopted (42 USC 673(a)(7) as added by Pub. L. No. 110 -351). June 2012 Adoption Assistance Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.659 -7 (2) The following additional eligibility provisions must be met in addition to the establishment of categorical eligibility: (a) The child was determined by the IV-E agency as someone who cannot or should not b e returned to the home of his or her parents ( 42 USC 6 73(c)(1)); (b) The child was determined by the IV-E agency to be a child with special needs . Special needs means that there is a specific factor or condition (such as ethnic background, age, or membership in a minority or sibling group, or the presence of factors such as medical conditions or physical, mental, or emotional handicaps) because of which it is reasonable to conclude that the child cannot be placed with adoptive parents without provid ing adoption assistance under title IV -E and medical assistance under title XIX . In the case of an applicable child, the child is also considered to have special needs if that applicable child meets all of the medical or disability requirements for Supple mental Security Income (SSI) and the IV -E agency determines that it is reasonable to conclude that the child cannot be placed with adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance under title IV -E and medical assistance under title XIX. The criteria for the factor or condition element of the special needs determination will be met if an applicable child meets all the medical or disability requirements for SSI (42 USC 673 (c)(1)(B) and 673(c)(2)(B), as amended/added by Pub. L. No. 110 -351). (c) The IV -E agency has made reasonable efforts to place the child for adoption without a subsidy. The only exception to this requirement is where it would be against the best interests of the child because of such factors as the existence of significant emotional t ies with prospective adoptive parents while in the care of the parents as a foster child (42 USC 673(c)(1)(B) and 673(c)(2) as amended/ added by Pub. L. No . 110-351). (d) The agreement for the subsidy was signed and was in effect before the final decree of adoption and contains information concerning the nature of services; the amount and duration of the subsidy; the child's eligibility for Title XX services and Title XIX Medicaid; and covers the child should he/she move out of State with the adoptive family (42 USC 675(3)). June 2012 Adoption Assistance Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.659 -8 (e) The prospective adoptive parent(s) must satisfactorily have met a criminal records check, including a fingerprint -based check (42 USC 671(a)(20)(A)). This involves a determination that such individual(s) have not committed any prohib ited felonies in accordance with 42 USC 671(a)(20)(A)(i) and (ii). The requirement for a fingerprint -based check took effect on October 1, 2006, unless prior to September 30, 2005 the State has elected to opt out of the criminal records check requirement or State legislation was required to implement the fingerprint -based check, in which case a delayed implementation is permitted until the first quarter of the State's regular legislative session follow ing the close of the first regular session begin ning after October 1, 2006 . The requirement applies to adoption assistance payments for calendar quarters beginning on or after the State's effective date for implementation (Pub. L. No. 109 -248, section 152(c)(1) and (3)). States that opted out of the criminal records check requirement at section 471(a)(20) of the Social Security Act prior to September 30, 2005 had until October 1, 2008 to implement the fingerprint -based check requirement. Effective October 1, 2008, a State is no longer permitted to opt out of the fingerprint -based check requirement. The opt out provision does not impact Tribes since they only became eligible to administer a title IV -E plan effective on October 1, 2009 (42 USC 671(a)(20)(B); Pub. L. No. 109 - 248, section 152(c)(2) and 45 CFR sections 1356.30(b) and (c)). (f) The prospective adoptive parent(s) any other adult living in the home who has resided in the provider home in the preceding 5 years must satisfactorily have met a child abuse and neglect registry check. This requirement bec ame effective on October 1, 2006 unless the State requires legislation to implement the requirement, in which case a delayed implementation is permitted until the first quarter of the State's regular legislative session follow ing the close of the first reg ular session begin ning after October 1, 2006 . The requirement applies to foster care maintenance payments for calendar quarters beginning on or after that date. Tribes first became eligible to administer a title IV -E plan effective on October 1, 2009 and must, therefore, comply with this requirement (42 USC 671(a)(20)(C); Pub. L. No. 109 -248, sections 152(c)(2) and (3)). June 2012 Adoption Assistance Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.659 -9 (g) Once a child is determined eligible to receive title IV -E adoption assistance, he or she remains eligible and the subsidy continues until: ( i) the age of 18 (or 21 if the IV-E agency determines that the child has a mental or physical disability which warrants the continuation of assistance); (ii) the IV-E agency determines that the parent is no longer legally responsible for the suppor t of the child, or ( iii) the IV-E agency determines the child is no longer receiving any support from the parents ( 42 USC 6 73(a)(4) (A) and (B)). Beginning on October 1, 2010, a title IV -E agency may amend its title IV -E plan to provide for a definition of a \"child\" as an individual who has not attained 19, 20, or 21 years old (as the IV -E agency may elect) (42 USC 675(8)(B)(iii)). This definition of a child will then permit payment of adoption assistance for a child who is over age 18 (where the IV -E agenc y does not determine that the child has a mental or physical disability which warrants the continuation of assistance up to age 21) if such a youth is part of an adoption assistance agreement that is in effect under section 473 of the Social Security Act a nd the youth had attained 16 years of age before the agreement became effective. As an additional requirement, a youth over age 18 must also (as elected by the IV -E agency) be (i) completing secondary school (or equivalent), (ii) enrolled in post -secondar y or vocational school, (iii) participating in a program or activity that promotes or removes barriers to employment, (iv) employed 80 hours a month, or (v) incapable of any of these due to a documented medical condition (42 USC 675(8)(B)). b. Nonrecurrin g expenses of adoption may be paid on behalf of a child only if all of the following requirements are met: (1) The agreement, as a separate document or part of an agreement for State /Tribe or Federal Adoption assistance payment or services, was signed prio r to the final decree of adoption (45 CFR section 1356.41(b)). (2) The agreement indicates the nature and amount of the nonrecurring expenses to be paid (45 CFR section 1356.41(a)). (3) The State or Tribe has determined that the child is a child with speci al needs (45 CFR section 1356.41(d)). June 2012 Adoption Assistance Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.659 -10 (4) The child has been placed for adoption in accordance with applicable State and local laws (45 CFR section 1356.41(d)). (5) The costs incurred by or on behalf of adoptive parents are not otherwise reimbursed from ot her sources (45 CFR section 1356.41(g)). c. There may be no income -eligibility requirement (means test) for the prospective adoptive parent(s) in determining eligibility for adoption assistance subsidy payments or nonrecurring expenses of adoption (45 CFR sections 1356.40(c) and 1356.41(c)). d. In the case of a child adopted after the dissolution of a guardianship where the child was receiving title IV -E guardianship assistance payments, the child 's eligibility for adoption assistance is to be determined wi thout consideration of the placement of the child with the relative guardian and any kinship guardianship assistance payments made on behalf of the child. Thus, if such a child is adopted, the title IV -E agency would apply the adoption assistance criteria for the child as if the guardianship had never occurred (42 USC 673(a)(1)(D) as added by Section 101(c) of Pub. L. No. 110-351). 2. Eligibility for Group of Individuals or Area of Service Delivery - Not Applicable 3. Eligibility for Subrecipients - Not Applicable F. Equipment and Real Property Management Equipment that is capitalized and depreciated or is claimed in the period acquired and charged to more than one program is subject to 45 CFR section 95.707(b) in lieu of the requirements of the A -102 Common Rule (applies to States only). G. Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking 1. Matching The percentage of required State/tribal funding and associated Federal funding (\"Federal financial participation\" (FFP)) varies by type of expenditure as follow s: a. Third party in -kind contributions cannot be used to meet the State's cost sharing requirements (Child Welfare Policy Manual Section 8.1F.Q#2 8/16/02). The non -applicability of the matching and cost sharing provisions of 45 CFR part 74 to this progra m conveys to the similar provisions of 45 CFR section 92.24 (as a result of the inclusion of HHS' entitlement programs under 45 CFR part 92) ( 45 sections 1355.30(c) and 1355.30(n)(1); CFR section 201.5(e )). Tribes receiving title IV -E are permitted to use in -kind funds from third -party sources as match for a June 2012 Adoption Assistance Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.659 -11 portion of administrative and training costs . The statute places specific limits on the amount of in -kind expenditures and types of third -party sources and authorizes the Secretary to set futur e limits in regulation (42 USC 679c(c)(1)(D) , as added by Section 301, Pub. L. No. 110 -351). b. Adoption Assistance Subsidy Payments - The percentage of title IV -E funding in Adoption Assistance subsidy payments will be the Federal Medical Assistance Program (FMAP) percentage. This percentage varies by State and is available on the Internet at http://www.aspe.hhs.gov/health/fmap.htm (42 USC 674(a)(1); 45 CFR section 1356.60(a)). ARRA provides for a temporary increase in FMAP percentages to provide additional funding to IV-E agencies (ARRA, Section 5001 as amended by Section 201 of the Education, Jobs and Medicaid Assistance Act , Pub. L No. 111 -226) . These temporary increases will affect rates for FYs 2009 and 2010 and the first three quarter s of FY 2011 only (i.e., October 1, 2008 - June 30, 2011 ). Generally, aside from the possi ble applicability of a hold harmless provision, an increase of 6.2 percent will be added to the FMAP percentage rate of every State for quarters from October 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010 . In accordance with Section 201 of Pub. L. No. 111 -226, t he ARR A temporary FMAP percentage rate increase is extended for an additional 6 months, but the level of increase is modified as follows: 3.2 percent for the quarter ending March 31, 2011 and 1.2 percent for the quarter ending June 30, 2011 . Effective October 1, 2009, separate Tribal FMAP rates, which are based upon the Tribe's service area and population, apply to Foster Care program maintenance payments incurred by Tribes that are participating in title IV -E programs through either direct operation of an appr oved title IV - E plan or through operation of a title IV -E agreement or contract with a State title IV -E agency. The methodology for calculating Tribal FMAP rates was provided through a final notice in the Federal Registe r that is available on the internet as follows: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR - 2011 -08-01/pdf/2011 -19358.pdf . The calculated FMAP rate for each Tribe includes any statutory temporary percentage increase applicable to State FMAP rates and applies unless it is exceeded by the FMAP rate for any State in which the Tribe is located (42 USC 679B(d) and 42 USC 679B(e)). c. Staff and Adopt ive Parent Training - The percentage of Federal funding in expenditures for short - and long -term training at educational institutions of employees or prospective employees, and short -term training of current or prospective foster or adoptive parents and me mbers of staff of State/Tribe - licensed or State/Tribe -approved child care institutions (including travel and per diem) is 75 percent (42 USC 674(a)(3)(A) and (B); 45 CFR section 1356.60(b)). June 2012 Adoption Assistance Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.659 -12 d. Professional Partner Training - The percentage of Federal fund ing in expenditures for short -term training of: relative guardians; State/Tribe - licensed or State/Tribe -approved child welfare agencies providing services to children receiving title IV -E assistance; child abuse and neglect court personnel; agency, child o r parent attorneys; guardians ad litem; and, court appointed special advocates is subject to an increasing FFP rate for these additional trainee groups as follows: 55 percent in FY 2009; 60 percent in FY 2010; 65 percent in FY 2011; 70 percent in FY 2012; 75 percent in FY 2013 and thereafter ( 42 USC 674(a)(3)(B), as added by S ection 203(b) of Pub .L. No. 110-351). e. Administrative Costs (1) The percentage of Federal funding for expenditures for planning, design, development, and installation and operation of a statewide or tribal service area -wide automated child welfare information system meeting specified requirements (and expenditures for hardware components for such systems) is 50 percent (42 USC 674(a)(3)(C) and (D); 45 CFR sections 1355.52 and 1356.60 (d)). (2) The percentage of Federal funding for adoption placement non - recurring cost expenditures is 50 percent for IV -E agency expenditures up to $2000 for each adoptive placement (45 CFR section 1356.41(f)(1)). (3) The percentage of Federal funding of a ll other allowable administrative expenditures, is 50 percent (42 USC 674(a)(3)(E); 45 CFR sections 1356.41(f) and 1356.60(c)). 2.1 Level of Effort - Maintenance of Effort A IV-E agency is required to spend an amount equal to any savings in State or tribal expenditures under title IV -E as a result of applying the differing program eligibility rules to applicable children for a fiscal year to provide any service that is permitted under title IV -B or IV -E (42 USC 673(a)(8)). 2.2 Level of Effort - Supplement Not Supplant - Not Applicable 3. Earmarking - Not Applicable H. Period of Availability of Federal Funds This program operates on a cash accounting basis and each year's funding and accounting is discrete. To be eligible for Federal funding, claims must be submitted to ACF within two years after the calendar quarter in which the IV -E agency made the expenditure. This limitation does not apply to prior period decreasing adjustments and June 2012 Adoption Assistance Title IV -E HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.659 -13 any claim qualifying for a time limits exception in accordance w ith 45 CFR section 95.19 (42 USC 1320b -2; 45 CFR sections 95.7, 95.13, and 95.19).

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The purpose of the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) program is to provide funds to States (including the District of Columbia and five territories) to provide services for individuals, families, and entire population groups in one or more of the following areas: (1) achieving or maintaining economic self -support and self -sufficiency to prevent, reduce, or eliminate dependency; (2) pr eventing or remedying neglect, abuse, or exploitation of children and adults unable to protect their own interests; (3) preserving, rehabilitating, or reuniting families; (4) preventing or reducing inappropriate institutional care by providing for communit y-based care, home -based care, or other forms of intensive care; and (5) securing referral or admission for institutional care when other forms of care are not appropriate, or providing services to individuals in institutions. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Admini stration and Services The SSBG program is administered by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Funds are awarded based on the State's population following receipt and review of the State's report on the proposed use of funds for the coming year, which serves as the State's plan. States have the flexibility to determine what services will be provided, consistent with the statutory goals and objectives, who is eligible, and how funds will be distributed among services and entities within the State, including whether to provide services directly or obtain them from other public or private agencies and individuals. The State must also conduct a public hearing on the proposed use and distribution of funds, as included in the report, as a prerequisite to the receipt of SSBG funds. Source of Governing Requirements The SSBG program is authorized under Title XX of the Social Security Act, as amended, and is codified at 42 USC 1397 thro ugh 1397e. The implementing regulations for this and other block grant programs authorized by Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 are published at 45 CFR part 96. Those regulations include both specific requirements and general administrative requi rements in lieu of 45 CFR part 92 (the HHS implementation of the A -102 Common Rule) for the covered block grant programs. Requirements specific to SSBG are in 45 CFR sections 96.70 through 96.74. As discussed in Appendix I of this Supplement, Federal Pr ograms Excluded from the A -102 Common Rule, States are to use the fiscal policies that apply to their own funds in administering SSBG. Procedures must be adequate to assure the proper disbursal of and accounting for Federal funds paid to the grantee, incl uding procedures for monitoring the assistance provided (45 CFR section 96.30). June 2012 SSBG HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.667 -2 Under the block grant philosophy, each State is responsible for designing and implementing its own SSBG program, within very broad Federal guidelines. States must administer t heir SSBG program according to their approved plan and any amendments and in conformance with their own implementing rules and policies. III. COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS In developing the audit procedures to test compliance with the requirements for a Federal program, the auditor should first look to Part 2, Matrix of Compliance Requirements, to identify which of the 14 types of compliance requirements described in Part 3 are applicable and then look to Parts 3 and 4 for the details of the requirements. A. Activities Allowed or Unallowed 1.

Unifo rm definitions for these services are included in Appendix A to 45 CFR part 96 - Uniform Definitions of Services. Expenditures for these services may include expenditures for administration, including planning and evaluation, personnel training and retrain ing directly related to the provision of those services (including both short - and long -term training at educational institutions), and conferences and workshops, and assistance to individuals participating in such activities (42 USC 1397a(a)). 2. A State may purchase technical assistance from public or private entities if the State determines that such assistance is required in developing, implementing, or administering the SSBG program (42 USC 1397a(e)). 3. A State may transfer up to 10 percent of its ann ual allotment to the following block grants for support of health services, health promotion and disease prevention activities, low -income home energy assistance, or any combination of these activities: Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant (C FDA 93.991); Block Grants for Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse (CFDA 93.959); Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant to the States (CFDA 93.994); Low -Income Home Energy Assistance (CFDA 93.568); Block (93.569 ) 45 CFR HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.667 -3 4. In FY 2009, an additional amount of funding was made available to those States (a) for which the President declared a major disaster during 2008 and (b) previously receiving a declaration for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. That funding is available to support services as under the regular SSBG program, as well as health and mental health services, and for repair and construction of health care facilitie s (including mental health facilities), child care centers, and other social service facilities (Pub. L. No 110 -329, Chapter 7). 5. Funds may not be used for: a.

OTHER INFORMATION Transfers out of SSBG As discussed in III.A, \"Activities Allowed or Unallow ed,\" funds may be transferred out of SSBG to other Federal programs. The amounts transferred out of SSBG are subject to the requirements of the program into which they are transferred and should not be included in the audit universe and total expenditures of SSBG when determining Type A programs. On the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards, the amount transferred out should not be shown as SSBG expenditures but should be shown as expenditures for the program into which they are transferred. Transfer s into SSBG A State may transfer up to 10 percent of the combined total of the State family assistance grant, supplemental grant for population increases, and bonus funds for high performance and illegitimacy reduction, if any, (all part of TANF) for a giv en fiscal year to carry out programs under the SSBG. Such amounts may be used only for programs or services to children or their families whose income is less than 200 percent of the poverty level. The amount of the transfers is reflected on the quarterly ACF -196, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Financial Report .

June 2012 HIT Regional Extension Centers HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.718 -1 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CFDA 93.718 HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY REGIONAL EXTENSION CENTERS PROGRAM I. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The purpose of the Health Information Technology Regional Extension Centers (REC) program is to furnish assistance, defined as education, outreach, and technical assistance, to help providers in their geographic service areas select, successfully implement, and meaningfully use certified electronic health record (EHR) technology to impr ove the q uality and value of health care. Regional centers will also help providers achieve, through appropriate available infrastructures, exchange of health information in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements , and patient pre ferences. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH ) Act, part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. L. No. 111 -5) authorizes incentive payments for eligible Medicare and Medicaid providers' meaningful use of certifi ed EHR technology. The detailed criteria to qualify for meaningful use incentive payments are established by the Secretary of HHS through the formal rulemaking process with Stage 1 Meaning ful Use criteria released July 13, 2010. In 2015, providers are expected to have adopted and be actively utilizing an EHR in compliance with the meaningful use definition or they will be subject to financial penalties under Medicare (per Sections 4 101(b) and 4102(b) of ARRA). Providers seeking to meaningfully use EHRs face a variety of challenging tasks. Those tasks include assessing needs, selecting and negotiating with a system vendor or reseller, implementing project management, and instituting workflo w changes to improve clinical performance and ultimately, outcomes. Past experience has shown that robust local technical assistance can result in effective implementation of EHRs and quality improvement throughout a defined geographic area. The REC program , administered by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), within the Office of the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Servi ces, has established 62 regional centers, each serving a defined geographic area. Entities eligible to serve as regional centers are domestic, nonprofit institution s or organization s, or group thereof. Awards under this program were made as 4 -year cooperative agreements with one 4 -year budget period . Each regional center will provid e federally supported individualized technical assistance to a minimum of 1,000 priority primary -care providers in the 4 years of the cooperative agreement. Funding for years 3 and 4 are contingent upon the Regional Extension Center receiving a positive b iennial evaluation at the end of year 2. June 2012 HIT Regional Extension Centers HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.718 -2 Pursuant to requirements of the HITECH Act, priority in providing technical assistance under the REC program must be given to providers that are primary -care providers (physicians and/or other health care professi onals with prescriptive privileges , such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) in any of the following settings: individual and small group prac tices (ten or fewer professionals with prescriptive privileges ) primarily focused on primary care; public and critical access hospitals ; community health centers and rural health clinics; and other settings that predominantly serve uninsured, underinsured, and medically underserved populations. The regional centers are expected to leverage and undertake activities that are in synergy with the expertise , capability , and activities of federally supported practice networks, where locally available, including, but not limited to, those supported by the Indian Health Service, the Health Resources and Services Administration , the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense , and relevant Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services demonstration projects.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The purpose of the State Grants to Promote Health Information Technology (State Health Information Exchan ge Cooperative Agreements) p rogram is to continuously improve and expand health information exchange (HIE) services over time to reach all health care providers in an effort to improve the quality and efficiency of health care. This program is one of several programs that, collectively, are intended to facilitate the adoption and use of electronic health records (EHRs ) and facilitate and expand the secure, electronic mov ement and use of health information among organizations according to nationally recognized standards. The governance, policy , and technical infrastructure supported through this program will enable standards -based HIE and a high -performance health care sy stem. This program builds on existing efforts to advance regional and State -level HIE while moving towards nationwide interoperability. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. L. No. 111 -5) includes the Healt h Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (the HITECH Act) that sets forth a plan for advancing the appropriate use of health information technology (HIT) to improve quality of care and establish a foundation for health care ref orm. Widespread adoption and meaningful use of HIT is one of the foundational steps in improving the quality and efficiency of health care. The appropriate and secure electronic exchange and consequent use of health information to improve quality and coo rdination of care is a critical enabler of a high - performance health care system. The State HIE program is administered by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), an office within the Office of the Secretary, Depart ment of Health and Human Services. Awards are in the form of cooperative agreements to States (which includes the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories - Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa) or State -designated non-profit entities (SDEs) . ONC will award no more than one cooperative agreement per State; however groups of States may combine their efforts into one project , resulting in an award to a multi -State consortium . Each coo perative agreement award is for both planning and implementation, except for States that have a plan approved by the National Coordinator prior to award , in which case they receive implementation funding only . Funding amounts will be determined as follows: Base Al location + Equity Adjustments + Needs -Based Adjustments. These cooperative agreements focus on developing the State -wide policy, governance, technical infrastructure and business practices needed to support the delivery of HIE services. The resulting capa bilities for healthcare -providing entities to exchange health information must meet the Medicaid and Medicare meaningful use requirements for health care providers (specifically Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Record Incentive Program 42 CFR parts 412, 413, 422, and 495) to achieve financial incentives. Cooperative agreement recipients will evolve and June 2012 State Health Information Exchange (HIE) Cooperative Agreements HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.719 -2 advance the necessary governance, policies, technical services, business operations and financing mechanisms for HIE over a 4 -year performance period .

Level of Effort - Not Applicable 3. Earmarking 1. The State HIE program cooperative agreements are funded with monies through three separate funding streams. The recipient is responsible for tracking and reporting expenditures for each funding stream. The specific allocations for each funding category a re included on the Notice of Award, which includes, as an attachment, \"State Health Information Exchange Cooperative Agreement Program Guidance for Reporting Expenditures.\" This guidance provides instruction for allowable program activities within each fu nding stream. Planning funds (CAN #19999SH): As required in Section 3013, recipients cannot expend funds on implementation until they obtain ONC approval on submitted State plans. To support the State planning activities, ONC allocated funds to each re cipient receiving a cooperative agreement that does not have an approved plan. Recipients are allowed 10 percent or a maximum of $1 million, whichever is the smaller amount, of their total award for planning expenses. Sub-national/Regional (intra -state) H IE (CAN#19999NF): Congress provided not more than and also not less than $300 million for intra -state HIE development. This activity is interpreted by ONC to be funding for implementation and operational activities that directly enable or benefit HIE act ivities within the State. Each recipient is given a specific allowance for intra-state HIE capacity development in proportion to its overall June 2012 State Health Information Exchange (HIE) Cooperative Agreements HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.719 -5 award. The recipient must not spend more and must not spend less than this allowance on intra -state activities. Nationwide (inter -state) HIE (CAN#19999SJ): ONC provided an additional amount of funding per recipient for HIE activities that enable State participation in inter -state HIE and the Nationwide Health Information Network activities. Inter -state HIE costs are those in any of the five domains listed above that are expended in order that health information is enabled to be shared across State borders between unaffiliated organizations. 2.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES Title XXI of the Social Security Act (Act) author izes the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to assist State efforts in initiating and expanding the provision of child health assistance to uninsured, low -income children. Under title XXI, States may provide child health assistance primarily for o btaining health benefits coverage through (1) obtaining coverage under a separate child health program that meets specific requirements; (2) expanding benefits under the State's Medicaid plan under title XIX of the Act; or (3) a combination of both. To be eligible for funds under this program, States must submit a State child health plan (State plan), which must be approved by the Secretary. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Administration and Services At the Federal level, CHIP is administered by the Department of H ealth and Human Services, through the Center for Medicaid, CHIP, Survey, and Certification (CMCS) of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Title XXI authorizes grants to States that initiate or expand health insurance programs for low - incom e, uninsured children. Under title XXI, CHIP is jointly financed by the Federal and State governments and is administered by the States. Within broad Federal guidelines, each State determines the design of its program, eligible groups, benefit packages, payment levels for coverage and administrative and operating procedures. CHIP provides a capped amount of funds to States on a matched basis. Federal payments under title XXI to States are based on State expenditures under approved plans that could be ef fective on or after October 1, 1997. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (Pub . L. No. 110-173) extended CHIP funding through March 31, 2009 to provide adequate funding to States for the purpose of maintaining their current enrollment through that date. Subsequently, the Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA 2009) (Pub. L. No. 111 -3) reauthorized CHIP through FY 2013. State Plans Title XXI State plans and amendments to those plans are approved in CMS's central office. The plans are submitted for review by an intra -Departmental team, which must decide upon approval or disapproval within a 90 -day period. This \"90 -day clock\" can be stopped by send ing a formal written request for additional information from the State, and can be restarted at the same point when a response is formally received. Copies of State plans are available from the State CHIP administrator and through the CMS website: http:// www.cms.gov/home/chip.asp. June 2012 CHIP HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.767 -2 Waivers The State may apply for a waiver of CHIP Federal requirements. Waivers are intended to provide flexibility needed to enable States to try new or different approaches to the efficient and cost-effective delivery of health care services, or to adapt their programs to the special needs of particular areas or groups of enrollees. Waivers allow exceptions to State plan requirements that permit the State to implement innovative programs or activities on a time -limited basis. Such demonstration projects are subject to specific safeguards for the protection of enrollees and the program. The Secretary will approve only demonstration projects that are consistent with key principles of the CHIP statute. States' waiver authority i s found at 42 USC 1397gg(e), which extends to CHIP the Medicaid waiver authority at 42 USC 1315. Source of Governing Requirements This program is authorized by Section 490l(a) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), Pub. L. No. 105 -33, as amended by P ub. L. No. 105 -100, which added title XXI to the Social Security Act (Act), and subsequent amendments to title XXI. Title XXI authorizes CHIP to assist State efforts to initiate and expand the provision of child health assistance to uninsured, low-income children. Title XXI is codified at 42 USC 1397aa -1397jj. The regulations for this program are found at 42 CFR part 457. Awards under CHIP are no longer excluded from coverage under the HHS implementation of the A-102 Common Rule, 45 CFR part 92 ( Federal Register , September 8, 2003, 68 FR 52843 - 52844). This change is effective for any grant award under this program made after issuance of the initial awards for the second quarter of Federal fiscal year (FY) 2004. This program also is subject to the requir ements of 45 CFR part 95 and the cost principles under Office of Management and Budget Circular A -87 (as provided in Cost Principles and Procedures for Developing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Agreements with the Federal Government , HHS Publication ASMB C -10, available on the Internet at http://rates.psc.gov/fms/dca/asmb%20c -10.pdf ).

III. COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS In developing the audit procedures to test compliance with the requirements for a Federal prog ram, the auditor should first look to Part 2, Matrix of Compliance Requirements, to identify which of the 14 types of compliance requirements described in Part 3 are applicable and then look to Parts 3 and 4 for the details of the requirements. June 2012 CHIP HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.767 -3 A. Activiti es Allowed or Unallowed 1. Activities Allowed - States have general flexibility in allocating their individual allotments toward activities needed to conduct the CHIP (42 USC 1397ee(a)). In addition to expenditures for child health assistance under the pl an for targeted low-income children, other allowable activities, to the extent permitted by 42 USC 1397ee(c), include payment of other child health assistance for targeted low - income children; expenditures for health services initiatives for improving the health of children (targeted and other low income) under the plan; expenditures for outreach activities; and other reasonable costs incurred by the State to administer the plan (42 USC 1397ee). 2. Activities Unallowed - Federal funds may not be expended un der the State plan to pay for any abortion or to assist in the purchase, in whole or in part, of health coverage that includes coverage of abortion, except if necessary to save the life of the mother or if the pregnancy is the result of incest or rape (42 USC 1397ee(c)). E. Eligibility 1. Eligibility for Individuals a. States have flexibility in determining eligibility levels for individuals for whom the State will receive enhanced matching funds within the guidelines established under the Act. Generally, a State may not cover children with higher family income without covering children with a lower family income, nor deny eligibility based on a child having a preexisting medical condition. States are required to include in their State plans a description of the standards used to determine eligibility of targeted low - income children. State plans should be consulted for specific information concerning individual eligibility requirements (42 USC 1397bb(b)). States have the option to extend eligibility to low -income targeted pregnant women. There is no income eligibility level for pregnant women in CHIP that is lower than the State's Medicaid level, and States must cover pregnant women up to 185 percent of the Federal poverty level before they can elect the o ption to include pregnant women in the CHIP State plan (Pub. L. No. 111 -3, Section 111). b. Qualified aliens, as defined at 8 USC 1641, who entered the United States on or after August 22, 1996, are not eligible for a separate child health program under title XXI (CHIP) for a period of five years, beginning on the date the alien became a qualified alien, unless the alien is exempt from this five year bar under the terms of 8 USC 1613. States must provide coverage under a separate child health program und er title XXI to all other otherwise eligible qualified aliens who are not barred from coverage under 8 USC 1613 (42 CFR section 457.320(b)(6)). June 2012 CHIP HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.767 -4 c. States may elect to provide medical assistance, notwithstanding section 401(a), 402(b), 403, and 421 of the P ersonal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, to children and pregnant women who are lawfully residing in the United States and who are otherwise eligible for such assistance. This optional coverage in CHIP is only applicable if the State has elected to apply this allowance with respect to such category of children or pregnant women under title XIX Pub. L. No. 111-3, Section 214). 2. Eligibility for Group of Individuals or Area of Service Delivery - Not Applicable 3. Eligibility f or Subrecipients - Not Applicable G. Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking 1. Matching The State matching rate for its CHIP expenditures is determined in accordance with the Federal matching rate for such expenditures, referred to as the enhanced Federal m edical assistance percentage (Enhanced FMAP) for a State. That is, the CHIP State matching rate is calculated by subtracting the Medicaid FMAP rate from 100, taking 30 percent of the difference, and then adding it to the Medicaid FMAP rate. The Enhanced FMAP is calculated in accordance with 42 USC 1397ee(b), which provides that the Enhanced FMAP for a State shall never exceed 85 percent. Calculated FMAPs and enhanced FMAPs may be found on the Internet at http://www.aspe.hhs.gov/health/fmap.htm (42 USC 1397ee(a) and (b)). A qualifying State may elect to be paid from the State's allotment for any of FYs 2009 through 2013, an amount equal to the additional amount that would have been paid to the State u nder title XIX with respect to expenditures if the enhanced FMAP had been substituted for the FMAP (42 USC 1397ee(g)(4)). The qualifying States are Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Wash ington, and Wisconsin (as determined by CMS on the basis of the criteria in Pub. L. No. 108 - 74, section 1(g)(2) and Pub. L. No. 108 -127, section 1). 2.1 Level of Effort - Maintenance of Effort a. In order to receive Federal matching funds for CHIP expendit ures at the enhanced matching rate, each State must continue to maintain its Medicaid eligibility standards and the methodologies that were applied in its Medicaid State plans as of June 1, 1997 (42 USC 1397ee(d)(1) and 1397jj(b)). June 2012 CHIP HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.767 -5 b. Three States, New Yo rk, Florida and Pennsylvania, maintain \"existing comprehensive State -based programs.\" For these three States only, beginning with FY 1999, the amount of the State's allotment for a fiscal year is reduced by the amount that the \"children's health insurance expenditures\" for the previous fiscal year is less than the total of such expenditures for FY 1996. For purposes of this provision, the term \"children's health insurance expenditures\" means: the State share of title XXI (CHIP) expenditures; the State sha re of expenditures under title XIX (Medicaid) attributable to an enhanced FMAP under section 1905(u) of the Act (42 USC 1396d(u)); and State expenditures for health benefits coverage under an existing comprehensive State -based program (42 USC 1397cc(d)(1) and 1397ee(d)(2)). 2.2 Level of Effort - Supplement Not Supplant - Not Applicable 3. Earmarking Expenditures not directly related to providing child health insurance assistance under the plan are limited to 10 percent of the State's total expenditures through CHIP. The following expenditures are subject to the 10 percent limit: (a) payment for othe r child health assistance for targeted low -income children; (b) expenditures for health services initiatives under the State child health assistance plan for improving the health of children; (c) expenditures for outreach activities; and (d) other reasona ble costs incurred by the State to administer the State child health assistance plan (42 USC 1397ee(c)). States may apply for a waiver, or variance of this 10 percent cap under 42 USC 1397ee(c)(2). If applicable, information regarding such a waiver is in the State plan. The 10 percent limit is applied on an annual fiscal -year basis and is calculated based on: (a) the total amounts of expenditures and (b) the quarter in which such expenditures are claimed by the State for the fiscal year (42 USC 1397ee). H. Period of Availability of Federal Funds The availability of amounts allotted for each of FYs 1998 through 2008 shall remain available for expenditure by the State through the end of the second succeeding fiscal year (i.e., the year of the award and two s ubsequent fiscal years); and for FY 2009 and each fiscal year thereafter, shall remain available for expenditure by the State through the end of the succeeding fiscal year (i.e., the year of award and one subsequent fiscal year) (42 USC 1397dd(e) and (f), as amended by Pub.

Medicaid is th e largest dollar Federal grant program and under OMB budgetary guidance and Pub. L. No. 107 -300, HHS is required to provide an estimate of improper payments for Medicaid. Improper payments mean any payment that should not have been made or that was made i n an incorrect amount (including overpayments and underpayments) under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements; and includes any payment to an ineligible recipient, and any payment for an ineligible service, any dup licate payment, payments for services not received, and any payments that does not account for credit for applicable discounts. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) (Pub. L. No. 111 -148) will result in signific ant expansion of the program in the future (see IV, \"Other Information,\" in this program supplement). While not precluding an auditor from determining that the Medicaid Cluster qualifies as a low - risk program (e.g., because prior audits have shown strong internal controls and compliance with Medicaid requirements), the above should be considered as part of the risk assessment process and audit documentation should support the consideration. I. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES Medical Assistance Program The objective o f the Medical Assistance Program (Medicaid or Title XIX of the Social Security Act, as amended, (42 USC 1396 et seq .)) is to provide payments for medical assistance to low - income persons who are age 65 or over, blind, disabled, or members of families with dependent children or qualified pregnant women or children. State Medicaid Fraud Control Units States are required as part of their Medicaid State plans to maintain a State Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU), unless the Secretary of HHS determines that cer tain safeguards are met regarding fraud and abuse. The mission of the MFCUs is to investigate and prosecute fraud by Medicaid providers. The State MFCUs also review complaints alleging abuse or neglect of patients in health care facilities receiving paym ents under the State Medicaid plan, and may review complaints of misappropriation of patients' private funds in such facilities. States are June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -2 required to refer all suspected violations of applicable Medicaid laws and regulations by providers to the MFCU. F ederal requirements for the establishment and continued operations of the units are contained in 42 USC 1396b(a)(6), 1396b(b)(3), and 1396b(q); and 42 CFR part 1007. A key requirement of the governing regulations is that a unit must be a single identifiab le entity of State government. The HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) is the agency responsible for the Federal oversight of the State MFCUs. In order to receive the Federal grant funds necessary to sustain their operations, the units must submit an application for Federal assistance to the OIG on an annual basis. The recently enacted Affordable Care Act provides additional tools and resources to fight fraud in the health care system by providing an additional $350 million over the next 10 years th rough the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account. The Affordable Care Act toughened sentencing for criminal activity, enhanced screenings and enrollment requirements, encouraged increased sharing of data across government, expanded overpayment recove ry efforts, and provided greater oversight of private insurance abuses. The Affordable Care Act also included tools and resources to help States reduce improper payments through the establishment of recovery audit contractors (RACs). State Survey and Certification of Health Care Providers and Suppliers The objective of the State Survey and Certification of Health Care Providers and Suppliers program is to determine whether the providers and suppliers of health care services under the Medicaid program a re in compliance with regulatory health and safety standards and conditions of participation. This program is administered in a manner similar to Medicaid and includes an approved State plan that addresses Federal requirements. Even though the State MFCUs and State Survey and Certification of Health Care Providers and Suppliers have substantially less Federal expenditures than the Medicaid Assistance Program, they are clustered with Medicaid because these programs provide significant controls over the expe nditures of Medicaid funds. It is unlikely that the expenditures for these two programs would be material to the Medicaid cluster; however, noncompliance with the requirements to administer these controls may be material. State Survey and Certification Am bulatory Surgical Center Healthcare -Associated Infection (ASC -HAI) Prevention Initiative The objectives of the ASC -HAI Prevention Initiative , which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, are as follows: (1) Improve State agency inspection capability a nd frequency for onsite surveys of Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs) nationwide; (2) Use a new infection control survey tool developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS ); (3) Improve the survey process through the use of a CMS tracer methodology; and June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -3 (4) Use multi -person teams for ASCs over a certain size or complexity. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES The following paragraphs are intended to provide a high -level, overall description of how Medicaid generally operates. It is not practical to provide a complete description of program procedures because Medicaid operates under both Federal and State laws and regulations and States are afforded flexibility in program administration. Accordingly, the following p aragraphs are not intended to be used in lieu of or as a substitute for the Federal and State laws and regulations applicable to this program. Administration The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administers the Medicaid program in cooperation with State governments. The Medicaid program is jointly financed by the Federal and State governments and administered by the States. For purposes of this program, the term \"State\" includes the 50 Sta tes, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories: Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Medicaid operates as a vendor payment program, with States paying providers of medical services directly. P articipating providers must accept the Medicaid reimbursement level as payment in full. Within broad Federal rules, each State decides eligible groups, types and range of services, payment levels for services, and administrative and operating procedures. State Plans States administer the Medicaid program under a State plan approved by CMS. The Medicaid State plan is a comprehensive written statement submitted by the State Medicaid agency describing the nature and scope of its Medicaid program. A State plan for Medicaid consists of preprinted material that covers the basic requirements, and individualized con tent that reflects the characteristics of each particular State's program. The State plan is referenced to the applicable Federal regulation for each requirement and will also contain references to applicable State regulations. The State plan contains all information necessary for CMS to determine whether the State plan can be approved to serve as a basis for determining the level of Federal financial participation in the State program. The State plan must specify a single State agency (hereinafter referr ed to as the \"State Medicaid agency\") established or designated to administer or supervise the administration of the State plan. The State plan must also include a certification by the State Attorney General that cites the legal authority for the State Me dicaid agency to determine eligibility. The State plan also specifies the criteria for determining the validity of payments disbursed under the Medicaid program. This encompasses the system the State will use to ensure that payments are disbursed only to eligible providers for appropriately priced services that are covered by the Medicaid program and provided to eligible beneficiaries. Payments must also be based on claims that are adequately supported by medical records, and payments must not be duplicat ed. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -4 A State plan or plan amendment will be considered approved unless CMS sends the State written notice of disapproval or a request for additional information within 90 days after receipt of the State plan or plan amendment. Copies of the State plan are available from the State Medicaid agency. Waivers The State Medicaid agency may apply for a waiver of Federal requirements. Waivers are intended to provide the flexibility needed to enable States to try new or different approaches to the efficient and cos t-effective delivery of health care services, or to adapt their programs to the special needs of particular areas or groups of beneficiaries. Waivers allow exceptions to State plan requirements and permit a State to implement innovative programs or activi ties on a time - limited basis, and are subject to specific safeguards for the protection of beneficiaries and the program. Actions that States may take if waivers are obtained include: (1) implement a primary care case - management system or a specialty physi cian system; (2) designate an entity to act as a central broker in assisting Medicaid beneficiaries to choose among competing health care plans; (3) share with beneficiaries (through the provision of additional services) cost -savings made possible through the beneficiaries' use of more cost effective medical care; (4) limit beneficiaries' choice of providers to providers that fully meet reimbursement, quality, and utilization standards, which are established under the State plan and are consistent with acc ess, quality, and efficient and economical furnishing of care; (5) include as medical assistance, under its State plan, home and community -based services furnished to beneficiaries who would otherwise need inpatient care that is furnished in a hospital or nursing facility, and is reimbursable under the State plan; and (6) impose a deduction, cost -sharing or similar charge of up to twice the nominal charge established under the State plan for outpatient services for certain non-emergency services (except tha t, pursuant to the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, a State may, at its option and without a waiver, charge higher co -payments for non -emergency services provided in an emergency room). A State may also obtain a waiver of statutory requirements to provide a n array of home and community -based services, which may permit an individual to avoid institutionalization (42 CFR part 441 subpart G). Depending on the type of requirement being waived, a waiver may be effective for initial periods ranging from two to fi ve years, with varying renewal periods. Copies of waivers are available from the State Medicaid agency. Payments to States Once CMS has approved a State plan and waivers, it makes quarterly grant awards to the State to cover the Federal share of Medicaid expenditures for services, training, and administration. The amount of the quarterly grant is determined on the basis of information submitted by the State Medicaid agency (in quarterly estimate and quarterly expenditure reporting). The grant award autho rizes the State to draw Federal funds as needed to pay the Federal financial participation portion of qualified Medicaid expenditures. The HHS Payment Management System, Division of Payment Management (PMS -DPM) in Rockville, Maryland, disburses Federal fu nds to States including funding under Medicaid. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -5 State Expenditure Reporting Thirty days after the end of the quarter, States electronically submit the CMS -64, Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for the Medical Assistance Program . The CMS -64 presents expenditures and recoveries and other items that reduce expenditures for the quarter and prior period expenditures. The amounts reported on the CMS -64 and its attachments must be actual expenditures for which all supporting documentation, in readily revie wable form, has been compiled and is available immediately at the time the claim is filed. States use the Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System to electronically submit the CMS -64 directly to CMS. Eligibility Eligibility for Medicaid is based on categori cal (e.g., families and children, aged, blind, and disabled) and financial (e.g., income/resources) status. The States must provide services to mandatory categorically needy and other required special groups. States may provide coverage to members of opt ional groups and medically needy individuals (individuals who are eligible for Medicaid after deducting medical expenditures from their income). Eligibility criteria will be specified in the individual State plan. Under the Personal Responsibility and Wor k Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, the cash welfare program known as Aid for Dependent Children (AFDC) was repealed and replaced with block grants to States known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Under Medicaid, children and paren ts who received AFDC were automatically enrolled in Medicaid. However, Medicaid for children and parents who would have met the State's old AFDC income and asset standards in place on July 16, 1996, has been preserved whether or not these individuals are eligible for the new TANF system (Pub. L. No. 104 -193). States must provide limited Medicaid coverage for \"qualified Medicare beneficiaries.\" These are aged and disabled persons who are receiving Medicare, whose income is below 100 percent of the Federal poverty level, and whose resources do not exceed twice the allowable amount under SSI (42 CFR section 407.40). The State plan will specify if determinations of eligibility are made by agencies other than the State Medicaid agency and will define the relati onships and respective responsibilities of the State Medicaid agency and the other agencies. States are required to have (1) documentation of qualified alien status if the applicant/recipient is not a U.S. citizen, (2) facts in the case record to support the agency's eligibility determination, and (3) a written application on a form prescribed by the agency and signed under a penalty of perjury. The State must require a written application signed under penalty of perjury and include in each applicant's ca se record facts to support the agency's decision on his/her application. The State must provide notice of its decision concerning eligibility and provide timely and adequate notice of the basis for discontinuing assistance. In cases of persons who are no t U.S. citizens, the State must obtain documentation of qualified alien status (42 CFR sections 435.907, 435.912, and 435.913; 42 USC 1320b -7; Section 1137 of the Social Security Act). June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -6 Services Medicaid expenditures include medical assistance payments for eligible recipients for such services as hospitalization, prescription drugs, nursing home stays, outpatient hospital care, and physicians' services, and expenditures for administration and training. In order for a medical assistance payment to be conside red valid, it must comply with the requirements of Title XIX, as amended, (42 USC 1396 et seq. ) and implementing Federal regulations. Determinations of payment validity are made by individual States in accordance with approved State plans under broad Fede ral guidelines. Some States have managed care arrangements under which the State enters into a contract with an entity, such as an insurance company, to arrange for medical services to be available for beneficiaries. The State pays a fixed rate per person (capitation rate) without regard to the actual medical services utilized by each beneficiary. Medicaid expenditures also include administration and training, the State Survey and Certification Program, and State Medicaid Fraud Control Units. Medicare Buy -In Program The Medicare Buy -In Program, also known as QMB (Qualified Medicare Beneficiary) and SLIMB (Specified Low -Income Medicare Beneficiary), is designed to protect low -income Medicare beneficiaries from the significant and growing costs required to re ceive Medicare coverage, including out -of-pocket cost sharing expenses (deductibles and co -payments). The program connects the two largest public health programs in the country, Medicare and Medicaid, as Medicaid pays for all or part of the Medicare premiu m and deductible amounts for individuals who are financially eligible. The QMB (Qualified Medicare Beneficiary) Program serves individuals with modest assets (up to $4,000 per individual or $6,000 per couple) with combined incomes that do not go over 100 percent of the Federal poverty level. The State Medicaid program pays their Medicare Part B premiums and cost -sharing amounts. The SLIMB (Specified Low -Income Medicare Beneficiary) Program pays only the Part B premium for those with incomes between 100 and 120 percent of poverty with assets up to $4,000 per individual or $6,000 per couple. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Section 5001 of ARRA provides eligible States with significant increases in their respective Federal medical assistance percentages (FMAPs), which are used for the purpose of determining the amounts of Federal funds available to States for their medical assistance expenditures under the Medicaid program. These increases are effective for a period of 9 calendar quarters between October 1, 2008, and December 31, 2010. Under the ARRA increased FMAP provision, there are a number of requirements and conditions that States must meet in order to continue to be eligible under ARRA for the increase in their FMAPs or for the increase in the FMAP s to be applicable to certain expenditures in their Medicaid programs during this period. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -7 Extension of ARRA . On August 10, 2010, the President signed the extension of ARRA increase in FMAP (Pub. L. No. 111 -226) that would continue the addit ional Federal a ssistance for 6 months, ending June 30, 2011, but would phase down the level of assistance. Prior to the ARRA extension, the ARRA FMAP increase was scheduled t o expire on December 31, 2010. The across the board ARRA increase of 6.2 percent is reduced to 3.2 percent and 1.2 percent for the second and third quarters of FY 2011, respectively. Therefore, the ARRA FMAPs for Quarter 2 of FY 2011 are 3 percent age points less than the Quarter 1 levels (6.2 percent minus 3.2 percent) , and the ARRA FMAPs for Quart er 3 of FY 2011 are 2 percent age points less than those for Quarter 2 (3.2 percent minus 1.2 percent). In recognition of these provisions, CMS has provided proxies for Quarters 1 through 3 FY 2011 ARRA FMAPs. ARRA FMAP Proxies for FY 2011 . The Secretary of HHS issues the increased FMAPs for each State, as determined in accordance with section 5001 of ARRA, and consistent with the availability of the necessary data. Because of the timing related to the issuance of the published increased FMAPs under ARRA for each quarter, CMS processed the initial grant awards for the second quarter of FY 2011 using Quarter 2 proxies as provided by CMS since the increased ARRA FMAPs for the second quarter of FY 2011 are not yet available. Under current law, the increased FMAP rates under ARRA are applicable through the end of the third quarter of FY 2011, and therefore, the increased ARRA FMAP proxies for Quarters 1 through 3 should be used for their corresponding quarters of FY 2011 (Note: all three quarters have different ARRA rates). Maintenance of Effort ARRA allows States to receive the increased Medicaid funds only if they have not acted since July 1, 2008 to reduce the income limits for Medicaid or otherwise make it more difficult for people to get or keep M edicaid. (The statute gives States until July 1, 2009 to reverse any eligibility cuts that they enacted or implemented after July 1, 2008 and, thus, qualify for the additional funds.) Section 5001(f)(2) of ARRA provides that the increased FMAP is not ava ilable \"for any claim received by a State from a practitioner ...for such days during any period in which the State has failed to pay claims in accordance with\" the timely processing of claims standards as referenced at Section 1902(a)(37) of the Social Se curity Act (the Act), and in implementing Federal Medicaid regulations (at 42 CFR section 447.45(d)). Under ARRA, with respect to practitioners the prompt pay provision applies only \"to claims made for covered services after the date of enactment.\" Since ARRA was enacted on February 17, 2009, the increased FMAP is not available for any practitioner claims received by a State on such day(s), beginning with February 18, 2009, that the State is not in compliance with the prompt pay provision. As described be low, in accordance with the applicable timely processing standards, claims received prior to February 18, 2009 will be considered in determining compliance with these standards, beginning on February 18, 2009. ARRA also requires that, beginning after a gra ce period ending May 31, 2009, the prompt pay standards as applicable to practitioner claims also will apply to hospital and nursing facility provider claims, insofar as such claims are paid on the basis of submission of claims from these providers. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -8 Under title XIX of the Social Security Act and Federal Medicaid regulations at 42 CFR section 447.45(d) in effect prior to the enactment of ARRA, and which continue to be in effect, there are two prompt pay standards referenced by the ARRA prompt pay provisions which are applicable to claims (as specified in the regulation) that are received from practitioners on or after February 18, 2009: 90 percent of clean claims received by the State must be paid within 30 days of receipt. 99 percent of clean claims received by the State must be paid within 90 days of receipt. Note that, under ARRA, the provider claims that are used to determine compliance with the prompt pay standards are separate and distinct from the provider claims that are received on days of non -compliance with the prompt pay standards. The claims received on the days of non - compliance are not eligible for the increased FMAP. These are not the claims that are reviewed to determine compliance. Indian Care Although Me dicaid allows States to impose enrollment fees, premiums, and cost -sharing charges on Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program participants, Section 5006 of ARRA precludes them from imposing these charges on Indian applicants, according to the guid ance released by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Specifically, Section 5006(a) of ARRA: exempts Indians from paying enrollment fees, premiums or similar charges if they are served by an Indian health care provider; exempts Indians from payin g a deductible, coinsurance, copayment or similar charges for Medicaid -covered services if they are served by an Indian health care provider; and prohibits any reduction in payment due under Medicaid to the Indian health care provider serving an Indian (i .e., a State must pay these providers the full Medicaid payment rate for furnishing the service). Statutory Changes Affecting the Future Direction of the Medicaid Program The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), Pub. L. No. 111 -148 (enac ted March 23, 2010) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (HCERA) of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-152 (enacted March 30, 2010) include numerous health -related provisions affecting the Medicaid program. A summary of the provisions of these laws is included under IV, Other Information. The provisions of these two statutes have varying implementation dates. The statutes allow flexibility in (1) in implementing certain provisions and (2) tailoring the individual State program to comply. A summary of the relevant provisions of these statu tes is included in IV, \"Other Information.\" Auditors should be aware of the provisions of these laws in designing their audit procedures. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -9 Control Systems Utilization Control and Program Integrity The State plan must provide methods and procedures to safe guard against unnecessary utilization of care and services, including those provided by long -term care institutions. In addition, the State must have: (1) methods of criteria for identifying suspected fraud cases; (2) methods for investigating these cases ; and (3) procedures, developed in cooperation with legal authorities, for referring suspected fraud cases to law enforcement officials. These requirements may be met by the State Medicaid agency assuming direct responsibility for assuring the requirements or by contracting with a quality improvement organization (QIO) (formerly know n as peer review organization (PRO)) to perform such reviews. The reviewer must establish and use written criteria for evaluating the appropriateness and quality of Medicaid services. The State Medicaid agency must have procedures for the ongoing post -payment review, on a sample basis, for the necessity, quality, and timeliness of Medicaid services. The State Medicaid agency may conduct this review directly or may contract with a QIO. Suspected fraud identified by utilization control and program integrity should be referred to the State Medicaid Fraud Control Units. Inpatient Hospital and Long -Term Care Facility Audits States are required to establish as part of the State plan s tandards and methodology for reimbursing inpatient hospital and long -term care facilities based on payment rates that represent the cost to efficiently and economically operate such facilities and provide Medicaid services. The State Medicaid agency must provide for the filing of uniform cost reports by each participating provider. These cost reports are used by the State Medicaid agency to aid in the establishment of payment rates. The State Medicaid agency must provide for periodic audits of the financ ial and statistical records of the participating providers. Such audits could include desk audits of cost reports in addition to field audits. These audits are an important control for the State Medicaid agency in ensuring that established payment rates are proper. ADP Risk Analyses and System Security Reviews The Medicaid program is highly dependent on extensive and complex computer systems that include controls for ensuring the proper payment of Medicaid benefits. States are required to establish a sec urity plan for ADP systems that include policies and procedures to address: (1) physical security of ADP resources; (2) equipment security to protect equipment from theft and unauthorized use; (3) software and data security; (4) telecommunications securit y; (5) personnel security; (6) contingency plans to meet critical processing needs in the event of short - or long -term interruption of service; (7) emergency preparedness; and (8) designation of an agency ADP security manager. State agencies must establish and maintain a program for conducting periodic risk analyses to ensure appropriate, cost effective safeguards are incorporated into new and existing systems. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -10 State agencies must perform risk analyses whenever significant system changes occur. On a bienn ial basis State agencies shall review the ADP system security of installations involved in the administration of HHS programs. At a minimum, the reviews shall include an evaluation of physical and data security operating procedures, and personnel practice s. As part of complying with the above requirement, a State may obtain a Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16, Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization (SSAE 16) Type II report from its service organization (if the State has a s ervice organization). The Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70, Service Organizations (SAS 70) is superseded by SSAE 16. A SSAE 16 Type I report does not address the effectiveness of a service organization's controls and would need to be supplemented b y additional testing of controls at the service organization. The specific areas covered by a SSAE 16 report differ according to each individual service organization's operations; however, in every instance, the Type II report procedures assess the suffici ency of the design of an organization's controls and test their effectiveness. A number of commonly covered areas include: Control Environment Systems Development and Maintenance Logical Security Physical Access Computer Operations Input Controls Output Controls Processing Controls Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) The MMIS is the mechanized Medicaid benefit claims processing and information retrieval system that States are required to have, unless this requirement is waived by the Se cretary of HHS. HHS provides general systems guidelines (42 CFR sections 433.110 through 433.131) but it does not provide detailed system requirements or specifications for States to use in the development of MMIS systems. As a result, MMIS systems will vary from State to State. The system may be maintained and operated by the State or a contractor. The MMIS is normally used to process payments for most medical assistance services and normally includes edits and controls that identify unusual items for f ollow up by the utilization control and program integrity unit. However, the State may use systems other than MMIS to process medical assistance payments. In many cases the operation of the MMIS is contracted out June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -11 to a private contractor. The State plan will describe the administration of each State's claims - processing system. Generally, the MMIS does not process claims from State agencies (e.g., State -operated intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded (ICF/MR)) and certain selected types of claims. The claims payments that are not processed through MMIS may be material to the Medicaid program. Federal Oversight and Compliance Mechanisms CMS oversees State operations through its organization consisting of a headquarters and 10 regional offices. CMS program oversight includes budget review, reviews of financial and program reports, and on-site reviews, which are normally targeted to cover a specific area of concern. CMS conveys areas of national and local concerns to the States through the region s. Technical assistance is used extensively to promote improvements in State operation of the program but enforcement mechanisms are available. CMS considers the single audit as an important internal control in its monitoring of States. Federal program o versight, because of its targeted nature, should not be used as a substitute for audit evidence gained through transaction testing. Medicaid Program Payment Error Rate Measurement On October 5, 2005, an interim final rule, with an opportunity for comment, was published in the Federal Register setting forth the State requirements to provide information to CMS for the purpose of estimating improper payments in the Medicaid program, as required under the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) of 2002. The effective date of these regulations is November 4, 2005. Source of Governing Requirements The auditor is expected to use the applicable laws and regulations (including the applicable State -approved plan) when auditing this program. The Federal law that au thorizes these programs is Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Title XIX), enacted in 1965 and subsequently amended (42 USC 1396 et seq .). The Federal regulations applicable to the Medicaid program are found in 42 CFR parts 430 through 456, 1002, and 10 07. Awards under the Medical Assistance Program (CFDA 93.778) are no longer excluded from coverage under the HHS implementation of the A -102 Common Rule, 45 CFR part 92 (Federal Register , September 8, 2003, 68 FR 52843 -52844). This change is effective for any grant award under this program made after issuance of the initial awards for the second quarter of Federal fiscal year (FY) 2004. This program also is subject to the requirements of 45 CFR part 95 and the cost principles under Office of Management and Budget Circular A -87 (2 CFR Part 225) (as provided in Cost Principles and Procedures for Developing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Agreements with the Federal Government , HHS Publication ASMB C - 10, available on the Internet at http://rates.psc.gov/fms/dca/asmb%20c -10.pdf ). June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -12 Availability of Other Program Information The HHS OIG issues fraud alerts, some of which relate to the Medicaid program. These alerts are available on th e Internet from the HHS OIG home page, Special Fraud Alerts section (http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/fraudalerts.asp ). Up-to-date program information , including State Medicaid Director and State Health offici al Letters , is available - Guidance/Federal -Policy -Guidance.html . III. COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS In developing the audit procedures to test compliance with the requirements for a Federal program, the auditor should first look to Part 2, Matrix of Compliance Requirements, to identify which of the 14 types of compliance requirements described in Part 3 are applicable and then look to Parts 3 and 4 for the details of the requirements. General Audit Approach for Medicaid Payments To be allowable, Medicaid costs for medical services must be: (1) covered by the State plan and waivers; (2) for an allowable service rendered (including supported by medical records or other evidence indicating that the service was actually provided and consistent with the medical diagnosis); (3) properly coded; and (4) paid at the rate allowed by the State plan. Additionally, Medicaid costs must be net of applicable credits (e.g., insurance, recoveries from other third parties who are responsible for covering the Medicaid costs, and drug rebates), paid to eligible providers, and only provided on behalf of eligible individuals. Due to the complexity of Medicaid program operations, it is unlikely the auditor will be able to support an opinion that Medicaid expenditures are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations (e.g., are allowable under the State plan) without relying upon the systems and internal controls. Examples of complexities include: Dependence upon large and complex ADP systems to process the large volume of Medicaid transactions. Medical services are provided directly to an eligible beneficiary, normally wit hout prior approval by the State. Medical service providers normally determine the scope and medical necessity of the services. Notice to the State that service is rendered is after -the-fact when a bill is sent. Payments systems do not include a review of original detailed documentation supporting the claim prior to payment. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -13 Complex billing charge structures and payment rates for medical services, including significance of proper coding of services (e.g., billing by diagnosis related groups (DRG)). Differen t types of Medicaid payments (e.g., inpatient hospital, physicians, prescription drugs and drug rebates). Medicaid has required control systems that should aid the auditor in obtaining sufficient audit evidence for Medicaid expenditures. These control sys tems are discussed in the preceding Program Procedures under Control Systems and are: (1) utilization control and program integrity; (2) inpatient hospital and long term care facility audits; (3) ADP risk analyses and system security reviews (e.g., of the MMIS); and (4) the MMIS normally includes edits and controls that identify unusual items for follow up by the utilization control and program integrity function. The first three generally are performed by specialists retained by the State Medicaid agency. The following table indicates the major types of Medicaid payments to which these controls will likely relate: Type of Medicaid Payment 1 2 3 4 Inpatient Hospital X X X X Physicians (including dental) X X X Prescription Drugs (net of rebates) X X X Institutional Long -Term Care X X X X Each of the above Medicaid payment types is tested for compliance with applicable laws and regulations under either III.A, \"Activities for Individuals.\" Based upon the assessed level of control risk, the auditor should design appropriate tests of the allowability of Medicaid payments. Testing likely will include tests of medical records, in which case the auditor should consider the need for assistance of specialists. The auditor may consider using the same specialists used by the State. The auditor should consider the following in planning and performing tests of controls and compliance: 1. III.N, \"Special Tests and Provisions\" includes required internal controls, which are compliance requirements (i.e., controls (1), (2), and (3) above), and audit objectives and procedures for each. The audit procedures will entail tests of work performed by the State Medicaid agency. 2. Tests of compliance with laws and regulations relating to III.A, B, and E below, and the compliance requirements enumerated in III.N should be coordinated. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -14 A. Activities Allowed or Unall owed 1. Funds can only be used for Medicaid benefit payments (as specified in the State plan, Federal regulations, or an approved waiver), expenditures for administration and training, expenditures for the State Survey and Certification Program, and expenditures for State Medicaid Fraud Control Units (42 CFR sections 435.10, 440.210, 440.220, and 440.180). 2. Case Management Services - The State plan may provide for case management services as an optional medical assistance service. The term \"case ma nagement services\" means services that will assist individuals eligible under the plan in gaining access to needed medical, social, educational, and other services. Medicaid case management services are divided into two separate categories: Administrative case management - Services must be identifiable with Title XIX benefit (e.g., outreach services provided by public school districts to Medicaid recipients). Medical/targeted case management - Services must be provided to an eligible Medicaid recipient. Se rvices do not have to be specifically medical in nature and can include securing shelter, personal needs, etc. (e.g., services provided by community mental health boards, county offices of aging). Case management services is an area of risk because of the high growth of expenditures and prior experience that indicates problems with the documentation of case management expenditures. With the exception of case management services provided through capitation (a process in which payment is made on a per benefic iary basis) or prepaid health plans, Federal regulations typically require the following documentation for case management services: date of service; name of recipient; name of provider agency and person providing the service; nature, extent, or units of s ervice; and, place of service (Pub. L. No. 99 -272, Section 9508; 42 CFR part 434). 3. Managed Care - A State may obtain a waiver of statutory requirements in order to develop a system that more effectively addresses the health care needs of its population. For example, a waiver may involve the use of a program of managed care for selected elements of the client population or allow the use of program funds to serve specified populations that would be otherwise ineligible (Section 1115 of the Social Security Act). Managed care providers must be eligible to participate in the program at the time services are rendered, payments to managed care plans should only be for eligible clients for the proper period, and the capitation payment should be properly calcula ted. Medicaid medical services payments (e.g., hospital and doctors charges) should not be made for services that are covered by managed care. States should ensure that capitated payments to providers are discontinued when a beneficiary is no longer enro lled for services. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -15 4. Medicaid Health Insurance Premiums - A State may enroll certain Medicare - eligible recipients under Medicare Part B and pay the premium, deductibles, cost sharing, and other charges (42 CFR section 431.625). 5. Disproportionate Share Hospital - Federal financial participation is available for aggregate payments to hospitals that serve a disproportionate number of low - income patients with special needs. The State plan must specifically define a disproportionate share hospital and the method of calculating the rate for these hospitals. Specific limits for the total disproportionate share hospital payments for the State and the individual hospitals are contained in the legislation (Section 1923 of the Social Security Act and 42 USC 1396 (r)). 6. Home and Community -Based Services - A State may obtain a waiver of statutory requirements to provide an array of home and community -based services which may permit an individual to avoid institutionalization (42 CFR part 441, subpart G). The HHS OIG has issued a special fraud alert concerning home health care. Problems noted include cost report frauds, billing for excessive services or services not rendered, and use of unlicensed staff. The full alert was published in the Federal Register on Au gust 10, 1995, (page 40847) and is available on the Internet from the HHS OIG home page, Special Fraud Alerts section ( http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/fraudalerts.asp ). 7. Medicare Part B Buy -In - 42 CFR sect ion 431.625(d)(1) and CMS Medicaid Manual - State Buy -in (Pub24) Sections 110 and 180 specify that Federal Financial Participation (FFP) is not available for States buy -in for non -cash Medical Assistance Only groups, e.g. the special income level group or the medically needy. FFP is available only for those individuals who are considered as some class of cash recipients or deemed to be a cash recipient or one of the Medicare Savings Program (MSP) groups. 8. Electronic Health Records (EHR) - States participating in the EHR incentive program can receive 90 percent FFP for approved processes, systems, and activities necessary to ensure the EHR incentive payments are being properly made ( Section 1903t of the Social Security Act, as amended by Section 42 01 of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act). B. Allowable Costs/Cost Principles Recoveries, Refunds, and Rebates (Costs must be the net of all applicable credits) 1. States must have a system to identify medical s ervices that are the legal obligation of third parties, such as private health or accident insurers. Such third -party resources should be exhausted prior to paying claims with program funds. Where a third -party liability is established after the claim is paid, reimbursement from the third party should be sought (42 CFR sections 433.135 through 433.154). June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -16 2. The State is required to credit the Medicaid program for (1) State warrants that are canceled and uncashed checks beyond 180 days of issuance (escheate d warrants) and (2) overpayments made to providers of medical services within specified time frames (42 CFR sections 433.300 through 433.320, and 433.40). Under S ection 6506 of the Affordable Care A ct, States now have up to 1 year (rather than 60 days) from the date of discovery of an overpayment for Medicaid services to recover, or to attempt to recover, such overpayment before making an adjustment to refund the Federal share of the overpayment. Except in the case of overpayments resulting from fraud , the adjustment to refund the Federal share must be made no later than the deadline for filing the quarterly expenditure report (Form CMS -64) for the quarter in which the 1 -year period ends, regardless of whether the State recovers the overpayment. 3. Section 1903(w)(1) of the Social Security Act (as amended by Pub. L. No. 102-234) provides that, effective January 1, 1992, before calculating the amount of Federal financial participation, certain revenues received by a State will be deducted from the State 's medical assistance expenditures. The revenues to be deducted are (1) donations made by health providers and entities related to providers (except for bona fide donations and, subject to a limitation, donations made by providers for the direct costs of out-stationed eligibility workers); and (2) impermissible health care -related taxes that exceed a specified limit USC 1396(b)(w); 42 CFR section 433.57). \"Provider -related donations\" are any donations or other voluntary payments (in - cash or in -kind) ma de directly or indirectly to a State or unit of local government by (1) a health care provider, (2) an entity related to a health care provider, or (3) an entity providing goods or services under the State plan and paid as administrative expenses. \"Bona f ide provider -related donations\" are donations that have no direct or indirect relationship to payments made under Title XIX (42 USC 1396 et seq .) to (1) that provider, (2) providers furnishing the same class of items and services as that provider, or (3) a ny related entity (42 CFR sections 433.58(d) and 433.66(b)). Permissible health care -related taxes are those taxes which are broad -based taxes, uniformly applied to a class of health care items, services, or providers, and which do not hold a taxpayer harm less for the costs of the tax, or a tax program for which CMS has granted a waiver. Health care -related taxes that do not meet these requirements are impermissible health care -related taxes (42 CFR section 433.68(b)). The provisions of Pub. L. No. 102 -234 apply to all 50 States and the District of Columbia, except those States whose entire Medicaid program is operated under a waiver granted under section 1115 of the Social Security Act (42 CFR part 433; Federal Register , August 13, 1993, 58 FR 43156 -43183) . June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -17 4. Section 1927 of the Social Security Act allows States to receive rebates for drug purchases the same as other payers receive. Drug manufacturers are required to provide a listing to CMS of all covered outpatient drugs and, on a quarterly basis, are required to provide their average manufacturer's price and their best prices for each covered outpatient drug. Based on these data, CMS calculates a unit rebate amount for each drug, which it then provides to States. No later than 60 days after the end of the quarter, the State Medicaid agency must provide to manufacturers drug utilization data. Within 30 days of receipt of the utilization data from the State, the manufacturers are required to pay the rebate or provide the State with written notice of dis puted items not paid because of discrepancies found. E. Eligibility 1. Eligibility for Individuals a. The State Medicaid agency or its designee is required to determine client eligibility in accordance with eligibility requirements defined in the approved State plan (42 CFR section 431.10). b. There are specific requirements that must be followed to ensure that individuals meet the financial and categorical requirements for Medicaid. These include that the State or its designee shall: (1) Require a written application signed under penalty of perjury and include in each applicant's case records facts to support the agency's decision on the application (42 USC 1320b -7(d); 42 CFR sections 435.907 and 435.913). (2) Use the income and eligibility verification sys tem (IEVS) to verify eligibility using wage information available from such sources as the agencies administering State unemployment compensation laws, Social Security Administration (SSA), and the Internal Revenue Service to verify income eligibility and the amount of eligible benefits. With approval from HHS, States may use alternative sources for income information. States also: (a) may target the items of information for each data source that are most likely to be most productive in identifying and pr eventing ineligibility and incorrect payments, and a State is not required to use such information to verify the eligibility of all recipients; (b) with reasonable justification, may exclude categories of information when follow -up is not cost effective; a nd (c) can exclude unemployment compensation information from the Internal Revenue Service or earnings information from SSA that duplicates information received from another source (42 USC 1320b -7(a); 42 CFR sections 435.948(e) and 435.953). June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -18 (3) Require, as a condition of eligibility objections, refuses to obtain a SSN. In redetermining eligibility, if the case record does not contain the required SSN, the agency must require the recipient to furnish the SSN (42 CFR section 435.920(b)) sections 435.910 and 920). (4) Verify each SSN of each applicant and recipient with SSA to insure that each SSN furnished was issued to that individual and to determine whether any others were issued (42 CFR sections 435.910(g) and 42 CFR 435.92 0). (5) Document qualified alien status if the applicant or recipient is not a U.S. citizen (42 USC 1320b -7d). (6) Redetermine the eligibility of Medicaid recipients with respect to circumstances that may change (e.g., income eligibility), at least every 1 2 months. The agency may consider blindness and disability as continuing until the review physician or review team determines that the recipient's blindness or disability no longer meets the definition contained in the plan. There must be procedures desi gned to ensure that recipients make timely and accurate reports of any changes in circumstances that may affect their eligibility. The State must promptly redetermine eligibility when it receives information about changes in a recipient's circumstances th at may affect his or her eligibility (42 CFR section 435.916). c. Qualified aliens, as defined at 8 USC 1641, who entered the United States on or after August 22, 1996, are not eligible for Medicaid for a period of five years, beginning on the date the ali en became a qualified alien, unless the alien is exempt from this five -year bar under the terms of 8 USC 1613. States must provide Medicaid to certain qualified aliens in accordance with the terms of 8 USC 1612(b)(2), provided that they meet all other eligibility requirements. States may provide Medicaid to all other otherwise eligible qualified aliens who are not barred from coverage under 8 USC 1613 (the five -year bar). All aliens who otherwise meet the Medicaid eligibility requirements are eligible for treatment of an emergency medical condition under Medicaid, as defined in 8 USC 1611(b)(1)(A), regardless of immigration status or date of entry. d. As discussed in the General Audit Approach for Medicaid Payments, the auditor will likely combine III.A, \" Activities Allowed or Unallowed,\" III.B, \"Allowable Costs/Cost Principles,\" and III.E, \"Eligibility.\" Therefore, compliance requirements related to amounts provided to or on behalf of eligibles were combined with III.A, \"Activities Allowed or Unallowed.\" June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -19 2. Eligibility for Group of Individuals or Area of Service Delivery - Not Applicable 3. Eligibility for Subrecipients - Not Applicable G. Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking 1. Matching The State is required to pay part of the costs of providing health care to the poor and part of the costs of administering the program. Different State participation rates apply to medical assistance payments. There are also different Federal financial p articipation rates for the different types of costs incurred in administering the Medicaid program, such as administration (including administration of family planning services), training, computer, and other costs (42 CFR sections 433.10 and 433.15). The auditor should refer to the State plan for the matching rates. 2. Level of Effort A State waiver may contain a level -of-effort requirement. 3. Earmarking A State waiver may contain an earmarking requirement. L. Reporting 1. Financial Reporting a. SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement - Not Applicable b.

Subaward Reporting under the Transparency Act - Applicable N. Special Tests and Provisions 1. Utilization Control and Program Integrity Compliance Requirements - The State plan must provide methods and procedures to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of care and services, including long -term care institutions. In addition, the State must have: (1) methods or criteria for identifying suspected fraud cases ; (2) methods for investigating these cases; and (3) procedures, developed in cooperation with legal authorities, for referring suspected fraud cases to law enforcement officials (42 CFR parts 455, 456, and 1002). Suspected fraud should be referred to the State Medicaid Fraud Control Units (42 CFR part 1007). The State Medicaid agency must establish and use written criteria for evaluating the appropriateness and quality of Medicaid services. The agency must have procedures for the ongoing post -payment rev iew, on a sample basis, of the need for and the quality and timeliness of Medicaid services. The State Medicaid agency may conduct this review directly or may contract with a QIO. Audit Objectives - To determine whether the State has established and imple mented procedures to: (1) safeguard against unnecessary utilization of care and services, including long term care institutions; (2) identify suspected fraud cases; (3) investigate these cases; and (4) refer those cases with sufficient evidence of suspecte d fraud cases to law enforcement officials. Suggested Audit Procedures a. Obtain and evaluate the adequacy of the procedures used by the State Medicaid agency to conduct utilization reviews and identifying suspected fraud. (1) Consider the qualifications o f the personnel conducting the reviews and identifying suspected fraud. Ascertain that the individuals possess the necessary skill or knowledge by considering the following: (1) professional certification, license, or specialized training; (2) the reputat ion and standing of licensed medical professionals in the view of peers; and (3) experience in the type of tasks to be performed. (2) Consider if the personnel performing the utilization review and identifying suspected fraud are sufficiently organized out side the control of other Medicaid operations to objectively perform their function. (3) Ascertain if the sampling plan implemented by the State Medicaid agency or the QIO was properly designed and executed. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -21 b. Test a sample of the cases examined by State Medicaid agency or the QIO and ascertain if such examinations were in accordance with the agency's procedures. c. Test a sample of the identified suspected cases of fraud and ascertain if the agency took appropriate steps to investigate and, if appropriate , make a referral. d. Based on the above procedures, consider the degree of reliance that can be placed on the utilization review and identification of suspected fraud in performing tests under III.A, \"Activities Allowed or Unallowed,\" III.B, Allowable \"Eligibility - Eligibility for Individuals.\" 2. Inpatient Hospital and Long -Term Care Facility Audits Compliance Requirement - The State Medicaid agency pays for inpatient hospital services and long -term care facility serv ices through the use of rates that are reasonable and adequate to meet the costs that must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated providers. The State Medicaid agency must provide for the filing of uniform cost reports for each participating provider. These cost reports are used to establish payment rates. The State Medicaid agency must provide for the periodic audits of financial and statistical records of participating providers. The specific audit requirements will be established by the State Plan (42 CFR section 447.253). Audit Objectives - To determine whether the State Medicaid agency performed inpatient hospital and long -term care facility audits as required. Suggested Audit Procedures a. Review the State Plan and State Medicaid agency operating procedures and document the types of audits performed (e.g., desk audits, field audits), the methodology for determining when audits are conducted, and the objectives and procedures of the audits. b. Through examination of documentation, a scertain that the sampling plan was carried out as planned. c. Select a sample of audits and ascertain if the audits were in compliance with the State Medicaid agency's audit procedures. d. Based on the above, consider the degree of reliance that can be p laced on the inpatient hospital and long term -care facility audits in performing tests under III.A, \"Activities Allowed or Unallowed,\" III.B, \"Eligibility - Eligibility for Individuals.\" June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -22 3. ADP Risk Analysis a nd System Security Review Compliance Requirement - State agencies must establish and maintain a program for conducting periodic risk analyses to ensure that appropriate, cost effective safeguards are incorporated into new and existing systems. State agenc ies must perform risk analyses whenever significant system changes occur. State agencies shall review the ADP system security installations involved in the administration of HHS programs on a biennial basis. At a minimum, the reviews shall include an eval uation of physical and data security operating procedures, and personnel practices. The State agency shall maintain reports on its biennial ADP system security reviews, together with pertinent supporting documentation, for HHS on -site reviews (45 CFR sect ion 95.621). Audit Objective - To determine whether the State Medicaid agency has performed the required ADP risk analyses and system security reviews. Suggested Audit Procedures a. Review the State Medicaid agency's policies and procedures, and document the frequency, timing, and scope of ADP security reviews. This should include any Type II reviews following Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16, Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization (SSAE 16) that may have been performed o n outside processors (service organizations). b. Consider the appropriateness and extent of reliance on such reviews based on the qualifications of the personnel performing the risk analyses and security reviews and their organizational independence from t he ADP systems. c. Review the work performed during the most recent risk analysis and security review. d. Based on the above, consider the degree of reliance that can be placed on the ADP Risk Analysis and System Security Reviews in performing tests under III.A, III.B, and III.E.1. 4. Provider Eligibility Compliance Requirement - In order to receive Medicaid payments, providers of medical services furnishing services must be licensed in accordance with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations to parti cipate in the Medicaid program (42 CFR sections 431.107 and 447.10; and section 1902(a)(9) of the Social Security Act) and the providers must make certain disclosures to the State (42 CFR part 455, subpart B (sections 455.100 through 455.106)). Audit Objec tive - To determine whether providers of medical services are licensed to participate in the Medicaid program in accordance with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, and whether the providers have made the required disclosures to the State. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -23 Sugg ested Audit Procedures a. Obtain an understanding of the State plan's provisions for licensing and entering into agreements with providers. b. Select a sample of providers receiving payments and ascertain if: (1) The provider is licensed in accordance with the State Plan. (2) The agreement with the provider complies with the requirements of the State Plan, including the disclosure requirements of 42 CFR 455 subpart B. 5. Provider Health and Safety Standards Compliance Requirement - Providers must meet the prescribed health and safety standards for hospital, nursing facilities, and ICF/MR (42 CFR part 442). The standards may be modified in the State plan. Audit Objective - To determine whether the State ensures that hospitals, nursing facilities, and ICF/MR that serve Medicaid patients meet the prescribed health and safety standards. Suggested Audit Procedures a. Obtain an understanding of the State Plan provisions that ensure that payments are made only to institutions that meet prescribed health and safety standards. b. Select a sample of payments for each provider type (i.e., hospitals, nursing facilities, and ICF/MR) and ascertain if the State Medicaid agency has documentation that the provider has met the prescribed health and safety standards. 6. Medica id Fraud Control Unit Compliance Requirement - States are required as part of their Medicaid State plans to maintain a MFCU, unless the Secretary of HHS determines that certain safeguards are met regarding fraud and abuse. Audit Objective - To determine w hether the State ensures suspected criminal violations are referred to an office with authority to prosecute cases of provider fraud. Suggested Audit Procedures a. Obtain an understanding of the States policies and procedures that ensure violations of Medi caid laws and regulations by providers are identified and are referred to an office with authority to prosecute cases of provider fraud. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -24 b. Select a sample of violations of Medicaid laws and regulations by providers and ascertain if the cases were referred to the State MFCU or, if the State does not have a MFCU, to an office with authority to prosecute cases of provider fraud. IV. OTHER INFORMATION Transfers into Medicaid (Title XIX) As described in Part 4, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) (CFDA 93.767), III.A.1, \"Activities Allowed or Unallowed,\" qualifying States may apply certain Medicaid program expenditures against their available CHIP allotments. In particular, qualifying States may use such Medicaid expenditures in amounts up to 20 percent of their available CHIP allotments through 2008 and, beginning April 1, 2009, as authorized by the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA), Public Law 111 -3 of 2009, up to 100 percent of their available CHIP allotments for FY 2009 and following fiscal years. The qualifying States, determined by CMS using the criteria in Pub. L. No. 108 -74 section 1(g)(2) and Pub. L. No. 108 - 127, section 1, are: Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Tenn essee, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. Amounts transferred into the State's Medicaid program are subject to the requirements of the Medicaid program when expended and should be included in the audit universe and total expenditures of this program when determining Type A programs. On the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards, the amounts transferred in should be shown as expenditures of this program when such amounts are expended. Improper Payments Auditors should be alert to the following which have been identified in audit findings both as non-compliance and material weaknesses. 1. Eligibility Determinations Findings related to eligibility determinations found internal control deficiencies including: eligibility determination and re -determination w ere not performed timely or performed within the timeliness standards, lack of internal controls over obtaining adequate documentation used to support eligibility determinations, the data inputted into the eligibility system were not accurate, clients info rmation were not verified to the Income Eligibility and Verification System (IEVS), and program staff did not have sufficient knowledge of program requirements and policies due to high turnover and lack of training. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -25 2. Medicaid Claims Processing Findings r elated to Medicaid claims processing found significant weaknesses including: inadequate documentation to support the payments claimed in the CMS -64; payments reported on the CMS -64 were not readily traceable to the individual claims or information in the s ub-system or the financial statements; inadequate internal control over utilization, fraud and accuracy of the Medicaid claims; lack of understanding of when to report payments in the CMS -64; lack of internal control in drawing down ARRA funds; inadequate internal control to assure that payments to providers were made in compliance with Federal regulations, e.g. payments for services that were not medically necessary and providers were not eligible Medicaid providers; and review of cost report and recoupme nt of rate adjustments were not timely. 3. Other areas of weaknesses identified included -- inadequate monitoring and oversight of subcontractors; inadequate monitoring and oversight to assure provider licensing, agreements or required certification were in effect and up -to-date, and that the related documentation were in file or in the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS); inadequate internal control related to implementation of MMIS replacement system; inadequate internal control regarding user ac cess to the MMIS including terminated employees' user access rights; and MMIS was not programmed and updated timely and accurately with proper information. Medicaid EHR Incentive Payment Program Title IV, Division B of ARRA established voluntary Medicare a nd Medicaid EHR incentive payments to eligible professionals, eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals, and certain Medicare Advantage organizations for the adoption and demonstration of meaningful use of certified EHR technology, as one component of the HITECH Act. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -26 Section 4201 of the HITECH Act amends section 1903 of the Act to provide 100 percent Federal financial participation (FFP) to States for incentive payments to certain eligible providers participating in the Medicaid program to purchas e, implement, operate (including support services and training for staff) and meaningfully use certified EHR technology. Auditors should be aware that funds made available to States for the Medicaid incentive program and the State's expenditure of those funds, including payments to eligible providers and costs of State administration of the program, are subject to the audit provisions of OMB Circular A -133.

Summary of Statutory Changes Affecting This Cluster Over Time AFFORDABLE CARE ACT - MEDICAID (Enacted March 23, 2010) Comprised of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), and Pub. L. No. 111 -148 and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (HCERA) of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111 -152 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), Pub. L. No. 111 -148 Title II - Role of Public Programs Subtitle A - Improved Access to Medica id Section 2001. Medicaid Coverage for the Lowest Income Populations (as amende d by Sections 10201(b) -(c) and Sections 1004(b)(1) and 1201 of HCERA) Eligibility Expansion in 2014: This provision creates a new mandatory Medicaid eligibilit y group under the State plan. The new eligibility group consists of individuals whose income is under 133 percent of the FPL, who are under 65, not pregnant and not other wise covered under Medicaid. In addition, income eligibility for children ages 6 to 18 years of age is expanded from 100 percent of the FPL to 133 percent of the FPL. States also have the option to cover individuals over 133 percent of the FPL and are permitted to phase -in the optional extension of eligibility over 133 percent, so long a s the State does not extend eligibility to higher -income individuals before cover ing lower -income individuals. For both the mandatory expansion to 133 percent and for any optional expansion over 133 percent, this provision requires that parents (or careta ker relatives) may not be enrolled under the Medicaid State plan or waiver of the plan unless their child is enrolled under the State plan or waiver of the plan or under oth er health insurance coverage. States have the option to provide a period of presum ptive eligibility for parents and non -pregnant childless adults in the same manner they provide a period of presumptive eligibility for children and pregnant women. Early Expansion Option: Effective April 1, 2010, this provision grants States the option to expand coverage early to individuals who will be in the new Medicaid expansion group prior to the mandatory eligibility expansion in 2014. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -27 Benefit Requirements: This provision requires t he new Medicaid expansion population to receive benchmark or benchmark -equivalent coverage consistent with Section 1937 of the SSA, regardless of whether the State has elected the option to provide benchmark or benchmark -equivalent coverage. This benchmar k benefit requirement applies to individuals covered under the early expansion option as well as individuals who will be covered in 2014. Individuals who are currently exempt from the application of benchmark and benchmark - equivalent coverage will continu e to remain exempt from this requirement; this includes mandatory pregnant women, blind and disabled individuals, and dual eligible individuals and other individuals as enumerated in Section 1937(a)(2)(B) of the SSA. This provision also adds mental health services and prescription drug coverage to the list of required basic services in benchmark -equivalent coverage and requires benchmark or benchmark -equivalent plans to comply with mental health parity services requirements. Beginning in 2014, benchmark a nd benchmark -equivalent plans must provide at least essential health benefits as described in Section 1302(b). Medicaid Maintenance of Effort Requirement: As a condition of continuing to receive Federal payments under Medicaid, this provision imposes a Medicaid maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement; the MOE requirement prohibits States from imposing eligibility standards, methodologies, or procedures that are more restrictive than those that were in effect as of the date of enactment. For adults, the Medicaid MOE requirement expires when the Exchange in the State is fully operational, but remain in effect for children under age 19 through September 30, 2019. A State is not considered to be in violation of the MOE if it applies the modified adjusted g ross income standard (as described in Section 2002) under the early expansion option prior to 2014. States also will not be in violation if they expand eligibility or move waiver populations into coverage under the State plan. However, States must contin ue comply with the MOE requirements as a condition of receiving increased Federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) payments as set forth in ARRA. This provision includes an exception to the MOE requirements for non -pregnant, non -disabled adults whose income exceeds 133 percent of the FPL, if during the period between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013, a State certifies, with the Secretary, that the State is projected to have a budget deficit. Requirement for Continuation of Political Subdivision Payments: Effective upon enactment, this provision provides that a State is not eligible for the increased FMAP available for the Medicaid expansion nor the ARRA FMAP increase if a State requires political subdivisions to pay a greater percentage of the n on-Federal share of Medicaid expenditures than they were paying on December 31, 2009. Voluntary contributions by a political subdivision are not considered a violation of this provision. Financing the Medicaid Expansion: This provision establishes tha t, for the purpose of applying an increased FMAP, the term \"newly eligible\" includes individuals up to 133 percent of FPL, who are not under 19 years of age and who, as of December 1, 2009, were not eligible under the Medicaid State plan or under a waiver of the plan for full benefits or benchmark or b enchmark -equivalent coverage. Individuals who were eligible, but not enrolled, for such benefits under a waiver with an enrollment ceiling are also considered to be \"newly eligible.\" This provision also esta blishes a uniform FMAP for all 50 States and the District of Columbia for expenditures related to newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -28 The Federal government will match the costs of covering \"newly eligible\" individuals as and 2020 and years thereafter: 90 percent. These matching rates do not apply to the early expansion option described above. States that opt to expand coverage between April 1, 2010 and January 1, 2014 will receive the regular Medicaid matching rate for such coverage until January 1, 2014. \"Expansion State\" Policy: This provision defines \"expansion States\" as States that currently offer health coverage statewide to parents and non -pregnant child less adults with income that is at least 100 percent of the FPL. To qualify as an expansion State, the coverage offered to parents and non -pregnant childless adults must include inpatient hospital services, coverage that is not dependent on access to empl oyer coverage, an employer contribution for coverage, and coverage that is not limited to premium assistance, hospital -only benefits, a high deductible plan, or alternative benefits under a Health Opportunity Account. For these expansion States, this prov ision provides an increased FMAP to reduce the State share of costs attributable to previously eligible, non -pregnant, childless adults under 133 percent of the FPL. For previously eligible childless adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the FPL, each expansion State will receive an increase in its FMAP equal to a specified percentage of the gap between its regular Medicaid matching rate and the enhanced match rate provided to other States. The \"transition percentage\" changes by year as percent; 2019 and years thereafter: 100 percent. In 2019 and thereafter, expansion States will be responsible for the same State share of the costs of covering non -pregnant, childl ess adults as non -expansion States will be (e.g., 7 percent in 2019, 10 percent thereafter). Also, between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015, a State that does not have any \"newly eligible\" individuals and has not been approved to divert its Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments to fund coverage expansions will receive a 2.2 percentage point increase in the FMAP for the costs of covering non -newly eligible individuals. Reporting Requirements: Beginning in January 2015 and annually thereaft er, this provision requires each State to submit a report to the Secretary that includes: 1) the total number of enrolled and newly enrolled individuals in the State plan or waiver of the plan for the fiscal year ending on September 30 of the preceding cal endar year, disaggregated by population; 2) a description of outreach and enrollment processes used by the State; and 3) any other data reporting determined necessary by the Secretary to monitor enrollment and retention. Beginning in April 2015 and annual ly thereafter, the Secretary is required to submit a Report to Congress on the total enrollment and new enrollment in Medicaid on a national and State -by-State basis and shall include recommendations for administrative or legislative changes to improve enr ollment in Medicaid. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -29 Section 2002. Income Eligibility for Nonelderly Determined using Modified Gross Income (as amended by Sec tion 1004 of HCERA) This provision establishes new rules, effective January 1, 2014, for determining eligibility for Medicaid, CHIP, and the Exchanges. These rules will generally replace the use of disregards in Medicaid and CHIP with the application of a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) standa rd. States are required, when determining MAGI eligibility, to utilize as the app licable income of an individual an amount equal to the individual's MAGI reduced by the dollar amount that is determined in accorda nce with Section 1902(e)(14). This requirement effectively raises the upper income eligibility level for the Medicaid expans ion from 133 percent of the FPL to 138 percent. This provision also generally prohibits the use of income disregards and asset tests in Medicaid, with certain exceptions for specific individuals, including the disabled and elderly, and individuals whos e income is determined as a result of eligibility for other Federal or State assistance programs (e.g., SSI, foster care). These individuals are also exempt from the MAGI requirements. This provision requires States to establish income eligibility thres holds for Medicaid populations using MAGI and household income that are not less than the effective income eligibility levels that are applied under the State plan or waiver on the date of enactment. Such eligibility thresholds are to be submitted to the Secretary for approval and the Secretary must ensure that the thresholds proposed by the State will not result in children losing coverage. This provision also requires States to develop an equivalent income test that ensures that individuals eligible for Medicaid on the date of enactment do not lose coverage during the transition to the MAGI standard, and requires that MAGI and household income be determined based on an individual's income as of the point in time at which the application for Medicaid is p rocessed. Section 2003. Premium Assistance for Employer -Sponsored Insurance (as amended by Section 10203(b)) Effective as if included in Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA), this provision aligns the definition of \" cost effective\" in Sections 1906(e)(2) and 1906A(a) of the SSA to the definition in Section 2105(c)(3)(A) of this Act and applies the definition to adults as well as to children. CHIPRA requires that premium assistance be cost effective relative to either the amount of expenditures under the State child health plan, including administrative expenditures, that the State would have made to provide comparable coverage to the child or family involved; or the aggregate amount of expenditures a State would have made under the child health plan, including administrative expenditures, for providing coverage under the plan for the child or their family. Section 2004. Medicaid Coverage for Former Foster Care Children (as amended by Section 10201(a)) Effective January 1, 2014, this provision c reates a new mandatory eligibility category for individuals who have aged -out of the foster care system and had previously received Medicaid while in foster care, so that they can remain eligible for Medicaid until they tur n 26. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -30 Presumptive eligibility rules are amended to apply to this new ma ndatory eligibility category. This provision also specifies that former foster care children remain eligible for the full scope of Medicaid benefits, rather than benchmark or benchmar k-equivalent benefits as mandated for individuals receiving coverage under Section 2001. Section 2005. Payments to territories (as amended by Sec tion 10201(d) and Sec tion 1204 of HCERA ) This provision specifies the terms and conditions for Territories t hat choose to establish an Exchange and provides $1 billion to the Territories for this purpose effective for CYs 2014 -2019. In addition, it raises the Territories' spending caps by $6.3 billion, beginning on July 1, 2011, through FY 2019. As of July 1, 2011, this provision permanently raises the Territories' FMAP rate from 50 percent to 55 percent. Section 2006. Special Adjustment to FMAP Determination for Certain States Recovering from a Major Disaster (as amended by Sec tion 10201(c)(5)) Starting January 1, 2011, this provision reduces projected decreases in the FMAP for States that have experienced major, statewide disasters. The criteria listed for a State to qualify for an FMAP adjustment are: 1) the President has declared for the State a major disaster under the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act during the preceding seven fiscal years, and determined as a result of such disaster that every county or parish in the State warranted public assistance under that Act; and 2) the State would have a decrease in its FMAP of at least three percentage points from the previous fiscal year, including a decrease in the base FMAP in any covered fiscal year as e stablished by ARRA. Under this provision, a qualifying State would see a n initial 50 percent reduction in the FMAP decrease it would otherwise experience under current law, and a 25 percent reduction in the subsequent years the State qualifies for this adjustment. Subtitle C - Medicaid and CHIP Enrollment Simplification Section 2201. Enrollment Simplification and Coordination with State Health Insurance Exchanges The provision requires States, as a condition of participation in Medicaid and receipt of Federal financial participation for calendar quarters beginning after Ja nuary 1, 2014, to establish procedures for the following : Enabling individuals to apply and renew their Medicaid eligibility through an Internet website; Enrolling without any further determination individuals who are identified by an Exchange established by the State as eligible for Medicaid or CHIP; Ensuring that individuals who are determined ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP are screened for eligibility for enrollment in qualified health plans offered by an Exchange, including eligibility for any premium credits and cost -sharing reductions; June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -31 Ensuring that the Medicaid agency, CHIP agency, and Exchange utilize a secure electronic interface to allow for Medicaid, CHIP, and premium assistance eligibility determinations; Coordinating Medicaid, CHIP, and Exchan ge coverage including EPSDT services; and Conducting outreach to and enrolling vulnerable and underserved populations including children, homeless youth, children and youth with special health care needs, pregnant women, racial and ethnic minorities, rural populations, victims of abuse or trauma, individual with mental health or substance -related disorders, and individuals with HIV/AIDS. In addition, the provision permits a State Medicaid and State CHIP agency to make eligibility determinations for premium credits and cost -sharing reductions on behalf of the Exchange. By not later than January 1, 2014, the provision requires States to have an Internet website that allows for comparisons of benefits, premiums, and cost -sharing applicable to an individual und er Medicaid with those available under a qualified health plan offered through an Exchange. These new requirements are included in a new Section 1943 of the SSA . Section 2202. Permitting Hospitals to Make Presumptive Eligibility Determinations for All Medicaid Eligible Populations Effective January 1, 2014, this provision allows hospitals and clinics that are participating Medicaid providers to be a qualified entity for purposes of determining, on the basis of preliminary information, whether any individu al is eligible for Medicaid for purposes of providing medical assistance during a p resumptive eligibility period. This provision broadens the populations for which presumptive eligibility decis ions may be made. The Secretary of HHS shall establish guidan ce related to this provision. Subtitle D - Improvements to Medicaid Services Section 2301. Coverage for Freestanding Birth Center Services Effective upon enactment, this provision requires States to cover services provided by freestanding birth ce nters as a mandatory service. A freestanding birth center service is defined as a service provided in a health facility that is not a hospital, where childbirth is planned to occur away from the pregnant woman's residence, is licensed or otherwise approved by t he State, and complies with State requirements. A grace period is granted to provide States an opportunity to pass legislation to amend their Medicaid State plans, if necessary under State law. Section 2302. Concurrent Care for Children Effective up on enactment, this provision allows children who are enrolled in either Medicaid or CHIP to receive hospice services without foregoing curative treatment related to a terminal illness. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -32 Section 2303. State Eligibility Option for Family Planning Services Effective upon enactment, this provision allows State Medicaid programs to cover family planning services and supplies without obtaining a waiver for individuals who are not pregnant and do not exceed the highest eligibility level for pregnant women. This p rovision also allows for such coverage during a presumptive eligibility period and adds family planning services and supplies as a required element of benchmark or benchmark -equivalent plans. Section 2304. Clarification of Definition of Medicaid Medical Assistance Effective upon enactment, this provision amends Section 1905 of the SSA to c larify the original intent of Congress that \"medical assistance\" encompasses both payment for services provided and the services themselves. Subtitle E - New Options for States to Provide Long -Term Services and Supports Section 2401. Community First Choice Option (as amended by Sec tion 1205 of HCERA) The provision establishes a new Medicaid State Plan option effective October 1, 2011 to allow States to cover home and community -based attendant services and supports for individuals with incomes not exceeding 150 percent of the FPL or, if greater, who have been determined to require an institutional level of care. It also requires States to make such services and supports available to individuals under a person -centered plan of care for purposes of assisting them in accomplishing activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, and health -related tasks through hands -on assistance, supervision, or cueing. States are provided an additional six percentage point increase in Federal Medicaid matching funds for services and supports provided to such individuals. The provision requires State compliance with c ertain requirements, an evaluation, and two Reports to Congress, with an interim report due not later than December 31, 2013 and a final report due by December 31, 2015. Section 2402. Removal of Barriers to Providing Home and Community -Based Services (HCB S) Amends Section 1915(i) of the SSA effective October 1, 2010 to permit States to cover individuals who are eligible for home and community -based services under a Section 1915(c), (d), or (e) waiver or Section 1115 demonstration and also establishes a 5 -year period to phase -in the enrollment of eligible individuals for States that choose to target services to specific populations with 5 -year renewal periods, lifts the prohibition on covering other services, and eliminates a State's option to cap enrollment and disregard statewideness. Section 2403. Money Follows the Person Rebalancing Demonstration The provision extends the demonstration, which currently runs through FY 2011, through FY 2017 and, effective April 22, 2010, shortens the length of time from s ix months to 90 days that an individual is required to reside in a facility prior to tr ansitioning to the community. For purposes of calculating the 90 -day period, the provision precludes the counting of any days during which an individual resides in an i nstitution on the basis of receiving short -term rehabilitative services covered by Medicare. Accordingly, $450 million for each of FYs 2012 -June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -33 2016 is provided for grants, of which not more than $1.1 million may be used each year for research on and a nation al evaluation of the program. Section 2404. Protection for Recipients of HCBS Against Spousal Impoverishment For a 5 -year period beginning on January 1, 2014, the provision requires States to extend impoverishment protections to spouses of individuals receiving Medicaid HCBS, as they are currently required to do for spouses of individuals residing in an institutional setting. Subtitle F - Medicaid Prescription Drug Coverage Section 2501. Prescription Drug Rebates (as amended by Sec tion 1206 of HCERA) Effective January 1, 2010, this provision increases the minimum rebate for single source and innovator multiple source outpatient prescription drugs from 15.1 percent to 23.1 percent. Under the provision, the minimum rebate for brand name drugs with clo tting factors and drugs with pediatric indications is increased from 15.1 percent of average manufacturer's price (AMP) to 17.1 percent of AMP and the rebate percentage for generic drugs is increased from 11 percent to 13 percent of AMP. This provision al lows the Federal government to capture savings from these increases in the minimum rebate percentages. Effective upon enactment, this provision requires drugs dispensed to Medicaid managed care enrollees to be subject to the same rebate amount required under Section 1927 of the SSA. Capitation rates paid to a managed care organization (MCO) must be based on the actual costs related to the rebates and are subject to regulations requiring actuarially sound rates. MCOs are required to report on a timely b asis information on the total number of units of each dosage form and strength and package size by National Drug Code (NDC) of each covered outpatient drug dispensed to Medicaid managed care enrollees. Effective January 1, 2010, this provision specifies the amount of the rebate for reformulated drugs. With respect to a drug that is a line extension of a single source drug or an innovator multiple source drug that is an oral solid dosage form, the rebate obligation will be the amount computed under Sectio n 1927 of the SSA or, if greater, the product of the AMP for the line extension drug, the highest additional rebate under Section 1927 for any strength of the original single source drug or innovator multiple source drug, and the total number of units of e ach dosage form and strength of the line extension product paid for under the Sta te plan in the rebate period. These requirements also apply to orphan drugs. In addition, this provision establishes a limit on the rebate amount for brand name drugs at 100 percent of AMP. Section 2502. Elimination of Exclusion of Coverage of Certain Drugs Beginning on January 1, 2014, this provision prohibits States from excluding smoking cessation drugs, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines from Medicaid coverage. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -34 Section 2503. Providing Adequate Pharmacy Reimbursement (as amended by Sec tion 1101(c) of HCERA) Effective October 1, 2010, this provision revises the Federal Upper Limit (FUL) to be no less than 175 percent of the weighted average (determined on the basis of utili zation) of the most recently reported monthly AMP for pharmaceutically and therapeutically equivalent multiple source drugs. This section also clarifies the definition of AMP to include sales by: 1) wholesalers for drugs distributed to retail community ph armacies; and 2) retail community pharmacies that purchase drugs directly from manufacturers. This section also excludes from the definition of AMP prompt payments, discounts provided by manufactures, and other discounts, and eliminates the requirement th at AMP data be disclosed to the public. This provision also adds a requirement that the weighted average of monthly AMPs and the average retail survey prices be disclosed to the public. Subtitle G - Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) Payment s Section 2551. Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) Payments (as amended by Sec tions 10201(e) -(f) and Sec tion 1203 of HCERA) As amended, this provision reduces States' DSH allotments by an aggregate annual reduction totaling $18.1 billion for FYs 2014 -2020 by applying a methodology that imposes the largest reductions on States with the lowest percentage of uninsured or States that do not target their DSH payments to hospitals with a high vol ume of Medicaid inpatients and high uncompensat ed care. A smaller reduction is applied to low DSH States. In addition, this provision extends Hawaii's DSH allotment through FY 2012, establishes Hawaii as a low DSH State beginning in FY 2013, and extends Tennessee's DSH allotment through FY 2013. Subtitle H - Improved Coordination for Dual Eligible Beneficiaries Section 2602. Providing Federal Coverage and Payment Coordination for Dual Eligible Beneficiaries No later than March 1, 2010, this provision requires the Secretary to establish a Federal Coordinated Health Care Office within CMS, intended to bring together officials and employees of the Medicare and Medicaid programs to more effectively integrate bene fits under those programs, and improve the coordination between the Federal and State governments for individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid benefits (\"dual eligibles\") to ensure that they have full access to the items and servic es to which th ey are entitled. It requires the Secretary, as part of the President's budget, to submit an annual Report to Congress containing recommendations for legislation that would improve care coordination and benefits for dual eligibles. Subtitle I - Improving t he Quality of Medicaid for Patients and Providers Section 2702. Medicaid Health Care -Acquired Conditions This provision directs the Secretary to identify State practices that prohibit payment for health care-acquired conditions and incorporate such pract ices, as appropriate for application to June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -35 Medicaid, into regulations in effect as of July 1, 2011. The regulations will prohibit Medicaid payment for services related to health care -acquired conditions specified in the regulation. The Secretary shall apply forthcoming Medicare regulations prohibiting payment for health care - acquired conditions as appropriate to the Medicaid program. Further, the Secretary may exclude certain payment exclusions identified for Medicare if those conditions are inapplicable to Medicaid beneficiaries. Section 2703. State Option to Provide Health Homes for Enrollees with Chronic Conditions Beginning January 1, 2011, this provision creates a new Medicaid State plan option under which States may provide payment for designated p roviders or teams of health care professionals for furnishing health home services, including care management, transitional care, patient and family support, referrals to community and social support services, and use of HIT, for individuals with at least two chronic conditions, one chronic condition and at -risk of a second chronic condition, or one serious and persi stent mental health condition. It allows States to claim a Federal Medicaid matching rate of 90 percent during the first eight fiscal quarters for such health home services and provides $25 million in planning grants that the Secretary may award States for purposes of developing its State plan amendment. As a condition of receiving payment for health home services, designated providers must rep ort to the State on quality measures and when appropriate and feasible, use HIT to provide such information. This provision requires the Secretary to contract for an independent evaluation of States that have exercised this option on the effects of this option on reducing admission rates to hospitals, emergency rooms, and skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). Further, the Secretary shall provide an interim Report to Congress by January 1,2014 based on State survey data collected by the Secretary, and a fin al Report to Congress on the results of the independent evaluation by no later than January 1, 2017. Subtitle K - Protections for American Indians and Alaska Natives Section 2901. Special Rules Relating to Indians This provision specifies that Indians with incomes at or below 300 percent of the FPL and enrolled in coverage through a State Exchange are exempt from cost -sharing (as s pecified in Section 1402(d)). This provision also establishes health programs operated by the Indian Health Service (IHS), Indian tribes, tribal organizations, or Urban Indian Organizations as the payer of last resort for services provided by those enti ties to eligible individuals. Finally, this section amends the Express Lane Option added by CHIPRA to specify that the IHS, a n Indian tribe, tribal organization, or urban Indian organization can make Express Lane determinations. Section 2902. Elimination of the Sunset for Medicare Part B Services Effective January 1, 2010, this provision eliminates the five -year sunset of rei mbursement (scheduled to take effect for services performed after December 31, 2009) for Part B services furnished by a hospital or skilled nursing facility of the IHS, whether operated by the IHS or by an Indian tribe or tribal organization. June 2012 Medicaid Cluster HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.778 -36 Subtitle L - Maternal and Child Health Services Section 2951. Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Programs This provision establishes a grant program for States, Territories, and Indian Tribes to create maternal, infant, and early childh ood home visita tion programs. The provision also requires States to conduct an initial needs assessment within six months of the date of enactment to identify populations who could benefit from these programs. The Secretary, with an independent advisory body, shall dev elop a plan within one year of enactment to establish the grant program, giving priority to programs that target specific high -risk populations. The Secretary is responsible for setting benchmarks, evaluating applications, and developing procedures and requirements for States, tribal organizations, and non -profit organizations to propose and implement a program that demonstrates quantifiable and measurable improvement on several maternal, child, and infant health benchmarks. This provision also requires a Report to Congress by March 31, 2015 on the Secretary's evaluation of the initial State needs assessments, and a Report to Congress by December 31, 2015 on the status of grants authorized under this program. Section 2954. Restoration of Funding for Absti nence Education This provision restores funding for Abstinence Education programs (Section 510 of the SSA) through FY 2014. Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (HCERA ) of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-152 Subtitle C - Medicaid Section 1202. Improving Payments for Primary Care Services For 2013 and 2014, this provision increases Medicaid fee -for-service and managed care payments for primary care services to equal that of payments under Medicare Part B. The provision defin es primary care services as evaluation and management services and services related to immunizations delivered by a physician with a primary care designation of family medicine, general internal medicine, or pediatric medicine. The increase in payment for such services will equal a 100 percent Federal match.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The objective of this program is to improve access to a comprehensi ve continuum of high -quality community -based primary medical care and support services in metropolitan areas that are disproportionately affected by the incidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The statut e refers to both persons infected with HIV and those who have clinically defined AIDS. These terms are used interchangeably in this compliance supplement but refer to this total universe of eligible individuals. Emergency financial assistance, in the form of formula -based funding and supplemental project - based funding, is provided to eligible metropolitan areas (EM As) and transitional grant areas (TGAs) to develop, organize, and operate health and support services programs for infected individuals and thei r care givers. The supplemental grants are discretionary awards and are awarded, following competition, to EMAs and TGAs that demonstrate need beyond that met through the formula award. They must also demonstrate the ability to use the supplemental amoun ts quickly and cost -effectively. Other criteria, contained in annual application guidance documents, may also apply. All EMAs and TGAs that are receiving formula assistance are also receiving supplemental assistance. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Administration The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services, administers the HIV emergency relief programs. HRSA uses data reported to and confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to determine eligibility (i.e., any metropolitan area for which there has been reported to and confirmed by the Director of CDC a cumulative total of more than 2,000 cases of AIDS for the most recent 5 calendar -year period for which data are availab le) and to establish the formula for allocation of funds. A TGA is defined as \" ... a metropolitan area fo r which there has been reported to, and confirmed by, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention a cumulative total of at least 1 000, but fewer than 2000, cases of AIDS during the most recent period of 5 calendar years for which such data is available. \" A metropolitan area is not eligible if it does not have an overall population of 50,000 or more. With respect to an EMA that rec eived funding in fiscal year (FY) 2006, the boundaries for determining eligibility are those that were in effect for the area in FY 1994. For areas becoming eligible for funding after FY 2006, the boundaries are those in effect at the time the area first receives funding under this program. At least two -thirds (66 2/3 percent ) of the appropriated amount is made available for the EMAs' and TGA's formula allocation and the remainder is awarded as supplemental project assistance on the basis of demonstrated need and other factors. EMAs and TGAs are funded for the June 2012 HIV Emergency Relief Proj ect Grants HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.914 -2 formula and supplemental allocation and project assistance on the basis of a single application and a combined award. An extension of TGA status is authorized if it has : (1) a cumulative total bet ween 1,400 -1,500 living cases of AIDS as of December 31 of the most recent calendar year for which data is available; and (2) less than 5 percent of an unobligated balance from its total Part A award. Funds previously awarded to TGAs that lose their status due to not meeting the eligibility and conti nued status requirements will be transferred to the State in which the TGA is located fo r 3 consecutive years. Funds are made available to the chief elected official of the EMA or TGA that administers t he public health agency that provides outpatient and ambulatory services to the greatest number of individuals with AIDS in the jurisdiction in accordance with statutory requirements and program guidelines. Day -to-day responsibility for the grant is ordin arily delegated to the jurisdiction's public health department, and some administrative functions may be outsourced to a private entity. The chief elected official of the jurisdiction is also required to establish or designate an HIV health services plann ing council, which carries out a planning process, coordinating with other State, local and private planning and service organizations, and establishes the priorities for allocating funds. Newly eligible areas designated as TGAs in FY 2007 and beyond may be exempt from the requirement to establish and use an HIV health services planning council. Consistent with funding and service priorities established through the public planning process, the receiving jurisdiction uses the funds to provide direct assista nce to public entities or private non-profit or for -profit entities to deliver or enhance HIV/AIDS -related core and support services; and, within established limits, for associated administrative activities. These administrative activities include EMA or TGA oversight of service provider performance and adherence to their subgrant or contractual obligations. Most of these service providers are non-profit organizations. Source of Governing Requirements This program is authorized under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006 (Pub. L.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The objective of this program is to assist States and territories in improving the quality, availability, and organization of health care and support services for individuals with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) disease /Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and their families. These objectives may be accomplished through provision of services by the State or HIV/AIDS care consortia in a home or community setting, or by paying health insurance premiums that would not otherwise be available to ensure continuity of care. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Administra tion and Services Grants are awarded annually, on a formula basis, to all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and territories of the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of Palau , the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands following submission of an application to and approval by the HIV/AIDS Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a component of the Department of Health and H uman Services. The responsible State agency, usually the State health department, is designated by the Governor. The application addresses how the State plans to address each of the five specified program components: (1) HIV care consortia; (2) home and c ommunity -based care; (3) health insurance continuation program; (4) provision of treatments; and (5) State direct services. This includes the State's plans for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP). ADAP is earmarked funding provided to the State as a separate amount in addition to the base formula grant amount, which includes supplemental funding. States may use a variety of service delivery mechanisms. States may provide some or all services directly, or may enter into agreements with local HIV care consortia, associations of public and non -profit health care and support service providers, and community -based organizations that plan, develop, and deliver services for individuals with HIV/AIDS. The State also may delegate some of its authority to moni tor provider agreements to a \"lead agency\" (fiscal agent) within the consortium, with specific responsibilities contained in a formal agreement between the State and that agency.

The State shall waive this requirement for an individual service provider in those instances when the provider does not impose a charge or accept reimbursement available from any third -party payer, including reimbursement under any insurance policy or any Federal or State health benefits program (42 USC 300ff -27(c)(4)(A)). 2. A State may not use grant funds to make payments for any item or service to the extent that payment has been made, or can reasonably be expected to be made, with respect to that item or service -- a. under any State compensation program, under an insurance policy, or under any Federal or State health benefits program; or b. by an entity that provides health services on a prepaid basis (except for a program administered by or providing the services of t he Indian Health Service) (42 USC 300ff -27(b)(7)(F)). 3. Any drug rebates received on drugs purchased from funds provided to establish a program of therapeutics must be used to support the types of activities otherwise eligible for funding under this program, with priority given to activities related to providin g therapeutics ( 42 USC 300ff -26(g) ). 4. Beginning in fiscal year, 2010, a State may request that its unobligated balance be reduced by the amount of unused ADAP rebate funds if expenditure of those funds would result in the grantee receiving an unobligated funds penalty (42 USC 300ff -31a(d), as amended by Section 10, Pub.

Drugs purchased from participating drug manufacturers by covered entiti es through the 340B Program may not be sold or transferred to anyone other than the patients of the covered entities. In addition, drugs purchased through the 340B Program are not entitled to rebates under the Medicaid program because this would result in duplicate discounts. While an organization is eligible to participate in the program, it must notify the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Office of Pharmacy Affairs ( OPA ) of its intention to participate by registering for the 340B Program. Participation in the 340B Program normally begins on the first day of a quarter. It is the entity's responsibility to tell its wholesaler or manufacturer that it is registered for 340B discount prices when it places an order. All organizations receiving 340B prices are required to maintain records of purchases of covered outpatient drugs and of any claims for reimbursement submitted for such drugs under title XIX of the Social Securi ty Act (Medicaid program, CFDA 93.778). Guidance for the 340B program is found in the following documents available at http://www.hrsa.gov/opa/federalregister.htm : \"Guidance Regarding Section 602 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 Limitation on Prices of Drugs Purchased by Covered Entities\" 5 8 FR 27289 (May 7, 1993 ) \"Final Notice Regarding Section 602 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 Duplicate Discounts and Rebates on Drug Purchases (5 8 FR 34058 -34059), June 23, 1993. \"Final Notice Regarding Section 602 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 Entity Guidelines \" 59 FR 25110 (May 13, 1994 ).

June 2012 HIV Care Formula Grants HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.917 -10 Accurate Information Section 340B of the PHSA requires OPA to maintain accessible data on the iden tity of participating entities. Covered entities are required to ensure the accuracy of the information in the database by regularly updating (at least annually) their informatio n, including the covered entity's exact name and street address , through submission of change request forms to OPA. Diversion Section 340B(a)(5)(B) of the PHSA prohibits covered entities from selling, transferring , or giving covered outpatient drugs to anyone other than patients of the covered entity. The statute does not define the term \"patient\" in section 340B and in 1996, HRSA issued a guideline regarding the definition of a \" patient\" under the 340B program . An individual is a ''patient'' of a covered entity (with the exception of State -operated or funded AIDS drug purchasing assistance programs) only if: (1) the covered entity has established a relationship with the individual, such that the covered entity mai ntains records of th e individual's health care; (2) the individual receives health care services from a health care professional who is either employed by the covered entity or provides health care under contractual or other arrangements (e.g. referral for consultation) such that responsibility for the care provided remains w ith the covered entity; and (3) the individual receives a health care service or range of services from the covered entity which is consistent with the service or range of services for which grant funding is provided.

A \"duplicate discount\" woul d occur if a n entity received a 340B discount and a Medicaid rebate were provided on the same drug. The mechanism that the Secretary established to comply with the legislation's mandate to prohibit duplicate discounts is a part of the OPA database called the Medica id Exclusion File (58 FR 34058 (June 23, 1993) and 59 Fed.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The objective of this program is to provide, on an outpatient basis, high -quality, early intervention services and primary care related to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This is accomplished by increasing the present capacity of eligible ambulatory health service providers to provide a continuum of HIV prevention for at -risk individuals, and care for individuals who are HIV -infected, including when applicable, perinatal care. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Administration and Services This program is administered at the Federal level by the HIV/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services. Grants are awarded to public and non -profit private entities, including federally qualified health centers under section 1905(1)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act. Grants ar e also awarded to non - State family planning organizations, comprehensive hemophilia diagnostic and treatment centers, rural health clinics, health facilities operated by or pursuant to a contract with the Indian Health Service, community -based organization s, clinics, hospitals, and other health facilities that provide early intervention services to those persons infected with HIV/AIDS through intravenous drug use, or to nonprofit private entities that provide comprehensive primary care services to populatio ns at risk of HIV/AIDS, including faith -based and community -based organizations. Those providers must be qualified Medicaid -participating providers unless an exception is granted by HRSA (42 USC 300ff -52(a)(1)(A) through (G) and -52(b)). The e arly intervention services (EIS) program enables primary health care providers to include a range of services from risk assessment, and HIV counseling, testing, and referral services to clinical care for people with HIV. Many of these providers receive ot her Federal funding, e.g., community and migrant health centers, but this categorical funding allows them to provide adequate funding for these services. Services may be provided directly by the grantee or through contractual agreements with other servic e providers. Source of Governing Requirements The HIV EIS grant program is authorized under Part C of Title XXVI of the PHS Act , as amended by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006 and Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 20 09 (Ryan White Program), and is codified at 42 USC 300ff -51 through 300ff -67. The program has no specific program regulations.

Audit Objectives - To determine if (1) a grantee's records are correct in the 340B database; (2) drugs were diverted to individuals who are not eligible patients; and (3) if the organization received duplicate discounts. Suggested Audit Procedures a. Determine if the grantee is participating in the 340B Program and, if so, continue with the remaining audit procedures. b. Review the grantee's latest change form submitted to OPA and compare it with the organization's actual physical location and other current information about the entity. c. Test a sample of drugs purchased for use under the funding program (CFDA 93.xxx) during the audit period to determine whether 340B drugs were properly identified through out the p rocurement process, including (1 ) paymen t at the discounted price and (2 ) proper identification as a 340B drug upon receipt. d. Test a sample of records of 340B drugs purchased for use under the funding program and released from inventory during the audit period to determine whether required authorizations were received, to whom the drugs were dispensed, and if the grantee determined that such individuals were eligible patients before dispensing the drugs . e. For eligible patients who received 340B drugs, t est a sample of Medicaid reimbursement requests to verify that the grantee did not claim, receive, or retain a duplicate rebate for those drugs under the Medicaid program . June 2012 Community Mental Health Services HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.958 -1 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CFDA 93.958 BLOCK GRANTS FOR COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES I. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The objective of the Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) Block Grant program is to provide funds to States and territories to enable them to carry out their respective plans for providing comprehensive community -based mental health services for adults with serious mental illness and children with serious emotional disturban ces. To insure creative and cost effective delivery of services, States are encouraged to develop solutions to address the specific mental health concerns of their local communities. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Administration and Services The Substance Abuse a nd Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), an operating division of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), administers the block grant program. Examples of CMHS Block Grant funded activities include: (1) a comprehensive, community -based system of mental health care for adults who have a serious mental illness and children and youth who have a serious emotional disturbances, including case management, treatment, rehabilitation, employment, housing, education, medical, dental, and other s upport services that enable individuals to function in the community and reduce the rate of psychiatric hospitalization; (2) outreach for homeless individuals who also suffer from serious mental illness and the development of special services for individua ls with serious illness living in rural areas; and (3) systemic integration of social, educational, juvenile justice, and substance abuse services with health and mental health services for children with a serious emotional disturbance to ensure that care is appropriate to their multiple needs (including services provided under the Individuals with Disabilities Act). CMHS funds are allocated to the States according to a formula legislated by Congress. States may then distribute these funds to cities, count ies, or service providers within their jurisdictions. Funds may only be used for carrying out the State plan, evaluating programs and services carried out under the plan, or planning, administration, and education activities relating to providing services under the plan. State Plan The State must submit to SAMHSA an annual application that includes a plan to meet the community mental health services objectives described above and signed assurances required by the Act. The State plan addresses how the State intends to comply with the various requirements of Title XIX, Part B, Subparts I and III of the Public Health Service Act (42 USC 300x) and its program objectives by addressing the five criteria listed in the statute. June 2012 Community Mental Health Services HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.958 -2 Source of Governing Requirements This program is authorized under Title XIX, Part B, Subparts I and III of the Public Health Service Act (42 USC 300x et seq. ). Criteria for the State plan may be found at 42 USC 300x -1. 45 CFR part 96 provides regulations for the general administrative requi rements for the covered block grant programs. These regulations are in lieu of 45 CFR part 92 (the HHS implementation of the A -102 Common Rule). In addition, States are to administer the CMHS program according to the plans that they submitted to SAMHSA. As discussed in Appendix I of this Supplement, Federal Programs Excluded from the A -102 Common Rule, States are to use the fiscal policies that apply to their own funds in administering CMHS. Procedures must be adequate to assure the proper disbursal of a nd accounting for Federal funds paid to the grantee, including procedures for monitoring the assistance provided (45 CFR section 96.30). Under the block grant philosophy, each State is responsible for designing and implementing its own CMHS program, within very broad Federal guidelines. States must administer their CMHS program according to their approved plan and any amendments and in conformance with their own implementing rules and policies. Availability of Other Program Information SAMHSA published a n otice in the Federal Register on July 6, 2001 (66 FR 35658) that details approval requirements for non -recurring expense exclusions from maintenance -of-effort calculations. A second SAMHSA Federal Register notice, published on November 23, 2001 (66 FR 587 46-58747) addresses retroactive application of the non -recurring expense exclusion. III. COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS In developing the audit procedures to test compliance with the requirements for a Federal program, the auditor should first look to Part 2, Mat rix of Compliance Requirements, to identify which of the 14 types of compliance requirements described in Part 3 are applicable and then look to Parts 3 and 4 for the details of the requirements. A. Activities Allowed or Unallowed 1.

June 2012 SAPT HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.959 -1 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CFDA 93.959 BLOCK GRANTS FOR PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE I. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The objective of the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant program is to provide funds to States, territories, and one Indian Tribe for the purpose of planning, carrying out and evaluating activit ies to prevent and treat Substance Abuse (SA) and other related activities as authorized by the statute. The SAPT Block Grant is the primary tool the Federal government uses to fund State SA prevention and treatment programs. While the SAPT Block Grant pr ovides Federal support to addiction prevention and treatment services nationally, it empowers the States to design solutions to specific addiction problems that are experienced locally. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Administration and Services The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), an operating division of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), administers the block grant program. For purposes of this guidance, the term \"State\" includes the 50 States , the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, Palau, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indian s. The States generally subaward funds for the provision of services to public and non -profit organizations. Service providers may include for -profit organizations but for -profits may not receive financial assistance. Examples of SAPT activities are: a. Alcohol Treatment and Rehabilitation - Direct services to patients experiencing primary problems for alcohol, such as outreach, detoxification, outpatient counseling, residential rehabilitation, hospital based care (not inpatient hospital services), abuse monitoring, vocational counseling, case management, central intake, and program administration. b. Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation - Direct services to patients experiencing primary problems with illicit and licit drugs, such as outreach, detoxification, methadone maintenance and detoxification, outpatient counseling, residential rehabilitation, including therapeutic communities, hospital based care (not inpatient hospital services), vocational counseling, case management central intake, and program admin istration. c. Primary Prevention Activities - Education, counseling, and other activities designed to reduce the risk of substance abuse. June 2012 SAPT HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.959 -2 The SAPT funds are allocated to the States according to a formula legislated by Congress. States may then distribute these funds to cities, counties, or service providers within their jurisdictions based on need. Of the SAPT funds dispensed to each State annually, Congress has specified that the State will expend not less than 20 percent for programs for individuals who do not require treatment for substance abuse. The programs should (1) educate and counsel the individuals on such abuse and (2) provide for activities to reduce the risk of such abuse by the individuals. SAPT Block Grant statutory \"set asides\" were esta blished to fund programs targeting special populations, such as services for women, especially pregnant and postpartum women and their children, and, in certain States, for screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). State Plan The State must submit to SAMHSA for approval, an annual application which includes a State plan for SA prevention and treatment services objectives described above and signed assurances required by the Act and implementing regulations. The entire application, including the pla n, must be reviewed by SAMHSA to ensure that all of the requirements of the law and regulations are met. The State plan addresses how the State intends to comply with the various requirements of Title XIX, Part B, Subparts II and III of the Public Health S ervice Act (42 USC 300x) and its program objectives and specific allocations by: (1) conducting State and local demand and need assessments; (2) establishing statewide prevention and treatment improvement plans with specific multi -year goals for narrowing identified service gaps, implementing training efforts, and fostering coordination among SA treatment, primary health care, and human service agencies; and (3) addressing human resource requirements, clinical standards and identified treatment improvement goals, and ensuring coordination of all health and human services for addicted individuals. The State shall make the plan public within the State in such a manner as to facilitate comment from any person (including any Federal or other public agency) duri ng development of the plan (including any revisions) and after submission of the plan to SAMHSA. Source of Governing Requirements This program is authorized under Title XIX, Part B, Subparts II and III of the Public Health Service Act (42 USC 300x). Imple menting regulations are published at 45 CFR part 96. Those regulations include general administrative requirements for the covered block grant programs in lieu of 45 CFR part 92 (the HHS implementation of the A -102 Common Rule)). Requirements specific to SAPT are in 45 CFR sections 96.120 through 96.137. In addition, grantees are to administer their SAPT programs according to the plan that they submitted to SAMHSA. As discussed in Appendix I of this Supplement, Federal Programs Excluded from the A -102 Common Rule, States are to use the fiscal policies that apply to their own funds in administering SAPT. Procedures must be adequate to assure the proper disbursal of and accounting for Federal funds paid to the grantee, including procedures for monitoring t he assistance provided (45 CFR section 96.30). June 2012 SAPT HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.959 -3 Availability of Other Program Information SAMHSA published a notice in the Federal Register on July 6, 2001 (66 FR 35658) that details approval requirements for non -recurring expense exclusions from maintenanc e-of-effort calculations. A second SAMHSA Federal Register notice, published on November 23, 2001 (66 FR 58746 -58747) addresses retroactive application of the non -recurring expense exclusion. III. COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS In developing the audit procedur es to test compliance with the requirements for a Federal program, the auditor should first look to Part 2, Matrix of Compliance Requirements, to identify which of the 14 types of compliance requirements described in Part 3 are applicable and then look to Parts 3 and 4 for the details of the requirements.

June 2012 Maternal and Child Health Services HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.994 -1 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CFDA 93.994 MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH SERVICES BLOCK GRANT TO THE STATES I. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The objective of the program of grants to States under the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant program is to provide funds to the 50 S tates, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, the Marshall Islands, and the Northern Marianas (States) for improvement of the health of all mothers and children consistent with applicable health status goals and national health objectives established under the Social Security Act . Specifically, MCH Block Grants are intended to: (1) provide and assure mothers and children (especially those with low income or limited availabi lity of services) access to quality maternal and child health services; (2) reduce infant mortality and the incidence of preventable diseases and disabling conditions among children; (3) reduce the need for inpatient and long -term care services; (4) increa se the number of children appropriately immunized against disease and the number of low -income children receiving health assessments and follow -up diagnostic and treatment services; (5) promote the health of mothers and infants by providing prenatal, deliv ery, and postpartum care for low -income, at -risk pregnant women; (6) promote the health of children by providing preventive and primary care services for low -income children; (7) provide rehabilitation services for blind and disabled individuals under sixt een years of age receiving benefits under Title XVI of the Social Security Act (Supplemental Security Income) to the extent medical assistance for such services is not provided under Title XIX (Medicaid); and (8) provide and promote family -centered, commun ity-based, coordinated care for children with special health care needs and to facilitate the development of community -based systems of services for those children and their families. II. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Administration and Services The MCH Block Grant program was created by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1981. Under that legislation, a number of categorical grants programs were consolidated into the single MCH Block Grant program. These were maternal and child heal th services for children with special health care needs; supplemental security income for children with disabilities; lead -based paint poisoning prevention programs; genetic disease programs; sudden infant death syndrome programs; and adolescent pregnancy grants. Extensive amendments to the authorizing statute in 1989 increased State programmatic and fiscal accountability under the program. These include requirements for States to define health status measures and to develop measurable objectives for prog ram efforts as well as to report progress on key maternal and child health indicators. June 2012 Maternal and Child Health Services HHS A-133 Compliance Supplement 4-93.994 -2 The program is administered by the Division of State and Community Health, Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) , a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
