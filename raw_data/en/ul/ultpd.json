People of all ages can be infected. Older adults and people with pre-existing medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and heart disease may be more likely to become severely ill if infected. COVID-19 Resources Please visit our webpages for information on COVID-19 specific services and relief programs, including resources in your area. You can also find tips to help you and your family stay healthy, stay connected and create positive new habits during this time. COVID-19 Vaccine: What You Need to Know There are two COVID-19 vaccines that have been fully approved by the FDA! They are from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.* Getting a vaccine is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your loved ones from COVID-19. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are given in two shots. You will get your first shot, then go back for your second shot a few weeks later. Your provider will give you a reminder card to help you keep track of which vaccine you got and when to get your next dose. It is very important to get both doses. Some vaccines also have a third or fourth shot called \"boosters.\" You may need a booster two to five months after your second shot, depending on your age or medical conditions. Talk to your provider for more information. *Visit the [Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) to learn more about all available vaccines. Call your healthcare provider or your local pharmacy. You can also visit [vaccines.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/) to find a vaccine near you. Most providers will ask you to make an appointment to get your shots. Depending on the specific vaccine you get, a second shot 3-4 weeks after your first shot is needed. While you have to get the second dose of the same version of the vaccine, you do not need to go back to the same location for your second dose. For example, if you go to your local pharmacy for dose one and the doctor for dose two, that is fine. It is very important you get both doses in order for it to be fully effective and protect you from coronavirus, so make sure to remain socially distant and continue to wear a mask, especially in between doses. No, the COVID-19 vaccine will be at no cost to you. You do not need to get approval from your health plan. This is sometimes called \"prior authorization.\" For questions, call the phone number on the back of your member ID card. A \"booster\" is usually another shot of the vaccine that is given after you get your initial shots. You may need a booster two to five months after your second shot, depending on your age or medical conditions. Talk to your provider for more information. You can get your next dose or booster from any provider. Just show them your COVID-19 vaccine card. A COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card is a small and handy paper card that will be given to you when you receive your first COVID-19 vaccine. This will help you keep track of when you received your first dose and when you are supposed to get your second dose, if applicable. It's an easy way to help you keep track of your vaccines. If you lose your COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card call the administering facility/provider you received your first dose from to ask about your vaccine information and verify your second appointment/location. The provider should have scheduled a second appointment with you at the same facility when you received the first dose. However, you can receive your second dose from another provider/facility and you should present your COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card. It depends. Many jobs and government agencies have rules about getting a COVID-19 vaccine. You may also have to get a vaccine if you plan to travel outside of the United States. Most people are able to get the COVID-19 shot without any serious problems. That's why we strongly recommend the vaccine. It is the best way to protect yourself, your loved ones, and the community. Yes! The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been fully approved by the FDA. This means that they have been thoroughly tested for safety. The vaccines are also very good at preventing the virus. They can help you from getting very sick. Side effects from the vaccine are usually mild. Serious side effects are rare. Learn how federal partners are working together to [ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html). Yes! It is safe to get the COVID-19 vaccine if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to get pregnant. People who get COVID during pregnancy are more likely to get very sick. That's why getting a vaccine is the best thing you can do for yourself and your child. Most pregnant individuals can get the COVID-19 shot without any serious problems. Talk to your provider about what's best for you. For more information about COVID-19 vaccines and pregnancy, visit the [Vaccination Considerations for People who are Pregnant or Breastfeeding](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html) section of the CDC website. Yes! The FDA has approved the vaccine for children ages 6 months and older. Most children can get the COVID-19 shot without any serious problems. Talk to your child's provider about what might be best for them. Eligible for 1 booster: - Everyone ages 5 years and older can get 1 booster after completing their [COVID-19 vaccine primary series](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html). Eligible for 2 boosters: - Adults ages 50 years and older. - People ages 12 years and older who are [moderately or severely immunocompromised](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html#mod). - People who got 2 doses (1 primary dose and 1 booster) of Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine. Yes. Even if you already had COVID-19, you should still get the vaccine. You can get COVID more than once. The vaccine can help you from getting the virus again. It can also help you from getting very sick. Side effects are usually mild and go away in a few days. You may get a fever or feel run down. This is normal as your body gets ready to fight off COVID-19. The place where you got the shot may also be sore. No. COVID-19 vaccines cannot make you sick with COVID-19. You are considered \"up to date\" on your shots two weeks past your final dose. You should still wear a mask if you're not feeling well or if you have to be around others who are sick. You should also wear a mask when you're in crowded indoor spaces or if you're travelling. A \"KN-95\" mask offers some of the best protection. Some people should wear a mask all the time even after they get the COVID-19 vaccine. This depends on your age and medical conditions. Talk to your provider about what's best for you. It will be important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to us to help stop this pandemic. It will take time for your body to build immunity after the vaccine. Together, COVID-19 vaccination and following CDC's recommendations for [how to protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) will offer the best protection from getting and spreading COVID-19. A \"breakthrough case\" is when you get COVID-19 even after getting the vaccine. This happens to some people because of how the COVID-19 virus keeps changing. Experts continue to study how common these cases are. Even though breakthrough cases can happen, the COVID-19 vaccines should help you from getting very sick. In other words, your symptoms might be less severe. Fully vaccinated people are less likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID even if they have a breakthrough case. Signs and Symptoms of COVID-19 COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. That means it affects your lungs. The virus spreads mainly when people cough or sneeze. Anyone can become sick with COVID, which is why the virus has been a public health emergency around the world since 2019. People who get COVID-19 may have many different symptoms. These symptoms can be mild or severe. They usually include: - Fever or chills - Cough - Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing - Feeling tired - Muscle or body aches - Headache - New loss of taste or smell - Sore throat - Congestion or runny nose - Nausea or vomiting - Diarrhea Symptoms usually start 2-14 days after you were close to someone else with the virus. COVID-19 can also spread BEFORE a person starts showing symptoms. These symptoms can also be caused by influenza, also known as the flu. The flu is a respiratory illness. That means it affects your lungs. The flu is most active in the United States in the autumn and winter. That's why everyone ages 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine (shot) each year. Additionally, the common cold can have similar signs and symptoms (see chart below). If you start having COVID-19 symptoms, you should get tested. There are tests that you can do at home. These are called \"self-tests.\" However, these tests aren't always accurate. You can also get what's called a \"PCR test.\" These are usually done at a lab or doctor's office. To get a self-test, call your local pharmacy. You can also get free COVID tests to keep at home through the U.S. Mail. [Click here to learn more.](https://www.covid.gov/tests) To get a PCR test, call your provider or health department. If you think you're sick, you should also think about wearing a face mask and staying away from others. That helps slow the spread of COVID. You may also reference the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/) for how to protect yourself and what to do if you are sick.

Read our [COVID-19 Discharge Instructions (PDF)](https://www.superiorhealthplan.com/content/dam/centene/Superior/Medicaid/PDFs/SHP_20206295A-MCD-COVID-19-Dischg-Instruc-M-EN-508-04092020.pdf). Monoclonal Antibodies for Treatment of COVID-19 The drug therapies available to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are growing and evolving rapidly. They include both drugs approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and drugs made available under FDA emergency use authorization (EUA). When the FDA approves a drug, it means the agency has determined, based on substantial evidence, that the drug is effective for its intended use, and that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks when used according to the product's approved labeling. A EUA is one of several tools the FDA is using to help make certain medical products available quickly during the COVID-19 pandemic. In certain emergencies, the FDA can issue an EUA to provide access to medical products that may potentially be used when there are no adequate, approved, and available options. EUAs allow the FDA to help strengthen the U.S.'s public health protections needed during public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. These are antibodies are similar to the ones your body would naturally make in response to infection. However, monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19 are mass-produced in a laboratory and are designed to recognize the unique spike protein of the outer shell of this virus. This interferes with the virus' ability to attach and gain entry into human cells. They give the immune system a leg up until it can mount its own response. Monoclonal antibody therapy for COVID-19 helps prevent hospitalizations, reduce viral loads and lessen symptom severity. This therapy can be extremely effective, but it's not a replacement for vaccination. The products are available under EUA for early outpatient treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in patients at high risk of disease progression. Patients are considered high risk based on medical conditions or other factors. They include but are not limited to: 65 years old or older, obesity, pregnancy, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, immunosuppressive disease or treatment, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, sickle cell, and neurodevelopmental disorders like cerebral palsy. The combination product casirivimab/imdevimab is also available under EUA for prevention of COVID-19 in individuals who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 that have been exposed to another individual infected with COVID-19. Individuals are considered high risk if they are not fully vaccinated or if they are vaccinated but have compromised immune systems. Monoclonal antibodies authorized under the EUA are covered benefits under Texas Medicaid and include sotrovimab and casirivimab/imdevimab combination. Treatment with these drug therapies do not require any prior authorization or approval by Superior HealthPlan. Monoclonal antibody therapy is given as a one-time dose through intravenous (IV) infusion or injected subcutaneously (under the skin) when being used preventatively or when IV infusion is not possible and would lead to delay in treatment. Monoclonal antibody therapy may not be administered in patients that are hospitalized or are requiring oxygen therapy. They are administered outpatient only. Outpatient infusion units may be standalone facilities or located within a hospital or doctor's office. Specially trained nursing staff administer and monitor patients receiving infusions ordered by physicians. Note: these infusions are not available through local pharmacies. Casirivimab/imdevimab and sotrovimab are authorized for use in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older weighting at least 40 kg/88 lbs. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) strongly encourages clinicians, patients and their advocates to regularly consult the [COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapeutic-management/) published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). These guidelines are based on scientific evidence and expert opinion and are frequently updated. Facilities that offer outpatient treatment of COVID-19, including monoclonal antibody therapy, can be found here: [Texas COVID-19 Therapeutics Availability (arcgis.com)](https://tdem.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=993e2c2079f8487cafcec74e00e84991). Administration of drug therapies require a physician's order. You can contact these facilities or your primary care provider for more information. Ivermectin is not a monoclonal antibody and is not approved or authorized for emergency use by the FDA for treatment or prevention of COVID-19 in humans or animals. Ivermectin has not been shown safe or effective for this use. Taking large doses of ivermectin is dangerous. Never use medications intended for animals on yourself or other people. Animal ivermectin products are very different from those approved for humans. If you are diagnosed with COVID-19 or have close contact with a person that has COVID-19, talk to your doctor about authorized and approved treatment options available to you, which do not include the use of ivermectin. [https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19) If your health care provider writes you an ivermectin prescription, fill it through a legitimate source such as a pharmacy, and take it exactly as prescribed. [https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2021/han00449.asp](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2021/han00449.asp) Get vaccinated against COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination is approved by FDA and is the safest and most effective way to prevent getting sick and protect against severe disease and death from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, including the Delta variant. Protect yourself and others from getting sick with COVID-19. In addition to vaccination, wear masks in indoor public places, practice staying at least six feet from other people who don't live in your household, avoid crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, and wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer that has at least 60 percent alcohol.
