The information cited by the Service is for Plum Island in general. The site-specific information regarding vegetative cover at the Plum Island Site is located in Section 3.8.6.1.1 of the NBAF EIS. Additional information regarding biological resources is located in Section 3.8.6.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2202 MD0128 cont.| 1| 26.1 cont.| 1| 26.1 2| 13.1 Taylor, Willie Page 2 of 3 Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 13.1 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding avian collisions at the Plum Island Site. Security requirements at the proposed NBAF would require continuous outdoor nighttime lighting. Nighttime lighting has the potential to impact wildlife through astronomical and ecological light pollution. Unshielded lighting can shine upward and interfere with bird migration, disorienting birds and causing them to collide with structures. Most concerns involve lighting associated with high-rise buildings and tele-communication towers; however, even residential lighting can affect some birds. The USFWS advocates the use of shielded lighting to minimize adverse impacts on migratory birds. Shielded fixtures direct light downwards and can be used to keep light within the boundaries of the site. The NBAF would employ the minimum intensity of lighting that is necessary to provide adequate security. Mitigation measures, such as the use of shielded lighting, will be considered in the final design of the NBAF. Compared to high-rise buildings and tele-communication towers, the height of the facility would be low (maximum of 90 feet). Given the relatively low profile of the building and the use of mitigation measures, construction of the proposed NBAF would not be likely to cause a significant number of bird collisions. However, DHS would consult with the USFWS during the design phase to minimize the potential for collisions, and would consider the use of additional mitigation measures such as the installation of window film, if deemed necessary. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2203 MD0128 Taylor, Willie Page 3 of 3 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2204 NCD001 1|15.3 2|2.0 Taylor, MSPH, Hope Page 1 of 2 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 15.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern. DHS is aware of the presence of the health and correctional facilities, described in Section 3.10.7.1 of the NBAF EIS. DHS has held public meetings and conducted outreach efforts to ensure that the surrounding communities, including officials of the health and correctional facilities, are well aware of the proposed action. A site-specific emergency response plan will be developed and coordinated with the local emergency management plan regarding evacuations and other emergency response measures for all potential emergency events including accidents at the NBAF. An emergeny response plan would include stipulations for any special-needs populations including institutionalized populations. The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety were evaluated in Section 3.14. The risks were determined to be low for all site alternatives. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's statement and regrets any confusion regarding information requested by the commentor. Since the inception of the NBAF project, DHS has supported a vigorous public outreach program. DHS has conducted public meetings in excess of the minimum required by NEPA regulations; to date, 24 public meetings have been held in the vicinity of NBAF site alternatives and in Washington, D.C. to solicit public input on the EIS, allow the public to voice their concerns, and to get their questions answered DHS has also provided fact sheets, reports, exhibits, and a Web page (http://www.dhs.gov/nbaf). Additionally, various means of communication (mail, toll free telephone and fax lines, and NBAF Web site) have been provided to facilitate public comment. It is DHS policy to encourage public input on matters of national and international importance.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2205 Taylor, MSPH, Hope Page 2 of 2 Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 13.3 DHS acknowledges the commentor's concern regarding potential wildlife impacts at the Umstead Research Farm Site. The susceptibility of native wildlife to foreign animal diseases necessitates additional research to further evaluate the potential adverse effects of foreign animal diseases on North American wildlife. Knowledge of susceptible species would facilitate the preparation of response plans, and the development of vaccines for wildlife would be part of the NBAF mission. Introduction of a foreign animal disease into the U.S., whether unintentional or intentional (as an agent of bioterror, for example), might go undetected for a relatively long period of time. Once detected, the necessary time required for response mobilization would further delay containment of the outbreak. Delays in detection and response would increase the potential for a widespread outbreak among wildlife populations. In the event of a widespread outbreak, the availability of effective vaccines for wildlife could prevent devastating impacts on wildlife populations and could be the only means of preventing the extirpation of endangered or otherwise vulnerable native species. The development of response plans and vaccines that focus on susceptible species would enhance the capability to protect native wildlife against the foreign introduction of disease such as Foot and Mouth disease and Rift Valley fever. The potential response measures that could be employed in the event of an accidental release are described in Section 3.8.9 of the NBAF EIS. Table 3.8.9-1 describes the potential response strategies that could be considered in the event of an accidental release. Depopulation or population reduction is one of ten potential FMD response strategies developed by the National Park Service. However, the National Park Service recommends the use of other strategies or combinations of strategies to avoid depopulating wildlife (see Table 3.8.9-1). A more likely scenario would include one or more of the non-lethal measures described in Table 3.8.9- 1. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 12.3 DHS notes the commentor's watershed concerns. The NBAF EIS Section 3.13.8, Waste Management describes the process that would be used to control and dispose of liquid wastes and Sections 3.3.7 and 3.7.7 describes standard methods used to prevent and mitigate potential spill and runoff affects. A site-specific emergency response plan would be developed and coordinated with the local emergency management plan regarding evacuations and other emergency response measures for all potential emergency events including accidents at the NBAF. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 21.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern. As described in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS's site selection criteria included, but were not limited to, such factors as proximity to research capabilities and workforce. As such, some but not all of the sites selected for analysis as reasonable alternatives in the NBAF EIS are located in suburban or semi-urban areas. Nevertheless, it has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. An example is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, where such facilities employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design,Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2206 construction, and operation of the NBAF. Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 5.0 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the five mainland site alternatives.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2207 Taylor, MSPH, Hope Page 1 of 13 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 1.0 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the NBAF. As described in Chapter 1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS's mission is to study foreign animal, zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) and emerging diseases that threaten our agricultural livestock and agricultural economy. The NBAF would enable research on the transmission of these animal diseases and support development of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and antiviral therapies for foreign animal, zoonotic and emerging diseases. By proposing to construct the NBAF, DHS is following policy direction established by the Congress and the President. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's opinion. The NBAF's mission is defensive and would not involve offensive bioweapons research or development. The international treaty, known as the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, to which the United States is a signatory, prohibits the development, production, stockpiling and acquisition of such weapons. DHS's mission is to study foreign animal and zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) diseases that threaten our agricultural livestock and agricultural economy. The purpose of the NBAF would be to develop tests to detect foreign animal and zoonotic diseases and develop vaccines (or other countermeasures such as antiviral therapies) to protect agriculture and food systems in the United States. As stated in section 2.2.2 of the NBAF EIS, the NBAF may be operated as a Government Owned/Government Operated Facility or as a Government Owned/Contractor Operated Facility. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 18.3 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding safety related to the transportation, storage, study, treatment, and disposal of infectous wastes. The risks associated with releases of infectious wastes addressed in Sections 3.8.9, 3.10.9, 3.14, and Appendices B, D, and E of the NBAF EIS. These sections provide a detailed analysis of the consequences from a accidental or deliberate pathogen release. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF then site-specific protocols and emergency response plans would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies that would consider the diversity and density of human, livestock, and wildlife populations residing within the area. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. It has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. Table 3.13.2.2-2 in the NBAF EIS lists the waste streams, origins, and pretreatment methods applicable to the liquid waste streams generated by the operation of the NBAF and ultimately destined for the sanitary sewer. Similarly, Table 3.13.2.2-3 lists the waste streams, origins, and pretreatment methods applicable to the waste solids that will be generated by the operation of the NBAF and ultimately destined for offsite disposal. These tables include all of the liquid and solid residuals from all of the different types of carcass disposal methodologies being considered. AsChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2208 shown on these tables, all of the potentially infectious wastes generated by the facility will be sterilized and, or decontaminated onsite in accordance with requirements found in Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL). The BMBL also requires physical and biological validation that decontamination processes are performing as required. Unless there is an accident or incident, the sanitary sewage released to the South Granville Water And Sewer Authority (SGWASA) would meet SGWASA acceptance criteria and pretreatment requirements. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 5.1 DHS notes the commentor's statement. Procedures and plans to operate the NBAF will include the Institutional Biosafety Committee, which will include community representatives as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS. Should a decision be made to build NBAF and the site selected, DHS would begin transition and operational planning which would include consideration of policies and procedures for public participation, education, and also public advisory initiatives. After DHS determines the viability and nature of such a public advisory and oversight function, appropriate roles and responsibilities would be defined.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2209 Taylor, MSPH, Hope Page 2 of 13 Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 21.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern that the NBAF would be a prime terrorist target. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS address accident scenarios, including external events such as a terrorist attack. A separate Threat and Risk Assessment (TRA) (designated as For Official Use Only) was developed outside of the EIS process in accordance with the requirements stipulated in federal regulations. The purpose of the TRA was to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses associated with the NBAF and are used to recommend the most prudent measures to establish a reasonable level of risk for the security of operations of the NBAF and public safety. Because of the importance of the NBAF mission and the associated work with potential high-consequence biological pathogens, critical information related to the potential for adverse consequences as a result of intentional acts has been incorporated into the NEPA process. Section 3.10 addresses capabilities and services of fire protection, law enforcement, and medical facilities each of which has emergency and accident response capabilities. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF, then site specific protocols and emergency response plans would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies, that would consider the local response capabilities, diversity and density of human, livestock, and wildlife populations residing within the area. Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 4.3 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding the site selection process, which is described in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS. DHS held a competitive process to select potential sites for the proposed NBAF as described in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS. A team of federal employees representing multi-department component offices and multi-governmental agencies (i.e., DHS, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and Department of Health and Human Services) reviewed the submissions based primarily on environmental suitability and proximity to research capabilities, proximity to workforce, acquisition/construction/operations, and community acceptance. Since the inception of the NBAF project, DHS has supported a vigorous public outreach program. DHS has conducted public meetings in excess of the minimum required by NEPA regulations; to date, 24 public meetings have been held in the vicinity of NBAF site alternatives and in Washington, D.C. to solicit public input on the EIS, allow the public to voice their concerns, and to get their questions answered DHS has also provided fact sheets, reports, exhibits, and a Web page (http://www.dhs.gov/nbaf). Additionally, various means of communication (mail, telephone and fax lines, and NBAF Web site) have been provided to facilitate public comment. It is DHS policy to encourage public input on matters of national and international importance. DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the five mainland site alternatives and reference to the U.S. Government Accountability Office report (May 2008) as justification. DHS believes that experience shows that facilities utilizing modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF, would enable it to be safely operated on the mainland. The conclusions expressed in Section 3.14 of the NBAF EIS show thatChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2210 even though Plum Island has a lower potential impact in case of a release, the probability of a release is low at all sites. The lower potential effect is due both to the water barrier around the island and the lack of livestock and susceptible wildlife species.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2211 Taylor, MSPH, Hope Page 3 of 13 Comment No: 7 Issue Code: 23.0 DHS notes the commentor's statement. As discussed in Section 2.2.1.1 of the NBAF EIS, modern biosafety design substantially diminishes the chances of a release as the primary design goal is to provide an adequate level of redundant safety and biocontainment that would be integrated into every component of the building. A discussion of human health and safety is included in Section 3.14. As described in Section 2.2.2 of the NBAF EIS, the proposed NBAF would be either a government owned-government operated (GOGO) or government owned-contractor operated (GOCO) facility. The GOCO model has been replicated many times over the past 50 years, primarily by the Department of Energy and its predecessor agencies. If it is decided that the NBAF would be GOCO, a PMP would be prepared for the facility. As also stated in Section 2.2.2, inspection of the NBAF by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and APHIS would occur a minimum of once over a three-year period. However, standard operating procedures would require more frequent monitoring. The potential impacts of an accidental release on wildlife are addressed in Section 3.8.9. Although the EIS acknowledges the potential for significant wildlife impacts in the event of an accidental release, the risk of such a release is extremely low (see Section 3.14). The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. An analysis of potential consequences of a pathogen (e.g., Rift Valley fever virus) becoming established in native mosquito populations, particularly in warm, humid climates, was evaluated in Sections 3.8.9, 3.10.9, and 3.14. The potential response measures that could be employed in the event of an accidental release are described in Section 3.8.9 of the NBAF EIS. Table 3.8.9-1 describes the potential response strategies that could be considered in the event of an accidental release. Depopulation or population reduction is one of ten potential FMD response strategies developed by the National Park Service. However, the National Park Service recommends the use of other strategies or combinations of strategies to avoid depopulating wildlife (see Table 3.8.9-1). A more likely scenario would include one or more of the non-lethal measures described in Table 3.8.9-1. In the event that depopulation or population reduction was determined to be the most appropriate course of action, hunting with firearms would be the likely method for implementing this strategy. The response to an accidental release of a mosquito- borne pathogen such as Rift Valley fever could include the aerial application of insecticides. The use of insecticides could lead to direct adverse impacts on insect fauna, as well as indirect impacts on other wildlife species through disruption of the food chain. Although the NBAF EIS acknowledges the potential for significant impacts on white-tailed deer in the event of an accidental release, the risk of such a release is extremely low (see Section 3.14). It has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas and in areas with abundant wildlife. State-of- the-art biocontainment facilities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF. Furthermore, the purpose of NBAF is to combat diseases that could haveChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2212 significant effects on wildlife. Research at the NBAF would include the development of vaccines for wildlife that could prevent adverse impacts from a foreign introduction. As discussed in Section 2.2.2 of the NBAF EIS, standard operating procedures would be established based on the data compiled from the construction documents, commissioning process, regulatory agencies, and their own experience with simulated system failure scenarios. These scenarios would occur during the commissioning process to help prepare the maintenance and research staff to respond in a timely and effective manner should the failure occur during normal operation of the facility. One example of biocontainment laboratory operation and maintenance procedures that would be required is daily inspections of essential containment and life support systems that must be completed and documented before laboratory work is initiated to ensure that the laboratory is operating according to established parameters. Practical and effective protocols for emergency situations would be established. These protocols would include plans for medical emergencies, facility malfunctions, fires, animals escaping within the laboratory, and other potential emergencies. Training in emergency response procedures would be provided to emergency response personnel and other responsible staff according to institutional policies. Many of the training and testing requirements are to maintain certification and licensure to operate a laboratory, which generally take up to a year beyond the construction phase to complete. The BMBL is the primary guidance source to ensure a safe and effective testing and training program for successful state-of-the-art biocontainment laboratory facilities. Comment No: 8 Issue Code: 15.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern. The economic impact of an accidental release is presented in Section 3.10.9 and Appendix D of the NBAF EIS. While the risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, DHS acknowledges that the possible economic effect would be significant for all sites. The primary economic effect of an accidental release would be the banning of U.S. livestock products regardless of the location of the accidental release, which could reach as high as $4.2 billion until the U.S. was declared foreign animal disease-free. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2213 Taylor, MSPH, Hope Page 4 of 13 Comment No: 9 Issue Code: 17.3 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding the handling and transport of packages containing identified and unidentified pathogens. The general regulations governing the required NBAF handling and transport of packages containing pathogens, and a discussion of the low risk associated with the shipment of infectious materials is provided in Section 3.11.9 of the NBAF EIS. Section 2.2.2.3 of the NBAF EIS provides detailed information on the handling and transport of packages containing pathogens. Additionally, an analysis of accidental releases during transportation is provided in Section 3.14, Health and Safety and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS. Information regarding the existing road conditions and potential effects to traffic and transportation from the Umstead Research Farm Site Alternative is provided in Section 3.11.7 of the NBAF EIS. Comment No: 10 Issue Code: 12.3 DHS notes the commentor's concerns and DHS acknowledges the current regional drought conditions. Described in Section 3.7.7.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, the South Granville Water and Sewer Authority has 3 to 4 million gallons per day of excess potable water capacity and could meet NBAF's need of approximately 110,000 gallons per day, currently less than 0.4% of the Authority's total current capacity. The NBAF annual potable water usage is expected to be approximately equivalent to the amount consumed by 210 residential homes. Section 3.13.8 describes the waste management processes that would be used to control and dispose of NBAF's liquid and solid waste. Sections 3.3.7 and 3.7.7 describe standard methods used to prevent and mitigate potential spills and runoff affects. Section 3.10.7.1.3 describes local response capabilities and Section 3.14.4.5 describes an accidental release's site specific consequences.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2214 Taylor, MSPH, Hope Page 5 of 13 Comment No: 11 Issue Code: 9.3 DHS notes the commentor's air quality concerns. The potential effects of NBAF operations on air quality are discussed in Section 3.4 of the NBAF EIS and includes the potential effects from incineration. Section 3.4.1 describes the methodology used in assessing potential air quality consequences at each site. Carcass/pathological waste disposal, including incineration, is discussed in Chapter 3 Section 3.13. Conservative assumptions were used to ensure the probable maximum effects were evaluated. Once the final design is determined, a more refined air emissions model will be used during the permitting process. The final design will ensure that the NBAF %does not significantly affect% the region's ability to meet air quality standards. Chapter 3 Section 3.14.4.5 describes site specific consequences from accidental events. Comment No: 12 Issue Code: 20.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern. A site-specific emergency response plan will be developed and coordinated with the local Emergency Management Plan regarding evacuations and other emergency response measures for all potential emergency events including accidents at the NBAF. The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety are evaluated in Section 3.14 of the NBAF EIS. The risks were determined to be low for all site alternatives, and the probability of a release requiring a quarantine or evacuation is very low. DHS would offer coordination and training to local medical personnel regarding the effects of pathogens to be studied at the NBAF. Emergency management plans will also include training for local law enforcement, health care, and fire and rescue personnel. The impacts analysis specifically included consideration of environmental justice concerns to include an assessment of the potential for disproportionately high and adverse effects to minority or low-income populations, as further described in Section 3.1 of the NBAF EIS. No disproportionately high and adverse effects to environmental or human resources are evident for the proposed Umstead Research Farm Site from normal facility operations.

I'm calling from Manhattan, Kansas and I wish to express my opinion on the NBAF installation that was thought about being moved here. I am against it and the reason for being against it is not that I don't think the facility itself could not be made safe, but I am afraid that the people working in the facility are a big variable and cannot really be guaranteed that these people can be always up-and-up and not maybe come up with somebody who is a little bit off or has a grudge or whatever. A good instance is the case of the scientist who was involved with the anthrax problem there. Nobody thought for years that this man had anything to do with the....sell....with the giving out anthrax and as a result people died. And this is a very respectable scientist, I assume. This is why I'm saying it's the scientists; it's the people that we cannot be sure about. And in this area where we have a lot of people in the cattle industry, I'm afraid you're right in the heart of where the danger could be very, very influential in causing a drastic situation. Really that's all I had to say. Again, I'm against the installation being put here in Manhattan, and as a matter of fact, possibly someplace on the coastal areas would be best because we at least are not centered in the middle....in the heartland. Thank you. 1|25.4 2|21.4 1 cont.|25.4 3|5.0 Terhune, Don Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.4 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the Manhattan Campus Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.4 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding a malicious and criminal act perpetrated by an NBAF employee. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS address accident scenarios, including internal and external events such as an \"insider\" criminal act and terrorist attack. A separate Threat and Risk Assessment (TRA) (designated as For Official Use Only) was developed outside of the EIS process in accordance with the requirements stipulated in federal regulations. The purpose of the TRA was to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses associated with the NBAF and are used to recommend the most prudent measures to establish a reasonable level of risk for the security of operations of the NBAF and public safety. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 5.0 DHS notes the commentor's position and concern for locating NBAF in a coastal location away from the heartland. DHS believes that experience shows that facilities utilizing modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF, would enable NBAF to be safely operated on the mainland.

We have been observing the debate about the Bio-Defense Facility proposed for Butner, NC. Our board has had several discussions concerning the placement of this facility in Butner. The board is composed of Vance County Commissioner representatives, City Council representatives, and a variety of \"regular\" folks that represent a cross-section of residents in our county. We previously endorsed locating the facility in Butner, NC, but some of us are disturbed to see members of the Granville County Commission withholding their endorsement of the project. We don't understand their hesitation, but our local county commissioners don't want to \"override\" another county's representatives. Therefore, we would like to change our position to one of neutrality. If our brethren in Granville have a change of heart or become more openly supportive of the facility, we would have no problem changing to support at that time. Having stated the board's position, I feel like the consummate politician. Respectfully submitted, W. Dennis Tharrington Partnership Chairman 1| 27.0WDL02 2 Tharrington, W.

Thank you for considering Flora and we want you to be here. Bye, bye. 1| 24.5 Thomas, Marie Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.5 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Flora Industrial Park Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2231 Thomas, Patricia Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.2 DHS notes the commentor's support for the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 15.2 DHS notes the commentor's support for the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. The number of short-term and permanent jobs are discussed in Section 3.10. It is expected that approximately 2,700 direct temporary jobs would result from construction of the NBAF, with many of the jobs being filled locally. Approximately 483 permanent jobs, including the initial 326 direct jobs, would result from operation of the NBAF, with much of the scientific work force relocating to the region. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2232 PD0142 August 21, 2008 Hello, my name is Stony Thomas and I am a resident of Madison County and I'm calling on behalf of Mississippi as the choice for the NBAF facility. I think that we have a great location. I think we have great resources and I think that, you know it's...it'd be a great opportunity for Mississippi to support protecting our country against bioterrorism. The people of Mississippi fully support this. I personally support it. A lot of the people that I know support it. So please keep us in consideration. I think that we are the best choice and should be your first choice. Thank you for this opportunity, for allowing me to give my opinion. Bye.1| 24.5 Thomas, Stony Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.5 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Flora Industrial Park Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2233 MSD001 1|24.0 2|24.5 Thompson, Bennie Page 1 Issue Code: 24.0 DHS notes the Congressman's support for the NBAF project and the Flora Industrial Park Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 24.5 DHS notes the Congressman's support for the Flora Industrial Park Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2234 MD0070 1| 3.0 21.0 Thompson, Cathy Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's concerns about long-term funding for the NBAF to ensure safe operations. The U.S. Congress and the President are responsible for determining funding priorities for government programs. DHS spends funds in accordance with congressional intent. DHS would maintain the NBAF and ancillary facilities in compliance with applicable environmental, safety, and health requirements and provide for safe operation and maintenance. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 23.0 DHS notes the commenter's concern for security of the NBAF. Regardless of location, the NBAF would have the levels of protection and control required by applicable DHS security directives. A Threat and Risk Assessment (designated as For Official Use Only) was prepared that evaluated site- specific security issues and will be considered in the decision making process on whether or not the NBAF is built, and, if so, where. Security would be provided by a series of fencing, security cameras, and protocols. In addition, a dedicated security force would be present on-site. Additional security could be provided via cooperation with local law enforcement agencies. DHS notes the commentor's concern that all possible pathogens to be studied at the NBAF are not listed in the NBAF EIS. The pathogens to be studied at the NBAF as provided in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS include Foot and Mouth Disease virus, Classical Swine Fever virus, Vesicular Stomatitis virus, Rift Valley Fever virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and African Swine Fever virus. Should the NBAF be directed to study any pathogens not included in the list of pathogens included in the NBAF EIS, DHS and USDA would conduct an evaluate of the new pathogen(s) to determine if the potential challenges and consequences were bounded by the current study. If not, a new risk assessment would be prepared and a separate NEPA evaluation may be required. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 12.3 DHS notes the commentor's watershed concern. The NBAF EIS Section 3.13.8 describes the Waste Management processes that would be used to control and dispose of NBAF's liquid and solid waste. Sections 3.3.7 and 3.7.7 describe standard methods used to prevent and mitigate potential spills and runoff affects. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 9.3 The potential effects of NBAF operations on air quality are discussed in Section 3.4 of the NBAF EIS and includes the potential effects from energy generation, traffic, and incineration. Site-specific effects at the Umstead Research Farm Site are discussed in Section 3.4.7. Carcass/pathological waste disposal, including incineration, is discussed in Section 3.13. Air emissions were estimated using SCREEN3, a U.S. EPA dispersion modeling program. Conservative assumptions were used to ensure the probable maximum effects were evaluated. Once the final design is determined, a more refined air emissions model will be used during the permitting process. The final design will ensure that the NBAF does not significantly affect the region's ability to meet air quality standards.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2235 Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 15.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern. A site-specific emergency response plan will be developed and coordinated with the local emergency management plan regarding evacuations and other emergency response measures for all potential emergency events including accidents at the NBAF. DHS would offer coordination and training to local medical personnel regarding the effects of pathogens to be studied at the NBAF. Emergency management plans will also include training for local law enforcement, health care, and fire and rescue personnel. Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 3.0 DHS notes the commentor's question regarding whether oversight of NBAF operations would include representatives from local municipalities. Procedures and plans to operate the NBAF will include the Institutional Biosafety Committee, which will include community representatives as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS. Should a decision be made to build NBAF and the site selected, DHS would begin transition and operational planning which would include consideration of policies and procedures for public participation, education, and also public advisory initiatives. After DHS determines the viability and nature of such a public advisory and oversight function, appropriate roles and responsibilities would be defined. DHS notes the commentor's question regarding public access to monitoring data. Consideration of provisions for public access to environmental monitoring data is not within the scope of the NBAF EIS. As stated throughout the NBAF EIS, waste treatment and other processes of concern have not been finalized and, as such, conservative assumptions were used to ensure the probable maximum effects were evaluated for each affected resource area. Any further detailed discussion of wastewater and air pollution control and associated monitoring technologies would be highly speculative and will not be known until the NBAF design is finalized. Ultimately, monitoring requirements will be at least partially dependent on the environmental permitting and associated reporting requirements imposed by federal, state, and local agencies. Of course, all environmental monitoring data would be subject to public review in accordance with the public record access provisions administered by the appropriate regulatory agencies. Comment No: 7 Issue Code: 21.0 See Comment No. 6. Procedures to notify the public regarding incidents at the NBAF will include input from the Institutional Biosafety Committee, which will include community representatives as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2236 MD0067 1| 12.3 2| 15.3 3| 21.0 4| 2.0 Thompson, Curtis Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 12.3 DHS notes the commentor's watershed concern. The NBAF EIS Section 3.13.8 describes the Waste Management processes that would be used to control and dispose of NBAF's liquid and solid waste. Sections 3.3.7 and 3.7.7 describe standard methods used to prevent and mitigate potential spills and runoff affects. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 15.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern. Any evacuation would be a very low probability event. A site- specific emergency response plan will be developed and coordinated with the local Emergency Management Plan regarding evacuations and other emergency response measures for all potential emergency events including accidents at the NBAF. The emergency response plan would be developed and would include stipulations for any special-needs populations including institutionalized populations. DHS would offer coordination and training to local medical personnel regarding the effects of pathogens to be studied at the NBAF. Emergency management plans will also include training for local law enforcement, health care, and fire and rescue personnel. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 21.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern about apportionment of financial liability in the event of a pathogen release. However, it is not possible to determine in advance who might be responsible for an incident. DHS will follow applicable local, state, and federal law, whether in asserting or defending against a claim for damages should a pathogen be released from the NBAF. Chapter 3, Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS investigate the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, DHS cannot guarantee that the NBAF would never experience an accident; however, the risk of an accidental release of a pathogen from the NBAF is extremely low. The economic impact of an accidental release, including the impact on the livestock-related industries, is presented in Chapter 3, Section 3.10.9 and Appendix D of the NBAF EIS. The major economic effect from an accidental release of a pathogen would be a potential ban on all U.S. livestock products until the country was determined to be disease-free.

Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS investigate the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur and consequences of thoseaccidents Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 17.3 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding the handling and transport of packages containing pathogens. The general regulations governing the required NBAF handling and transport of packages containing pathogens, and a discussion of the low risk associated with the shipment of infectious materials is provided in Section 3.11.9 of the NBAF EIS. Section 2.2.2.3 of the NBAF EIS provides detailed information on the handling and transport of packages containing pathogens. Additionally, an analysis of accidental releases during transportation is provided in Section 3.14, Health and Safety and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS. Information regarding the existing road conditions and potential effects to traffic and transportation from the Umstead Research Farm Site Alternative is provided in Section 3.11.7 of the NBAF EIS. Comment No: 3 DHS notes the commentor's concern that NBAF operations could result in an accident. Section 3.14 investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. Once the ROD has been signed and prior to the initiation of NBAF operations, a site-specific emergency management plan will be developed that will be coordinated with the local emergency management plan and will include contingency plans for potentially affected residents and institutions. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 25.3 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the Umstead Research Farm Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2241 FD0071 Thornsberry, D.V.M., R.

Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 5.0 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the five mainland site alternatives. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 21.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the safe operation of the NBAF. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS investigate the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur and consequences of thoseaccidents Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 15.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but DHS acknowledges that the economic effect would be significant for all sites. Appendix D of the EIS cites numerous studies and simulations by USDA and others that estimate the potential economic losses from an outbreak of FMD in the United states. All scenarios evaluated assume, for example, that an outbreak of FMD would result in a temporary export ban of US meat products. The results of these studies are summarized in Appendix D.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental 2008 2-2243 D.V.M., R. Page 3 of 3 Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 21.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the NBAF. The purpose and need for the proposed action is discussed in Chapter 1 of the NBAF EIS. DHS can not guarantee that the NBAF would never experience an accident. However, as discussed in Section 2.2.1.1, modern biosafety design substantially diminishes the chances of a release as the primary design goal is to provide an adequate level of redundant safety and biocontainment that would be integrated into every component of the building. A discussion of human health and safety is included in Section 3.14. Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 21.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding potential natural disaster impacts to the NBAF. Sections 3.4, 3.6, and 3.14.3.2 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS address NBAF design criteria and accident scenarios associated with natural phenomena events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes. The NBAF would be designed to withstand the normal meteorological conditions that are present within the geographic area of the selected site. DHS notes the commenter's concern regarding potential tornado impacts to the NBAF. The NBAF would be designed and built to withstand the normal meteorological conditions that are present within the geographic area of the selected site (hurricanes, tornados, etc.). Given the nature of the facility, more stringent building codes are applied to the NBAF than are used for homes and most businesses, regardless of which NBAF site is chosen. The building would be built to withstand wind pressures up to 170% of the winds which are expected to occur locally within a period of 50 years. This means the building's structural system could resist a wind speed that is expected to occur, on the average, only once in a 500 year period. In the unlikely event that a 500-year wind storm strikes the facility, the interior BSL-3Ag and BSL-4 spaces would be expected to withstand a 200 mph wind load (commonly determined to be an F3 tornado). If the NBAF took a direct hit from an F3 tornado, the exterior walls and roofing of the building would likely fail first. This breach in the exterior skin would cause a dramatic increase in internal pressures leading to further failure of the building's interior and exterior walls. However, the loss of these architectural wall components should actually decrease the overall wind loading applied to the building, and diminish the possibility of damage to the building's primary structural system. Since the walls of the BSL-3Ag and BSL-4 spaces would be reinforced cast-in-place concrete, those inner walls would be expected to withstand the tornado.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact "}
