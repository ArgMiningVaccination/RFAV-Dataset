The trial enrolled 131 healthy volunteers in Australia, gave them either a placebo or one of four escalating doses of its vaccine, and found that everyone who received the vaccine produced a high level of antibodies against covid-19. Novavax signed a deal last month to receive $1.6 billion in funding as part of the US federal government's \"Operation Warp Speed\" program to develop a covid-19 vaccine. Any side effects? About 80% volunteers experienced pain and tenderness at the injection site, while more than 60% had other side effects like fatigue and headaches. Most reactions were mild, but eight patients had severe side effects. Novavax says no one was hospitalized as a result, and all of the reactions disappeared after a few days. Some provisos: As with any Phase I trial, the aim was to establish the safety rather than the efficacy of the vaccine. The data has been published on a preprint server, which means it hasn't been peer-reviewed yet. Much like vaccine study results recently published by the Oxford/AstraZeneca team, and the Moderna trial, it's too early to draw firm conclusions about whether the vaccine will protect against coronavirus long-term. That's why [Moderna](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/27/1005657/moderna-enrolling-30000-volunteers-biggest-covid-19-vaccine-phase-3-trial/) and AstraZeneca are now enrolling tens of thousands of volunteers for the next stage of trials, when we'll get a clearer picture of just how likely these vaccines are to work. The bigger picture: AstraZeneca's biopharma lead, Mene Pangalos, [has warned](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p08m8kv6) that, rather than conferring permanent protection, a covid-19 vaccine may only have an effect for a year or two. There are more than 150 vaccines being developed around the world, with at least 25 already in human trials. Given the virus has infected [18.5 million people globally](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) and killed over 700,000, the pressure is on to find a viable solution\u2014although [scientists warn](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine.html) that clinical safety cannot be compromised in the face of [political and nationalistic pressure](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/world/europe/russia-trials-vaccine-October.html).
