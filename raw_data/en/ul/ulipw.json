[Ayurveda: ayur (life) veda (knowledge)](https://www.ayurvedanama.org/history-of-ayurveda) Ayurveda translates from Sanskrit to the 'science of life'. It is the ancient healing system of India that incorporates the important balance of mind and body. In Ayurveda, dis-ease comes from a state of mental or physical imbalance due to the accumulation of ama (toxins). Ayurveda aims to alleviate the cause of that imbalance through purifying body therapies, lifestyle shifts and nutritional changes. We all have individual characteristics and qualities that are unique to ourselves. Ayurveda states that these qualities correspond to nature and that we carry each element of nature in our physical body. [Earth, Wind, Water, Fire and Ether.](https://kripalu.org/resources/ayurvedic-doshas) Those who practice Ayurveda believe every person is made of five basic elements found in the universe. These five elements work together in harmony to bring us ideal health, vitality and balance of body with the external environment. These combine in the human body to form three life forces or energies, called doshas. They are Vata dosha (space and water); and Kapha dosha (water and earth). Everyone inherits a unique mix of the three doshas. But one is usually stronger than the others. Each one controls a different body function. It's believed that your chances of getting sick, and the health issues you develop, are all linked to the balance of your doshas. [Vata Dosha:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4719489/) Those who practice Ayurveda believe this is the most powerful of all three doshas. It controls very basic body functions, like how cells divide. It also controls your mind, breathing, blood flow, heart function, and ability to get rid of waste through your intestines. Things that can disrupt it include eating again too soon after a meal, fear, grief, and staying up too late. If vata dosha is your main life force, you're thought to be more likely to develop conditions like anxiety, asthma, heart disease, skin problems, and rheumatoid arthritis.Small steps create big change. Receiving these treatments will bring awareness into your body and mind, enlivening compassion and love into interactions with all beings. But above all, bringing compassion and love to yourself. [Pitta Dosha:](https://www.artofliving.org/in-en/ayurveda/ayurvedic-treatments/pitta-imbalance-manage) This energy controls your digestion, metabolism, and certain hormones that are linked to your appetite. Things that can disrupt it are eating sour or spicy foods and spending too much time in the sun. If it's your main life force, you're thought to be more likely to develop conditions like Crohn's disease, heart disease, high blood pressure, and infections. [Kapha Dosha:](https://www.artofliving.org/in-en/ayurveda/ayurvedic-treatments/kapha-imbalance-manage) This life force controls muscle growth, body strength and stability, weight, and your immune system. You can disrupt it by sleeping during the day, eating too many sweet foods, and eating or drinking things that contain too much salt or water. If it's your main life energy, practitioners believe you may develop asthma and other breathing disorders, cancer, diabetes, nausea after eating, and obesity.
