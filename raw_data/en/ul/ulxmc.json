I generally have avoided cleanses, but I am now in FAR better shape after her help and following the cleanse-which she calls a \"reset.\" I like that term better. Without her help, I honestly believe that I would be seriously ill, and perhaps admitted into the hospital, damaging my health even further. I'm SO grateful for Eileen. I cannot put into words how helpful she has been to me. I'm extending my learning and changes with her for another 14 days. The reset is really a normal way to eat\u2014doesn't feel like I'm starving or forfeiting a lot actually.\" -BR -BR Contact a Certified Health Coach in Mequon, WI If you or someone you love could benefit from losing weight, gaining energy, and making more mindful decisions around life challenges, than give me a call to start your journey today!
