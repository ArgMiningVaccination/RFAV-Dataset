I began my studies in Traditional East Asian Medicine in 2001 at NatureCare College in Sydney, NSW. After the birth of my first child, I returned to study at the Australian Shiatsu College in Brunswick, Victoria during 2003-4. At this time I also apprenticed with a Chinese Medicine practitioner in Melbourne for a number of years. After the home birth of my second child, our family moved to England for a period of time. Here I gained my formal acupuncture qualifications with a BSc from the London School of Traditional Acupuncture in 2008. Upon returning to Naarm, Melbourne, I established my own treatment space, which I have been running since 2009. I believe in the profound and unique capacity of acupuncture to create a real, lasting change in the way we as humans can experience the radical nature of being alive. Traditional East Asian Medicine contains a wisdom and insight that is based on thousands of years of practice and the patience of many sages. In this way, it has a unique capacity to understand why we experience ourselves as separate entities, and how best to bring us back into alignment with the non-duality at the heart of existence. The space I create is a safe, sacred place that encourages us, both you and me, to step into the field of energy between us and allow what emerges to be seen, heard and witnessed. It is a deep, fluid container for alchemy and transformation to occur; a place that welcomes magic and mystery. I hold the space for attentive listening and deep intuitive, healing to happen. The intention of these sessions is to deal with any concerns you have about your mind:body:soul. The sessions may involve intuitive acupuncture, ritual and ceremony, journeying and soulful support. WHY INTUITIVE ACUPUNCTURE? I have completed at least 20 hours of further study in Traditional East Asian Medicine every year since 2009. I have training in a number of different acupuncture modalities including Five Element Acupuncture, Japanese Meridian Therapy and Eight Extraordinary Channels. The 'style' of acupuncture I offer will vary depending on what type of concern is brought and what I intuit will be the most effective and helpful way to engage with the qi field between myself and the person in front of me at that moment. This is why I call my offering Intuitive Acupuncture. "}
