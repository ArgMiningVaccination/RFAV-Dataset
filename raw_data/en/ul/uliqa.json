Prevention and Control of Japanese Encephalitis/ Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (JE/AES) has been fortified by including multipronged strategy envisaging convergence with the designated Ministries, therefore for taking a step further towards successful programme execution, framing of operational guidelines is imperative. It is a matter of great pleasure for me to know that Directorate of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) has developed operational guidelines for all the functionaries working in the field of Prevention and Control of JE/AES . The technical guidelines developed to cover all the aspects of health related components to be implemented in the programme mode shall prove to be useful and handy for all concerned hea lth professionals while executing the programme related activity in the field. I congratulate all the experts in general and the officials of Directorate of NVBDCP in particular for having framed this technical document that will go a long way in guiding the States for effective implementation of programme. I wish all a great success and hope that by carrying out the programme activities in accordance with these gui delines sincerely in the field shall help us in achieving programme activities. (Lov Verma ) Secretary (Health & FW) ii PREFACE Japanese Encephalitis (JE) over the years has emerged as one of the major public health problems in the country due to its complex eco -epidemiology. Subsequent to a major outbreak of suspected Japanese Encephalitis in Ea stern Uttar Pradesh in 2005, Govt. of India took up the initiative of introducing Japanese Encephalitis vaccine in priority in high endemic areas in 2006. Simultaneously Directorate of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme was vested with the re sponsibility of Prevention and Control of Japanese Encephalitis/ Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (JE/AES) in programme mode which resulted in development of technical guidelines for operational ising programme components in 2007. The guidelines covered all the important areas of Disease Surveillance, Prevention and control and case management aspects. In view of the evidence of the entero -viral and other non -JE infections circulating in the endemic areas of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Directorate of NVBDCP revised the above guidelines for including management of encephalitis as a result of entero -viral infections during 2009. A major initiative of Govt. of India resulted in developing a unique programme seeking convergence of the Ministries like (i) Ministry of Drin king Water and Sanitation for provision of safe water supply (ii) Women and Child development for provided high quality nutrition to the vulnerable children (iii) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment for establishing District Disability Rehabilitatio n Centers. (iv) Ministry of HUPA for ensuring the supply of safe water in slums and towns (v) Ministry of Human Resource. The above convergence resulted in developing National Programme for Prevention and Control of JE/AES . Ministry of Health and Family W elfare has been designated as the nodal agency for overseeing the progress made by the programme, therefore, it was felt that comprehensive guidelines on health components of the revised strategy be developed, to be followed by the States . Directorate of NVBDCP has done a good job in coming up with a set of technical operational guidelines to be used by all the personnel engaged in Prevention and Control of JE/AES. I am sure that all those functionaries involved in executing the programme successfully in the field will find these guidelines very useful and therefore I hope that the implementation of programme components will receive a great momentum which will ultimately lead to achieving the desired goal of significant reduction of mortality and morbidity due to JE/AES . I wish programme all the success. (Jagdish Prasad) Director General Health Services iii ACKNOWLEDGMENT JE is an emerging public health problem afflicting mostly children between 1 -15 years of age. Because of its eco -epidemiological complexity it poses a serious challenge in terms of prevention and control. Keeping in view this challenge, Government of India has formulated a multipronged strategy in five most Japanese Encephalitis endemic States . This strategy encompasses a unique multi -sectora l approach aimed at significantly reducing the disease burden as well as preventing mortality, morbidity and disability to a great extent. This approach necessitated the development of revised operational guidelines for convenient operationalization of the programme strategy in the field. The operational guidelines on National Programme for Prevention and Control of Japanese Encephalitis/Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (JE/AES) developed by Directorate NVBDCP are expected to be used by all the stakeholders work ing in different endemic areas for Prevention and Control of JE/AES. It is a matter of great pleasure for me to thank the experts from this Directorate as well as from Directorate General of Health Services, and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare who le nt a helping hand and guided us in framing these guidelines. I am thankful for the overall technical guidance provided by Dr. Jagdish Prasad DGHS, Govt. of India. The support and encouragement provided by Sh. Anshu Prakash, Joint Secretary (MoH&FW) is gra tefully acknowledged. The guidance received from Dr. Shiv Lal, Ex -Spl. DGHS (PH) and Programme Coordinator JE/AES is highly appreciated. I will also express my gratitude to my colleagues, Dr. P.K. Sen, Additional Director, Dr. R.K. Jaiswal, Assistant Direc tor and the consultants Dr. V. K. Raina, Dr. Aruna Rastogi, Dr. Nibedita Das, Dr. B .R. Thapar and Sh. V.K. Reehl, for their invaluable contribution in preparing the guidelines. Secretarial Assistance while preparing this document rendere d by the staff of JE division is also thankfully acknowledged. I am sure that these guidelines will help all the concerned personnel in appropriately taking up Prevention and Control measures in the field. (A.C.

The virus is maintained in animals, birds, pigs, particularly the birds belonging to family Ardeidae (eg. Cattle egrets, pond hero ns etc) which act as the natural hosts. Pigs & wild birds are reservoirs of infection and are called as amplifier hosts in the transmission cycle, while man and horse are 'dead end hosts. The virus does not cause any disease among its natural hosts and tra nsmission continues through mosquitoes primarily belonging to vishnui group culex. Vector mosquito is able to transmit JE virus to a healthy person after biting an infected host with an incubation period ranging from 5 to 14 days. The disease affects the Central Nervous System and can cause severe complication s, seizures and even death. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of this disease is very high and those who survive may suffer from various degrees of neurological sequeale. (An estimated 25% of the affected children die, and among those who survive, about 30 - 40% suffers from physical & mental impairment). The children suffer the highest attack rate because of lack of cumulative immunity due to natural infections. The incidence of JE disease is never an indic ation of the risk at which the population is living in JE endemic areas, because of inapparent infections, which tend to outnumber the apparent infections and also due to the lifelong immunity, which develops despite inapparent infection. The ratio of over t disease to inapparent infection varies from 1:250 to 1:1000. Thus the cases of JE represent tip of the iceberg compared to the large number of inapparent infections. Usually the number of overt disease cases reported from each village is 1 or 2. The first case of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) was reported in India in 1955 from Vellore, Tamil Nadu. The first major JE outbreak was reported in 1973 from Burdwan district of West Bengal. Since then JE/AES has been reported from 171 districts of 19 States in the country. A major outbreak of Japanese Encephalitis was reported from eastern UP during 2005 resulting in recording of more than 6000 cases and 1500 deaths. This led to a major decision of introduction of vaccine in high endemic areas. Simultaneously NVBDCP developed surveillance and case management guidelines for syndromic reporting of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome including Japanese Encephalitis. During this outbreak NIV Pune detected entero -viral infections (22%) out of 302 CSF/sera samples through RT -PCR. Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) is a general description of the clinical presentation of a disease characterized by high fever altered consciousness etc mostly in children below 15 years of age. Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) has a very complex et iology and JE virus is only one of the many causative agents of Encephalitis. Further it is also 2 evident that many cases of AES in these States are caused by Entero -viruses which are spreading through unsafe drinking water sources. The disease is causing h igh mortality and disability. During 2013, a declining trend in the number of AES cases (27% ) and (7%) in deaths was observed as compared to corresponding period of 2012. The epidemiological analysis of the data collected for the States from 2008 -2013 revealed the following: Most vulnerable age group between 1 -5 years followed by 5 -10 years and 10 -15 years in that order. Least JE infections in infants (0-1 year). All the endemic States except Assam start reporting JE cases from July onwards attaining a peak in September - October. In Assam the cases start appearing from February and attain a peak in the month of July. Due to circulation of entero -viruses particularly in Eastern Uttar Pradesh AES cases are reported round the year. Realizing the gravity of problem of AES & JE in the country, a Group of Ministers (GoM) was constituted vide Cabinet Secretariat's order no. 241/1/5/2011 -CAB dated 4th November, 2011 by Govt. of India envisaging multi pronged strategy encompassing preventive (sanitation, safe d rinking water, improvement in nutrition etc.), case management (capacity building of medical and para -medical staff, referral etc.) and rehabilitation (physical and social rehabilitation of disabled children), measures to address the problems relating to J E/AES. On the recommendations of the Group of Ministers, Govt. of India approved National Programme for Prevention & Control of JE/AES. The operational guidelines have been prepared by the Directorate of NVBDCP for implementation of National Programme for Prevention & Control of JE/AES. The guidelines are intended to guide the programme managers at state & district level for better management of the programme by providing information on AES surveillance, JE Vaccination, early case detection and speedy r eferrals of complicated cases to well equipped hospitals, rehabilitation of disabled children due to AES/JE which can help to reduce mortality & disability in affected children. 1.2 Goal and Objectives of the Programme Considering the complexity of JE/A ES problem and the urgency of addressing the adverse consequences of the growing incidence of JE/AES through a multi -pronged strategy, it has been decided to launch a comprehensive National Programme on Prevention and Control of JE/AES with the participati on of concerned Ministries/ Departments. The goal of the Programme will be to reduce morbidity, mortality and disability in children due to JE/AES. The major objectives of the Programme shall be; 3 (i). to strengthen and expand JE vaccination in affected dist ricts; (ii). to strengthen surveillance, vector control, case management and timely referral of serious and complicated cases; (iii). to increase access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities to the target population in affected rural and urban areas; (iv). to estimate disability burden due to JE/AES, and to provide for adequate facilities for physical, medical, neurological and social rehabilitation; (v). to improve nutritional status of children at risk of JE/AES; (vi). to carry out intensified IEC/BCC a ctivities regarding JE/AES. 1.3 Strategy The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has been taking various prevention and control measures against Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) but the nature of the problem suggests that AES should be construed as a br oader development and rehabilitation challenge rather than merely a medical problem. Therefore, there is a need to put in place a multi -pronged strategy. This strategy can be implemented only with the active engagement of the Ministries/ Departments of (i ) Health and Family Welfare (ii) Drinking Water and Sanitation (iii) Social Justice and Empowerment (iv) Women and Child Development (v) Urban Development (Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation) and (vi) Human Resource Development (Department of School Edu cation and Literacy). To begin with the, interventions shall be focused during Phase -I of the programme in 60 districts in 5 States (Assam, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh & West Bengal) Annexure 1a, out of 171 districts in 19 States , identified as JE endemic districts as shown in Annexure - 1b. 1.4 Guidelines , Protocols etc. The new Programme combines the basic elements of on -going schemes of participating Ministries/ Departments. However, some new elements and strategies have been incorporated in the Programme. Therefore, the participating Ministries/ Departments will prepare and disseminate comprehensive guidelines/ protocols for the implementation of the Programme wherever required. 1.5 Monitoring, Supervision & Coordination The complexity involved i n the implementation of this National Programme with inputs, support and supervision from various Ministries/Departments is self -evident. Therefore, a Committee has been set up under the Chairmanship of the Secretary, Department of 4 Health & FW, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare with Secretaries and/ or their representatives from the Ministries/Departments of Drinking Water & Sanitation, Women & Child Development, Social Justice & Empowerment, Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation, School Education and Hea lth Research to supervise and monitor the activities of the Programme in coordination with various stakeholders including State Governments. The Committee will decide on measurable and time -bound monitoring indicators in respect of each Ministry/Department and monitor the progress on six - monthly basis against the agreed indicators. The Committee has also set up a Task Force consisting of officials and experts from participating Ministries/ Departments for making field visits, interacting with state and dist rict authorities and coordinating with other ground level functionaries, besides assessing the progress of different components on the ground. 5 Chapter -2 Role and responsibilities of different Ministries 2.1 Ministry of H ealth and Family Welfare Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has been designated as nodal agency to monitor the progress on the implementation of following programme components recommended by Group of Ministers (GoM). a) Strengthening and Expanding JE Vac cination. b) Strengthening of Public Health Activities c) Better Clinical Management of JE/AES Cases. d) Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR) e) Establishing of District Counselling Centres f) Monitoring, Supervision and Coordination g) Research -Cum -Interventio n Project 2.2 Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation Considering the risk of transmission of (Entero -viral infection) AES through contaminated drinking water, the provision of safe drinking water and proper sanitation are critical for the prevention and control of AES. Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation will undertake following activities to improve supply of drinking water and its quality in 60 priority districts. (i). Installation of new IM -II hand pumps to replace private/public/shallow hand pumps. (ii). Mini water supply scheme in habitations where JE/AES cases are reported, with energized deep bore -well and stand posts with adequate number of taps and provision for chlorination. In States /habitations where piped water supply schemes exist in the a ffected areas, they can alternatively utilize this fund for extension of pipelines, installation of disinfection units like Ultrafilteration (U F) Activated Carbon ( AC), Ultra violate ( UV), Electro -chlorinator, and related activities for controlling bacteri ological contamination. 6 (iii). Water safety measures for drinking water sources in the affected areas; immediate repairs of hand pump platform, raising of hand pump platforms in flood prone areas, construction of soakage pits, chlorination, etc. (iv). Solid and liquid waste management in the affected habitations/districts. (v). Awareness generation and capacity building of local community and field level engineers and technicians. (vi). Water quality testing of all public sources in the 60 districts with sample testing for vir ological examination. The Ministry will take up following activities to improve access to sanitation facilities. (i). Effective demand generation for sanitation facilities through awareness creation and IEC (ii). Incentivising BPL households for construction an d usages of sanitation facilities. (iii). Providing interest free loans out of revolving fund to APL households. (iv). Providing sanitation facilities in schools and anganwadis housed in government buildings The estimated costs of drinking water and sanitation compo nents have been worked out based on requirements in 60 districts over a period of 3 -5 years. 2.3 Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (HUPA) It is evident from available data that JE/AES is primarily a rural -based problem. However, JE/AES c ases have been reported from some urban areas as well. Based on the reported cases and perceived risk of transmission of AES, a list of 66 municipalities which require adequate facilities for safe drinking water and sanitation has been prepared by the Mini stry of Health and Family Welfare and is placed at Annexure -2.The Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation has estimated slum households and slum population at 4.77 lakh and 24.9 lakh respectively in identified 66 municipalities in 43 districts. 2.4 Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment fulfills its mandate of providing rehabilitation services to target populations through a network of national institutes, composite regional centres, and distr ict disability rehabilitation centres established across the country. The Ministry is also operating various schemes, including Scheme of Assistance to Disabled Persons for Purchase/ Fitting of Aids/ Appliances and Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS) for promoting physical, psychological, social, educational and economic rehabilitation of persons with 7 disabilities to enhance their quality of life and also to enable them to lead a life with dignity. The Ministry has already initiated process of setting up District Disability Rehabilitation Centres (DDR Cs) in 60 priority districts. The Government of Tamil Nadu has set -up DDRCs in all districts including 4 priority districts out of its own resources. The Ministry has also set -up a Composite Region al Centre in Patna and, therefore, a separate DDRC is not needed in Patna. The Ministry will, therefore set -up and operate 15 new DDRCs in remaining priority districts in 4 States over 5 years as follows: S. No. States Districts 1. Assam Bengal (1) Paschim Midnapur Total 4 States and 15 Districts The Ministry wil l also assist the needy persons with disabilities in procuring durable, sophisticated and scientifically manufactured, modern, standard aids and appliances that can promote their physical, social and psychological rehabilitation on priority basis in 60 dis tricts. Similarly, the Ministry will provide Grant -in-AID to voluntary agencies under Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS) to provide services for pre - school and early intervention, special education, vocational training, and community based reh abilitation, and psycho -social rehabilitation in identified 60 districts. 2.5 Ministry of Human Resource Development (Department of School Education) It was recognized that children with disabilities due to JE/AES need special facilities for their educ ation. Department of School Education has informed that their mandate is to set up inclusive schools as no separate schools are established for mentally challenged children. However, it was agreed that a tailor -made curriculum was required to cater to spec ific needs of JE/AES affected children. It has been decided that a joint team consisting of officials from Ministry of Human Resource Development, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) and Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerme nt will develop the curriculum, and the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment will set up special schools and training centres under Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS) in 60 districts based on assessed needs of affected children. 8 2.6 Mi nistry of Women and Child Development Poor nutrition is an important risk factor for JE/AES. Therefore, it is critical that special efforts are made to improve the nutritional status of the children in affected areas. The Ministry of Women and Child Devel opment will take steps to improve the monitoring of feeding of children at the Anganwadi centres with the help of district and state authorities under Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) in 60 priority districts. The Ministry will also take specia l measures to train and sensitize Anganwadi workers and their supervisors regarding JE/AES. The Ministry will also provide additional Take Home Ration (THR) to the moderately undernourished children enrolled under ICDS in 60 most affected districts. 9 Chapter - 3 Operational Guidelines for the activities to be conducted by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare 3.1 Strengthening and Expanding JE Vaccination. Vaccination with the approved JE vaccine is one of the most effective preven tive measures given the complex eco -epidemiology of the disease that involves multiple hosts supporting the circulation of JEV. In addition vector control measures also have their limitations given the exophilic as well as exophagic tendencies of the prove n vectors belonging to Cx. Vishnui group. Subsequent to a major outbreak of JE in Eastern UP during 2005, GoI introduced JE vaccination with SA -14-14-2 vaccine in phased manner starting from 2006. 132 districts have already been brought under JE vaccinati on as part of Universal Immunization Programme (UIP). Out of 62 new districts proposed to be covered during 2012 -13 & 2013 -14, 16 districts have already been covered under JE vaccination during 2012 -13. Further, new areas will also be covered based on epid emiological evidence. Micro planning for strengthening routine immunization including JE is planned in the programme which may include name based tracking and also capacity building and training of field level workers. As per Go vt. of India guidelines, 2 doses of JE vaccine have been approved to be included in UIP to be given one along with measles at the age of 9 months and the second with DPT booster at the age of 16 -24 months w.e.f. April, 2013. This activity will be undertaken by Immunization Divisi on, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in consultation with State concerned. 3.2 Strengthening of Public Health Activities A district level model action plan including public health measures for containment of JE/AES has been developed in consultation with state and district health authorities in Uttar Pradesh. The model action plan envisages community based surveillance, entomological surveillance, vector control, and IEC/BCC capacity building involving community volunteers. It has been decided to implemen t similar action plan in 60 priority districts. Details of public health activities to be carried out under public health measures is Annexed at Annexure. 3. 3.3 Vector Control JE vectors are exophillic and endophagic in nature. The risk of transmission incr eases when the human dwellings and animal sheds particularly piggeries are situated very 10 close to each other. When they are situated far from each other, the risk of transmission is reduced. Because of outdoor resting habits and crepuscular nature, the ve ctor control using indoor residual spray is technically not feasible. In addition to this, due to vast and enormous breeding habitats like perennial ponds, paddy fields and other water bodies, larval control using various anti larval measures is also not f easible as it is resource intensive. Therefore, vector control using ULV (ultra low volume) fogging is the only recommended method of vector control and can be used during JE epidemics also. 3.4 Disease Surveillance JE Surveillance implies a continuous monit oring of all factors influencing transmission and effective control of JE, building up capacity for early recognition of impending outbreaks or epidemics. It is pertinent that the JE Surveillance system collects the information on epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory and entomological parameters from the identified sites on a regular basis. The list of Apex referral laboratories is given at Annexur e-4. 3.5 Advocacy Meeting Advocacy meetings will include orientation training of ASHA / AWW and community volunteers. 3.6 Behavior Change Communication (BCC) / Information Education and Communication (IEC) Preparation of community education, printing material, Nukkad Naatak at block PHC and prominent places and also advocacy workshop. Behavior change communication (BCC) is a process of any intervention with individuals , communities and/or societies to develop communication strategies to promote positive behaviors which are appropriate to their settings. This in turn provides a supportive environment which will enable people to initiate and sust ain positive and desirable behavior outcomes. BCC should not be confused with behavior modifica tion, a term with specific meaning in a clinical psychiatry setting. Behavior Change Communication is different from ordinary instructional method of communication and is target specific. A society consists of many sub -groups. The strategy for Behavior Change Communication will vary from group to group. Following points are important while considering the Behavior Change Communication strategy.[3] Vulnerability/risk factor of the target group. The conflict and obstacles in the way to desired change in Behavior. 11 Type of message and communication media which can best be used to r each the target group. Type of resources available and assessment of existing knowledge of the target group about the issue which is going to be dealt with. There can be several more points in this list. A successful Behavior Change Communication requires lots of research and meticulous planning about the knowledge content of the subject and behavior/attitude pattern of the target group. Objectives of IEC/BBC in the Programme: 1) To promote individual services and all other interventions of the project by c reating demand and acceptance among target groups. 2) To bring about desirable behavioral changes in the household maternal, child care and feeding practices. 3) To mobilize community participation and support for project activities. 4) To empower the com munities to plan and implement sustainable interventions to reduce malnutrition among adolescent girls, women and children and improve health and nutrition status of the community. In order to achieve above objectives, and keeping in view the nature of th e disease, Govt. of India in collaboration with NDMA, NVBDCP, CHEB and other experts developed a prototype in Hindi for creating awareness amongst the affected community in 14 districts of Uttar Pradesh during 2012 -13. Approximately 6000 trainers were trained in above districts for disseminating information to the community. The prototype material is annexed at Annexure -5. 3.7 Monitoring & Supervision It has been observed that successful implementation of any disease control porgramme largely depends upon a robust supervision and monitoring mechanism. It is therefore of utmost importance to generate clear basic data which when filled up appropriately can be analysis efficiently for providing quick feed back to the concerned health authorities. The monitorin g formats for JE/AES are given at Annexure -6. In order to strengthen programme activities at field level, it has been proposed to provide human resource at state and district level ToR for the contractual appointment are provided at Annexure -7. 3.8 Settin g Up of Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation at Medical Colleges (Neuro -rehabilitation component ) In view of residual neurological sequelae in 30 -40% of children who recover from JE/AES , there is a 'felt need' to have rehabilitation specialist s (Physiatrists) trained in 12 assessment, quantification and management of disabilities occurring as a result of JE/AES. Thus a separate Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (PMR) at Medical Colleges (Neuro -rehabilitation component) in 10 medical colleges (Annexure - 8) in high endemic States in the country has been recommended with the objectives of: providing high quality and affordable care to persons with musculo -skeletal & neurological disorders due to JE/AES with focus on reducing disability & handicap. Organizing m anpower training program in consonance with the District Health Program and other paramedical persons involved or part of multidisciplinary rehabilitation team. Providing public health education in the area of rehabilitation related to JE/AES. The department should have multi level teaching and training programs: - Short term training program for medical from government medical colleges and district hospitals can be initiated. These physicians can visit the centers for a period of three to six months and acquire skill in recognition, evaluation and management of common disabling conditions. - Training program for other health professionals like Physical therapists, Occupational therapists, Psychologists, social works and commu nity based health workers involved in rehabilitation. 3.9 Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) WHO defines (Acute Encephalitis Syndrome) AES by Acute febrile illness and a change in mental illness status (such as confusion, disorientation, inability to talk, and coma) and/or new onset of seizures excluding simple febrile seizures. As there is no specific treatment, such patients require more supportive therapy in the form of taking care of feeding , airway s, anticonvulsants for seizure control and management of intracranial pressure which requires close monitoring of patients. Therefore to reduce mortality, morbidity and disability in the patients it has been decided to set up a well -equipped 10 -bedded Paediatric intensive care unit ( PICU) in district hospital s of 60 priority districts. PICU will be a specific area of hospital where sophisticated monitoring, titrated life support, specific therapy and specialized nursing for potentially salvage able, critically ill patients with life threatening illness will be provided. PICU will be a nursing unit that will be staffed and equipp ed to look after such patients and their needs or who require extensive nursing care and almost constant obse rvation. As recommended under programme the components for PICU is enclosed as Annexure -9. 13 Chapter -3A Epidemiological Surveillance Background Effective epidemiological surveillance of JE would require recording of encephalitis so that the actual disease burden can be assessed area wise. Various activities pertaining to epidemio logical surveillance i.e. collection, compilation, analysis and interpretation of data, follow -up action and feedback should be carried out in a systematic and organized manner. Epidemiological surveillance of JE would include components of laboratory base d serological surveillance ( 3E) and clinical surveillance (detailed below). To carry out clinical surveillance of JE it is crucial that all health institutions, which are attending to patients either at outpatient department or as indoor cases, be on the lookout for any patients presenting with the signs and symptoms of encephalitis. All the reporting units (health institutions) in endemic areas both in public and private sector should further notify all these suspected JE cases based on standard case defin itions. For reporting by all reporting units a line list of these cases should be prepared on the standardized reporting format and submitted to the higher authorities. For surveillance purposes, JE is commonly reported under the heading of \"acute encephal itis\". In the WHO's guidelines for JE surveillance, syndromic surveillance for JE is recommended. This means that all cases of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) should be reported. Laboratory confirmation of suspected cases can be done where feasible. The following case definition should be used for reporting of suspected JE cases in endemic areas: Case Definition of Suspected case: - Acute onset of fever, not more than 5 -7 days duration. - Change in mental status with/ without New onset of seizures (excluding febrile seizures) (Other early clinical findings - may include irritability, somnolence or abnormal behavior greater than that seen with usual febrile illness) Important In an epidemic situation fever with altered sensorium persisting for more than two hours with a focal seizure or paralysis of any part of body, is encephalitis. Presence of rash on body excludes Japanese Encephalitis. AES with symmetrical signs and fever is likely to be cerebral Malaria. JE and AES Surveillance The purpose of JE and ASE Surveillance is to estimate disease burden and understand the disease pattern in terms of its influence on morbidity and mortality. The incidence of JE and AES will form the basis of any future planning for prevention and control of this 14 disease. JE and A ES surveillance would thus mean generation of authentic and valid information on epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and entomological parameters on regular basis. This surveillance will be carried out through sentinel sites and other health institutions . Sentinel Surveillance Sites with laboratories (SSSL) facilities Sentinel Surveillance Sites without laboratories facilities Other Informer Units Sentinel Surveillance Sites (SSSL) with laboratories facilities The key component of the AES surveillance system is the referral hospital with laboratory capacity to diagnose JE. These sites would include government or private health facilities which are engaged in treating a large number of AES patients. JE and AES surveillance at the local level will be in stitution based, initially through at least one sentinel surveillance site with laboratory facility per district. Seventy Eight such sentinel surveillance sites have been identified where laboratories facilities will be strengthened in the first phase (Lis t is given at Annexure -10). Activities : Each SSSL would have a designated nodal officer for coordination of JE/AES surveillance activities. In SSSL, Medical Officers (MOs), pediatricians, and other physicians, nurses who see patients with AES should infor m the designated Nodal Officer immediately upon presentation of the AES case. The case should be further subjected to laboratory investigations for which the nodal officer should immediately notify the District Vector Borne Disease Officer (DVBDO) or the d esignated officer in charge of AES/JE surveillance in the district. The SSSL will regularly generate and transmit infor mation on the AES/JE cases and outcome. These units will also send regular information to DVBDO. There should be case investigation and l ine listing of suspected cases of JE in order to track these cases back their villages and to take appropriate control measures. Records and Reports: The identified SSSL should maintain documentation of the patients reported upon. For reporting of AES and confirmed JE cases and deaths from States to NVBDCP, AESF -1 and AESF -1A form will be used. Line list of AES and JE confirmed cases will be maintained and submitted to SMO/SPO in the form AESF -3 by nodal officer. Sentinel Surveillance Sites without laborat ory facilities (SSSs) Some of the identified sentinel surveillance sites in government or private health facilities such as district hospitals, CHCs, PHCs etc. are engaged in treating a large number of AES patients and do not have facilities for laborato ry diagnosis of JE. Such sentinel surveillance sites will be linked to the nearest facilities or SSSL with facilities for sero-diagnosis of JE. 15 Informer Units (IU) These are smaller health facilities or private practitioners who are visited by AES patient s but in relatively smaller numbers than reporting units. These units should inform the DVBDO or Surveillance Medical Officer (SMO) under National Polio Surveillance Project (NPSP) whenever they come across an AES case as is being done for reporting of AF P cases. They usually do not maintain detailed documentation of the patients visiting them. To further strengthen the AES reporting at the district level IDSP resources can be utilized and the Epidemiologist may be involved in investigation of the AES case s.

In the office of DVBDO, compilation of all informati on/reports will be undertaken for interpretation and action. Report will be submitted to SPO form AESF -2, AESF -2A, AESF -3. Data analysis (time/place/person) & Interpretation Compile JE Outbreak Investigation report 16 Case Investigation All cases that are notified should be verified and investigated by a specially trained DVBDO, designated Surveil lance Medical Officer or district level epidemiologist within 48 hours of notification. The necessary steps in the AES case investigation are: Once a case of AES is reported by a physician, health unit or any other source, the District Vector Borne Disease Officer (DVBDO) or any other designated official must personally see the case to ascertain if the case meets the AES case definition. Using the case investigation form AESF -4 as a guide, obtain the history and conduct a physical examination of the patie nt. Co ordinate the collection of specimens of serum or CSF and transportation to the identified laboratory. Completeness and timeliness of reporting from the reporting units should be regularly monitored. To summarize, following surveillance activities n eed to be carried out at the district level: Monitoring daily/weekly/monthly surveillance reports of AES/JE cases including \"nil\" case reports submitted by different reporting Units. Ensuring analyzed of AES/JE cases and reconciling data with existing, surveillance systems such as IDSP to identify if there are any outbreaks. Ensuring that all data from cases are properly collected, analyzed and interpreted from local action. Ensuring that surveillance reports and case investigation data are shared with other surveillance systems such as IDSP and forwarded to SPO, /NVBDCP (National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme) on Daily / weekly or monthly basis as per requirement. Supervision and monitoring at all levels would be strengthened for ensuring effectiv e surveillance. Surveillance activities at state level The District will report to the state on daily/weekly/monthly basis as per requirement depending on the disease situation. Data from the districts will be compiled and analyzed at the state level to understand the disease situation to provide feedback to the districts and to initiate appropriate prevention and control measures. To strengthen the JE/AES surveillance the state may coordinate with existing ICMR designated Viral Diagnostic Laboratories ( VDL). Final compiled date from the state will be send to the national level on daily/weekly/monthly basis as desired by the disease situation. Presently 85 sentinel sites and diagnostic centre s exist in different States. Considering growing number of JE reporting districts, it has been decided to add 20 more such 17 centres with provision of manpower, equipment, kits, capacity building etc. In each sentinel site there is a provision for contractual appointment of a Data Entry Operator (DEO). Terms of Referen ce of DEO are annexed at Annexure - 11. 3: INFORMATION FLOW DIAGRAM k AESF 1/1A = AES Cases & JE cases reporting Form from the States AESF 2/2A = AES Cases & JE cases reporting Form from the Districts AESF 3 = Line Listing Form AESF 4 = Case Investigation Form SSSL = Sentinel Surveillance Sites with laboratory facili ties SSS = Sentinel Surveillance Sites without laboratory facilities IU = Informer Unit Periodicity of Reports Daily report should be generated and transmitted in an outbreak situation, weekly report in transmission period and monthly report in inter -epidemic period.

The clues for an impending outbreak can be picked up from following. Prediction of high rainfall by the meteorological department, an unusual increase in the adul t vector density. Relative increase in pig population and water frequenting birds should alert the local officers. They should share such information with the District Nodal Officer of JE Surveillance (DMO). Virus detected in the suspected animal hosts and in mosquitoes can also act as an indicator for warning a forthcoming outbreak. Other associated parameters and the surveillance data can be correlated to above to identify early warning signals. Epidemiological data for the last ten years would indicate t he trend of the diseases in the specific area. Micro analysis of such data at the district level would help the district health officer to predict areas which are at risk of having epidemic outbreak of JE. To obtain the earliest linking of an impending ou tbreak it is essential that all the components of surveillance i.e. collection, compilation, analysis and interpretation of data, follow -up action and feedback must be carried out in a systematic and organized manner. Supervision and monitoring at all leve ls is mandatory for ensuring effective surveillance. The state Programme officer would compile district -wise surveillance data generated through epidemiological, entomological laboratory and veterinary surveillance, predict the suspected outbreak and warn the districts for implementation of proper measures for prevention of outbreak. Outbreak investigations should be initiated if there is a sudden increase in cases or if cases reported are different from historical information, in terms of season, geographi c area, age group, or case fatality. All compiled reports should be sent to Dte. of NVBDCP on regular basis as per proforma attached at Annexure -12. Early Warning Signals Directorate of NVBDCP monitors daily/weekly or monthly incidence of JE as per the needs. During epidemics, daily monitoring is carried out while weekly reports are insisted upon during the transmission season. During the inter -epidemic period a monthly report is expected from the States . This surveillance data is further analyzed by 19 the D te. of NVBDCP and interpreted to detect any warning signals(WS) for JE outbreak. Based on epidemiological trends advance warnings are given to the States . Some of the early warning signals for JE outbreak are: Reporting of a suspect case, with clustering i n time and space which do not fit into the expected known endemicity or seasonality of JE, in a given area. Fluctuations in ecological conditions conducive for vector breeding and enhanced adult density of JE vectors. Presence of amplifying host in good nu mber Detection of viral activity in vector Detection of viral activity in zoonotic reservoir/s It is emphasized that comprehensive analysis of all available information is made to estimate the risk of an outbreak. Risk Factors for JE outbreak in an Area Increase in susceptible population High density of Culex mosquitoes Presence of amplifying hosts such as pigs, water birds etc. Paddy cultivation Outbreak investigation JE is a disease of public health importance because of its epidemic potential and high case fatality rate. JE, in patients who survive, complications may lead to life long sequelae. The first major outbreak of JE occurred in Bankura and Burdwan districts, West Bengal, in 1973 and since then it has spread to many States / UTs of the country. Though JE is primarily a disease of rural agricultural areas, where vector mosquitoes proliferate in close association with pigs and other animal reservoirs, epidemics have also been reported in peri -urban areas where similar conditions may exist. For inves tigation of an outbreak, the first principle is to have in place a system to receive early warning signals and confirm diagnosis. In areas of low JE endemicity every single suspect JE case needs to be investigated. However in areas where HE is endemic the term outbreak can be applied to an unusual increase in suspected JE cases compared to the normal transmission or increase beyond the normal range due to seasonal variations. This normal range will be different from place to place. Following steps should be taken for epidemic outbreak investigation: Steps of Outbreak Investigation Define an outbreak. Assessment of the number of suspected cases in the area and confirmation of an outbreak. In case JE diagnosis is confirmed, incidence rates may be worked out. Delineation of the area involved in outbreak Investigation of reported cases in the Case Investigation Form (AESF -4). 20 Line list of cases including age and gender distribution of suspected cases, date(s) of onset of fever and other symptoms in a chronologic al order and severity of illness of the cases, including deaths. (AESF -3). Laboratory confirmation of suspected cases Assessment for presence of reservoir host such as pigs, cattle, poultry in the near vicinity of suspected cases. Vector surveillance shoul d be initiated immediately, which should include collection of larvae and adult mosquitoes, identification of vector species, density and for incrimination of the vector mosquitoes. History of JE outbreak in the past must be noted. Analysis and report on t he distribution and risk factors associated with the outbreak. After an outbreak is over, detailed report the outbreak must be prepared on the Form JE F -10 and submitted to Directorate of NVBDCP. Anticipatory preparation for managing an outbreak of JE: Anticipatory preparations should be made for timely availability of medicines, equipment and accessories as well as sufficient number of trained medical, nursing and paramedical personnel. For clinical management of JE cases States should identify the facil ities like CHCs, District Hospitals and Medical colleges. These institutions should ensure the availability of the necessary drugs, IV fluids & equipment before the onset of JE transmission season. It is essential for investigation of an outbreak that rap id response teams are constituted at state and district level for investigation and containment of an outbreak. These teams should have experts in medicine, epidemiology, entomology and microbiology. Peripheral institutions have to be prepared to manage an y outbreak. For this provision should be made for Technical Malathion, fogging machines, health education materials, preliminary laboratory investigations, transportation of cases to referral centers before the transmission season. The staff should be orie nted towards detection of cases and trained to take immediate remedial measures to report cases in prescribed format and also follow up for laboratory confirmation. The data should be collected and analyzed to understand the causes of the outbreak. Outbre ak containment After receiving the warning signals and investigation of a suspected outbreak, the containment measures should automatically be rolled out. The rapid response team should be mobilized and it should start immediate containment action. To min imize the mortality and reduce CFR prompt and appropriate clinical management of suspected JE cases is essential. Cases occurring in periphery, needing specialized care, should be referred to the referral centre without any delay. Some of the measures deta iled below will be found useful for managing JE outbreak: 21 Daily monitoring of the outbreak, cases and deaths. Besides early referral of cases to higher treatment centres. Daily report to State/ National Health Authorities The local health authorities parti cularly the PHC medical officers and district health officials must be aware of the disease profile in their area. As the overt in a village in a given season does not exceed more than 2 cases, the local health personnel and the community at large must be alerted about reporting occurrence of any fever case with altered sensorium. For early reporting involve key members of the community. Control measures should be implemented immediately. Vector control measures especially fogging the Malathion technical sh ould be carried out immediately in the affected village, use of bed nets; full sleeve clothes etc. during evening hours should be promoted to prevent mosquito bites. Continue community education for personal prophylaxis like use of impregnated mosquito net s, keeping piggeries away from human habitations etc. 22 Chapter 3C Eco-Entomological Surveillance Entomological surveillance helps to monitor JE vector density continuously in JE endemic areas (trend data), suggest appropriate vector control measures, und ertake entomological investigations during epidemic and evaluate the impact of control measures. The entomologist and insect collectors or / Biologist / Entomologist attached with Filaria Control Unit may be assigned and made responsible for entomological surveillance in the district. They would identify index villages in the district for entomological surveillance. Vector Mosquitoes of Japanese Encephalitis In India, JE virus has been isolated from 17 mosquito species in wild caught specimens from differen t parts of the country. Maximum isolations have been recorded from Culex vishnui group consisting of Cx.tritaeniorhynchus, Cx.vishnui and Cx.pseudovishnui . Female mosquitoes get infected after feeding on a vertebrate host harbouring JE virus and after 9 -12 days of extrinsic incubation period, they can transmit the virus to other hosts. Culex vishnui subgroup of mosquitoes are very common, widespread and breed in water with luxuriant vegetation, mainly in paddy fields and their abundance may be related to th eir breeding in rice fields, shallow ditches, pools, fish ponds, etc. Preference for breeding places during rainy season and irrigation channels bordering the paddy fields support breeding during non -monsoon season. Rain water collections in low lying areas with aquatic vegetation/ submerged grasses support the breeding during post monsoon months. However permanent water collection in ponds, ditches etc. with aquatic vegetation such as water hyacinth, elephant grass, etc. provide favourable breeding places during all months. In view of the breeding habitats of the vector mosquitoes, JE is usually associated with rural areas with paddy cultivation. Cx.tritaeniorhynchus, the principal vector of JE has been reported to be an outdoor restor (exophilic) but may r est indoor during some part of the year. Vector of JE are zoophilic and feed outdoor as well as indoor. They prefer to feed on cattle and also feed on pig. Cattle such as cows may reduce risk by diverting vector mosquitoes (zooprophylaxis). For planning ve ctor control measures, the bionomics of vector mosquitoes in an area needs to be studied. Objectives of Entomological Surveillance 1. To identify the JE vector mosquitoes in an area 2. To monitor JE vector abundance in JE endemic areas 3. To detect JE virus in vect or mosquitoes 4. To suggest appropriate vector control measures 23 Procedure Entomologist and insect collectors or/ Biologist/National Filaria Control Officers in the districts will be responsible for entomological surveillance in JE endemic areas. An entomolog ical team of National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR) may also conduct these studies. Refresher training of these functionaries would be organized by the DTE. of NVBDCP on receiving request from States . They will identify index villages in the distric t for entomological surveillance. Choice of index villages At least 3 villages in which JE has occurred in the recent past (past five years) At least 2 villages which remained unaffected till date would be monitored in each affected block Sampling would be carried out on fortnightly basis Surveillance would be carried out round the year to known the JE vector density, their resting behaviour, feeding behaviour and detection/isolation of JE virus from vector mosquitoes. Following entomological investigation s are to be carried out: Larval surveys Larval density and Mapping of breeding sites: Larval survey should be carried out by the entomological team periodically. All potential breeding sites will be surveyed and will be reported on the standard proforma. All permanent breeding sites of JE vectors would be identified (mapped) and provided to District officers for implementation of control measures. Larvae collected in the field would be reared in laboratory for emergence of adult mosquitoes for identificat ion of vector species. For this purpose standardized reporting format AESF -6 form (Annexure -13) for breeding survey will be used by all the entomological/ reporting units. Adult surveys Indoor/ Outdoor resting collection and the Dusk Collection should be carried out from fixed as well as random sites in indoor sites such as human dwelling/cattle sheds/mixed dwelling and outdoor situations such as bushes, plantations, standing crops, etc. by hand catch method using suction tubes. Per Man Hour Density (PMHD) will be monitored and reported in standard prescribed format AESF -7 (Annexure -14). This collection would be carried out in the index villages only. Cx. tritoeniorhynchus predominantly rests outdoors on agricultural crops and wild vegetation, depending on local situations, where they can also be monitored by BPD Hop Cage method; formerly known as sweep cage method (NICD). The density of mosquito may be estimated as average number of mosquitoes collected per 10 Hop 24 Cages. The larger the area covered by hoppi ng, the better representation of the mosquito density. Total number of mosquitoes collected x 10 Mosquito density = (Per 10 HC) Total numbers of hops made on vegetation Susceptibility of JE vector mosquitoes and larvae Susceptibility status of JE ve ctor mosquitoes to insecticides particularly Malathion in JE endemic areas should be carried out by entomological teams in the state/ICMR/ any other institute. Map should be prepared in all JE endemic States about the status resistance in vector mosquitoes to insecticides. Format AESF -9 (Annexure -15) will be used for reporting susceptibility/resistance status of vector mosquitoes. Method for Collection and Transportation of mosquitoes for isolation of JE virus For entomological studies the virus isolation w ould be attempted from vector mosquitoes, which would be collected in a screw -capped clean test tube and sent to the laboratory at NIV/CRME. Particularly, in epidemic situations it becomes necessary to collect vector mosquitoes for isolation of JE virus. In an epidemic situation, it is desirable to collect mosquitoes from the affected areas - both indoor and outdoor, so that they may be processed for virus isolation. This may give an indication of the species acting as vector of the area. Mosquitoes can be collected by standard method such as aspirator, baited traps, biting collections and light traps. The mosquitoes should be held alive in 'Barraud Cages' wrapped with moistened lint or cloth. If the collection locality is not far from the laboratory or transp ortation can be done within a day or two, they may be transported alive in Barraud cages. For such transportation, it is necessary to provide raisins soaked in water or cotton pledged soaked in 10 percent glucose solution inside the Barraud cage. If the co llection locality is far from the laboratory and immediate transportation is not possible, mosquitoes may be identified, pooled species wise and stored in liquid nitrogen, refrigerators or on dry ice for subsequent transportation to the laboratory. If facilities for liquid nitrogen or dry ice storage are not available in the field, transport medium may be used to store the mosquito pools. It is, however, necessary that such pools are constantly kept in the refrigerator or transported on wet ice. Since the C entre for Research in Medical Entomology (CRME), ICMR, Madurai and Tamil Nadu has developed a technique whereby the JE antigen can be detected in even 28 days old desiccated mosquitoes and NICD has also detected JE virus antigen even after 20 months of mos quito collection from field. It would be possible to get the JEW antigen detected from the mosquitoes regularly dispatched to CRME, Madurai by post. However, the care should have to be taken not to allow mosquitoes attacked by fungus or affected by dilapid ation before enveloping for dispatch. 25 Laboratory Support The following virological investigations should be carried out in labs: 1. Screening/ isolation of JE virus from suspected JE vector mosquitoes. 2. Vector incrimination would be done in collaboration with NIV Pune, CRME Madurai and NICD, Delhi. Entomological/Vector Control guidelines In India, JE virus has been isolated from 17 mosquito species in wild caught specimens from different parts of the country. Maximum isolations have been recorded from Culex v ishnui pseudovishnui infected after feeding on a vertebrate host harbouring JE virus and after 9 - 12 days of extrinsic incubation period, they can transmit the virus to other hosts. Cx. tritaeniorhynchus , the principal vector of JE has been reported to be an outdoor restor (exophilic) but may also rest indoor during some part of the year. Vectors of JE are zoophilic and feed outdoor as well as indoor. They prefer to feed on cattle and pigs. Cattle such as cows may reduce risk of transmission by diverting vector mosquitoes (zooprophylaxis). For planning vector control measures, the bionomics of vector mosquitoes in an area needs to be studied. Vector Control JE vector ar e exophillic endophagic in nature. The risk of transmission increases when the human dwellings and animal sheds particularly piggeries are situated very close to each other. When they are situated far from each other the risk of transmission is reduced. Because of outdoor resting habits and crepuscular nature, the vector control using indoor residual spray is technically not feasible. In addition to this, due to vast and enormous breeding habitats like perennial ponds, paddy fields and other water bodies la rval control using various anti larval measures is also not feasible as it is resource intensive. Therefore, vector control using ULV fogging (ultra low volume) is the only recommended method of vector control and can be used during JE epidemics also. Pre requisites of thermal fogging Thermal fogging with portable fogging is done in outdoor situations (outside human habitation), where large number of JE cases are reported. Fogging should be carried out in downwind to upwind direction. 26 During outdoor foggi ng it is important to direct the fog to all possible adult mosquito resting sites like bushes, tree -shaded areas and other outdoor resting in peri domestic habitats. The most effective type of thermal fog for mosquito control is medium / dry fog i.e. it s hould just moisten the hand when the hand is passed quickly through the fog at a distance of about 2.5 to 3.0 metres in front of the fog tube. The technical specification recommended for fogging machined should be of BIS standard no. 14855 (Part 1): 2000 for Vector Control. Time of Fogging ULV fogging is carried out only when right weather conditions are present. These conditions presented in the following table: Climatic condition Most favourable conditions Average conditions Unfavourable conditions Time Late evening between (17:00 19:00 hrs) Early evening Mid-morning or afternoon Wind Steady, between 3 -13 km/hr 0-3 km/hr Medium to strong, over 13 km/hr Rain No rain No rain Heavy rain Temperature Mild Mild Hot Frequency of fogging: During outbreak situations, fogging applications have to be carried out at 7 -10 days interval till a significant reduction in vector densities is achieved. Points to remember during ULV fogging In the late evening hour, temperature is very cool when the vector mosquitoes are most active fogging is more effective. Cool weather in the evening hour is more comfortable for worker wearing protective clothing. 27 In the afternoon when the temperature is high, convection currents from the ground will prevent concentrat ion of the spray close to the resting places of adult mosquitoes flying or resting, thus rendering the spray ineffective. An optimum wind speed of between 3 and 13 hm/hr enables the spray to move slowly and steadily over the ground, allowing for maximum ex posure of mosquitoes to the spray. Air movements of less than 3 km/hr may result in vertical mixing, while winds greater than 13 km/hr disperse the spray too quickly. In heavy rain, the spray generated loses its consistency and effectiveness. When the rain is heavy, spraying should stop and the spray head of the ULV machine should be turned down to prevent water from entering the blower. ULV fogging in JE control is not recommended as a routine vector control method, it should only be used during epidemics or when large number of JE cases are reported from any JE endemic areas. Selection of insecticide and requirements of material and manpower The insecticide is selected on the basic biological effectiveness against the vector concerned, its likely effect on target and non -target organisms, and its hazard to humans, threat to the environment posted by its proposed use, cost, transportation requirements and availability of suitable application equipment. Under NVBDCP, Presently Malation and Pyrethrum formul ations are use for fogging applications, For thermal fogging: 5 per cent Malathion (Technical) in kerosene/diesel (1 litre of technical Malathion in 19 litres of diluents). The application rate of insecticide with most of this equipment is generally <0.5 l itres per hectare and requirements can be worked out on this basis. Mostly the effective application is about 330 ml per hectare; however, it varies with type of machine used. Usually a maximum of 1 -1.5 km radius from the epicenter of outbreak is considere d adequate. The manpower requirement is also dependent on the type of equipment. Most of the portable mist blowers/foggers can be operated by one person, yet it is desirable to make a team of two operators to facilitate transportation of insecticides, spares etc. and maintenance of records of operations. Personnel Protection Measures In addition to the vector control, personnel protection measures also help in reducing man vector contact and help in reducing disease transmission. Therefore, intensive IEC activity on use of personnel protection measures in preventing JE cases is also essential. Some of the recommended personnel protection measures are described below. a. Protective clothing :- Clothing reduces the risk of mosquito biting if the cloth is suffic iently thick or loosely fitting. Long sleeves and trousers with stockings may protect the arms and legs, the preferred sites for mosquito bites. Schoolchildren should adhere to these practices whenever possible. Impregnating clothing with 28 chemicals such as permethrin can be especially effective in preventing mosquito bites. b. Mats, coils and aerosols :- Household insecticidal products, namely mosquito coils, pyrethrum space spray and aerosols have been used extensively for personal protection against mosquitoe s. Electric vaporizer mats and liquid vaporizers are more recent additions which are marketed in practically all urban areas. c. Repellents :- Repellents are a common means of personal protection against mosquitoes and other biting insects. These are broadly classified into two categories, natural repellents and chemical repellents. Essential oils from plant extracts are the main natural repellent ingredients, i.e. citronella oil, lemongrass oil and neem oil. Chemical repellents such as DEET (N, N - Diethyl -m-Toluamide) can provide protection against JE vector for several hours. Permethrin is an effective repellent when impregnated in cloth. Procurement of fogging machine While procuring the fogging machine, the technical specification recommended for fogging machined should be of BIS standard no. 14855 (Part 1): 2000 for Vector Control. Procurement of these machines can also be made through Directorate of General of Supplies Disposals (DGS&D ) Rate contract No. FOGGING_MC/WMT -3/RC - V1090000/1214/13/06284/804 date 17th Feb, 2013 valid till 1 6/02/201 5. Veterinary Based Surveillance : By identifying the prevalence & density of pigs, ducks, and ardeid birds and detecting viral activity in susceptible hosts, veterinary surveillance helps to track the rate of Haemagglu tination Inhibition (HI) antibody carriers and the appearance of antibody from fresh infection as an index of the spread of JE virus in animal host. Veterinary -based surveillance is conducted with the help of animal husbandry department. Sera sample from t hese animals is randomly collected for serology to ascertain transmission of JE virus. Sera sample from these animals is randomly collected for serology to ascertain transmission of JE virus. Like most other arboviral infections, JE is basically a disease of animals. Pigs and birds, particularly those belonging to Family Ardeidae (e.g. cattle egrets, pond herons, etc.) are natural hosts. The virus is generally maintained in the enzootic form and appears as focal outbreaks under specific ecological condition s. Infection in human beings is caused as a result of spill -over of infection from zoonotic cycle. At low vector density level the virus circulates in ardied birds -mosquito ardied bird cycle. However, at the commencement of monsoon season or increased avai lability of surface area mosquito breeding e.g. paddy cultivate etc., the vector population builds up rapidly, the virus from wild birds through vector mosquito species spreads to peri domestic birds and then to mammals like cattle and pigs, etc. and event ually spills over to man. 29 Natural Reservoirs of JE virus a)-Birds : Some species of birds like pond herons, cattle egrets, poultry birds, ducks and sparrows, etc. appear to be involved in natural transmission of JE virus. Migratory birds may be involved in the transfer of virus one region to another. b)-Cattle : Cattle do not circulate virus in their blood but develop antibodies against them; hence they do not act as natural host for the virus. It is believed that prevalence of an enormously large populat ion of cattle in India as compared to pigs may act as deterrent to the spread of JE infection, as the vector mosquito species have got more preference for cattle blood as compared to that of human beings. c)-Pigs : Infected pigs do not manifest many overt symptoms of the disease but allow multiplication and circulation of the virus in their blood. They are capable of infecting a large number of vector mosquito species, which in turn may transmit the virus to man after the completion of extrinsic incubation period of 9 -12 days. The pigs are thus considered to be \"amplifier hosts\" for the virus. Animal surveillance The purpose of animal surveillance is to track the rate of HI antibody carriers and the appearance of antibody from fresh infection as an index of JE viral activity and its spread in animal hosts. Objectives The objectives of Veterinary based surveillance are: Prevalence of Pigs/Ducks, Ardied Birds in an area To detect viral activity in susceptible hosts Procedures Veterinary -based surveillance can be conducted with the help of Animal Husbandry Department Assessment of pig density in relation to human habitation should be carried out. Density of other susceptible host population should also be carried out periodically. Sera sample from these ani mals should be randomly collected for serology to ascertain transmission of JE virus. As the pigs are amplifying host for JE virus, monitoring of antibody titre in pigs would be helpful in determining viral activity. Generally, 5 -8 months old piglets shoul d be selected and blood samples should be collected. The antibody titre in the serum samples should be estimated. Detection of IgM antibody would indicate recent infection. The area where HI antibody carrier pigs are high and IgM antibody is detected the a rea can be considered at risk of JE virus infection. Sera sample from pigs to be randomly collected for serology in collaboration with veterinary department to ascertain transmission of JE virus in pigs. The process of 30 collection of pig sera would be on re gular basis for generating regular data for early warning signals . Laboratory analysis of Sera samples Animal sera sample collection should be done with the help of Veterinary Department and screening for antibody carriers could be done by microbiology uni t of Veterinary Research Institutes having such facilities. Study of different strain of virus could be done with the help of NCDC, Delhi, National Institute of Virology, Pune and CRME, Madurai. Differential diagnosis Disease outbreaks in pigs is characte rized by abortions, fetal mummification or stillbirths, and encephalitis in pigs up to 6 months of age, or disease outbreaks in horses characterized by fever, jaundice or nervous signs of depression and in coordination or hyper -excitability should be consi dered as possible JE infections. As a part of the emergency response, any clinical disease in pigs and horses that may be JE should be investigated to establish the extent of infection. Isolation of virus should be attempted from suitable cases. Serology s hould be conducted on sick horses, with sera-sampling two weeks later to confirm antibody conversion to JE. Similar serological monitoring should be conducted in piggeries suspected of being infected. If it was desired to define free zones, the surveillanc e requirements to establish and maintain the zone will have to be developed at the time. Pigs would be the most sensitive sentinel animals, though because of operational difficulties, the existing arbovious surveillance programs (that do not use pigs) woul d need to be used.

Case Classification: Laboratory -Confirmed case : A suspected case with any one of the following markers: Presence of lgM antibody in serum and/ or CSF to a specific virus including JE/Entero Virus or others Four fold difference in lgG antibody titre in paired sera Virus isolation from brain tissue Antigen detection by immuno fluroscence Nucleic acid detection by PCR In the sentinel surveillance network, AES/JE will be diagnosed by lgM Capture ELISA, and virus isolation will be done in National Reference Laboratory. Probable Cases Suspected case in close geographic and tempo ral relationship to a laboratory - confirmed case of AES/JE in an outbreak Acute Encephalitis Syndrome due to other agent A suspected case in which diagnostic testing is performed and an etiological agent other than AES/JE is identified Acute Encephalitis Syndrome due to unknown agent A suspected case in which no diagnostic testing is performed / no etiological agent is identified / test results are indeterminate 32 MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ENCEPH ALITIS SYNDROME (AES) INCLUDING JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS One of the major components of the Programme Strategy is the case Management of the patients , most of whom are admitted in Health Inst itutions in a serious condition. This necessitated NVBDCP to de sign guidelines on Case Management of Japanese Encephalitis in 2007 wh ich can be accessed on the website. The evidence of circulation of entero -viruses in the community in Eastern UP was established by ICMR which prompted revision of above guidelines by incorporating the case management of other Encephalitis including JE. This revision was done in 2009 and the detailed guidelines are as follows: - Danger Sign & Line of Treatment Management of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome including Japanese Encephalitis is essentially symptomatic. To reduce severe morbidity and mortality, it i s important to identify early warning signs and refer patients to health facility and educate the health workers about the first line if management at the grassroots level. Chart 1 depicts what is to be done for a patient at the community level. Chart : Ma nagement of AES including Japanese Encephalitis At Community Level (PHC) Treatment Danger Sign Fever with any one of the following: Lethargy Unconsciousness Convulsions May be associated with other findings eg. Paralysis, rash, hepa tosplenomegaly Further Danger Sign TREATMENT REFERRAL TO NEAREST FIRST REFERRAL UNIT (FRU) Shock/ Hypotension/ Low BP/ Feeble Thready pulse Need of Ventilator - Poor respiratory efforts, cyanosis not managed by oxygen - I/V line - I/V fluids - Correction of Blood Sugar - Suction - Oxygen - I/V anti convulsant if convulsions are not controlled - Use of ambubag if necessary - Catheterization - Use of Mannitol - Inj. Paracetamol - Input/ output charting - Pulse, respiratory rate, temperature and B.P. moni toring Fever - Tap water vigrous sponging - Paracetamol Convulsions - Anti Convulsants Secretion - Suction Nil Orally Position of patient prone/Semi -prone with head on one side oxygen if possible. Refer to Tertiary Hospital 33 MANAGEMENT OF CASES OF AES INCLUDING JE Treatment at the health facility, it is important to exclude other causes of CNS affliction like meningitis or cerebral malaria which require specific treatment. Treatment will depend on the conditi on in which patient is received in the health facility. Since patients are likely to arrive with high grade fever and change in mental status or convulsions proceed with the assessment of patency of airway. The treatment at PHC/ CHC District level or at tertiary care hospitals remains the same. Depending upon the needs of care and availability of facilities available at the centre/ hospital the patients to be transferred to the nearest higher centre for further management. It should be ensured before tran sferring the case, all the available treatment is provided to the patient. Only needy patients where such facilities are not available, to be transported. The time consumed in transportation itself is a major cause of high mortality rate. In all endemic a reas, all the facilities including training can be arranged before hand except Ventilatory Support. All Centres should be equipped with ambu beg and oxygen in addition to other medicines and I/V cannula. The treatment of the patients may require, as follo w:- 1.) Management of Airways and Breathing. 2.) Management of Circulation. 3.) Control of Convulsion and Intracranial pressure 4.) Control of Temperature 5.) Fluid and Electrolytes and Calories/ Nutrition 6.) General management 7.) Specific treatment of any for treatable cause 8.) Investigations, Samples Collection & Transportation 9.) Reporting of a case 10.) Rehabilitation 34 MANAGEMENT OF AIRWAY AND BREATHING Assessment of Airway and Breathing Obstructed breathing / Severe respiratory distress Fig 1. Position of the Patient Turn the patient on the prone side to reduce risk of aspiration. Keep the neck slightly extended and stabilize by placing cheek on one hand. Bend one leg to stabi lize the body position. Indications of Ventilatory Support 1. Detoriating General Condition 2. Very Shallow Respiration/ Severe Respiratory Distress/ Heart Sound are Feeble 3. Capillary Refilling time/ colour of Patient Not Improved Clear Airways No oral feed Nurse in semi pron e and prone position Give Oxygen if needed Clear secretions from mouth Wiping oral cavity Suction of mouth turning head on one side Give Oxygen Ventilate with Bag and Mask / Endo Tracheal Tube if breathing is laboured.

CONTROL OF TEMPERATURE a) If No Rigors: - i. Tap Water Sponging: Not only on forehead, palms or soles, whole body to be wet with water and fan(ceiling/table/manual) is on. Cold sponging is harmful. ii. If temperature is too high - Cold Sponges may be kept on head, axilla and groins. iii. Injection Paracetamol: 5mg/kg, deep intra muscular at either lateral side of thigh or upper outer Quadrant of hip. If injection is not available give Pa racetamol 10 - 15mg/kg maximum upto 600 mg by Nasogastric tube. Paracetamol Suppository are also available which may be used. Other antipyretic medicines e.g. nemusulide/ brufen/ meftal/ aspirin etc are not advisable, specially in children. b) If chills or Rigors present : i. Don't cover patients ii. Don't do water sponging iii. Use Paracetamol injection, syrup, through nasogastric tube or Paracetamol suppository as advised above. MANAGEMENT OF FLUID ELECTROLYTES AND CALORIES/NUTRITION (A) Assessment of Dehydration Dehydration is classified into No/ some / Severe Dehydration. Since it is difficult to assess dehydration in a patient of encephalitis as the patient is lethargic and unable to drink, therefore, skin turgor takes precedence over other signs. An objective wa y of classification would be as follows: (i) Some Dehydration: Irritability Thirsty Sunken Eyes Less Tears Dry Mouth Skin Turgor Delay (ii) Severe Dehydration: Floppiness Drowsiness/ Lethargy Unconscious Inability to Drink 38 (iii) Signs of shock Oligu ria/ anuria Rapid and thready pulse Capillary filling time > 3secs Low Blood Pressure (B) Management of Dehydration: (a) Some Dehydration: IV fluid Ringer lactate/ N saline 100m/kg to be given over 8 hrs. Where the facility for IV fluids is not available administer ORS 75m/kg in 4 hrs through nasogasrtic tube Reassess: if there is improvement continue with maintenance IV fluid/if no improvement is detected, switch to plan for severe dehydration (b) Severe Dehydration IV fluid Ringer lactate 100ml/kg is g iven as per the table below Table 1: Rate of Fluid (Ringer Lactate) 30ml/kg 70ml/kg < 1yr 2 hrs 4 hrs >1yr 1 hrs 5 hrs Reassess: If there is improvement switch to maintenance/ if no improvement is detected or deterioration is observed infuse IV fluid more rapidly. (b) Maintenance Maintenance fluid is administered at the following rate Table 2: Weight Fluid Volume 1 - 10 10 ml / kg 11 - 20 1000 ml + 50cc/kg over & above 10 kg 21 - 40 1500 ml+20cc/kg over & above 10 kg (C) Calories/ Nutrition During CNS infections and convulsion and hyperphyrexia state, calories specially glucose required is increased and it should be given in form of 10% Dextrose or even 25% Dextrose may be given on arrival of the patient. A total dose of 200 mg/kg may be given. All I/V fluids with Dextrose should be continued till patient is stabilized, convulsions are controlled, no vomiting and distention of abdomen, at this time, intra gastric feeding may added and slowly I/V fluids are replaced by total nasogastric feeding. 39 GENERAL MANAGEMENT i. Suction : Frequent suction either by mucous sucker, or suction machine to be done on an unconscious patient, so secretion may not collect in mouth to avoid aspiration and maintenance the patency of airways. ii. Nasogastric Aspiration : Nil orally, place a Nasogastric/ Ryles tube into stomach and do a frequent suction to avoid any vomiting and aspiration. It will also help in decompensation of stomach and decrease intra abdominal pressure. It will help in respiration. iii. Care of Eye, Bowel Bl adder & Back : Eyes to be covered by wet gauge An antibiotic Eye ointment may be applied twice a day or liquid paraffin may be put in eyes to avoid drying of Cornea. If child does not pass stool, put a glycerine enema. Bed should be well maintained, don't allow to form any bed sore. Spirit & powder may be applied on back and on all pressure points. Frequent changing of patient's position. Catheterize the patient to avoid soiling of beds. Physiotherapy once patient is stabilized Other General Nursing Care Treat Secondary infections - by appropriate antibiotics Treat underlying other pathology - e .g. anemia, malnutrition, etc. TREATMENT OF SPECIFI C CAUSE IF ANY i. Herpes - Acyclovir - 10 mg/kg/dose, slowly over a period of one hour - 8 hourly X 21 days. ii. Zoste r Varicella - Acyclovir - 10mg/kg/dose, 1/2hrs slowly, over a period of 1 hour - 8 hourly X 2 -3 weeks. iii. Malaria - I/V Quinine - 20 mg/kg in 5% Dextrose slowly over a period of 1hr then 10mg/kg 8 hourly. Monitor Blood Sugar and Blood Pressure. iv.

REHABILITATION Physiotherapy/ PMR Advice of Pediatric Neurologist Correction to fix deformity - by Orthopaedic Sur geon Child Psychologist advice Various prosthesis Artificial appliances REPORTING OF A CASE It is very important to report all the suspected cases of AES or JE to the appropriate health authorities to prevent further spread of disease. It should be repor ted promptly in prescribe proforma. The details should be filled in clear and neat writing and all the information in the proforma should be provided. CLINICAL DIFFERENTIA TION OF JE FROM OTHE R VIRAL/BACTERIAL/ P ARASITIC INFECTIONS JE primarily involves t he gray matter of many parts of the Central Nervous System. Differentiation of Encephalitis and Encephalopathy and making a probable etiological diagnosis of Japanese Encephalitis and Epidemic Brain Attack in rural areas, (where facilities are minimum but expectations are maximum), on clinical grounds is extremely important to manage the encephalitis case not only as an individual but also for the community since the management of JE and EBA call for immediate reporting to the Health Authorities for a wider coordinated intervention by many different departments to contain the epidemic. Epidemics of Viral Encephalitis demand a clinical diagnosis about the causative Virus for controlling the epidemic at the earliest and for asking for the specific test. Simpl e clinical observations help in assessing the depth of coma, planning emergency measures necessary to save the child, limit disability, prognosticate and to initiate epidemic control measures. This must be followed by neurological examination for any localizing signs and to plan for the urgent investigations for a final diagnosis. 41 Exclusion of treatable conditions like Cerebral malaria, Epidemic Brain Attack, Tuberculous Meningitis is extremely important since they require prompt additional specific treatment. The therapy for JE/Epidemic Brain Attack is primarily conservative and supportive since there is no specific treatment for both Japanese Encephalitis and Epidemic Brain Attack, and both have a high case fatality rate, if prompt medical and nursing care is not provided. Analysis of fatal cases of JE/Epidemic Brain Attack revealed that ignorance is killing more children than the pathogen per se. Only 1 death out of every 35 deaths is directly due to JEV and all others are preventable with prompt and early management bringing down the USUALLY REPORTED case fata lity rate of JE from 35 -50% to less than 1%. Similar degree of lowering of morbidity is also possible. Same is the case with Epidemic Brain Attack also. The prognosis of JE depends on the extent of involvement at primar y presentation, timely management and autoimmune mechanisms of this disease. Japanese Encephalitis Case Definition : Suspected case for referral to Hospital: - i. Fever ii. Altered Sensorium Viral Encephalitis Syndromic Surveillance: Suspected JE Primary Criteria: i. Epidemic season ii. Acute Fever iii. Altered Sensorium lasting > 6 hours iv. No rash1 v. No evidence of any other encephalitis Supportive Criteria i. Focal Neurologic S/S ii. Endemic areas iii. JE Season iv. CSF consistent with Viral Enceph alitis v. Normal metabolic Profile Probable JE Encephalitis syndrome CSF consistent with Viral Encephalitis Elevated IgM antibody Stable antibody 42 Confirmed Case: Suspected case plus Any one or more of the following - JE IgM in CSF - Or 4 fold or greater rise o f antibody titers in paired sera (acute / convalescent) - Or detection of virus, antigen or genome in tissue, blood or other body fluids. Management in Tertiary Level Hospitals i. Hypoxia is alleviated by intubatio n, positive pressure ventilation, and ensuring an arterial Pao 2 of 65 mm Hg or better. ii. Hypotension is treated in a stepwise fashion by first volume infusion with isotonic fluids to normovolemia, next vasopressors and finally treatment is directed at reduci ng ICP in an effort to maintain CPP greater than 50. iii. Brainstem involvement may necessitate intubation & mechanical ventilation. iv. Cardiac arrest requires resuscitation measures. v. SIADH (Syndrome o f Inappropriate Anti Diuretic Hormone) is treated with Hypertonic saline. Role of I mmunoglobulins in Case M anagement of AES cases : The experts are of the opinion that IV immunoglobulin cannot be recommended for routine use in AES cases including JE in vi ew of the current scientific evidence. List of required equipments and drugs at various levels are enclosed at Annexure -16. 43 Chapter -3E Laboratory Network Laboratory based serological surveillance Sometimes, it may be difficult to differentiate Ja panese Encephalitis from those caused by other viruses, bacteria etc. as clinical signs of JE are indistinguishable from other causes of AES. Under such circumstances laboratory confirmation is essential for accurate diagnosis of JE. Confirmation of a susp ected or probable case of JE would require the support of a well equipped laboratory to test blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the same. For strengthening of JE sero - surveillance in the country following activities will be carried out: Laboratory c onfirmation of JE cases Collection, Storage and Transportation of samples to serology laboratories Establish a Net work of JE testing laboratories Establish Reporting system and ensure use of uniform formats Establish internal quality assurance in the labo ratory Laboratory confirmation of JE cases The fever and AES surveillance will capture any suspected JE cases which can be confirmed by laboratory tests as per the following markers: Presence of IgM antibody in serum and/or CSF Four fold differences in Ig G antibody titre in paired sera Virus isolation from brain tissue Antigen detection by immunofluoroscence Nuclic acid detection by PCR Laboratory confirmation of suspected JE cases would be carried out in the identified sentinel laboratories. At the labor atories the preferred test of JE diagnosis is the IgM Capture ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay). Internal quality control of JE tests would be assured in the laboratory. These laboratories may also do other investigations or send the specimens on to national levels as necessary. JE laboratories will also be included under the External Quality Assurance for laboratory services under NVBDCP. Specimen collection and transportation Blood (serum) and Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are the specimens to be col lected for JE diagnosis. Blood samples should be collected from suspected JE cases within 4 days 44 after the onset of illness for isolation of virus and at least 5 days after the onset of illness for detection of IgM antibodies. A second, convalescent sample s should be collected at least 10 -14 days after the first sample for serology. Patient information should be recorded as below on a laboratory request and report form (AES -5) that must accompany the specimen when it is referred to the laboratory: i) Name, ag e and sex of the patient. ii) Full Mailing Address. iii) Number of cases with similar illness in the locality/village/town. iv) Name and contact address of treating doctor. v) Brief clinical features with a special note on any asymmetry of clinical signs and symptoms. vi) Three dates are very important : Date of last JE vaccination; Date of onset of first symptom Date of collection of sample. vii) Label the vial with the patient's name, date of collection and specimen type. The specimens should be labeled with the number and this must be identical to the number given in the AESF -4. viii) In the case of an outbreak, a laboratory request and report form in the form of a line list may be prepared. Blood/Serum Equipment for collection of serum the following equipment, and blood collection k it would be required 5ml vacutainer tube(non -heparinized) with 23g blood collection tubes if syringe and needle is used for blood collection Disposable gloves and face mask (one set each) Tourniquet Sterilizing swabs Sterile serum storage Specimen labels, marker pen Band aid Zip lock plastic bags Lab request form Cold box(vaccine carrier) with ice packs First aid kit (Along with address of nearest referral facility in case of blood collecting complications). Collection procedure Collect 5ml blood by venepuncture in a sterile tube labeled with patient identification and collection date The blood should be kept at room temperature until there is complete retraction of the clot from the serum 45 Blood can be stored at +4o C to +8o C for up to 24hrs before the serum is separated Do not freeze whole blood There are 2 options available to ensure that the proper specimen reaches the lab Option 1 Transport whole clotted blood specimen to laboratory within 24 hours. Option 2 This could be centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10minutes to separate the serum If centrifuge is not available, carefully remove the serum using a pipette, avoid extracting red cells Transfer the serum aseptically to a sterile labeled vial Store the serum at +40C to +80C until transport to the laboratory Transportation of blood/serum specimens Specimens should be transported to the laboratory as soon as possible. Do not wait to collect additional specimens before transporting Place specimens in Zip lock or plastic bags and pack with absorbent material (cotton/tissue paper) Use a Thermos flask with ice or a vaccine carrier If using ice packs (should be frozen) and vaccine carrier, place frozen icepacks along the sides and place the samples in the center Place lab req uest form in plastic bag and tape to inner side of the Styrofoam bos/ vaccine carrier Arrange a transporting date When the arrangements have been finalized, inform the lab of the time and manner of transportation Serum should be shipped on wet ice within 4 8 hours or stored at +40C to +80C for a maximum period of 7 days In case a delay is anticipated, sera must be frozen at -200C and should be transported to the speci fied laboratory on frozen ice packs. Repeated freezing and thawing can have detrimental effects on the stability of IgM antibodies. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) CSF specimen would be collected in a sterile screw capped bottles under all aseptic precautions b y a trained person. The containers should be properly labeled and transported at the earliest to the designated laboratory. All attempts would be made to collect CSF sample for confirmation of diagnosis. 46 Collection procedure CSF is the fluid that bathes , cushions, and protects the brain and spinal cord. It flows through the skull and spine in the subarachnoid space, which is the area inside the arachnoid membrane. To obtain a specimen of cerebrospinal fluid the procedure is carried out by expert medical officer. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is the most common means of collecting a specimen of CSF. The patient is positioned on his side with his knees curled up to his abdomen and with chin tucked in to his chest. (Occasionally this procedure is performed wi th the person sitting and bent forward) The skin is scrubbed, and a local anesthetic is injected over the lower spine. The spinal needle is inserted, usually between the 3rd and 4th lumbar vertebrae. Once the needle is properly positioned in the sub -arachn oid space, pressures can be measured and fluid can be collected for testing After the sample is collected, the needle is removed the area is cleaned, and a bandage is applied The patient is asked to remain flat, or nearly flat, for 6 to 8 hours after the p rocedure. Overall, discomfort is minimal to moderate. The entire procedure usually takes about 30minutes, but it may take longer. The actual pressure measurements and fluid collection only takes a few minutes. Examination of CSF is an essential step in th e diagnosis of any patient with evidence of meningeal irritation or affected cerebrum. Approximate 2 -3ml of CSF is collected and part of it is used for physical and cytological, biochemical, and microscopic examination and the remaining CSF is to be stored aseptically for serology, viral culture, bacteriological or fungal examination. The following important precautions need to be taken for CSF collection and transportation: CSF is a precious specimen, handle it carefully and economically. It may not be possible to get a repeat specimen Collect CSF in a screw capped sterile container and not in an injection vial with cotton plug Do not delay transport and laboratory investigations Perform physical inspection immediately after collection and indicate finding s on laboratory requisition form Store at +40C, if delay in processing is inevitable. Storage and transport of CSF sample Place the specimens at +40C as soon as possible after collection. Dispatch these at the earliest possible opportunity on wet ice in a large thermos or an ice -box to the designated laboratory. Considering the emergency, preference should be given to hand carry the sample to the designated laboratory. Samples for PCR should be transported 47 on dry ice. A designated person (or persons) woul d be responsible for storage, packing and transport of samples according to national or international guidelines. Criteria for rejection of CSF/Serum samples Leakage of sample Haemolyzed sample Inadequate quantity Improperly cold chain maintenance during t ransportation Improperly labeled sample Samples collected in improper containers Turbid serum sample (contaminated) All laboratories would be classified in the following categories: i) District Sentinel Surveillance Laboratories The laboratory attached w ith hospitals or medical college will be a designated JE Sentinel Surveillance laboratory. Laboratory confirmation of suspected JE cases would be carried out in these identified sentinel laboratories. Directorate of NVBDCP envisages strengthening these lab oratories so that necessary equipment and testing kits are made available in a phased manner. Govt. of India would provide Mac ELISA test kits as well as ELISA Reader in places where such equipment is not available. Adequate training will be imparted to me dical and paramedical staff working in these laboratories. In the first phase, 50 sentinel surveillance laboratories have been identified. Subsequently, SSL at district level will be strengthened in all endemic districts in a phased manner. ii) National la boratories/Referral laboratories National laboratories such as NCDC, NIV, Pune, NIMHANS, Bangalore, etc. already exist in the country for diagnosis of JE cases and to investigate the viral strain of AES cases. Samples from any district sentinel laboratori es may be sent to these laboratories for detail analysis. Reporting All test results would be conveyed back to respective Sentinel Surveillance/Reporting Units Sites and to DMO in the form (AESF - 5) for planning and implementation of appropriate control m easures. All complied reports will be sent to SPO. Quality Assurance All the laboratories are to be accredited by WHO. This accreditation requires 100% proficiency score in test panels and a yearly on -site review by trained WHO virologists . The program mon itors the turn around time between specimen receipt in the laboratories and report for all laboratories in the network. 48 Sero - Surveillance in vaccinated Children Any case of post vaccinated effects like fever seizures etc. should be investigated for the vi rus strains to match the same with the vaccination strain or otherwise. For children vaccinated with JE vaccine within six months of illness onset, testing a single serum sample for JE IgM may not be diagnostic because it may diagnosis can only be confirme d by demonstrating JE IgM in the CSF, JE virus isolation, a positive nucleic acid amplification test, immuno histochemistry, IFA, or a four -fold or greater rise in antibody titre in acute and convalescent phase serum samples. 49 Chapter - 3F Paediatric Inten sive Care Unit Paediatric Intensive care unit (PICU) is a specific area of hospital where sophisticated monitoring, titrated life support, specific therapy and specialized nursing for potentially salvageable, critically ill paediatric patients with life threatening illness or injury, is provided. It is evident that AES/JE causes inflammation of brain coverings (Encephalitis) which in most of the cases results in temporary/permanent Neuro Muscular deficit. Such patients require more supportive/conservati ve treatment for a longer period PICU beds are occupied by patients with a wide range of clinical conditions but all have dysfunction or failure of one or more organs, particularly nervous system, respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Patients usually require intensive monitoring, and most need some form of mechanical or pharmacological support such as mechanical ventila tion, renal or vasoactive drugs. Adequate facilities at district hospitals are essential for better clinical management leading to imp roved survival of children affected by JE/AES. In order to achieve this objective, it has been decided to set up a well -equipped 10 - bedded intensive care unit (ICU) in district hospitals of 60 priority endemic district s. These PICUs will be well equipped with medical equipments like pediatric ventilator, defibrillator, bed side monitors, blood gas analyzer and syringe pumps. For the patients requiring continuous supply of O 2 there is provision of central gas supply (O2, compressed air, nitrous oxide and v acuum) in PICU.As encephalitis patient due to abnormal Intra cranial pressure requires closed monitoring of vital parameters like Blood Pressure, HR, RR and Temperature ,bed side monitors will be installed at each bed side. To have better view of all the p atients, the PICUs will have central monitoring station from where the clinical parameters of the patients can be accessed. Continuity and stability of nursing staff are of paramount importance in this area. Ideally the nurses posted in PICU should not be rotated too often and senior medical nursing staff should also take interest in checking their standard of competence and training them adequately. Depending upon the workload of that area the numbers of nurses should be decided. For day to day administr ative, technical control and for round the clock coverage of the ward, medical officer who should preferably have critical care background be appointed in the PICU. To keep abreast with the latest development in the field of medical technology hands on training and refresher training have been scheduled for the doctors and nursing staff. 50 Chapter - 3G Physical Medicine Rehabilitation Objective - Relevance of the Department Japanese Encephalitis/Acute Encephalitis Syndrome is one of the public health proble ms in the country because of the high case fatality rate which is about 30 % and residual neurological sequelae in 30 -40% of children who recover. Limited therapeutic options and lack of specific treatment for JE/AES, significantly contribute to the morbid ity and functional impairment. Rehabilitation has become an integral subspeciality in the health care system to cater to the needs of these patients. There is a 'felt need' since long to have rehabilitation specialists (Physiatrists) trained in assessment, quantification and management of disabilities occurring as a result of JE/AES. Further a separate department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation is the need of the hour in the Medical Colleges in high endemic States in the country, which will contribute in rehabilitation, capacity building and human resource development in the field of rehabilitation. Clinical Services The department, to begin with, should have one unit and should provide the following patient care services: Daily Out Patient Services: 9.00 AM onwards In Patient facility: 10 beds General Ward (Male): 5; General Ward (Female): 5; Therapy sections: A well equipped Physical, neurological and psychological therapy should provide daily services for patients Ideally the institute should have tie -up with centers with orthotic division (preferably part of the department), urologists and plastic surgeons for referrals, whenever necessary. Supportive services from allied specialties namely neurology, imaging, neurosurgery, psychiatry, speech and hearing, psychology and social work. Training/Academic programs: The department should have multi level teaching and training programs: Short term training program for medical from government medical colleges and district hospitals can be initiated. These physicians can visit the centers for a period of three to six months and acquire skill in recognition, evaluation and management of common disabling conditions. 51 Training program for other health professionals like Physical therapists, Occupational therapists, Psychologists, social works and community based health workers involved in rehabilitation. Infras tructure Space/ building Ward should preferably be on the ground floor with easy accessibility of ambulance, car trolley and wheel chair. A covered veranda, with steps, ramps are advisable. All clinical departments must be easily approachable. Ideally, it should be an independent wing of the hospital or an annex designed for wheel chair access. Wards with 10 beds (or more), each should be curtained f or privacy. Toilets should be 45cms High and extended 60 cms from wall. Rail on one side and a bar to hold on the other side. Wash basin should be hand operated with clear distance for wheel chair to slide underneath -at least 75cms. Bath should have a tele phone cord shower unit. Commode wheelchairs and shower curtains be provided. The building should provide the following area: Ward Out-patient department Physiotherapy section -Hall, office, store room Occupational therapy section -Hall, office store room Orthotic section (optional) Office for physicians ADL training room Adequate space for inpatient, outpatient and departmen t as per institute norms. List of Equipment/Furniture required has been given at Annexure - 17. Details of Manpower at Annexure -18 and TOR at Annexure -19 are given .
