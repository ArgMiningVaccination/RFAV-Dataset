For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment to yield a still further embodiment derived from the teaching of the disclosure. Thus, it is intended that the disclosure or content of the claims cover such derivative modifications and variations to come within the scope of the disclosure or claimed embodiments described herein and their equivalents. Additional objects and advantages of the disclosure will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the claims. The objects and advantages of the disclosure will be attained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations and variations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. The accompanying figures show schematic process flowcharts of preferred embodiments and variations thereof. A full and enabling disclosure of the content of the accompanying claims, including the best mode thereof to one of ordinary skill in the art, is set forth more particularly in the remainder of the specification, including reference to the accompanying figures showing how the preferred embodiments and other non-limiting variations of other embodiments described herein may be carried out in practice, in which: Step A involves feedstock mixing where feedstock may be mixed with one or more additives from the group consisting of water, minerals, vitamins, and polymer to form an enhanced feedstock. Additionally, other enhancers may be added to the feedstock such as niacin, taurine, glucuronic acid, citicoline, or insect growth hormones. Table 1 on Generally, a feedstock may be characterized as agriculture residue, alcohol production coproducts, animal waste, bio-waste, compost, crop residues, energy crops, fermentation waste, meat, insects, fermentative process wastes, food processing residues, food waste, garbage, industrial waste, livestock waste, municipal solid waste, plant matter, poultry wastes, rice straw, sewage, spent grain, spent microorganisms, urban waste, vegetative material, wood waste, cannabis, waste cannabis from the Farming Superstructure System, fish, fish that are fed the insects grown in the IPSS. Mixing of feedstock with additives or enhancers is discussed below in detail. Exact proportions of feedstock, additives, and enhancers may be precisely combined to form an enhanced feedstock that is suitable to grow insects in a manner that maximizes productivity, minimizes mortality, and maximizes animal welfare. It has been my realization that the enhanced feedstock mixtures, weigh ratios, proportions, ranges cited in Table 1 of It also has been my realization that the enhancers listed herein are those, when fed to insects, may then subsequently fed to humans as energy-Insects\u00ae, which are a specialized kind of edible insect that contains a dose of the stimulant caffeine, vitamins, and other functional ingredients. It has also been my realization that insects truly enjoy eating my inventive enhanced feedstock blend and it increases their quality of life. Although there is no evidence and no way of truly telling that insects have the cognitive ability to enjoy eating my proprietary enhanced feedstock blend, I certainly give them the benefit of the doubt. It has also been my realization that mixing water with the feedstock profoundly benefits insects since it elevates their well-being by making it impossible for them not to fear from expiration from respiratory impairment from being drowned in or under a liquid. It is the totality of the features of the present application that provide the maximum benefit to society. An enhanced feedstock transfer line (002) is discharged from feedstock mixing (step A) where it enters the feedstock splitting (step B). Step B feedstock splitting involves dividing the enhanced feedstock up into a plurality of enhanced feedstock steams. In embodiments, it may be advantageous to have a plurality of insect feeding chambers and only one feedstock mixing sequence step. This minimizes the capital intensity of the Insect Production Superstructure System (IPSS) to thus in turn permits a more lucrative return on investment (ROI). In some instances, Step B may not be required since only one feeding chamber is desired. A first enhanced feedstock transfer line (004) and a second enhanced feedstock transfer line (006) are discharged from feedstock splitting (Step B) and are routed to insect feeding chamber #1 (step C1) and insect feeding chamber #2 (step C2).

Herein are disclosed advancements and better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs in maximizing insect welfare, maximizing insect output on a minimal physical outlay, and benefit of large groups of people a high-value animal protein. Insect eggs are extracted from the plurality of breeding chambers and are provided to a breeding chamber where the eggs are incubated and hatched. Hatched insects are then provided to the plurality of insect feeding chambers (step C1 and C2) via a first feeding chamber hatched insect transfer line (024) and a second feeding chamber hatched insect transfer line (026), respectively. Thus, herein is disclosed a method to: (i) remove at least a portion of eggs laid by the egg-laying insects within the feeding chambers; (ii) incubate at least a portion of the removed eggs in a breeding chamber; (iii) hatch at least a portion of incubated eggs; and, (iv) introduce a portion of hatched insects back into the insect feeding chamber.

In embodiments, the backflush fluid pressure regulating valve (H59) may be adjusted to a pressure that is less than the rupture pressure of that of the filter element (H13). It is preferred to counter currently backflush the filter element (H13) by setting the pressure of the backflush fluid pressure regulating valve (H59) to a pressure of 0.25 PSI to 0.5 PSI; 0.5 PSI to 1.5 PSI; 1.5 PSI to 3 PSI; 3 PSI to 6 PSI; 6 PSI to 9 PSI; 9 PSI to 15 PSI. The best mode of operation for realizing a continuous filtrate stream depleted of exoskeleton and encompasses operating the filtration system in a manner which allows for periodic back flushing of the filter element cloth surface in-situ by providing a counter-current flow of backflush fluid to the filter element. The backwashing dislodges any accumulated exoskeleton, in the form of a filter cake, allowing it to sink to the bottom of the filter for removal of the system as a thick, paste-like, filter cake substance. It is preferred to utilize differential pressure across a filter bundle as the main variable to determine when to undergo a back-flushing cycle, as opposed to using manual predetermined periodic time duration intervals, or using the reduction in flow through the filter bundles as the variable dictating when to commence filter back flushing, (synonymously termed in-situ regeneration'). Filter element differential pressure between 0.25 and 15 PSI is commensurate with preferable cake thickness of 20 to 35 millimeters. In contrast, using manual predetermined periodic time duration intervals as the sole mechanism to determine when to commence filter cleaning, often results in operational impairment, in that 'cake bridging' more readily occurs. 'Cake bridging' may be described as a large mass of agglomerated exoskeleton suspended solids filling the spaces between the filter elements and thus posing a challenge to regenerate in-situ, frequently requiring process interruption for physical cleaning and removal of the heavy, gelatinous exoskeleton filter cake. In-situ filter cleaning may be accomplished by reversing the flow of liquid or gas through the filter element thereby dislodging exoskeleton filter cake from the cloth surface thus allowing it to sink to the bottom of the interior of the filter. This affords operations the luxury of minimizing losses of valuable solvent while draining the filter cake from the system.Filter Operating Procedure Herein is described the preferred operating procedure for continuous filtration of exoskeleton. Filtration [step 950] cooperates with the cyclic-batch filter [step 958]; filter cake discharge end [step 960]; and filtration restart preparation [step 962]. In step 950, (filtration), filtration proceeds and the filter pressure drop is monitored. As a filtration cycle progresses, solid exoskeleton particles are deposited onto the surface of the filter element and adhere to its surface until a nominal target differential pressure drop between around 0.25 to 15 PSI is attained, which is proportionate to a predetermined thickness of 20 to 35 millimeters. If the filter pressure drop is lower than the nominal target differential pressure drop, the filtering cycle continues until the nominal target differential pressure drop is reached. When a filter has reached its nominal target differential pressure drop, a filter cleaning cycle will commence, which begins with step 952 (filter bundle isolation). The sequential steps encompassing filtration and filter cleaning can be further illuminated by using When a nominal target pressure drop across a filter is attained, the exoskeleton filter cake material must be dislodged from the filter element, and thus step 952 (filter isolation) proceeds, which involves isolating the filter by closing the supply valve (H61) and discharge valve. Once both the supply valve (H61) and discharge valve are closed, to isolate the filter, step 954 may proceed. Step 954, (filtrate backflush), involves transferring a backflush fluid (liquid or gas) to backflush the filter. In embodiments, a typical backflush, in step 954, requires that the backflush fluid supply valve (H56) need be left open for a duration between: 5 seconds to 10 seconds; 10 seconds to 30 seconds; 30 seconds to 1 minute; 1 minute to 5 minutes; 5 minutes to 15 minutes; 15 minutes to 30 minutes; 30 minutes to 60 minutes; 60 minutes to 90 minutes. After the backflush fluid (H54) has been introduced to the filter, and once the backflush fluid supply valve (H56) has been returned to a closed position, step 956 may commence. Step 956 (exoskeleton filter cake sedimentation) entails allowing the dislodged exoskeleton filter cake solids to sink to the bottom of the filter. Step 958 (exoskeleton filter cake discharge start) involves opening the exoskeleton discharge valve (H51) to allow transference of an agglomerated exoskeleton particulate filter cake material from the system. The backflush fluid (H54) may be liquid or gas or a combination of both during Step 958. In embodiments, a gas may be used to dry the exoskeleton and then dislodge the dried exoskeleton from the surface of the filter element (H13). Step 960 (filter cake discharge end) entails closing the exoskeleton discharge valve (H51) since exoskeleton have been discharged from the system. After step 960 has transpired, step 962 (filtration restart preparation) may commence which entails opening the supply valve (H61) and discharge valve (H21) to again commence filtration on the regenerated filter bundle, thus allowing step 950 to commence again, then allowing the filtration and regeneration cycle to repeat itself.

A computer (COMP) may be programmed to control the operation of the insect evacuation module (3000) to be able to systematically apply a vacuum on any one separate or individually of either of the first feeding chamber (FC1), second feeding chamber (FC2), or third feeding chamber (FC3). The level of the vacuum by the insect evacuation fan (312) may vary. Alternatively, instead of a fan, a vacuum pump, steam jet ejector, pneumatic vacuum, eductor, or any conceivable vacuuming means to realize the end to pull a vacuum on any number of plurality of feeding chambers (FC1, FC2, FC3) at any given time may be used. At times, it is important to be able to only draw a vacuum on only one of the feeding chambers at any given time depending upon how far along in the insect growth stage any given feeding chamber (FC1, FC2, FC3) is at. For example, by measuring the pressure drop across each of the network of cells contained within any given feeding chamber (FC1, FC2, FC3), it may be determined that it is desirable to only evacuated the insects from say, for example, feeding chamber 1 (FC1) while leaving the other two feeding chambers (FC2, FC3) to remain unchanged to promote stable insect growth. To achieve this end, the computer (COMP) will send a signal (XV1) to only the feeding chamber 1 evacuation valve (VV1) on the first feeding chamber (FC1) to evacuate the contents therein. A common insect evacuation pressure sensor (PT10) is installed on the common entry conduit (CEC), or alternatively may be installed on any plurality number of separators (S1, S1, S3). The common insect evacuation pressure sensor (PT10) is configured to input a signal (XT10) to the computer (COMP). A common insect evacuation vent line (VRL) is connected at one end to the common entry conduit (CEC) and connected at another end to a header vacuum vent valve (VV0). The header vacuum vent valve (VV0) is interposed on the common insect evacuation vent line (VRL) and is in fluid communication with both the insect evacuation fan (312) and each one of the plurality of insect feeding chambers (FC1, FC2, FC3). The header vacuum vent valve (VV0) is equipped with a controller (CV0) that is configured to input and output a signal (XV0) to the computer (COMP). At least one common insect evacuation line reducer (VR0) is interposed on the common insect evacuation vent line (VRL). The header vacuum vent valve (VV0) is configured to be able to control the level of vacuum pulled on a feeding chamber (FC1, FC2, FC3). In the event that a deep vacuum needs to be pulled to evacuate a feeding chamber that has reached its maximum or desired insect capacity, the header vacuum vent valve (VV0) may be operatively included in a control loop while integrated with (i) the common insect evacuation pressure sensor (PT10), and (ii) the controller (316) of the fan motor (314) of the insect evacuation fan (312). For example, if a deep vacuum needs to be pulled on, say feeding chamber 1 (FC1), while leaving the other feeding chambers unchanged, the header vacuum vent valve (VV0) may remain in the closed position to permit the insect evacuation fan (312) to completely draw down the pressure in the feeding chamber 1 (FC1) to pull an insect and gas mixture having an insect portion and a gas portion through the first feeding chamber insect evacuation output (205A) and common entry conduit (CEC). If the header vacuum vent valve (VV0) is then opened, or modulated, by any given percentage, it will increase the gas portion of the insect and gas mixture flowing into the separator (300) and thus increase the pressure in the feeding chamber (FC1) since not as deep of a vacuum will be pulled on the feeding chamber (FC1). A header vacuum vent valve (VV0) may be able to aide in the separation of insects and gas within any plurality of separators (S1, S2, S3) contained within the insect evacuation module (3000) by providing a predictable and consistent inlet velocity at the inlet of any number of any give plurality of separators (S1, S2, S3). In embodiments, the egg-laying insects may be evacuated from any plurality of feeding chambers (FC1, FC2, FC3) by applying a vacuum with a velocity pressure range from: between about 0.001 inches of water to about 0.002 inches of water; between about 0.002 inches of water to about 0.003 inches of water; between about 0.003 inches of water to about 0.006 inches of water; between about 0.006 inches of water to about 0.012 inches of water; between about 0.012 inches of water to about 0.024 inches of water; between about 0.024 inches of water to about 0.050 inches of water; between about 0.050 inches of water to about 0.075 inches of water; between about 0.075 inches of water to about 0.150 inches of water; between about 0.150 inches of water to about 0.300 inches of water; between about 0.300 inches of water to about 0.450 inches of water; between about 0.450 inches of water to about 0.473 inches of water; between about 0.473 inches of water to about 0.496 inches of water; between about 0.496 inches of water to about 0.521 inches of water; between about 0.521 inches of water to about 0.547 inches of water; between about 0.547 inches of water to about 0.574 inches of water; between about 0.574 inches of water to about 0.603 inches of water; between about 0.603 inches of water to about 0.633 inches of water; between about 0.633 inches of water to about 0.665 inches of water; between about 0.665 inches of water to about 0.698 inches of water; between about 0.698 inches of water to about 0.733 inches of water; between about 0.733 inches of water to about 0.770 inches of water; between about 0.770 inches of water to about 0.808 inches of water; between about 0.808 inches of water to about 0.849 inches of water; between about 0.849 inches of water to about 0.891 inches of water; between about 0.891 inches of water to about 0.936 inches of water; between about 0.936 inches of water to about 0.982 inches of water; between about 0.982 inches of water to about 1.031 inches of water; between about 1.031 inches of water to about 1.083 inches of water; between about 1.083 inches of water to about 1.137 inches of water; between about 1.137 inches of water to about 1.194 inches of water; between about 1.194 inches of water to about 1.254 inches of water; between about 1.254 inches of water to about 1.316 inches of water; between about 1.316 inches of water to about 1.382 inches of water; between about 1.382 inches of water to about 1.451 inches of water; between about 1.451 inches of water to about 1.524 inches of water; between about 1.524 inches of water to about 2.286 inches of water; between about 2.286 inches of water to about 3.429 inches of water; between about 3.429 inches of water to about 5.143 inches of water; between about 5.143 inches of water to about 7.715 inches of water; between about 7.715 inches of water to about 11.572 inches of water; between about 11.572 inches of water to about 17.358 inches of water; between about 17.358 inches of water to about 26.037 inches of water; between about 26.037 inches of water to about 39.055 inches of water; between about 39.055 inches of water to about 58.582 inches of water; between about 58.582 inches of water to about 87.873 inches of water; between about 87.873 inches of water to about 131.810 inches of water; between about 131.810 inches of water to about 197.715 inches of water; between about 197.715 inches of water to about 296.573 inches of water; or, between about 296.573 inches of water to about 400 inches of water.

In embodiments, the mosquitos include genetically modified mosquitos to assist in insect control and prevent the spread diseases like Zika and dengue fever. In embodiments, the mosquitos include a naturally-occurring bacteria called Wolbachia which makes them unable to have offspring with wild female mosquitoes. In embodiments, Wolbachia is a genus of gram-negative bacteria that infects arthropod species, including a high proportion of insects, and also some nematodes. For example, the genetically modified mosquitos include may include Oxitec created genetically altered males of the species (OX513A) that produce the protein tTA, which negatively affects cell development. The transgenic animals need the antibiotic tetracycline to survive. If these animals are released in large numbers and mate with females, antibiotic dependence is passed to the next generation and the offspring die. Thus, the Aedes aegypti population is greatly reduced and thereby the risk for the people in that region of contracting a mosquito-born disease. In embodiments, the genetically modified mosquitos include Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus. In embodiments, the insects are genetically modified. In embodiments, the insects are transgenic animals. In embodiments, the predatory mites are transgenic animals. In embodiments, the bats are transgenic animals. In embodiments, the insects are genetically modified organisms (transgenic organisms). In embodiments, the genetically modified organisms are used as a method of biological insect control (a sterile insect technique) whereby overwhelming numbers of sterile insects are released into the wild. The released insects are preferably male, as this is more cost-effective and the females may in some situations cause damage by laying eggs in the crop, or, in the case of mosquitoes, taking blood from humans. The sterile males compete with wild males to mate with the females. Females that mate with a sterile male produce no offspring, thus reducing the next generation's population. Sterile insects are not self-replicating and, therefore, cannot become established in the environment. Repeated release of sterile males over low population densities can further reduce and in cases of isolation eliminate pest populations, although cost-effective control with dense target populations is subjected to population suppression prior to the release of the sterile males.

In embodiments, the first adsorber system (SMB1) is configured to input a filtered and pressurized crude cannabinoid extract (HCM) and a first desorbent (HDC). In embodiments, the first adsorber system (SMB1) is configured to output a first extract (HDA) and a first raffinate (HDE). In embodiments, the first extract (HDA) can also be called a primary extract (HDB). In embodiments, the first adsorber system (SMB1) includes an adsorber or plurality of adsorbers containing an adsorbent. In embodiments, the first adsorber system (SMB1) includes a plurality of adsorbers containing adsorbent is provided and may be called the stationary phase. In embodiments, the adsorbent positioned within the adsorber or plurality of adsorbers may be called the stationary phase. The bed of adsorbent that is contained within the adsorber does not move so therefore it is stationary. The plurality of beds of adsorbent that are contained within the plurality of adsorbers does not move so therefore it is stationary. In embodiments, at least a portion of cannabis is dissolved in a solvent (e.g.\u2014the filtered and pressurized crude cannabinoid extract (HCM)) and may be called the mobile phase. In embodiments, a first adsorber system (SMB1) operates as a simulated moving bed chromatography (SMB chromatography) which is a continuous process. This is implemented by arranging several preparative columns connected in series and periodically changing the valve setting so that a movement of the solid phase in the opposite direction of the flow of the liquid phase is simulated. In embodiments, the system is continuously fed with a feed mixture (e.g.\u2014the filtered and pressurized crude cannabinoid extract (HCM)) comprising the compounds to be separated and an eluent (e.g.\u2014the first desorbent (HDC) which is a liquid, water, treated water, or a solvent) while a raffinate and an extract are continuously withdrawn from the system. In embodiments, the first adsorber system (SMB1) periodically switches the feed, eluent, extract and raffinate ports in the same direction. The basic premise of a simulated moving bed adsorber system is that the inlet and outlet ports are switched periodically in the direction of the fluid flow. This simulates the countercurrent movement of the phase in the process. Chromatography is a technique used to separate mixtures. In embodiments, the mixture may include cannabinoids and a solvent. In embodiments, the mixture may include a filtered and pressurized crude cannabinoid extract (HCM). In embodiments, the mixture may include cannabinoids from a first solvent and volatiles mixture (FSVM). In embodiments, the mixture may include cannabinoids from a second volatiles in a liquid solvent. The mixture of cannabinoids and the solvent may be called the mobile phase. The mobile phase is passed through an adsorber containing an adsorbent, the adsorbent within the adsorber may be called a stationary phase. In embodiments, a moving bed adsorber may be used in which the stationary phase would then move. The mixture of cannabinoids and solvent are introduced into the adsorber and various constituents of the mixture travel at different speeds, causing them to separate. The separation is based on differential partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases. More than one adsorber may be used so there may be various stationary phases. Subtle differences in each of the cannabinoids' partition coefficient result in differential retention on the stationary phase and thus affect the separation. For example, some cannabinoids are more hydrophilic than others and are mode readily soluble in a solvent such as lipids and alcohol. These compounds in turn have a relatively larger partition coefficient than the cannabinoids that are less hydrophilic. In embodiments, a relatively less hydrophilic cannabinoid has a greater partition coefficient than a cannabinoid that is more hydrophilic. In embodiments, a relatively more hydrophobic cannabinoid has a greater partition coefficient than a cannabinoid that is less hydrophilic. In other embodiments, a relatively less hydrophilic cannabinoid has a greater partition coefficient than a cannabinoid that is more hydrophilic. In other embodiments, a relatively more hydrophilic cannabinoid has a lesser partition coefficient than a cannabinoid that is lesser hydrophilic. In embodiments, tetrahydrocannabinol has a partition coefficient of 6.99. In embodiments, 9-tetrahydrocannabinol 9-THC has a partition coefficient of 6.99. In embodiments, cannabidiol has a partition coefficient of 5.79. In embodiments, tetrahydrocannabinol has a partition coefficient that is greater than cannabidiol. In embodiments, tetrahydrocannabinol is more hydrophobic than cannabidiol. cannabidiol is more hydrophilic than tetrahydrocannabinol. Since tetrahydrocannabinol has a partition coefficient that is greater than cannabidiol, it will stay in the bed longer than the cannabidiol. In embodiments, the tetrahydrocannabinol will stay in the adsorber bed longer than the cannabidiol. In embodiments, the cannabidiol will stay in the adsorber bed longer than the tetrahydrocannabinol. In embodiments, the tetrahydrocannabinol will elute before the cannabidiol will elute before the tetrahydrocannabinol.

The claims and specification are in conformity with 37 CFR 1.163, this specification and especially claimed ranges of elements (a) through (x) and other elements of the claims contain as full and complete a disclosure as possible of the plant and the characteristics thereof that distinguish the same over related known varieties, and its antecedents, and particularly point out where and in what manner the variety of plant has been asexually reproduced. Further, in the case of this newly found plant, this specification particularly points out the location and character of the area where the plant was discovered. Applicant is based out of Baltimore, Md., 21202. The claims and specification are in conformity with 35 U.S.C. 112(a), since this specification and especially claimed ranges of elements (a) through (x) and other elements of the claims contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor or joint inventor of carrying out the invention. Complete botanical description and the characteristics which distinguish over related known varieties are herein provided. The new variety differs from parents and related (similar) cultivars of Cannabis sativa L. ssp. Sativa and Cannabis sativa L. ssp. Indica (Lam.). The new variety differs from parents and related (similar) cultivars because DANLEO III has a precise and unique engineered concentrations of: cannabidiol, tetrahydrocannabinol, energy, carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, ash, volatiles, nitrogen, sulfur, chlorine, sodium, potassium, iron, magnesium, phosphorous, calcium, zinc, cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose, fat, fiber, protein, as well as specific L. ssp. Sativa and Cannabis sativa L. ssp. Indica (Lam.) contents and ratios. The new plant differs from its parents and related cultivars because it is engineered to more effectively alleviate inflammation, manage pain, treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and digestive disorders, while also helping to prevent sleep disorders. It provides adequate stimulant to cure attention deficit disorder but does not so act as such a stimulating drug to prevent normal sleep, dietary, and exercise patterns. Because of this remarkable new plant, and combination of ingredients, individuals seeking to medicate with tetrahydrocannabinol can now use this plant as medicine while having little-to-no side effects at all whatsoever and at a very low dosage compared to its parents and related cultivars. Applicant has specifically identified the characteristic of improved medicinal benefits through extensive trial and error and has a claim which is the result of quantifiable, experimental, and empirical data characterizing the difference between DANLEO and Sativa or L. ssp. (Lam.) alone. Most importantly, DANLEO III possesses a volatiles content ranging from between 30 weight percent to 90 weight percent, and a Cannabis sativa L. ssp. Sativa content ranges from 20 weight percent to 70 weight percent, and a Cannabis sativa L. ssp. Indica (Lam.) content ranges from 15 weight percent to 65 weight percent. Whereas the patents and cultivars possess 100 weight percent of each of Cannabis sativa L. ssp. Sativa content and a Cannabis sativa L. ssp. Indica (Lam.), applicant's research and development has resulted in a new and distinct plant that has an engineered amount of volatiles while mixing Cannabis sativa L. ssp. Sativa content and a Cannabis sativa L. ssp. Indica (Lam.) at varying ratios to achieve a preferred cannabidiol content ranging from 0.125 weight percent to 25 weight percent. Applicant has realized that the tetrahydrocannabinol content ranging from 5 weight percent to 63 weight percent is specifically tailored to maximize dosage while having a volatiles content ranging from between 30 weight percent to 90 weight percent. The combination of DANLEO III having a volatiles content ranging from between 30 weight percent to 90 weight percent together with the tetrahydrocannabinol content ranging from 5 weight percent to 63 weight percent provides a remarkable new plant. Because of this, a user can use less of the plant to achieve the required dosage. The application conforms to 37 CFR 1.163(a) since the specification particularly points out that Applicant is based out of Baltimore, Md., USA in zip code 21202 which was the location that Applicant realized that he can take stem cuttings and asexually reproduce plants in a manner disclosed in this specification. This disclosure conforms to 37 CFR 1.163(a) since the specification particularly points out that Baltimore, Md., USA in zip code 21202, indoor propagation, growing, and cultivation were the location and character of the area where the plant was discovered. Applicant has generated the ranges of claimed ranges of elements (a) through (x) were discovered through comprehensive compositional analysis, particle-induced X-ray emission analysis, elemental analysis, proximate analysis, and ultimate analysis immediately available from a variety of different laboratories in the USA. Obtaining the appropriate ranges of varying concentrations of Cannabis sativa L. ssp. Sativa and Cannabis sativa L. ssp. Indica (Lam.) were performed on a trial and error basis. The tetrahydrocannabinol concentration is provided as a measurement of DANLEO III's leaves, seeds, stems, roots, or any reproductive structures on a dry basis. The age and growing conditions of this plant shown in The parents of the instant plant are known and are comprised of Cannabis sativa L. ssp. Sativa\u00d7Cannabis sativa L. ssp. Indica (Lam.). Seeds from either are commercially available from many vendors throughout the USA. Applicant devised various plant hybrids of Cannabis sativa L. ssp. Sativa\u00d7Cannabis sativa L. ssp. Indica (Lam.) to create a plant best suited to accommodate industrial, commercial, recreation and medicinal popular demand. The idea of a superior and precisely engineered composition that embodies DANLEO III as described and disclosed herein was discovered by the applicant's in his garden where the inventor was asexually reproducing and cultivating many plants, in many different containers, of many different species. Applicant's work with plants has resulted in the discovery of a cross between Cannabis sativa L. ssp. Sativa\u00d7Cannabis sativa L. ssp. Indica (Lam.) described herein. Applicant has discovered that DANLEO III can be reproduced asexually, by taking cuttings of the plants of origin resulting in a remarkable new plant.
