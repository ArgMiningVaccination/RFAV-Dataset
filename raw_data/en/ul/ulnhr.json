Find out why a Whole Body Cleanse & Spiritual Detox may be just the right tool to clear body, mind & spirit and awaken to a rejuvenated YOU!", "sitename": "Sedona Yoga Festival", "date": "2016-11-17", "cleaned_text": "Sometimes we feel stuck... Lord knows I have! It seems it is an inevitable aspect of the Spiritual Journey and the whole body cleanse & spiritual detox is a good way through. Often I have found myself in troubled times, wondering why everything seems to be held in suspended animation while my heart & soul quietly continue to keep my attention on what is really going on. Trust me... the awful chatter that can arise in our minds, often self-directed negative talk, is an incredibly destructive force. It is what prevents most of us from stepping into a deeply authentic place, sidelining ourselves from life... stuck. It doesn't feel good. It doesn't feel right, and yet, stuck is the harbinger of greatness! Consciousness is always evolving, and aligned with it, we, too are always expanding. We just need to keep up... and I believe when we feel stuck, it is merely a clear sign that we are not keeping up. So, here's the cool thing... the Spiritual Journey is all about noticing the signs, right? Then we can respond to them in a manner that allows unimpeded growth in all areas of your life... physical, emotional, energetic and spiritual. However, it does take some personal discipline and desire to move forward... to get unstuck. It feels good to be in the flow, we all know it... have all been there at least a few times, albeit, often unawares of how we got there, yet undeniably so, it feels really good! You know it, deep in your body, the only way out of those heavy sensations and experiences is through... Spiritual Detox & Whole Body Cleanse - a way to the light... [Think about it... how it feels. Heavy right? Dense... Dark. These are and so many more words can describe the feelings we have when we are stuck. So, logically, it would make sense that if we got \"lighter\" ourselves something might shift. Yes? I thought so... and every time I have undertaken either a spiritual detox or whole body cleanse (often together), I have experienced a lighter & brighter state of being. Much more peace, clarity, balance, harmony, serenity... downright goodness has followed.](https://www.aumbasesedona.com/event/total-yoga-detox-luke-ketterhagen/?instance_id=1574) It's a pretty simple formula really, cleanse the body, mind & spirit... inside and out. Ten days is pretty standard, although I have experimented with a variety of lengths of time and have somewhat concluded that your body will tell you when you are done. It's all about cultivating a greater intimacy with yourself, being able to filter out what is not you, to find you; that quiet whisper, always guiding us, always present. Often we can't hear it over the cacophony of distractions our senses report. Our bodies, minds and spirits are polluted with so many toxins from every day western life that it is near impossible to feel into our intuition, or get in the flow. If this is your first Spiritual Detox or whole body cleanse, commit to at least 10 to 14 days. (there is something deeply profound about a 40-day experience... let me know in the comments below if you would like to know more about that.) There can be no other outcome than transformation, if one commits. No other possibility than to know the lightness of being or effortless ease possible to every human being. The Spiritual Detox & Whole Body Cleanse can be as simple as switching to a mono-diet with only organic, non-gmo ingredients and turning off the tv (particularly the news and social media) to sophisticated ancient protocols, practices and treatments all aimed at purifying the body and mind. As body/mind become pure, our energy increases, as does our ability to move energy through the more subtler aspects of our being. We become clear. Who doesn't want clarity these days, right!!?? Stay tuned, as we explore this topic further in future posts... The holidays are a good time to begin practicing some mindfulness and create an awareness around your own personal situation. Often the stresses pile up during the holidays and we find our selves exhausted and strained in the new year. Let's prevent that from happening this year! We know this time of year can be challenging, so go easy on yourself and plan a post holiday getaway where you can experience your own Spiritual Detox and whole body cleanse. Supercharge your New Year with a New YOU! Make life epic... because "}
