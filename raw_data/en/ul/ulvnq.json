The present invention also relates to methods of making cell-binding agent-drug (cytotoxic agent) conjugates in a specific manner modifica \u00ad tion of drugs with these linkers first, followed by reaction with prepared cell-binding agents; or modification of cell-binding agents with these linkers first, followed by reaction with drugs. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The big challenge of chemotherapeutic drugs is their narrow therapeutic windows due to they normally cannot discriminate between normal and malignant cells, thus causes side effects which limit the tolerated doses below the clinically effective ones. In contrast, immunotherapy, normally in the form of monoclonal antibodies (mAh) can specifically bind to certain proteins or molecules of malignant cells, leaving normal cells unharmed, and thus has less side effects and bigger therapeutic windows than chemotherapy. Mono\u00ad clonal antibodies (mAb) can target against malignant cells by several mechanisms, such as, I). Making the cancer cell more visible to the immune system (Villaruz, L. C. et al, 2014, Transl Lung Cancer Res, 3, 2-14; Camacho, L. H. 2015 Cancer Med 4, 661-72); 2). Block\u00ad ing growth signals (Dillman, R. O. 2011, Cancer Biother Radiopharm, 26, 1-64; Ferris, R. L. et al 2010, J Clin Oncol, 28, 4390-9); 3). Stopping new blood vessels from forming (Arrillaga-Romany, I., et al, 2014, Expert Opin Investig Drugs, 23, 199-210); 4). Deliver \u00ad ing radiation to cancer cells (Chapuy, B. et al, 2007, Biotechnol J. 2, 1435-43); 5). Deliver \u00ad ing chemotherapy drug to cancer cells (Chari R. J. 2008 Acc Chem Res. 41, 98-107; Mullard A. 2013, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 12, 329-332; Zhao, R. J. 2012, J. Med. Chem., 55, 766-782 ); 6). Delivering enzyme to cancer cells (Francis R. J. et al, 2002, Br. J Cancer 87, 600-7). One of these above strategies, delivering chemotherapy to cancer cells called antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), which enables to target and deliver drugs to cancer cells leaving normal cells largely unaffected by the exquisite targeting ability of antibodies, has been intensely exploitation in the last two decades. In particular, since US FDA approvals of Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin) in 2011 and Kadcyla (ado-trastuzumab 15 20 25 30WO 2015/155753 PCT/IB2015/056083 emtansine) in 2013, the applications of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) as a promise targeted treatment of cancers have been exploded and almost every major pharmaceutical and biotech company has adopted this approach (Chari, R. et al, Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 3796-3827; Sievers, E. L. et al. Annu Rev Med. 2013, 64, 15-29; Mehrling, T. Future Oncol, 2015, 11, 549). Currently there are more than 50 ADC drugs in the clinic trials according to www.clinictrails.gov . The first-generation ADCs, including Kadcyla interchain an anti\u00ad body respectively to a cytotoxic drug. Since there are over 50 surface-exposed lysines and 8 hinge cysteine residues in IgGl antibodies, this nonselective conjugation results in randomly cross-linkage of cytotoxic drugs to practically all areas of the antibody molecule, particularly having a diverse population of ADCs with a wide distribution of drugs per antibody (DAR) (Wang, L., et al. 2005 Protein Sci. 14, 2436; Hamblett, K. J., et al. 2004 Clin. Cancer Res. 10, 7063). Thus some of the undesired ADC subpopulation could lead to shorter circulation half-life, lower efficacy, potentially increased off-target toxicity and a wide range of in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) properties (Hamblett, K. J. et al, Clin. Cancer Res. 2004, 10, 7063-7070; Adem, Y. T. et al, Bioconjugate Chem. 2014, 25, 656-664; Boylan, N. J. Bioconjugate Chem., 2013, 24, 1008-1016; Strop, P., et al 2013 Chem. Biol. 20, 161-167). In addition, with this classical conjugation, the batch-to-batch consistency in ADC production can be challenging and may require diligent manufactur\u00ad ing capabilities (Wakankar, A. mAbs, 2011, 3, 161-172). Therefore, biotechnology companies and academic institutions are highly focusing on establishing novel reliable methods for site-specific ADC conjugation. So far, there are several approaches developed in recent years for site selective ADC preparation (Panowski, S, 2014, mAbs 6, 34). They include incorporation of unpaired cysteines, e.g. engineered reactive cysteine residues, called THIOMAB from Genentech (Junutula, J. R., et al 2010 Clin. Cancer Res. 16, 4769; Junutula, J. R., et al 2008 Nat (Strop, P., Bioconjugate Chem., 2014, 25, 855-862; Strop, P., et al., 2013, Chem. Biol. 20, 161-167; US Patent 8,871,908 for Rinat-Pfizer) or transglutaminase (Dennler, P., Bioconjug. 569-578. US pat appl 20130189287 for Innate Pharma; US for Bio-Ker S.r.l. (IT)), incorporation of thiolfucose (Okeley, N. M., et al 2013 Bioconjugate Chem. 24, 1650), incorporation of 2 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/155753 PCT/IB2015/056083 unnatural amino acids Proc. Natl. Zimmerman, E.S., et ah, 2014, Bioconjug. Chem. 25, 351-361; Wu, P., et al, 2009 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 106, 3000-3005; Rabuka, D., Protoc . Pattent for Allozyne), Incorporation of selenocysteine into antibodies (Hofer, T., et al 2009, Biochemistry 48, 12047-12057; US Patent 8,916,159 for US National Cancer Institute), Convertion of cysteines located in the CXPXR consensus sequence to formylglycine (FGly) with formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) (Drake, P.M., et al., 2014, Bioconjug. Chem. 25, 1331-1341. Carrico, I. S. et and through glycoengineeringly introduction sialic acid with the use of galactosyl- and sialytransferases (Zhou, Q., et al 2014, Bioconjug. Chem., 25, 510-520, US Pat Appl 20140294867 for Sanofi- These above methods have produced nearly homoge \u00ad neous product profiles, but they are required antibody-engineering processes and reoptimization of cell culture conditions. Moreover, expression yields for genetic encoding of an unnatural amino acid were typically not promisingly high enough (Tran, F., et al, 2014, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. Ill, 1766-71) which has a significant impact on the cost of goods of the ADC. In addition, it has been known that ADCs obtained by conjuga\u00ad tion to cysteine side chains often display limited stability in circulation, leading to prema \u00ad ture disconnection of the cytotoxic payload before the tumor site is reached (Junutula, J. R., et al 2008, Nat. Biotechnol. 26, 925-32). The disulfide bond structures of the four subclasses of IgG antibodies were known in the 1960s (Milstein C. Biochem J 1966, 101:338 - 351; Pink JR, Milstein C. Nature 1967, 214:92-94; Frangione B, Milstein C. Nature 1967, 216:939 - JR, Milstein C. Nature 1967, 216:941 -942; Frangione et J et al Biochemistry, 1975, 10, 2157-63 ). Disulfide bond structure is critical for the structure, stability, and biological functions of IgG molecules. Among the four subclasses of IgG antibodies, IgGi, IgG2, IgG 3 and of 12 intra-chain disulfide bonds; each disulfide bond is associated with an individual IgG domain. The two heavy chains are connected in the hinge region by a variable number of disulfide bonds: 2 for 3 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/155753 PCT/IB2015/056083 IgGi and IgGzj, 4 for IgG 2 and 11 for IgG3. The light chain of the IgGi is connected to the heavy chain by a disulfide bond between the last cysteine residue of the light chain and the fifth cysteine residue of the heavy chain. But, for IgG2, IgG 3 and IgGzj, the light chain is linked to the heavy chain by a disulfide bond between the last cysteine residue of the light chain and the third cysteine residue of the heavy chain (Liu, H. and May, K., 2012, mAbs 4, 17-23). On the ranks of the susceptibility of disulfide bonds in human IgGl antibodies by experimental reduction, differential alkylation, and LC-MS analysis (Liu, H, et al Anal. Chem., 2010, 82, 5219-5226), inter chain disulfide bonds are more susceptible to reduc \u00ad tion than intra chain disulfide bonds, and the disulfide bonds between the light chain and heavy chain were more susceptible than disulfide bonds between the two heavy chains. The upper disulfide bond of the two inter heavy chain disulfide bonds was more suscepti\u00ad ble than the lower one. Furthermore, disulfide bonds in the CH2 domain were the most susceptible to reduction. Disulfide bonds in VL, CL, VH, and CHl domains had similar and moderate susceptibility, while disulfide bonds in the CH3 domain were the least susceptible to reduction (Liu, H, et al Anal. Chem., 2010, 82, 5219-5226). Based on the more susceptibility of inter chain disulfide bonds in human IgGl anti\u00ad bodies, several institutions and companies adopted the chemically specific conjugation strategy through rebridging reduced interchain disulfide bonds of a native antibody, such as, using bromo or dibromo-maleimides, called next generation maleimides (NGMs) (Schumacher, F.F., et al 2014, Org. Biomol. Chem. 12, 7261-7269; UCL Cancer Institute), applying bis-alkylating reagents via a three-carbon bridge (Badescu, G., et Bioconjug. Chem. WO2013/190272, WO2014/064424 for 2015/0105539 through di-maleimide as also used bromo maleimide and dibromomaleimide linkers to conjugate both drugs and antibodies for a quite while (WO20 14/009774, PCT/IB2012/053554). However, these above bridge linkers were designed in the way to conjugate only one cytotoxic agents to a pair of disul \u00ad fide bonds, and therefore at most of time they only produced ADCs at DAR less than 2 (drugs per antibody), due to limited numbers (about two pairs) of reduced disulfide bonds are more accessible for conjugation. As one of the major issues for ADCs is the limited numbers or amount of cytotoxic compound that ultimately reaches the tumor, and thus the favorable DAR over 3 is much important factor for improvement of ADC therapeutical index (Epenetos, A. A. et al, CancerRes., 1986, 46, 3183-3191; Chari, R. V. Acc. Chem. Res., 2008, 41, 98-107, Zhao, 4 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/155753 PCT/IB2015/056083 R. Y. et al, 2011, J. Med. Chem. 54, 3606-3623), we therefore disclose novel disulfur bridge linkers of this invention that not only are able to conjugate two or more drugs per linker for achieving higher DARs (>4), but also can selectively rebridge pairs of reduced inter chain disulfide bonds on surface of antibody, which are generated by overloaded TCEP or DTT reduction agents. And the over reduced pairs of thiol groups that are inac\u00ad cessibly reached by the bridge linkers can be recoupled (regenerated) by an oxide, e.g. dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA) or Cu(II), to form back disulfide bonds at the end of conju \u00ad gation. In principal, this rebridging back of reduced disulfide bonds results in more stable or longer half-life of ADCs in comparison with traditional thiol linked ADCs. Furthermore, as the \"ring-opened \" succinimide ring linker bearing mono-thioether bond has improved in vitro stability, improved PK exposure, and improved efficacy as compared to the mono- thiol-maleimide-conjugated ADCs (Turney, L. N, et al, 2014, Bioconjug. Chem. 25, 1871 \u2014 80; Lyon, R. P, et al. 2014, Nat. Biotechnol. 32, 1059-62), due to the latter is prone to payload loss via a retro-Michael type reaction of the maleimide conjugation (Shen, B. Q, et al, 2012, Nat Biotechnol. 30, 184-9; Turney, L. N, et al, 2014 Bioconjug Chem. 25, 1871 \u2014 80), the bridge linkers of this invention containing a 2,3-disubstituted succinic group, or 2- monosubstituted, or 2,3-disubstituted fumaric or maleic (turns (E)- or cis (Z)-butenedioic) group have less payload loss as compared to their nonhydrolyzed bromo or dibromo- maleimide linkers which were tested in our lab. In other words, the methods of the instant invention can be used to for the immunoconjugates that carry a combination of drugs, in particular different drugs, which can be delivered simultaneously and specifically to a particular target site, where the therapeutic molecules in the medicament are highly homo \u00ad geneous, with lot-to-lot consistency. The major advantages of such immunoconjugates include: simultaneous targeted delivery of multiple drugs that act synergistically in target \u00ad ing malignant cells; combining drugs that act in different phases of the cell cycle to in\u00ad crease the number of target cells exposed to a particular pharmaceutical drug or effect; minimized exposure to non-target cells, tissues or organs; precise control over drug pay- loads and drug ratios leading to homogenous final products. In short, the bridge linkers of the invention can make homogeneous production of specific ADCs in a simple manner. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides linkers containing a 2,3-disubstituted succinic or cis to link two drugs to a cell-binding agent (e.g., an antibody).

CELL-BINDING AGENT-DRUG CONJUGATES 20 WO 2015/155753 PCT/IB2015/056083 5 10 15The conjugates of the present invention can be represented by the following formula, Cb=t|?LCg rr\"|l) n \u00ae2 , wherein Cb containing succinic, fumaric or maleic group, Drugi and Drug 2 are a drug molecule, n is an integer from I to 30, and two S (sulfur) elements from Cb bridgely link to L, which covalently connects two or more drugs (per bridge linker L). The bridge linker L may be composed of one or more linker components. Exemplary linker units (\"EO\" or \"PEO\"). Additional linker components are known in the art and some are described herein.

The conjugatable thiol groups can reduction pairs of disulfide bonds on the surface of cell-binding molecule. Drugi and Dmg 2 represent the same or different cytotoxic agents, linked to the cell\u00ad binding agent via or combination thereof. n is I ~ 30; \"----\", Ri, R2, Xi and X2 are described the same previously in Formula (I). As described in more detail below, Drugi and Drug 2 can be any of many small mole \u00ad cule drugs, including, conjugate, the cell-binding agent can be first modified with the bridge linkers of the present invention through reduction of disulfide bonds of the cell\u00ad binding molecule. The yielded a pair of free thiols can react to the bridge linker of Formula (I) at pH 5-9 aqueous media with or without addition of 0-30% of water mixable (miscible) organic solvents, such as DMA, ethanol, methanol, acetonitrile, THF, isopropanol, dioxane, propylene glycol, or ethylene diol, a cytotoxic agent reacts to the modified cell-binding molecule accordingly. For example, synthesis of the cell-binding agent-drug conjugates linked via disulfide bonds is achieved by a disulfide exchange between the disulfide bond in the modified cell-binding agent and a drug containing a free thiol group. Synthesis of the cell-binding agent-drug conjugates linked via thioether is achieved by reaction the maleimido or haloacetyl or ethylsulfonyl modified cell-binding agent and a drug containing a free thiol group. Synthesis of conjugates bearing an acid labile hydrazone can be achieved by reaction of a carbonyl group with the hydrazide moiety in the linker, by methods known in the art (see, for example, P. Hamann et ah, Cancer Res. 53, 3336-334, 1993; B. Laguzza et ah, J. Med. Chem., 32; 548-555, 1959; P. Trail et ah, Cancer Res., 57; 100-105, 1997). Synthesis of conjugates bearing triazole linkage can be achieved by reaction of a 1-yne group of the drug with the azido moiety in the linker, through the click chemistry (Huisgen cycloaddition) (Lutz, J-F. et al, 2008, Adv . Drug Del. Rev. 60, 958-970; Sletien, E. M. et al 2011, Acc Chem . Research 44, 666-676). Alternatively, the drug can react with the bridge linkers of the present invention that have conjugated to a cell-binding molecule to give a modified cell-binding molecule linker of Formula (III) bearing functionalities. For example, a thiol-containing drug can be 23 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/155753 PCT/IB2015/056083 reached with the modified cell-binding molecule bridge linker of Formula (III) bearing a maleimdo, or a haloacetyl, or an ethylsulfonyl substituent at pH in aqueous molecule-drug conjugate a thioether linkage. A thiol-containing drug can undergo disulfide exchange with a modified bridge linker of Formula (III) bear\u00ad ing a pyridyldithio moiety to give a conjugate a disulfide bond linkage. A drug bearing a hydroxyl group or a thiol group can be reacted with a modified bridge linker of Formula (III) bearing a halogen, particularly the alpha halide of carboxylates, in the presence of a mild base, e.g. pH 8.0-9.5, to give a modified drug bearing an ether or thiol ether link. A hydroxyl group containing drug can be condensed with a bridge cross linker of Formula (I) bearing a carboxyl group, in the presence of a dehydrating agent, such as EDC or DCC , to give ester linkage, then the subject drug modified bridge linker undergoes the conjugation with a cell-binding molecule. A drug containing an amino group can condensate give a conjugate via amide bond linkage. The conjugate may be purified by standard biochemical means, such as gel filtration on a Sephadex G25 or Sephacryl S300 column, adsorption chromatography, and ion ex\u00ad change or by dialysis. In some cases, a small molecule as a cell-binding agent (e.g. folic acid, melanocyte stimulating hormone, EGF etc) conjugated with a small molecular drugs can be purified by chromatography such as by HPLC, medium pressure column chroma \u00ad MODIFIED cell-binding agent modified by reaction with linkers of the present invention are preferably represented by the Formula (III) Z1-R 1-X 1- I_________o No ILThI X2 Ib Z 2 n b Wherein \"----\", Cb, Z1, Z2, n, Ri, R2, Xi, and X2 are defined the same as in Formula (I) and (II). 24 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/155753 PCT/IB2015/056083 In preferred The modified cell-binding agent can be prepared via a reaction of the cell\u00ad binding agent with the bridge linkers of Formula (I) as described in Formula (II) above. In order to achieve a higher conjugation yield of the alkyne group on the bridge link\u00ad ers with a pair of free thiols on the cell-binding molecule, preferably on an antibody, a small percentage of organic co-solvent may be required to add to the reaction mixture, as well in the solution after the reaction to maintain solubility of the Formula (III) in aqueous solution. To modify the cell-binding agents, the cross-linking reagent (bridge linker) of Formula (I) can be first dissolved in a polar organic solvent that is miscible with water, for example different alcohols, such as methanol, high concentration, for example 1-500 mM. Meanwhile, the cell-binding molecule, such as antibody dissolved in an aqueous buffer pH 5-9.5, preferably pH 6-8.5, at 1-35 mg/ml concentration was treated with 1-20 equivalent of TCEP or DTT for 20 min to 12 hour. After the reduction, DTT can be removed by SEC chromatographic purification. TCEP can be optionally removed by SEC chromatography too, or staying in the reaction mixture for the next step reaction without purification. Furthermore, the reduction of antibodies or the other cell-binding agents with TCEP can be performed with a bridge linker of Formula (I), for which the cross-linking conjugation for the cell-binding molecules can be achieved simultaneously along with the TCEP reduction. The aqueous solutions for the modification of cell-binding agents are buffered be\u00ad tween pH 6 and 9, preferably between 6.5 and 7.5 and can contain any non-nucleophilic buffer salts useful for these pH ranges. Typical phosphate, triethanolamine HC1, HEPES , and MOPS such as cyclodextrins, sucrose and salts, for examples, NaCl and KCL After the addition of the bridge linker of Formula (I) into the solution containing the reduced cell-binding molecules, the reaction mixture is incubated at a temperature of from 4 0C to 45 0C, preferably at ambient temperature. The progress of the reaction can be monitored by measuring the 25 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/155753 PCT/IB2015/056083 decrease in the absorption at 254 nm, or increase in the absorption at 280 nm, or the other appropriate wavelength. After the reaction is complete, isolation of the modified cell\u00ad binding agent can be performed in a routine way, using for example gel filtration chroma \u00ad tography, or adsorptive chromatography. The extent of modification can be assessed by measuring the absorbance UV spectra. For the conjugation without a chromophore group, the modification or conjugation reaction can be monitored by LC-MS , cross-linkers described herein have diverse functional groups that can react with any drugs, preferably cytotoxic agents that possess a suitable substituent. For examples, the modified cell-binding mole \u00ad cules bearing an amino or hydroxyl react with drugs bearing an N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester, the modified cell-binding molecules bearing a thiol substituent can react with drugs bearing a maleimido or haloacetyl group. Additionally, the modified cell-binding molecules bearing a carbonyl (ketone or aldehyde) substituent can react with drugs bearing a hydrazide or an alkoxyamine. One skilled in the art can readily determine which linker to use based on the known reactivity of the available func\u00ad tional group on the linkers.

The modified drugs can be prepared via reaction of the drug with the linkers of the Formula (I) to give a modified drug of Formula (IV) bearing functionality of an 2,3- disubstituted succinic group, or 2-monosubstituted or 2,3-disubstituted maleic group. But for drugs containing a thiol, or the drugs undergoing to link a cell-binding molecule via the bridge linkers through thioether, thioester or disulfide bond, it is therefore preferred that the Drugi or Dmg 2 may be synthesized to connect to R1, or R2 in a piece of components via the linkage of thioether, 26 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/155753 PCT/IB2015/056083 thioester or disulfide bond first. Then the synthesized Ri-Drugi or R2-Drug 2 component is assembled to 2,3-disubstituted succinic acid, or or 2,3-disubstituted fumaric acid, or or 2,3-disubstituted maleic acid to form the bridge linker modified drugs of Formula (IV). For examples of the synthesis, a thiol-containing drug can be reacted with the linker of components Ri or R2 bearing a maleimdo substituent at neutral pH in aqueous buffer to give a Ri-Drugi or R2-Drug 2 compartment bearing thioether linkage, and following by condensation with either 2,3-disubstituted succinic or 2-monosubstituted 2-monosubstituted or 2,3-disubstituted maleic acid to give a modified drug of Formula (IV) bearing thioether linkage. A drug bearing a hydroxyl group can be reacted with a linker component Ri or R2 bearing a halogen, or a tosylate, or a mesylate, in the presence of a mild base, to give a Ri-Drugi or R2-Drug 2 compartment bearing ether linkage, and following by condensation with 2,3-disubstituted succinic acid, or 2,3- disubstituted maleic acid to give a modified drug of Formula (IV) bearing thioether link\u00ad age. A hydroxyl group containing drug can be condensed with a linker of Formula (I) bearing a carboxyl group, in the presence of a dehydrating agent, such as EDC or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), to give a modified drug of Formula (IV) via ester link\u00ad age.

An amino group containing drug can similarly undergo condensation with a carboxyl group on the bridge linker of Formula (I) to give a modified drug of Formula (IV) bearing amide bonds. The modified drug can be purified by standard methods such as column chromatography over silica gel or alumina, crystallization, CELL-BINDING AGENTS The cell-binding molecule that comprises the conjugates and the modified cell-binding agents of the present invention may be of any kind presently known, or that become known, molecule that binds to, complexes with, or reacts with a moiety of a cell population sought to be therapeutically or otherwise biologically modified. 27 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/155753 PCT/IB2015/056083 The cell binding agents include, but are not limited to, large molecular weight proteins such as, for example, full-length antibodies (polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies); single antibodies; antibodies such as F(ab') 2, Fv [Parham, J. Immunol. 131, 2895-2902 antibodies, CDR's, diabody, triabody, tetrabody, miniantibody, small immune proteins (SIP), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above which immuno- specifically bind to cancer cell antigens, viral antigens, microbial antigens or a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing, binding to a specific antigen or exhibiting the desired biological activity (Miller et al (2003) J. of Immunology 170:4854-4861); interferons (such as type I, hormones), MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone), steroid hormones, such as androgens and estrogens, melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH); growth factors and epidermal growth factors (EGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating (GM-CSF), transforming growth factors (TGF), such as TGFa, TGFp, insulin and insulin growth factors (FGFs); smaller molecular weight proteins, poly-peptide, and peptide such as J. Biol. Chem. 932-937 (1985)]; proteins or lipoproteins, such as lectins; cell nutrient-transport molecules; and small molecular inhibitors, such as pro state-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) inhibitors and small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), non-peptides or any other cell binding molecule or substance, such as bioactive polymers (Dhar, et ACS Nano, 2008, 19, 1309-12; Medarova, et al, Nat. Med. 2007, 13, 372-7; Javier, et al, Bioconjugate Chem. 2008, 19, 1309-12); liposomes (Medinai, et Des. capsides (Flenniken, et al, Viruses Nanotechnol. 2009, 327,71-93). 28 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/155753 PCT/IB2015/056083 In general, a monoclonal antibody is preferred as a cell-surface binding agent if an ap\u00ad propriate one is available. And the antibody may be murine, human, humanized, chimeric, or derived from other species. Production of antibodies used in the present invention involves in vivo or in vitro pro\u00ad cedures or combinations thereof. Methods for producing polyclonal anti-receptor peptide antibodies are well-known in the art, such as in U.S. Pat. No. 4,493,795 (to Nestor et al). A monoclonal antibody is typically made by fusing myeloma cells with the spleen cells from a mouse that has been immunized with the desired antigen (Kohler, G.; Milstein, C. (1975). Nature 256: 495-497). The detailed procedures are described in \"Antibodies \u2014A Laboratory Manual \", Harlow and Lane, eds., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York (1988), which is incorporated herein by reference. Particularly monoclonal antibodies are produced by immunizing mice, rats, hamsters or any other mammal with the antigen of interest such as the intact target cell, antigens isolated from the target cell, whole vims, attenuated whole vims, and viral proteins. Splenocytes are typically fused with myeloma cells using polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000. Fused hybrids are selected by their sensitivity to HAT (hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymine). Hybridomas producing a monoclonal anti\u00ad body useful in practicing this invention are identified by their ability to immunoreact specified receptors or inhibit receptor activity on target cells. A monoclonal antibody used in the present invention can be produced by initiating a monoclonal hybridoma culture comprising a nutrient medium containing a hybridoma that secretes antibody molecules of the appropriate antigen specificity. The culture is main \u00ad tained under conditions and for a time period sufficient for the hybridoma to secrete the antibody molecules into the medium. The antibody-containing medium is then collected. The antibody molecules can then be further isolated by well-known techniques, such as using protein-A affinity chromatography; anion, cation, hydrophobic, or size exclusive chromatographies (particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after protein A, and sizing column chromatography); centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. Media useful for the preparation of these compositions are both well-known in the art and commercially available and include synthetic culture media. An exemplary synthetic medium is Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM; Dulbecco et ah, Virol. 8, 396 (1959)) supplemented with gm/1 glucose, 0-20 mM glutamine, 0-20% fetal calf serum, several ppm amount of heavy metals, such as Cu, Mn, Fe, or Zn, etc, or/and the heavy 29 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/155753 PCT/IB2015/056083 metals added in their salt forms, and with an anti-foaming agent, such as polyoxyethylene- polyoxypropylene block copolymer. In addition, antibody-producing cell lines can also be created by techniques other than fusion, such as direct transformation of B lymphocytes with oncogenic DNA, or transfec \u00ad tion with an such Epstein-Barr (HHV-4)) be produced via an anti-receptor peptide or peptides containing the carboxyl terminal as described well-known in the art. See Niman the anti-receptor peptide or a peptide analog is used either alone or conjugated to an im\u00ad munogenic carrier, as the immunogen for producing anti-receptor peptide monoclonal antibodies. There are also a number of other well-known techniques for making monoclonal anti\u00ad bodies as binding molecules in this invention. Particularly useful are methods of making fully human antibodies. One method is phage display technology which can be used to select a range of human antibodies binding specifically to the antigen using methods of affinity enrichment. Phage display has been thoroughly described in the literature and the construction and screening of phage display libraries are well known in the art, see, e.g., Dente et al, Gene. 148(1):7-13 (1994); Little et Science 246:1275-1281 (1989). Monoclonal antibodies derived by hybridoma technique from another species than human, such as mouse, can be humanized to avoid human anti-mouse antibodies when infused into humans. Among the more common methods of humanization of antibodies are complementarity-determining region grafting and resurfacing. These methods have been extensively described, see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,859,205 and 6,797,492; Liu et al, 103(10):3557-62 (2006) each incorporated herein by reference. Lully human antibodies can also be prepared by immunizing transgenic mice, rabbits, monkeys, or other mammals, carrying large portions of the human immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, with an immunogen. Examples of such mice are: the Xenomouse. (Abgenix/ Amgen), the HuMAb-Mouse (Medarex/BMS), see also U.S. Pat. No. 6,596,541 , 30 5 10 15 20 25 In human therapy, murine variable regions and hu\u00ad man constant regions can also be fused to construct called \"chimeric antibodies \" that are considerably less immunogenic in man reference). In addition, site-directed mutagenesis in the variable region of an antibody can result in an antibody with higher affinity and specificity for its antigen (Brannigan et al, Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 3:964-70, (2002)); Adams et al, J Immunol Methods. 231:249-60 (1999)) and exchanging constant regions of a mAb can improve its ability to mediate effector functions of binding and cytotoxicity. Antibodies immuno specific for a malignant cell antigen can also be obtained commer \u00ad cially or produced by any method known to one of skill in the art such as, e.g., chemical synthesis or recombinant expression techniques. The nucleotide sequence encoding anti\u00ad bodies immuno specific for a malignant cell antigen can be obtained commercially, e.g., from the GenBank database or a database like it, the literature publications, or by routine cloning and sequencing. Apart from an antibody, a peptide or protein that bind/block/target or in some other way interact with the epitopes or corresponding receptors on a targeted cell can be used as a binding molecule. These peptides or proteins could be any random peptide or proteins that have an affinity for the epitopes or corresponding receptors and they don't necessarily have to be of the immunoglobulin family. These peptides can be isolated by similar tech\u00ad niques as for phage display antibodies (Szardenings, J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2003; 23(4):307-49). The use of peptides from such random peptide libraries can be similar to antibodies and antibody fragments. The binding molecules of peptides or proteins may be conjugated on or linked to a large molecules or materials, such as, but is not limited, an albumin, a polymer, a liposome, a nano particle, a dendrimer, as long as such attachment permits the peptide or protein to retain its antigen binding specificity.

According to a further object, the present invention also concerns pharmaceutical compositions comprising the conjugate via the bridge linkers of the invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient for treatment of cancers, infec \u00ad tions or autoimmune disorders. The method for treatment of cancers, infections and auto\u00ad immune disorders can be practiced in vitro, in vivo, or ex vivo. Examples of in vitro uses include treatments of cell cultures in order to kill all cells except for desired variants that 47 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/155753 PCT/IB2015/056083 do not express the target antigen; or to kill variants that express undesired antigen. Exam \u00ad ples of ex vivo uses include treatments of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) prior to the performance of the transplantation (HSCT) into the same patient in order to kill diseased or malignant cells. For instance, clinical ex vivo treatment to remove tumour cells or lym\u00ad phoid cells from bone marrow prior to autologous transplantation in cancer treatment or in treatment of autoimmune disease, or to remove T cells and other lymphoid cells from allogeneic bone marrow or tissue prior to transplant in order to prevent graft-versus-host disease, can be carried out as follows. Bone marrow is harvested from the patient or other individual and then incubated in medium containing serum to which is added the conjugate of the invention, concentrations range from about I pM to 0.1 mM, for about 30 minutes to about 48 hours at about 37 \u00b0C. The exact conditions of concentration and time of incuba\u00ad tion (=dose) are readily determined by the skilled clinicians. After incubation, the bone marrow cells are washed with medium containing serum and returned to the patient by i.v. infusion according to known methods. In circumstances where the patient receives other treatment such as a course of ablative chemotherapy or total-body irradiation between the time of harvest of the marrow and reinfusion of the treated cells, the treated marrow cells are stored frozen in liquid nitrogen using standard medical equipment. For clinical in vivo use, the conjugate via the linkers of the invention will be supplied as solutions or as a lyophilized solid that can be redissolved in sterile water for injection. Examples of suitable protocols of conjugate administration are as follows. Conjugates are given weekly for 8-20 weeks as an i.v. bolus. Bolus doses are given in 50 to 500 ml of normal saline to which human serum albumin (e.g. 0.5 to I mF of a concentrated solution of human serum albumin, 100 mg/mF) can be added. Dosages will be about 50 pg to 20 mg/kg of body weight per week, i.v. (range of 10 pg to 200 mg/kg per injection). 4-20 weeks after treatment, the patient may receive a second course of treatment. Specific clinical protocols with regard to route of administration, excipients, diluents, dosages, times, etc., can be determined by the skilled clinicians. Examples of medical conditions that can be treated according to the in vivo or ex vivo methods of killing selected cell populations include malignancy of any types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, graft rejections, and infections (viral, bacterial or parasite). The amount of a conjugate which is required to achieve the desired biological effect, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the chemical characteristics, the potency, and the bioavailability of the conjugates, the type of disease, the species to which 48 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/155753 PCT/IB2015/056083 the patient belongs, the diseased state of the patient, the route of administration, all factors which dictate the required dose amounts, delivery and regimen to be administered. In general terms, the conjugates via the linkers of this invention may be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing 0.1 to 10% w/v conjugates for parenteral administration. Typical dose ranges are from I g/kg to 0.1 g/kg of body weight per day; a preferred dose range is from 0.01 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg of body weight per day, or per week, or an equivalent dose in a human child. The preferred dosage of drug to be administered is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, the formulation of the compound, the route of administration (intravenous, intramuscular, or other), the pharmacokinetic properties of the conjugates by the chosen delivery route, and the speed (bolus or continuous infusion) and schedule of administrations (number of repetitions in a given period of time). The conjugates via the linkers of the present invention are also capable of being ad\u00ad ministered in unit dose forms, wherein the term \"unit dose \" means a single dose which is capable of being administered to a patient, and which can be readily handled and packaged, remaining as a physically and chemically stable unit dose comprising either the active conjugate itself, or as a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, as described hereinafter. As such, typical total daily/weekly/biweekly/monthly dose ranges are from 0.01 to 100 mg/kg of body weight. By way of general guidance, unit doses for humans range from I mg to 3000 mg per day, or per week, per two week or per month. Preferably the unit dose range is from I to 500 mg administered one to four times a week, and even more prefera \u00ad bly from I mg to 100 mg, once a week. Conjugates provided herein can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions by admixture with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Such unit dose compositions may be prepared for use by oral administration, particularly in the form of tablets, simple capsules or soft gel capsules; or intranasal, particularly in the form of powders, nasal drops, or aerosols; or dermally, for example, topically in ointments, creams, lotions, gels or sprays, or via trans-dermal patches. DRUGS/CYTOTOXIC AGENTS Drugs that can be conjugated to a cell-binding molecule in the present invention are small molecule drugs including cytotoxic agents, which can be linked to or after they are modified for linkage to the cell-binding agent. A \"small molecule drug\" is broadly used herein to refer to an organic, inorganic, or organometallic compound that may have a 49 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2015/155753 PCT/IB2015/056083 molecular weight of for example 100 to 1800, more suitably from 120 to 1400.

In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation of conjugates 127,129 and 142 in com\u00ad parison with T-DM I: cell lines used in the cytotoxicity assays were HL-60, a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line; NCI-N87, a human gastric carcinoma cell line; BT-474, a human invasive ductal carcinoma cell line; and SKOV3, a human ovarian carcinoma cell line. For HL-60, NCI-N87, and BT-474 cells, the cells were grown in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS. For SKOV3 cells, the cells were grown in McCoy 's 5A Medium with 10% FBS. To run the assay, the cells (180 pi, 6000 cells) were added to each well in a 96-well plate and incubated for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Next, the cells were treated with test com\u00ad pounds (20 ) at various concentrations in appropriate cell culture medium (total volume, 0.2 mL). The control wells contain cells and the medium but lack the test compounds. The plates were incubated for 120 hours at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. MTT (5 mg/ml) was then added to the wells (20 ) and the plates were incubated for 1.5hr at 37\u00b0C. The medium was carefully removed and DMSO (180 ) was added afterward. After it was shaken for 15min, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm and 570 nm with a reference filter of 620nm. The inhibition% was calculated according to the following equation: inhibition% = [l-(assay-blank)/(control-blank)] x 100. The cytotoxicity 889 (ICso> 8/ IC50= 0.009), and for SK-OV-3 cell was over 800; Specificity of conjugate 129 for N87 cell was over 666 (ICso> 8/ IC50= 0.012), and for SK-OV-3 cell was over 533; Specificity of conjugate 142 for N87 cell was over 155 (ICso> 15/ IC50= 0.097), and SK-OV-3 Specificity of conjugate T-DMl cell (ICso> 15/ IC50= 0.263), and for SK-OV-3 cell was over 80. The three new conjugates 127,129 and 142 were extremely more potent than the commercial conjugate T-DM I. Example 54. Antitumor Activity In vivo. The in vivo efficacy of conjugates 127,129 and 142 along with T-DMl were evaluat\u00ad ed in a human gastric carcinoma N-87 cell line tumor xenograft models. Five-week-old female BALB/c Nude mice (30 animals) were inoculated subcutaneously in the area under the right shoulder with N-87 carcinoma cells (5 x IO6 cells/mouse) in 0.1 mL of serum- free medium. The tumors were grown for 8 days to an average size of 133 mm3. The animals were then randomly divided into 5 groups (6 animals per group). The first group of mice served as the control group and was treated with the phosphate-buffered saline vehicle. The remaining three groups were treated with conjugates 127,129,142 and T- DMl respectively at dose of 3 mg/Kg administered intravenously. Three dimensions of the tumor were measured every 4 days and the tumor volumes were calculated using the formula tumor volume =1/2 (length x width x height). The weight of the animals was also measured at the same time. A mouse was sacrificed when any one of the following criteria was met: (I) loss of body weight of more than 20% from pretreatment weight, (2) tumor avolume larger than 1500 mm , (3) too sick to reach food and water, or (4) skin necrosis. A mouse was considered to be tumor-free if no tumor was palpable. 108 WO 2015/155753 PCT/IB2015/056083 The results were plotted in Figure 16. All the four conjugates did not cause the animal body weight loss. And the animals at control group were sacrificed at day 37 due to the atumor volume larger than 1500 mm and they were too sick. All 6/6 animals at the groups of compound 127 and 129 had completely no tumor measurable at day 13 till day 60 (the 5 end of experiment). All 6/6 animals at the group of Compound 142 group had no tumor measurable at day 21 and 2/6 animals had tumor growth (measurable) back at days 48. In contrast T-DMl at dose of 3 mg/Kg was not able to eradicate the tumors and it only inhib \u00ad ited the tumor growth for 28 days. 10 109 WO 2015/155753 PCT/IB2015/056083 CLAIMS What is claimed is: I.
