The word Reiki comes from the Japanese words Rei which means \"Universal\" and Ki which means, \"Life-Force Energy.\" Reiki is not associated with any specific religious practice, however, it is a subtle and effective form of healing using spiritually attuned life-force energy- the same energy which flows through all living things. A Reiki session can reduce stress and support the body's ability to heal itself on all levels - physical, mental, and emotional. It is common to feel heat and/or vibration from the practitioners hands during the treatment. A session is constructed with a plan to address ailing areas of the body through the use of light touch. The body is repairing itself constantly. Reiki supports this activity in a calming and effective way. "}
