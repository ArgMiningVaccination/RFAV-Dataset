Business needs to produce reliable, relevant and fit-for-purpose information that can inform business decision-making and ensure meaningful and credible disclosure on social and environmental metrics.

For businesses to compete on sustainability performance - rather than methodology - we need broad business engagement, implementation of natural capital measurement and valuation. At the same time, sector specific guidance will be important to ensure relevance and applicability for all For businesses to make better decisions- they need to be able to produce comparable information on natural capital. We must work harder to measure, value and manage natural capital as carefully as we do financial capital.

The Protocol helps inform business decision-making and presents the first step towards creating an agreed-upon approach. The Natural Capital Protocol Toolkit sorts through the wealth of tools, methodologies and approaches available for natural capital measurement and valuation and maps them against the Natural Capital Protocol framework.
