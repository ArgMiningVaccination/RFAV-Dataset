Learn more about acupressure mats, including how to choose the best one. What are you waiting for?", "sitename": "BetterMe Blog", "date": "2023-02-07", "cleaned_text": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is credited with the discovery of acupressure, a type of therapy that uses pressure points located along the body's meridians to reduce pain and improve overall health. Acupressure is believed to stimulate the flow of chi \u2014 or life force energy \u2014 along these pathways, allowing the body to return to balance. Acupressure mats are a modern, innovative way to use this ancient healing practice at home. These mats are made of hundreds of plastic spikes that are arranged in a pattern according to TCM principles. When you lie or stand on the mat, the spikes stimulate the pressure points along your body, activating the flow of chi and providing relief from pain and tension. There is some scientific backing to these claims (which we'll highlight below). But first, let's take a look at how an acupressure mat works. Why Do Acupressure Mats Work? The concept behind the spiky, needle-like projections of an acupressure mat is [simple](https://betterme.world/articles/positions-to-release-gas/): When pressure is applied to a particular point on the body, it stimulates blood flow and oxygen to the area. This increases circulation which translates to a supply of fresh nutrients \u2014 including endorphins and serotonin \u2014 which can help reduce pain, tension, and inflammation ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5388088/)). In addition to the physical [benefits](https://betterme.world/articles/what-is-an-asana-in-yoga/) of increased circulation and oxygenation, the use of acupressure mats can also provide mental and emotional benefits. Many people report a sense of relaxation and improved mood after their session ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5388088/)). Is Acupressure Scientifically Proven? The scientific evidence for acupressure mats is quite slim, but there are a few studies that point to its potential effectiveness. One study found that acupuncture mats can help reduce pain in people with chronic lower back pain. The results showed that the participants who used an acupressure mat had significantly lower levels of pain than those in the control group ( [8](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/11/5211)). However, because the participants continued other forms of therapy such as medication and physical therapy, it is impossible to know how much credit can be given to the mat alone ( [8](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/11/5211)). Another study focused on the effects of acupressure mats on sleep quality. The results showed that those who used an acupressure mat at bedtime had improved sleep quality, reduced stress levels and fatigue ( [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28089414/)). However, the sample size was fairly small which means that these results need to be taken in context. A conflicting study showed that there was no significant difference in sleep quality between those who used an acupressure mat and those in the control group. The authors concluded that more research is needed to determine the efficacy of acupressure mats for sleep quality ( [6](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228349622_Does_relaxation_on_a_bed_of_nails_spike_mat_induce_beneficial_effects_A_randomized_controlled_pilot_study)). A review of research into acupressure for pain management during labor found that there is some evidence that acupressure can help reduce labor pain. Women who used acupressure during labor reported feeling less pain than those who did not ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7007200/)). A warning from this review, however, is that acupressure mats should not be used before week 38 of pregnancy due to the risk of premature labor ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7007200/)). While more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind acupressure mats, these preliminary studies provide a compelling argument for their potential benefits. And even so, being a non-invasive, affordable, and readily available form of therapy, acupressure mats are worth a try.

According to both Traditional Chinese Medicine and user reports, acupressure mats can be used to treat a range of issues including: Muscle Tension Think of [your muscles](https://betterme.world/articles/yoga-namaste/) as a rubber band \u2014 if you don't stretch them, they can become tight and sore. The pressure from the acupressure mat helps loosen tight muscles and relieve tension, making you feel more relaxed ( [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5637139/)). Sciatica Pain The spikes from the acupressure mat can help stimulate pressure points that are associated with sciatica pain. These points include the lower back, hips, and legs \u2014 all areas that are commonly affected by sciatica ( [8](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/11/5211)). When these pressure points are stimulated, it can help relax the muscles and also reduce inflammation ( [8](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/11/5211)). Back And Neck Pain The spikes from the acupressure mat help stimulate pressure points in your back and neck that are associated with pain relief. When these points are stimulated, it can help relax the muscles in these areas and reduce inflammation ( [8](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/11/5211)). Headaches And Migraines A headache or migraine can be caused by tense [muscles](https://betterme.world/articles/yoga-lifestyle/), poor blood circulation, or other factors. The pressure from the mat helps to increase circulation and reduce muscle tension, which can help alleviate headaches and migraines ( [7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20128040/)). Plus, applying pressure on specific points triggers the release of endorphins, which can help reduce pain. Stress Relief Destressing techniques such as yoga and meditation are excellent for relieving stress. But some people find that the pressure from acupressure mats works better for them in certain situations ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6533784/)). Just like massages that feel good and comforting, the use of acupressure mats can trigger the release of endorphins \u2014 which are \"happy hormones\" \u2014 offering a sense of relaxation and calmness. Plus, knowing that you're doing something good for your body can also help reduce stress levels. Insomnia The calming sensations from the acupressure mat can help reduce stress and anxiety, making it easier to fall asleep. The pressure from the spikes also helps [relax your muscles](https://betterme.world/articles/yoga-for-weight-lifters/) and reduce tension and pain, which can make it easier to drift off into a peaceful sleep ( [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28089414/)).

In some cases, people may experience temporary bruising and soreness in areas where the mat was used. This is generally not a cause for concern and should subside within a few days. If the pain does not improve or worsens, you should discontinue use and consult a doctor. Some people with chronic conditions such as diabetes, vascular problems, and circulation issues may be at an increased risk of developing skin irritation, blisters, or nerve damage from the mat ( [2](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Acupuncture_contraindications)). It is important to speak with your doctor before using an acupressure mat if you have any existing medical conditions. Additionally, pregnant women should avoid using an acupressure mat as the pressure and stimulation could potentially be dangerous by inducing labor ( [2](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Acupuncture_contraindications)). If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, consult your doctor before using an acupressure mat. Finally, it is important to avoid using the mat if you have any open wounds or skin lesions. Obviously, direct pressure to the affected area could cause further damage. In this case, you should consult your doctor who may be able to recommend alternative treatments for pain relief.
