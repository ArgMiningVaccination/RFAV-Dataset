The template of questions that makes up the model was applied tonaturopathic practice in the United States; some information about naturopathic health care inCanada is also included. The model 's broad issue areas and more specific questions provide general guidelines for assessing naturopathic practice and its various subgroups of practitioners. The template does not include anyquantitative measuring units. As such it cannot be used as a tool to decide the value of one modality orpractice group over another. Rather, its value lies in eliciting the information that consumers, educators,policy makers, insurers and others \u2014each with their own set of interests \u2014might use to evaluate an emerging profession. It provides a context for assessing naturopathic health care and other newprofessional practices in a way that can ensure both access and safety for the public. In testing the model, it was apparent that we could not obtain answers to all the template 's questions and that some question areas were not answerable. Notably, it was not within the scope of this projectto determine whether naturopathic practice measures up to the competencies developed by the PewHealth Professions Commission and referenced in the template. The competencies are subjectiveelements of individual professionals and cannot be easily answered for an entire profession althoughthey may provide guidance to professional leaders and educators. * Dower C, O 'Neil E, Hough H.

Forward ixProfile of a Profession: Naturopathic PracticeIntroduction Naturopathic health care encourages the self-healing abilities of the individual primarily through the education and promotion of natural, non-toxic therapeutic methods and modalities. Thishealing tradition relies on a rich set of practices and therapies that can be both distinctive from andcomplementary to mainstream allopathic or osteopathic medicine. Compared to allopathic medicine, one of the traditions of the naturopathic approach has been to be more accepting of various methods and thus has been less regimented and formal. Today,however, as complementary and alternative medicine methods are more generally accepted, ingrowing demand and showing evidence of efficacy, there are some growing pains within thistradition as various sub-groups within the field seek to distinguish themselves, maintain the pastor protect what is perceived as professional prerogatives. All of these developments are quitenatural and have been a part of the professionization process in other parts of health care for overone hundred years. For the purpose of this study we have identified three groups that have interests in sustaining naturopathic methods of practice. While they have a much in common they also havedistinguishing characteristics that are obvious to varying degrees to themselves and others. Each isvaluable and fills a different niche in a system of health care, particularly one in which relativelysafe practices are chosen by consumers based on efficacy criteria that the consumers themselvesevaluate. The differences between the groups are significant enough for us to attempt to answer thequestions in the model template for each group separately. The first group will be called naturopathic physicians for this study. This group has focused much of its energy in attempting to make more formal the processes by which a studentmoves through the study of naturopathy and achieves the status of becoming a physician. Introduction 1Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practice2 IntroductionUCSF Center for the Health Professions As such, there is a formal curriculum of 4 years of study in the schools that have aligned themselves with this approach. Until recently the group had a national accrediting body and hastaken great strides in standardizing entry to the profession as they define it, improvingevidence-based research, and seeking formal recognition by state accreditation bodies. Thisgroup places great value on such standardization and improvement of practice that have been apart of the tradition of many other health professional such as allopathic physicians, dentists,and podiatrists in the twentieth century. The second group is the large number of what we will call naturopaths . This group maintains the strictest definition of natural healing and does not incorporate surgical, non-naturalpharmaceutical or obstetrical care into their practice. They may focus their work on one or moreof the various modalities that comprise naturopathic healing. They have a much more varied setof pathways for entry into practice and training ranges from self instruction and apprenticeshipto formal course of study. The group places great value on the independence and responsivenessthat such values afford. A third group is also part of the current situation. These are practitioners of medicine, dentistry or nursing that are licensed under their traditional pathway, but have come to \"add\" naturopathic modalities to their practice. The level of preparation for these practitioners is wide ranging from little to full blown courses of study, with most seeming to fall on the side ofless formal acquisition of this knowledge. As a group, these individuals represent severaldifferent, licensed allopathic professions and are not of one voice on naturopathy issues.Members of this group may share the values and interests of both other groups. They tend tovalue independence and practice freedom with regards to naturopathy but within the structuredframework their allopathic licenses provide. A situation such as this in which two radically different sets of values are at play will create tensions, concerns and confusion. Not surprisingly, that describes the naturopathic landscapein the US today (in contrast to Canada, where both groups exist in relative peace). While theterm \"naturopathic physician \"is largely reserved for those who have gone to a 4-year program, both groups have educational programs that offer \"ND\"(Naturopathic Doctor) degrees and some members of both groups call themselves naturopathic \"doctors \". In the minority of states that license naturopathic physicians, the titles \"naturopathic physician \",\"naturopathic doctor \", and even \"naturopath \"may be protected by statute for those who have completed the 4-year medical school-model programs. Elsewhere, members of the group we are calling naturopathsmay call themselves naturopaths, traditional naturopaths, naturopathic practitioners, ornaturopathic consultants. Both camps have wrapped themselves in the traditions of Benedict Lust as the founder of the practice. As the claim to being most \"traditional \"is beyond the ability of the authors to decide, we grant that each has and is welcome to its own interpretation of tradition. Beyond tradition each camp wants some legal and/or regulatory protection from the other. These interests should take a back seat to the interests of the public. There are three issues ofimportance to the public that would seem to need to be addressed by any efforts to regulate theseprofessions. First, as the analysis that follows will establish, these two bodies of practice, bothsharing the same name, are separating along the set of values that are mentioned above. Theyembrace different practice philosophies and approaches to care. The public should be able toreadily distinguish one group from the other. We have suggested above that the group that valuesformalization and systemization be called naturopathic physicians. Although the other group hasa great variety of practices in its camp it would be best if all of them were called the same thing,we have suggested naturopaths. This second title avoids the use of the word doctor, as thisimplies a more formal and systematic course of study, regardless of which tradition one works in.This group has some who have met such stringent requirements, but many others that have not.Because it values its freedom more than standardization, it would seem appropriate that it takethis more general title. Introduction 3Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic PracticeThe second regulatory concern should be assurance of the public 's safety. This needs to be balanced with the opportunity for access, the third regulatory concern. In most cases thereshould be little that prevents an individual from making a decision to seek a naturopathicprovider 's assistance. Because many of the aspects of the practice are non-invasive, the public 's protection while not absolutely assured is not grossly endangered. To put this more positively, thepublic has felt itself well positioned to make its own judgments about consuming naturopathictherapy, and this right of access should continue. However, when naturopathic practice doesbecome more invasive it is important that adequate regulatory safeguards protect this dimensionof the public 's interest. What follows is our case study of naturopathic practice. Not surprisingly the part of the practice that desires standardization and formalization has produced more information that is verifiableand of a standard form. The other part of the profession that values its freedom and innovationis more difficult to capture and describe. We have done our best trying to recognize the value ofeach approach and to point to ways in which each can live with the other in a way that serves thepublic and enriches the practice. 4 IntroductionUCSF Center for the Health ProfessionsChapter One: Naturopathic Medicine 7Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practice Chapter One: Naturopathic Medicine Section ADefining and Describing Naturopathic Medicine How is the profession described and defined? What do members of the profession do and how do they provide care? What is the range of care provided? What is the profession's history and philosophy? How big is the professional workforce? 1 Description and Definitions Naturopathic medicine is a comprehensive system of health care within the complementary and alter- native medicine world that incorporates many modalities. Naturopathic physicians encourage the self-healing abilities of the individual through the education and promotion of therapeutic methods andmodalities. \"Naturopathic practice blends centuries-old knowledge of natural, nontoxic therapies with current advances in the understanding of health and human systems. \"(Bastyr University Catalog, 1999/2000) Naturopathic physicians are typically trained in a wide array of alternative therapies includ-ing herbology, homeopathy, massage, hydrotherapy, physical medicine, behavioral medicine,Traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, acupuncture, and nutrition therapy, as well asclinical practices such as minor surgery, pharmacology and obstetrics. The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP), the primary professional association for naturopathic physicians, defines naturopathic medicine as \"...a distinct system of primary health care \u2014 an art, science, philosophy and practice of diagnosis, treatment and prevention of illness. Naturopathic medicine is distinguished by the principles uponwhich its practice is based. These principles are continually reexamined in the light of scientificadvances. The techniques of naturopathic medicine include modern and traditional, scientific andempirical methods. \"(AANP , 1998) 1For a complete list of questions, see Dower et al., Profiling the Professions: A Model for Evaluating Emerging Health Professions . UCSF Center for the Health Professions, 2001.The Canadian Naturopathic Association defines naturopathic medicine as \"...a distinct system of primary health care that uses natural methods and substances to support and stimulate the body 's self-healing process. It provides a complete, individualized and coordinated approach to health care integrating modern scientificknowledge with traditional and natural forms of medicine. Naturopathic medicine is theart and science of disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention using natural therapiesincluding:Botanical medicine Clinical nutrition Hydrotherapy Homeopathy Naturopathic manipulation Traditional Chinese medicine/Acupuncture Prevention and lifestyle counseling \"(Canadian Naturopathic Association, 2000) History and tradition Like naturopaths, naturopathic physicians trace their history to Benedict Lust as the founding father of the profession (Baer, 1992; Cody, 1985). In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Lust expandedupon European water cure and herbal therapies to develop a comprehensive system of health care andphilosophy of health. Members of the naturopathic medicine tradition point to the growth of theprofession in the US during the early decades of the 20th century, citing laws recognizing naturopathythrough regulation that were enacted in about half the states and several Canadian provinces by the '30s and '40s. A significant decline in the popularity of naturopathy in the United States characterized the profession from post World War II until the 1970s, during which time most health care centeredaround the allopathic medical model. Beginning in the 1970s, increased interest in holistic andalternative health care brought about a resurgence of naturopathy (Finken, 1986; Baer, 1992; Cody,1985; Gort and Coburn, 1988; Canadian Naturopathic Association, 1999). The past 30 years have seenmore attention by naturopathic physicians to establish schools, standardize education andaccreditation, conduct and publish research on safety and efficacy, seek state and provincial licensure, 8 Chapter One: Naturopathic MedicineUCSF Center for the Health Professionsorganize the profession, develop professional guidelines and grow the size of the professional workforce in the US and Canada. Naturopathy is also practiced in Germany, Great Britain, Australia, and other countries, and schools in these countries offer education and training in naturopathy. Philosophy and practice The philosophy and practice of naturopathic medicine is built on the principles listed below. These principles were developed by naturopathic physicians for the AANP . The Healing Power of Nature Naturopathic physicians recognize an inherent ability of the body to heal itself. It is the role of the naturopathic physician to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and facilitate andenhance this self-healing process. Identify and Treat the Causes Naturopathic physicians seek to remove the underlying causes of disease rather than eliminating or suppressing symptoms. First Do No Harm Naturopathic physicians strive to: 1) use methods that minimize harmful side effects, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat, 2) prevent suppression of symptoms, and 3) respect each indi-vidual 's self-healing process. Doctor as Teacher The primary role of the naturopathic physician is to educate and encourage individuals to take responsibility for their own health. They also recognize the therapeutic potential of thedoctor/patient relationship. Chapter One: Naturopathic Medicine 9Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic PracticeTreat the Whole Person Naturopathic physicians recognize that total health includes physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, spiritual, and other factors. They encourage patients to pursue personal spiri-tual development. Prevention Naturopathic physicians encourage and emphasize disease prevention, i.e., assessing risk factors and heredity and susceptibility to disease, and making appropriate interventions in partnership withpatients to prevent illness. Naturopathic medicine is committed to creating a healthy world forhumanity (American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, 1998). Appendix A contains a more comprehensive definition of naturopathic medicine and principles of practice developed by the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians. Appendix B containsguidelines developed by the Canadian Naturopathic Association. Model of care Naturopathic medicine is based primarily on a model and strategy of preventive care and health promotion, respecting the body 's natural healing processes as its model for both acute and chronic care. While the emphasis is on the natural healing capacity of the individual 's body, naturopathic physicians are also trained to incorporate some aspects of allopathic medicine into their practices.These include minor surgery, some limited pharmacology, and obstetrics. Naturopathic physicians offer a unique service to consumers that may range from integrative medicine to lifestyle education, depending on the practitioner. Some individuals choosenaturopathic medicine as their primary form of health care instead of allopathic medicine, andmany may choose an integrative form of health care, i.e., naturopathic and allopathic physiciansworking collaboratively to treat patients for specific conditions. 10 Chapter One: Naturopathic MedicineUCSF Center for the Health ProfessionsNaturopathic physicians most often see clients/patients with chronic illness such as cancer, arthritis, asthma, and diabetes, and acute conditions such as colds, flu, and bronchitis. Naturopathicphysicians view themselves as general family practice physicians and, therefore, would refer patientsexperiencing conditions outside the general scope of a general practice (AANP , 1998). For example,anyone experiencing an acute surgical emergency would be referred to the appropriate allopathicmedical personnel. Practice guidelines developed by the AANP indicate that naturopathicphysicians are \"...obligated to make referrals if requested by the patient or deemed necessary by the physician. \"(AANP , 1998) Workforce size and demographics No large scale studies are available on the size or demographic profile of the practicing naturopathic physicians in the US and Canada at this time. Currently, the best estimates for size of the naturopath-ic physician workforce come from state licensing boards. According to 2000 figures obtained from stateand provincial licensing boards, approximately 1300 naturopathic physicians were licensed in the US(12 jurisdictions 2) and 500 were licensed in Canada (4 jurisdictions3) (See Table 1). Where not oth- erwise indicated, a jurisdiction 's total number of physicians includes practicing physicians as well as those persons who may not be actively practicing, practicing in another state, or retired. Information was not available on the sex of most licensed naturopathic physicians. Of the jurisdictions that did provide information on sex, the workforce was about evenly split between men and women inthe US; in Canada, more naturopathic physicians were men than women. No information was avail-able on racial or ethnic identities of licensed practitioners. Anecdotal evidence indicated that some individuals were trained as naturopathic physicians but practice without a license or under other professional licenses (such as acupuncture) in states that donot license naturopathic physicians. While the actual number of such individuals is unknown, Chapter One: Naturopathic Medicine 11Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practice 2In 2000, naturopathic physicians were regulated through licensure in eleven states (Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, and Washington). In Florida, several naturopathic physicianswho were licensed under an old law still practice under Florida 's medical board, but no new naturopathic physicians are being licensed and there is no active naturopathic licensing board in Florida. 3In 2000, naturopathic physicians were regulated through licensure in 4 provinces (British Columbia, Manitoba,Saskatchewan, and Ontario).12 Chapter One: Naturopathic MedicineUCSF Center for the Health Professions TABLE 1.

The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians reports having about 1800 members and the Canadian Naturopathic Association reports about 300 members (See Table 13). However, theseunverified figures include non-licensed individuals such as retirees, supporting members and students.Naturopathic medical schools have begun col- lecting information on their alumni through sur-veys that include questions such as current placeof residence, field of employment, practice pat-terns and income. Results of these surveys havenot yet been published. Another element of workforce size is the pipeline of students being educated at the various schoolsfor training future members of the profession.Table 3 provides information regarding total stu-dent enrollment, enrollment in the naturopathicmedicine program, and number of students grad-uating in the next class.

Section BSafety and Efficacy of Naturopathic Medicine How does the profession measure the safety and efficacy of its services? What are the findings of studies on safety and risk of harm to patients? What are the findings on efficacy and effectiveness? What is the profession 's research agenda? 4 Measuring safety and efficacy The naturopathic medical profession measures the safety and efficacy of its modalities primarily through scientific study and research. Because the profession encompasses a number of modalities andtherapies, naturopathic medicine can rely on the research and publication of studies conducted withinfields that are not specific to naturopathic medicine. For example, naturopathic physicians can consultany of the many journals dedicated to each of the following therapies and modalities: clinical nutrition, 4For a complete list of questions, see Dower et al., Profiling the Professions: A Model for Evaluating Emerging Health Professions . UCSF Center for the Health Professions, 2001.homeopathy, herbal and botanical medicine, massage, acupuncture, and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Naturopathic physicians also rely on the findings published in mainstream allopathic medical and phar-maceutical journals for information about the minor surgery, limited pharmaceutical prescribing andobstetrics that naturopathic physicians may incorporate into their practices. In addition, naturopathic medicine has its own peer-reviewed journal, The Journal of Naturopathic Medicine in which studies are published. In the bigger picture of which naturopathic medicine is a part, the growing interest in complementary and alternative medicine has initiated new research directives in evaluating the safety and efficacy ofnon-allopathic therapies. The results of research thus far have stimulated public debate between criticsand proponents of complementary health care. Opponents of alternative medicine often suggest thatnon-allopathic therapies are unproven according to research standards and act as placebos at best.Many in the academic and medical communities feel that research in alternative medicine should con-form to the accepted methodologies in biomedical research. Some who support complementary healthcare suggest that allopathic and non-allopathic medicine represent two different paradigms, i.e., com-plementary therapies are more holistic in nature than allopathic medicine and current scientificmethodologies, which are designed to measure cause and effect of individual agents or interventions,cannot adequately measure the effectiveness of holistic approaches. In one attempt by those who would move the research forward within the traditional bio-medical model, the Cochrane Collaboration has assembled a review team to evaluate research to date oncomplementary and alternative medicine. The primary task of the Cochrane Collaboration is tomaintain and disseminate systematic and up-to-date reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)in health care. When RCTs are not available, other reviews of the most reliable evidence from othersources are added to the database. The Cochrane Collaboration recently created a ComplementaryMedicine field to compile a database of RCTs in alternative medicine. In order for reviews to beincluded in the Cochrane Complementary Medicine registry, an intervention must not meet morethan one of the following criteria: 1) the intervention is exclusively or almost exclusively performed Chapter One: Naturopathic Medicine 15Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practiceby individuals with conventional medical qualifications; 2) the intervention is a recommended treat- ment, and 3) the intervention fails to involve any theoretical divergence with mainstream medicineor science. The Complementary Medicine review team is currently in the process of evaluating andadding reviews to the database. Safety On the continuum of potential risk of harm to patients, naturopathic medicine falls somewhere in the middle. Many of the modalities and therapies employed by naturopathic physicians pose little to noharm to the individual. These might include nutrition guidance and some herbal therapies for exam-ple. Naturopathic physicians also employ some modalities however that are less inherently safe. Theseinclude minor surgery and prescription of some pharmaceutical drugs. While naturopathic medicinemay emphasize the use of natural, non-toxic therapies, the inclusion of some invasive techniques raisethe potential for risk of harm somewhat. Safety issues in some of the complementary and alternative health care modalities that may be used by naturopathic physicians may imply either the toxicity level of the therapy itself or the competency ofthe practitioner performing the therapy. Many articles have recently reported health problems follow-ing acupuncture and other treatments; however, the majority of these conditions have been caused bypractitioners who lacked sufficient knowledge of the modality involved (Berman et al., 2000). Recent literature on herbal medicine has included reports of adverse effects of many herbal remedies. However, many of the negative conditions associated with herbs have occurred due to an interactionwith a drug prescribed by an allopathic physician. It has been noted that 70% of patients do not advisetheir clinicians about their use of herbal supplements (Miller, 1998). Because naturopathic physiciansand allopathic physicians practicing naturopathic modalities may prescribe both herbal and pharma-ceutical preparations, it is imperative for these individuals to encourage doctor-patient interaction andbe aware of known or potential drug-herb interactions. 16 Chapter One: Naturopathic MedicineUCSF Center for the Health ProfessionsEfficacy and effectiveness The majority of complementary and alternative medicine literature focuses on single substances or treatments, and numerous investigations have shown that various individual treatments may or may notbe effective. Research thus far suggests that naturopathic modalities such as acupuncture and herbalremedies, manual therapies such as physiotherapy, and nutritional therapies, are effective in treatingsome conditions but not others (Berman et al., 2000). Most reviewers have concluded that moreresearch is needed to test efficacy of complementary and alternative medicine therapies. Table 4 provides a sampling of data regarding the efficacy of naturopathic modalities. While a com- prehensive compilation of all relevant information would be beyond the scope of this report, we choseseveral illnesses/conditions that are reflective of the variety of health problems that may be presentedto naturopathic physicians. Naturopathic physicians may use multiple modalities in treating one con-dition, so each condition is associated with various naturopathic interventions. Of note, as seen in Table 4, several authors found acupuncture to be effective in relieving back pain. However, Smith et al. (2000) reviewed 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effectsof acupuncture on back or neck pain. Results from 8 of the 13 trials showed no significant decrease inpain due to acupuncture treatments. Several herbal supplements, i.e., omega-3 fatty acids, feverfew, andmagnesium, were shown to reduce migraine and frequency (McCarren et al., 1985; Murphyet al., 1988; Weaver, 1990). However, reviewers of RCTs investigating the effects of homeopathy onmigraine headaches concluded that homeopathy is ineffective in decreasing migraine headaches andassociated symptoms (Ernst et al., 1999). Research agenda Because of the aforementioned issues with using the biomedical research model to assess whole systems of holistic health care, there is a lack of research on practices such as naturopathic medicine (Calabrese, 2000).Current naturopathic medical institutions currently perform research under their own auspices. The researchinfrastructure is still new, sources of funding are limited, and the profession does not carry the same clout,for example, that allopathic medicine enjoys in securing research monies. However, organizations such as the Chapter One: Naturopathic Medicine 17Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practice18 Chapter One: Naturopathic MedicineUCSF Center for the Health Professions TABLE 4.

UCSF Center for the Health Professions, 2001. 6In the US, governmental regulation of health care professionals can be grouped into three levels: licensing, certification, and registration. All three tiers of regulation carry the intention to protect consumers and the integrity of a professionagainst unqualified individuals. Licensing is the most restrictive form of regulation and is \"...a mechanism for legally recognizing and socially acknowledging a profession and providing standards for the practice of such profession \" (New York State Senate, 1998). State certification regulates the use of a specific occupational title; anyone may deliver the service but only those cer- tified may use a protected title (Finocchio et al., 1995). Individuals who do not meet specific certification requirementsin a profession cannot use a given title associated with the certification. Both licensing and certification serve as toolsto monitor membership and disciplinary procedures in a profession (New York State Senate, 1998). (Private sector cer-tification is a non-governmental activity that some professions employ; it is discussed below). Registration is the least restrictive form of regulation. In most cases, registration is generally a matter of registering one's name, address and qualifications with a state authority. There are rarely standards for entry to practice or require- ments for continued competence with registration (Finocchio et al, 1995).National Institutes of Health (NIH) are beginning to take an interest in investigating whole practices. Bastyr University and the National College of Naturopathic Medicine have both secured investigatory fundingfrom NIH to evaluate naturopathic medical treatments. Additionally, National College of NaturopathicMedicine has recently joined a research consortium with five other Oregon institutions to form the OregonCenter for Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Neurological Disorders (ORCCAMIND).Research at the Center will focus on alternative therapies in neurological disorders. Section CGovernment Regulation and Private Sector Recognition of Naturopathic Medicine To what degree is the profession recognized, through law or policy, by private and public (government) sector entities? Is the practice of the profession expressly illegal in any states or provinces? Is it regulated through licensure of members of the profession? Where the profession is regulated, what is the legal scope of practice for members of the profession? Do health plans cover the services provided by members of the profession? What are the estimated utilization rates for the profession? 5 State and provincial regulation (See Appendix C for regulatory contacts) Naturopathic physicians are pursuing licensing6in most US states and are now licensed in 11 states. Table 5 provides the requirements for obtaining a license in each state or province regulating naturopathicmedicine. Typically, the fundamental requirements include graduation from an accredited naturopathic20 Chapter One: Naturopathic MedicineUCSF Center for the Health Professions TABLE 5.

Additional required criteria vary from state to state. Naturopathic physicians are regulated in four Canadian provinces to date, i.e., British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan. Regulation is pending in Alberta and proposed in Nova Scotia.Naturopathic practice is remarkably similar among the four provinces, showing consistency as to thedefinition and legal scope of naturopathic practice. Fees to obtain a license range from $50 in the state of Washington (Washington State Department of Health, 2000) to $675 in Maine (Maine Office of Licensing and Registration, 2000). Many states alsorequire a fee to process the license application and those fees may range from $50 in Alaska andWashington to $400 in Arizona. Arizona, Connecticut, Maine, Montana, and Washington requirelicense renewal on an annual basis while Alaska, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Oregon, Utah, and Vermontrequire a renewal every two years. License renewal fees range anywhere from $50 in Utah (Utah Divisionof Occupational and Professional Licensing, 1999) to $450 in Connecticut (Connecticut Department ofPublic Health, 1998) and Washington (Washington State Department of Health, 2000). NPLEX (Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examinations) exams are the standard written exam- inations required for licensure in naturopathic medicine in North America. The exam consists ofthree sections: a) the Basic Science exam (anatomy, physiology, pathology, biochemistry, microbiol-ogy, and immunology), b) the Clinical Science exam (clinical and physical diagnosis, laboratorydiagnosis and diagnostic imaging, botanical medicine, pharmacology, nutrition, physical medicine,psychology and lifestyle counseling, and emergency medicine), and c) the Add-on exams (home-opathy, acupuncture, obstetrics, jurisprudence, and minor surgery). Eligibility to take the ClinicalNPLEX includes completion of requirements for graduation from a naturopathic medical collegeaccredited by the CNME. As seen in Table 6, all states and provinces that license naturopathic physicians require the Clinical Science exams in order to obtain a license. The state of Connecticut does not require the Basic Science 24 Chapter One: Naturopathic MedicineUCSF Center for the Health ProfessionsChapter One: Naturopathic Medicine 25Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practice TABLE 6.

The provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario require an oral and practical examinationin addition to the written NPLEX examinations. NPLEX is administered by the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE, 2000), which was established in 1999. The organization sets policies regarding the qualifications and admin-istration of NPLEX exams, proctors the NPLEX at testing sites across the United States and Canada,and ensures applicants are qualified to take the NPLEX exams (NABNE, 2000). Applicants who wishto take the NPLEX exam must apply to the NABNE. Individuals are eligible to take the Basic Scienceexam following completion of basic science course work. The Clinical Science exams may be complet-ed after graduation from a four-year naturopathic medicine program. According to current laws in the eleven states regulating naturopathic medicine, individuals who attend institutions other than those accredited by the CNME are not allowed to become licensedpractitioners. In all eleven states, the current law requires that each licensee be a graduate of anaturopathic medical college accredited by the CNME. Legal Scope of Practice in States and Provinces Legal scopes of practice accompany licensing acts. These legal scopes of practice, which must be distinguished from professional scopes of practice discussed below, define what licensed members ofthe profession may and may not do in the provision of health care. Although some professions, such asallopathic physicians, are governed by similar scope of practice laws in all states and provinces, otherprofessions, including naturopathic physicians, must adhere to different sets of laws and regulationspromulgated by the legislative and licensing bodies in the various jurisdictions that license them. Tables7 and 8 provide legal scope of practice information for naturopathic physicians in the United States andCanada. Scope of practice laws are mixed among states and provinces where allopathic procedures areconcerned. Naturopathic physicians are allowed to prescribe drugs in some states, but the range of drugsis limited in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. In Maine, Montana, and Ontario, naturopathicphysicians are allowed to order x-rays for patients but not perform the procedure themselves. 26 Chapter One: Naturopathic MedicineUCSF Center for the Health ProfessionsChapter One: Naturopathic Medicine 27Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practice Prescribe drugs no yes no no yes yes yes yes yes yes yes no (limited) (limited) (limited) Minor Surgery no yes yes no yes yes no yes yes no limited no Hydrotherapy yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes Colonic Irrigation yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes Physiotherapy yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes Naturopathic yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes manipulation Electrotherapy yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes X-ray yes yes yes yes Or der not Order not yes yes yes yes yes Or der not perform perform perform Venipuncture yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes no Obstetrics no yes yes yes no yes, yes, Yes, yes Not Yes, no with with with specified with certificate certificate certificate certificate Gynecology yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes no Botanical yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes medicine Acupuncture no yes no no Yes, no Yes, no no yes no no with no with no certificate certificate Nutrition yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes Homeopathy yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes Sources: Prepared by the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians Alliance for State Licensing, July 1,1999; Rodriguez, Efrain.

The scope of practice for naturopathic physicians in most statesincludes public health responsibilities such as reporting diseases and immunizations. Licensing and disciplinary boards Each state regulating naturopathic physicians through licensing has identified a board for licensing and disciplinary purposes; some boards are specific to naturopathic medicine while others have responsibil-ity for naturopathic physicians and other health care professionals. The primary duty of state profes-sional licensing boards is to protect the public. This is accomplished through a disciplinary process thatincludes investigating complaints made against practitioners, and disciplining physicians who have vio-lated statues or regulations specified by the board itself. State naturopathic licensing boards also ensurethat individual applicants meet the qualifications for licensure as stated in the statutes, and set the feescommensurate with applications and license distribution. Boards may also have been delegated theauthority from legislative bodies to work to define and update scope of practice regulations in naturo-pathic medicine, and to specify education and training criteria to meet the legal scope of practice. Table 9 provides information on naturopathic licensing boards in states regulating naturopathic medi- cine. Each board is usually comprised of naturopathic physicians licensed in the respective state orprovince and at least one member of the general public. Table 10 summarizes the laws regarding naturopathy in the 39 states that do not license naturopathic physicians. Of these, two states (South Carolina and Tennessee) explicitly prohibit the practice ofnaturopathy (apparently including both naturopathic medicine and naturopathy). Five states(Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Minnesota, Virginia) and the District of Columbia affirmatively regulatethe practice of naturopathy but not naturopathic medicine. In these states and in the remaining 32that regulate neither naturopathic medicine nor naturopathy, naturopathic physicians may be able topractice naturopathy but may risk prosecution under state medical practice acts if they attempt toprovide care to the full extent of their naturopathic medical education and training, which includesdiagnostic, minor surgical, pharmacological and obstetric skills.

Naturopathic physicians sometimeschoose to study and become licensed as acupuncturists in those states where naturopathic physicianscannot be licensed but acupuncturists can. In doing so, they are able to legally see patients and providehealth care as acupuncturists. Also included in Table 10 is information about recent legislative activity. Of the 32 states that regulate neither naturopathic medicine nor naturopathy, legislation was introduced in at least 9 of them duringthe 1999 -2000 or 2000 -2001 legislative sessions. All of these bills, most of which would have licensed naturopathic physicians, died. Governmental reimbursement of naturopathic medicine Cooper et al. reported in 1998 that neither Medicare nor Medicaid provided reimbursement for serv- ices rendered by naturopathic physicians. To our knowledge, Medicare maintains this policy, however,Medicaid will cover acupuncture and naturopathic medical services if the practitioner is licensed by thestate where the service is provided and the service is considered a medical necessity (Health CareFinance Administration, 2000). Private sector reimbursement of naturopathic medicine One form of private sector recognition of a profession is through insurance coverage or third party reimbursement. The majority of complementary and alternative medical (CAM) treatments are notreimbursed by insurance companies, although several health plans and Health MaintenanceOrganizations (HMOs) have begun to expand coverage. Since 1996, based on companies 'own business decisions and marketing strategies, a number of managed care organizations have begun to offer some type of coverage of complementary andalternative medical care as options. For example, Oxford Health Plans and Prudential Healthcare Plansin New Jersey are two managed care companies to offer reimbursement for naturopathic services. In1997, Oxford Health Plans, possibly the most progressive managed care company in the Northeast, Chapter One: Naturopathic Medicine 33Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practice34 Chapter One: Naturopathic MedicineUCSF Center for the Health Professions TABLE 10.

Oxford conducted a telephonesurvey in 1996 of approximately 400 members regarding complementary and alternative medical caretherapies. One-third of members indicated that they were already using some such therapies and 75percent indicated they would like their health insurer to cover these therapies. In response, Oxford setup advisory boards in six non-allopathic medicine disciplines and created a network of providers.Unlike some other health plans, Oxford does not require a referral by the primary care physician inorder to take advantage of these services. In at least one other example, private sector reimbursement decisions were mandated by public sector legislation. In 1995, the state of Washington mandated health plans to provide access to all licensedproviders, including those of alternative health care (Revised Code of Washington \u00a7 48.43.045, 1997). The law states that every health plan shall permit \"...every category of health care provider to provide health services or care for conditions included in the basic health plan services ...\" As of late 2000, many health plans and HMOs were providing coverage for some non-allopathic modalities, the most popular being chiropractic and acupuncture, the latter of which may be includedin the practices of naturopathic physicians. Examples of such companies include Kaiser Permanente inNorthern California, HealthNet in California, Blue Cross of Washington and Alaska, PrudentialHealthCare Plans of New Jersey, Sloans Lake Health Plan of Colorado, PacificCare of Washingtonand Group Health Cooperative in Washington State. A few of these plans and organizations offer naturopathic modalities as a core benefit (economic inte- gration) and may even have begun to integrate complementary and alternative services at the clinicallevel (clinical-economic integration). However, most managed care companies typically provide com-plementary and alternative medical care through a \"rider \". With a rider to a policy, a policy holder pays for the services out-of-pocket but receives a discount on services provided by practitioners who aremembers of the plan 's credentialed network (Weeks, 1996a). 38 Chapter One: Naturopathic MedicineUCSF Center for the Health ProfessionsNetworks for managed care organizations are usually created through a contracted vendor or network provider. The network provider ensures that practitioners are licensed and meet various credentialingcriteria. Network credentialing is intended to protect consumers by ensuring safety and quality throughstandards such as licensing, education, and malpractice requirements within each profession (Weeks,2000). Landmark Healthcare, Inc. in California, for example, is a network provider who requirescomplementary and alternative care practitioners to meet guidelines put forth by the NationalCommittee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), and ensures that practitioners are evaluated and re-credentialed every two years. Some of Landmark 's criteria for credentialing CAM providers include: a) verification of current, unrestricted license, b) verification of educational background and work history,c) history of professional legal actions, d) site review to ensure that facilities meet safety, cleanliness,and access standards, and e) availability of emergency services to patients/clients. Malpractice insurance Naturopathic physicians cannot purchase naturopathic medical malpractice insurance in unlicensed states, but coverage is available for physicians located in states that regulate naturopathic medicine.Many of these states require naturopathic physicians to maintain professional malpractice insurance. InConnecticut, for example, the law states that individuals may not carry malpractice insurance less than$500,000, with an aggregate of not less than $1,500,000 (General Statutes of Connecticut 373 \u00a7 20-39q, 2000.). In the state of Alaska, malpractice is not required, but one must post a sign in the office stating that one does not carry malpractice insurance. In Canadian provinces where naturopathic physicians are regulated, individuals must be registered with their provincial association and carry malpractice insurance. In British Columbia, malpracticeinsurance is mandatory and the physician must provide evidence of insurance in order to obtain alicense to practice. The province of Alberta will also require malpractice insurance when the pendinglegislation is passed. Utilization rates There has been very little research done to date on utilization rates of naturopathic physicians and Chapter One: Naturopathic Medicine 39Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practice40 Chapter One: Naturopathic MedicineUCSF Center for the Health Professions it is impossible to estimate demand for services. However, although the sample size is small, some data regarding utilization rates for naturopathic physicians were found in the January 2000 issue of The Integrator . Ten naturopathic physicians were surveyed in Washington state regarding estimated utiliza- tion rates and revenues (The Integrator, 2000). Some important points from the survey are listed below: Patients seen per day ranged between 8 -15, and most likely 10 -12 All physicians worked no more than 32 hours per week Revenues increased between 50 -100% following insurance coverage for naturopathic medical services Nearly two-thirds of patients now have insurance coverage Additional information about utilization rates may be available from alumni surveys currently being conducted and analyzed by schools of naturopathic medicine. Section DEducation and Training of Naturopathic Physicians What are the education and training opportunities (didactic and clinical) for would-be members of the profession? Are educational programs standardized and/or accredited? Can future professionals specialize in certain areas? 7 Education and training of naturopathic physicians Training for naturopathic physicians covers a wide range of natural therapeutic modalities including hydrotherapy, herbal medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, Oriental medicine, homeopathy, and diet therapy.The curriculum also includes courses with a clinical emphasis have training in such clinical specialties as minor surgery and obstetrics and gynecology.Many naturopathic physicians may choose to specialize in one modality (e.g., acupuncture) while usingother therapies to supplement their primary practice. 7For a complete list of questions, see Dower et al., Profiling the Professions: A Model for Evaluating Emerging Health Professions . UCSF Center for the Health Professions, 2001.Competency in naturopathic medicine is largely assessed through testing via an extensive academic sys- tem. Like other professions, naturopathic physicians must show proficiency through graduation fromfour-year schools and written NPLEX exams prior to becoming licensed. In Canada, competency isalso assessed by practical exams in several provinces. Competence garnered through education and training in any profession should match the legal scope of practice, and it is assumed that the legislature in each state where naturopathic physicians arelicensed has been written to best ensure such a match. Where legal scopes of practice have been statu-torily defined, educational programs must ensure that they meet the standards legally mandated. Inaddition to legal scopes of practice, most professions have a professional scope of practice that is usual- ly broader than any particular jurisdiction 's legal scope or definition. The professional scope of practice, often defined by a professional association, helps guide educational programs, future development ofthe profession, and legislators considering regulation. The professional scope of practice for naturo-pathic physicians is defined in the AANP guidelines below: 1. The scope of naturopathic physician 's practice is eclectic and dynamic in nature. 2. Naturopathic physicians are trained to understand and utilize a wide variety of therapeutic modalities and to select the treatment that, in their opinion, best serves the patient 's condition. 3. The types of therapeutics a physician may choose from include, but are not limited to: a. Acupunctureb. Botanical medicinec. Clinical nutrition and nutritional and therapyg. Massage Naturopathic manipulative techniquej. Orthopedics One: Naturopathic Medicine 41Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practicek. Physical medicine l. Psychotherapy and counselingm. Soft tissue manipulationn. Surgeryo. Use of appropriate pharmacological agents (AANP , 1998) The schools themselves as well as each person training to be a naturopathic physician must assess whether the education and assessment model matches the professional scope of practice. Table 11 presents information about the schools that provide education and training for naturopathic physicians. It includes academic prerequisites for the programs, short synopses of the curricula, lengthof programs, descriptions of internships required for programs, if they exist, and degrees or certificatesawarded upon completion or graduation (for information about number of students, see Table 3 above).As shown in Table 11, most schools of naturopathic medicine are residential (students attend classesand labs in person) and have rigorous four-year academic programs. Naturopathic medical students arerequired to spend a significant number of hours interning at a naturopathic medicine clinic. It is notrequired at this point, but if an individual wishes to gain more clinical experience after graduation, heor she may enter a naturopathic postdoctoral residency program. The National College of NaturopathicMedicine, for example, offers residency positions at affiliate clinics and private practices. It is com-monly accepted that at least one year of postgraduate medical education and training is needed beforenaturopathic physicians begin a practice. In order to qualify for the residency program, individuals musthave graduated from an institution accredited by the CNME and, in most cases, must be licensed priorto commencement of the assigned residency (National College of Naturopathic Medicine, 2000). Allresidencies offered to graduating students are supervised by licensed naturopathic physicians and areavailable on a limited basis. At present, Utah is the only state requiring a one-year residency prior toobtaining a license (Utah Code \u00a7 58-71-302, 2000). 42 Chapter One: Naturopathic MedicineUCSF Center for the Health ProfessionsChapter One: Naturopathic Medicine 43Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic PracticeTABLE 11.

Note: Information for American University of Integrative Medicine could not be confirmed.Accreditation and Licensing of Schools of Naturopathy Most professions choose to endorse the credibility of their education and training programs through accreditation. Accreditation is usually obtained from a regional or national accrediting agencyrecognized by the United States Department of Education. Accrediting organizations focus primarilyon the quality of the program in question and accreditation typically represents an endorsement of theacademic program (State of New Mexico Commission on Higher Education, 2000). Educationalinstitution licensing, on the other hand, is usually a grant of permission by a state agency for aninstitution to operate as a business. Table 12 presents a listing of schools of naturopathic medicine inthe United States and Canada and their accreditation and licensing status. Education in naturopathic medicine has been standardized in the US to the extent that the most of the schools have been accredited by the Council for Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). To date,the CNME has been the only accrediting body for naturopathic medicine programs, and has been rec-ognized by the United States Department of Education for almost fourteen years. On January 16,2001, however, the CNME lost its sponsorship by the federal government. The CNME cannot appealthe decision, but the organization will reapply for recognition in the future. It is unknown at presenthow this decision might affect current statutes and regulatory processes. As can be seen in Table 12, Bastyr University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine, and Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine have been accredited by the CNME. The University ofBridgeport in Connecticut recently applied for accreditation candidacy with the CNME. There is noformal accreditation process in Canada, and the U.S. Department of Education does not accredit for-eign institutions. However, the Department of Education does review educational standards used byschools in other countries and determines whether those standards are comparable to accreditationstandards in the United States. If so, the Department of Education will allow American studentsattending foreign schools to participate in the Federal Family Educational Loan program to aid ineducational expenses (Department of Education, 2000). The Canadian College of NaturopathicMedicine is currently recognized by the Department of Education while the West CoastNaturopathic Medical College is not.

How are rates of patient satisfaction? How is the profession developing new modalities? How accessible are members of the profession to the public? What groups and associations are working to promote the profession? 8 Guidelines and protocols Naturopathic medicine is in the process of developing clinical care practice guidelines and protocols. This is a new undertaking throughout health care, but many naturopathic physicians, like other health care profes-sionals, are committed to developing a consistent method for advancing such a science. While detailed clin-ical care guidelines are still in the development stages, naturopathic physicians can rely on less specific prac-tice guidelines developed by the professional associations to guide daily practice (see appendices A and B). Although naturopathic physicians are trained to work collaboratively with other health care profes- sionals and to refer patients to other providers as appropriate, we did not identify any formal documentsregarding interprofessional guidelines or protocols for clinical care. Patient satisfaction Limited research has been done to date on patient satisfaction, including cultural competence, of natur- opathic medical care. However, pilot data was gathered regarding cost savings of naturopathic medicalcare from 135 patients at five separate participating naturopathic physician practices (Weeks, 1996b).A two-page survey was completed by each patient at the time of their visit to a naturopathic physician.The majority of patients felt that the care received by naturopathic physicians was cost effective forthem. These points are summarized below:49% experienced lowered or discontinued use of conventional prescription medications 16% were able to eliminate surgery or other invasive procedure 8For a complete list of questions, see Dower et al., Profiling the Professions: A Model for Evaluating Emerging Health Professions . UCSF Center for the Health Professions, 2001.96% indicated that home care education was excellent or good 92% indicated an excellent or good effect on lifestyle following NP care 68% reported that, following visits to a naturopathic physician, they were successfully caring for conditions at home for which they would normally have visited a physician in the past New modalities and therapies Naturopathic medicine has a tradition of embracing new care modalities and therapies (see above for coursework offered at universities and list of modalities and therapies included in AANP 's definition of professional scope of practice for naturopathic physicians). The profession continues to find ways tostudy and test value of the various therapies it includes in its scope of expertise. Access to and cost of care We found no studies regarding access to naturopathic medicine. However, one can estimate that based on the relatively small size of the professional workforce (compared to other health careprofessions), the limited number of states and provinces that permit naturopathic medicine to bepracticed to the full extent of the education and training of naturopathic physicians, and the lackof or limited reimbursement from health plans and HMOs, access to naturopathic physicians isextremely limited in the US and Canada. This is particularly true for areas beyond the PacificNorthwest, where naturopathic physicians are concentrated. Information on the costs of naturopathic medicine to consumers is extremely limited. In early 2000, The Integrator reported some findings based on a limited sample of profiling reports prepared by Regence Blue Shield comparing naturopathic physicians credentialed as PrimaryCare Providers (ND-PCPs) with other PCPs such as medical doctors (MDs). From the limitedsample, The Integrator reported that average cost of services billed by ND-PCPs were in the highest quartile, non-evaluation and management costs by ND-PCPs were in the lowest quartileand hospitalization costs of ND-PCPs were in the lowest third (The Integrator, 2000). 48 Chapter One: Naturopathic MedicineUCSF Center for the Health ProfessionsA sample of ten naturopathic physicians credentialed as primary care providers by Regence Blue Shield in Washington state found net incomes to be in the $50,000-$60,000 range for an average of 23 patientcontact hours per week (The Integrator, 2000). Professional and Trade Associations One of the mechanisms with which professions seek to develop the profession is professional and trade associations. These entities are often established to further the interests of the members of a profession.They usually include information about new developments in the field, offer conferences and seminarson topics ranging from policy to clinical coursework, and work on encouraging a cohesive group of pro-fessionals. Tables 13 and 14 provide information on professional associations in the field of naturopathic medi- cine, and include total membership, categories of members, and requirements for membership. Manyassociations have membership categories for individuals who are retired or full-time students. Associatememberships are often available for those who are not practicing naturopaths but wish to support theefforts of the association. The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians is the primary trade association for naturo- pathic physicians in the United States where the Canadian Naturopathic Association has a similarfunction in Canada. The AANP and the CNA sponsor affiliated state and provincial associations,respectively. The majority of state naturopathic associations require proof of graduation from a schoolof naturopathic medicine for membership. The associations offer a number of services to their mem-bers, including general practice guidelines, political updates, and a fee guide.

What do members of the profession do and how do they provide care? What is the range of care provided? What is the profession 's history and philosophy? How big is the professional workforce?9 In essence, naturopaths (also known as traditional naturopaths, naturopathic practitioners, naturopath- ic consultants, and true naturopaths) believe in detoxifying, cleansing, and strengthening the body toenhance the body 's own natural healing ability. The Coalition for Natural Health, a national profes- sional organization for practitioners and students of natural health modalities that lay in the realm ofnaturopathy, defines traditional naturopathy as \"...an approach to healthcare that focuses on the body 's intrinsic ability to heal itself. Vis medicatrix naturae , or the healing power of nature, is central to the naturopathic philosophy. Strengthening and cleansing the body to allow natural healing is the ultimate goal of a traditional naturopath.Naturopathy is considered a holistic approach to health due to the fact that it focuses on the wholeperson - body, mind, and spirit. Because the objective of naturopathy is to optimize the body 's self- healing ability, rather than to address symptoms of disease, such as infection, there is no occasionin which a naturopath would ever diagnose or treat a disease, perform any invasive procedure, per-form surgery, or prescribe drugs or pharmaceuticals. \"(Coalition for Natural Health, 2000) The California Naturopathic Association defines naturopathy as a system of healing that comprises natural methods to assess and care for the health of the patient. \"Naturopathy is concerned with both a healthy lifestyle and the prevention of disease - pain - and physical, chemical or mental conditions.Naturopathy promotes health and wellness through education, specializing in detoxification, gentlenatural therapies, and lifestyle changes. \"(California Naturopathic Association, 2001). 9For a complete list of questions, see Dower et al., Profiling the Professions: A Model for Evaluating Emerging Health Professions . UCSF Center for the Health Professions, 2001.Naturopaths use many modalities that may include exercise, diet therapy, herbs, acupressure, reflexol- ogy, herbology, electricity, massage, manual manipulation, magnetism, color therapy, sound therapy,nutritional supplementation, homeopathy, iridology, and kinesiology (California NaturopathicAssociation, 2001). History and tradition Like naturopathic physicians, naturopaths trace their history to Benedict Lust as the founding father of the profession. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Lust expanded upon European water cureand herbal therapies to develop a comprehensive system of health care and philosophy of health.Naturopaths have developed a tradition that embraces only non-invasive modalities and therapies andexcludes most allopathic practices. Over the past several decades, naturopaths have established anumber of schools, developed a broad set of treatments and therapies that exclude surgery,pharmaceuticals and other allopathic types of care, and have worked to ensure access to naturopaths byopposing state regulation of naturopathic practitioners. 10Naturopathy is also practiced in Germany, Great Britain, Australia, and other countries, and schools in these countries offer education andtraining in naturopathy. Model of care Naturopaths do not use invasive medical treatments such as x-rays, prescription drugs, injections, or surgery. Naturopaths choose not to incorporate any allopathic procedures or modalities into theirpractice, and feel that all modalities used should be noninvasive. They feel that the primary tenet ofallopathic medicine, i.e., treating isolated symptoms of a disease rather than the individual as a whole,is not fundamentally consistent with the tenets of naturopathy. Naturopathy is primarily viewed in terms of a health promotion/wellness model, although naturopaths also treat acute illnesses such as colds or flu. Naturopathy as performed by naturopaths is not recommended for persons with severe acute trauma or acute infection that requires hospitalization. \"Naturopathy may be applied in any health care 54 Chapter Two: NaturopathyUCSF Center for the Health Professions 10For a brief history of naturopathy offered by the Coalition for Natural Health, see Appendix D.situation, however, its strongest successes are in the treatment of chronic degenerative diseases. \" (California Naturopathic Association, 2001) Workforce size and demographics Because naturopaths are not regulated through licensing, it is difficult to estimate thesize of the profession. Table 15 provides thenumber of persons certified by the ANMCAB 11 as either American Board CertifiedNaturopathic Physicians 12or American Board Certified Naturopaths. These numbers are only arough estimate of the number of practicingnaturopaths in each state, and the actual num-bers may be significantly different than thoselisted in Table 15. Many naturopaths do not seekcertification or they may not be actively practic-ing. Thus, the actual numbers of practicingnaturopaths are likely greater than those num-bers seen in Table 15. Data were not availableregarding gender or ethnic representation in theprofession. One of the common ways to predict future professional workforce supply is to look atthe education and training pipeline data. Chapter Two: Naturopathy 55Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practice 11The American Naturopathic Medical Certification and Accreditation Board (ANMCAB) offers privatesector (non-governmental) certification in naturopathy.See Section C below for more information. 12Licensed naturopathic physicians do not seek certification through the ANMCAB.TABLE 15.

Where available, information is shown regarding total student enrollment, enrollment in the naturopathic program, number of studentsgraduating in the next class, and designation as to type of program, i.e., residential, distance learning,or both. Distance learning schools typically do not operate on a semester schedule and provide openenrollment and open graduation for students, i.e., individuals may enter and complete the program atany time. Due to this open structure, it is difficult to estimate the number of students graduating in aspecified amount of time. We were unable to obtain data for all schools that educate naturopaths and,therefore, Table 16 is only a partial listing.

What are the findings of studies on safety and risk of harm to patients? What are the findings on efficacy and effectiveness? What is the profession 's research agenda? 13 Measuring safety and efficacy Naturopaths are not of a single voice regarding how and whether to measure safety and efficacy of the services they provide. Many naturopaths rely on tradition, professional experience and theexperiences of their clients and patients for tailored feedback rather than subjecting their recom-mendations to the biomedical model of research. Others can rely on published studies. Becausenaturopathy includes a number of modalities and therapies, naturopaths can rely on the researchand publication of studies conducted in fields not specific to naturopathy. For example, natur-opaths can consult any of the journals dedicated to nutrition, exercise, homeopathy and herbaland botanical medicine. In the bigger picture of which naturopathy is a part, the growing interest in complementary and alternative medicine has initiated new research directives in evaluating the safety and efficacy of non-allopathic therapies. The results of research thus far have stimulated public debate between criticsand proponents of complementary health care. Opponents of alternative medicine often suggest thatnon-allopathic therapies are unproven according to research standards and act as placebos at best.Many in the academic and medical communities feel that research in alternative medicine shouldconform to the accepted methodologies in biomedical research. Some who support complementaryhealth care suggest that allopathic and non-allopathic medicine represent two different paradigms,i.e., complementary therapies are more holistic in nature than allopathic medicine and currentscientific methodologies, which are designed to measure cause and effect of individual agents orinterventions, cannot adequately measure the effectiveness of holistic approaches. 13For a complete list of questions, see Dower et al., Profiling the Professions: A Model for Evaluating Emerging Health Professions . UCSF Center for the Health Professions, 2001.In one attempt by those who would move the research forward within the traditional bio-medical model, the Cochrane Collaboration has assembled a review team to evaluate research to date oncomplementary and alternative medicine. The primary task of the Cochrane Collaboration is tomaintain and disseminate systematic and up-to-date reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)in health care. When RCTs are not available, other reviews of the most reliable evidence from othersources are added to the database. The Cochrane Collaboration recently created a ComplementaryMedicine field to compile a database of RCTs in alternative medicine. In order for reviews to beincluded in the Cochrane Complementary Medicine registry, an intervention must not meet morethan one of the following criteria: 1) the intervention is exclusively or almost exclusively performedby individuals with conventional medical qualifications; 2) the intervention is a recommended treat-ment, and 3) the intervention fails to involve any theoretical divergence with mainstream medicineor science. The Complementary Medicine review team is currently in the process of evaluating andadding reviews to the database. Safety On the continuum of potential risk of harm to patients, naturopathy falls close to the safe end of the spectrum. Because \"the goal is to optimize the body 's self-healing ability, rather than to address symptoms of disease, such as infection, there is no occasion in which a naturopath would ever diagnoseor treat a disease, perform any invasive procedure, perform surgery, or prescribe drugs orpharmaceuticals. \"(Coalition for Natural Health, 2000). This approach minimizes potential risk of harm to the public. Most of the modalities and therapies employed by naturopaths pose little to noharm to the individual; because they are not licensed to dispense regulated products, naturopaths limittheir work to promoting health and wellness through education, specializing in detoxification, gentlenatural therapies, and lifestyle changes. At the same time, even unregulated substances, such as herbs, may pose some risk of harm. Recent literature on herbal medicine has included reports of adverse effects of many herbal remedies. However,many of the negative conditions associated with herbs have occurred due to an interaction with a drugprescribed by an allopathic physician. It has been noted that 70% of patients do not advise their 58 Chapter Two: NaturopathyUCSF Center for the Health ProfessionsChapter Two: Naturopathy 59Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practice clinicians about their use of herbal supplements (Miller, 1998). It is thus imperative for naturopaths to encourage doctor-patient interaction and be aware of known or potential drug-herb interactions. Efficacy and effectiveness As noted above, many naturopaths tailor their work to individuals and rely on feedback from those individuals about the effectiveness of their care. Measuring the efficacy of naturopathy ischallenging. Where research has been done, the majority of complementary and alternative medicineliterature focuses on single substances or treatments, and numerous investigations have shown thatvarious individual treatments may or may not be effective. For example, herbal remedies andnutritional therapies may be effective in treating some conditions but not others (Berman et al.,2000). Most reviewers have concluded that more research is needed to test efficacy ofcomplementary and alternative medicine therapies. Naturopaths may use some of the same modalities (e.g. herbal remedies and nutritional guidance) as naturopathic physicians. Some examples can be found mixed above in Table 4 (although againwe note that only some, not all, modalities are employed by both groups of practitioners). Research agenda We identified no organized effort by naturopaths to pursue research to advance the profession as a whole.60 Chapter Two: NaturopathyUCSF Center for the Health Professions Section CGovernment Regulation and Private Sector Recognition of Naturopaths To what degree is the profession recognized, through law or policy, by private and public (government) sector entities? Is the practice of the profession expressly illegal in any states or provinces? Is it regulated through licensure of members of the profession? Where the profession is regulated,what is the legal scope of practice for members of the profession? Do health plans cover the services provided by members of the profession? What are the estimated utilization rates for the profession? 14 Public sector regulation While only a few states (including Alabama, Kansas, and Virginia) have statutorily recognized the right of naturopaths to practice15, and with the significant exceptions noted below, the practice of naturopathy is generally permitted in the vast majority of states and provinces. Thisis usually the case because the profession of naturopathy is statutorily ignored and naturopathsmay provide care as long as that care is not construed as practicing medicine (or other regulatedprofession) without a license. Because naturopaths are not regulated through licensure in theUnited States or Canada, legal scopes of practice have not been enacted for the profession. In some states, naturopathy is legally prohibited or curtailed. The practice of naturopathy (and naturopathic medicine) is illegal in the states of South Carolina and Tennessee. In the states that licensenaturopathic physicians, the licensing requirements are such that naturopaths are not eligible forlicensure and the terms 'naturopath 'and 'naturopathy 'may be legally reserved for use only by naturopathic physicians. In such cases, naturopaths may practice but may not use the terms 'naturopath ' or 'naturopathy 'to describe themselves or their services and may not provide care that could be construed to be naturopathic medicine (or any other regulated profession). Finally, a few states prohibitthe practice of some of the modalities included in the naturopath 's education and training. 14For a complete list of questions, see Dower et al., Profiling the Professions: A Model for Evaluating Emerging Health Professions . UCSF Center for the Health Professions, 2001. 15See Table 10 Some jurisdictions have developed unique approaches to the regulation of naturopaths and other non- allopathic care providers. In the District of Columbia, naturopaths are state regulated through privatesector registration. Naturopaths may register with the District 's Council on Naturopathic Registration and Accreditation (CNRA) in order to practice. The CNRA was \"...created as a nonprofit organiza- tion for the purpose of promoting traditional naturopathic techniques, recognizing trained and degreedpractitioners, as well as certifying to the public the credentials of naturopathic doctors \"(Council on Naturopathic Registration and Accreditation, 1998). In order to become a registered naturopath, onemust meet the following requirements: 1) hold a Doctor of Naturopathy degree from an accreditedschool, 2) currently be a practicing naturopath, 3) hold current membership in your state naturopathicorganization, and 4) hold current membership in a national naturopathic organization. The CNRAdoes not have specific accreditation requirements, so anyone holding a Doctor of Naturopathy degreemay become a registered naturopath. The state of Minnesota has enacted legislation that allows the practice of unlicensed complementary and alternative health care practitioners, including naturopaths. Complementary and alternative healthcare practices include but are not limited to: \"1) acupressure; 2) anthroposophy; 3) aromatherapy; 4) Ayurveda, 6) culturally traditional healing practices; 7) detoxificationpractices and 8) energetic healing; 9) polarity therapy; 10) folk practices; 11) healingpractices utilizing food, food supplements, nutrients, and the physical forces of heat, cold, water,touch, and light; 12) Gerson therapy and colostrum therapy; herbology orherbalism; 15) iridology; massagetherapy; meditation; 19) mind-body healing practices; 20) naturopathy; 21) noninvasiveinstrumentalities; and 22) traditional Qigong practices, such as Qi Gong energy healing. \"(Minnesota Statutes \u00a7 146A.01, 2000) As defined in the statutes, complementary health care practices do not include surgery, x-ray, dispensing legend drugs, practices involving skin puncture, setting fractures, useof medical devices, or manipulation of the spine or joints. All unlicensed practitioners must provide awritten copy of the complementary and alternative health care client bill of rights prior to providingtreatment, and each client must sign a statement indicating that he/she has received the bill of rights.A listing of what must be included in the bill of rights is provided in Appendix E. Chapter Two: Naturopathy 61Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic PracticeIn the state of Idaho, one may be an unlicensed physician and ...\"administer treatment or provide advice regarding the human body its functions that: 1. Does not use legend drugs or prescription drugs in such practice;2. Uses natural elements such as air, heat, water, and light;3. Only uses class I or class II nonprescription, approved, medical devices as defined in Section 513 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; 4. Only uses vitamins, minerals, herbs, natural food products and their extracts, and nutritional supplements; and who 5. Does not perform surgery;6. Requires each person receiving services to sign a declaration of informed consent which includes an overview of the health care provider 's education which states that the health care provider is not an 'MD'or 'DO'and is not licensed under the provisions of this chapter. \"(Idaho Statutes 18 \u00a7 54-1804, 2000). Finally, although the regulation of health care professionals is reserved for the states, some local juris- dictions are experimenting with ways within their legal boundaries to address the practice of health carepractitioners. For example, San Diego County (California) allows individuals to obtain a businesslicense and practice as a Holistic Health Practitioner. Holistic Health Practitioners are defined as\"...non-medical health care therapists who use a massage specialty and therapeutic approach in caring for clients and who present ...proof of satisfactory completion of one thousand hours of instruction in such specialty or therapeutic approach at a school with a State approved curriculum and proof of mem-bership in a State or nationally chartered organization devoted to the specialty of therapeutic approach.The practice of such health care therapists may include other services such as nutritional assistance orcounseling as long as all activities are directed toward health care \"(San Diego County Code of Regulatory Ordinances 1 \u00a7 66.504, 1995.). For further information regarding naturopathic practice and regulation, look to Legal Guidelines for Unlicensed Practitioners by Dr. Lawrence D. Wilson (Wilson, 2000). 62 Chapter Two: NaturopathyUCSF Center for the Health ProfessionsPublic and private sector reimbursement Naturopaths do not currently receive payment for services provided through federal or state health plans. Nor do insurance companies provide coverage for services provided by naturopaths. We did notlocate any network aggregators that included naturopaths. Malpractice insurance Malpractice insurance is available to naturopaths. The Coalition for Natural Health offers a discount- ed plan for members. The American Association of Nutritional Consultants (AANC) also offers pro-fessional liability insurance for naturopaths. Currently, the AANC has an agreement with theAmerican Naturopathic Medical Association and will offer malpractice insurance to graduates ofClayton College and Trinity College possessing a Doctor of Naturopathy diploma/degree. The policyprovides $500,000 per occurrence and $1,000,000 per member aggregate for all occurrences (AmericanAssociation of Nutritional Consultants, 2001). Utilization rates To our knowledge, there is no published data regarding utilization rates or demand for naturopaths. Nor is there published information about satisfaction rates specific to naturopaths. Private sector credentialing The American Naturopathic Medical Certification and Accreditation Board (ANMCAB) offers private sector (non-governmental) certification in naturopathy. Applicants must meet the minimum criteria andapply to the Board 30 days prior to the examination date in order to take the examination. The examina-tion contains four sections that include topics such as biology, healing techniques, nutrition, homeopathy,and herbology. Those individuals certified by the ANMCAB must complete 20 units of continuing edu-cation annually to retain certification status. Currently, the ANMCAB offers two types of certification: 1) American Board Certified Naturopathic Physician \"Any currently state licensed allopathic doctor, osteopath, doctor of dental surgery, doctor of medical dentistry, doctor of pharmacology, chiropractor, nurse practitioner, Chapter Two: Naturopathy 63Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practice64 Chapter Two: NaturopathyUCSF Center for the Health Professions or PhD in biochemistry with additional training in naturopathy may become a certified naturopathic physician \"(American Naturopathic Medical Certification and Accreditation Board, 2000). A naturopathic doctor holding a second medical degree may also qualify to take the written exam. 2) American Board Certified Naturopath The following are prerequisites for certification: a. graduation from the following naturopathic programs: Clayton College of Natural Health,Trinity College of Natural Health,International College of Naturopathy,Herbal Healer Academy, and/or b. equivalent education and experience in health care, and c. pass the written examination. To date, ANMCAB certification is not recognized legally by any state. However, two years ago, a bill was introduced in Texas that would have required naturopaths practicing in that state to become reg-istered (Texas State Naturopathic Medical Association, 2000). The primary requirement for registra-tion would be board certification from the ANMCAB. Although the bill died in the house, the TexasState Naturopathic Medical Association hopes the bill will be reintroduced.Chapter Two: Naturopathy 65Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practice Section D Education and Training of Naturopaths What are the education and training opportunities (didactic and clinical) for would-be members of the profession? Are educational programs standardized and/or accredited? Can future professionals specialize in certain areas? 16 Many educational and training opportunities exist for naturopaths, and the range of opportunities varies depending on the school. While many of the programs provide residential and on-sitecoursework, a significant number of them offer distance learning opportunities via traditionalcorrespondence or electronic means. Length of programs varies considerably. A few programs are 3 -4 years long but the majority offer degrees for 2 years or less of education. Table 17 provides anonexclusive list of schools providing training for naturopaths. Where available, information aboutrequirements for admission, courses included in the training program, type of program, length ofprogram, existence of a residency, apprenticeship or internship, and the degree or certification attainedupon completion are provided. Table 17 is incomplete due to unavailability of some information. Standardization and accreditation Educational opportunities in naturopathy are not standardized across the United States and Canada. However, several schools are accredited by the same organizations and offer similar training. Severalschools that offer education and training in naturopathy are accredited by the American NaturopathicMedical Certification and Accreditation Board and the American Association of DruglessPractitioners. Both organizations are professional trade associations and neither is recognized by fed-eral or state governments. Several schools that educate and train naturopaths are not accredited.Westbrook University is an institution that follows the naturopathic philosophy, and is currently notaccredited as they seek accreditation from an organization recognized by the Department of Education.Table 18 provides a nonexclusive listing of schools that offer training in naturopathy and respectiveaccrediting and licensing organizations, if applicable. 16For a complete list of questions, see Dower et al., Profiling the Professions: A Model for Evaluating Emerging Health Professions .

The ANMCAB does consider health care experience a prerequisite to certification. Matching Training to Scope of Practice Because states do not license naturopaths, there is no defined legal scope of practice for them. Although some state associations have defined a professional scope of practice for their members, there is noprofessional scope of practice adopted at a national level for naturopaths. With neither legal scope ofpractice nor a consensus document regarding professional scope of practice, each school may adopt itsown curriculum and degree criteria. Individuals may determine whether and when they are sufficientlyprepared to provide care. Integrated training Naturopaths only utilize modalities and therapies that are non-allopathic in nature. Thus, education in this branch of naturopathy leans heavily toward training in holistic health practices and care. Manyschools, however, offer courses in the basic sciences such as anatomy, physiology, biology, chemistry,microbiology, and immunology. Continuing education and career options Individual practitioners may choose to enhance their curriculum or practice by participating in workshops or seminars. Some naturopaths seek additional training if they wish to specialize in aparticular therapy such as homeopathy or acupuncture. Those who wish to teach in the field maychoose to complete a doctoral program. Naturopaths may follow several career avenues after completion of a diploma or certification program. Some of these routes include naturopathic or nutritional consulting, owning ormanaging natural health retail businesses, authoring or publishing books or magazine articles onvarious natural health topics, conducting seminars and workshops, appearing on radio ortelevision programs focusing on holistic health, working with outreach groups in developing Chapter Two: Naturopathy 73Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practice74 Chapter Two: NaturopathyUCSF Center for the Health Professions 17For a complete list of questions, see Dower et al., Profiling the Professions: A Model for Evaluating Emerging Health Professions . UCSF Center for the Health Professions, 2001.countries to promote holistic health among indigenous peoples, and developing and marketing natural health products. Because naturopaths generally are not regulated by law, there are no legal requirements for continuing education. However, individuals certified by the American Naturopathic Medical Certification andAccreditation Board must attain 20 continuing education units annually in order to retain certification.Continuing education is awarded for attending seminars, writing technical papers, teaching, work-shops, or attending conferences in naturopathy and natural health care alternatives. Faculty and curriculum development To our knowledge, there are no national or regional associations for teachers at schools of naturopathy. In many professions, these associations are typically involved in curriculum review and revision.Curriculum review is currently performed at the schools themselves. Many schools of naturopathy havecreated academic advisory committees that review the curriculum. Section E Proactive Practice Model and Viability of Profession of Naturopathy What efforts has the profession made to develop practice guidelines, treatment protocols and interprofessional collaboration on clinical care? How are rates of patient satisfaction? How is the profession developing new modalities? How accessible are members of the profession to the public? What groups and associations are working to promote the profession? 17 To our knowledge, there are no nationally accepted practice guidelines or standards of care for naturopaths. Nor are there any nationally recognized interprofessional guidelines for practice,standard of care, consulting, or referral. However, individual practitioners refer clients/patients tomembers of other professions when deemed appropriate. To our knowledge, there are no data available on patient satisfaction, provider/patient relationships, diversity, or cultural appropriatenessof care for naturopaths. To advance the profession, the American Naturopathic Medical Association offers an annual convention for naturopaths. The convention provides networking and educational opportunities fornaturopaths as well as individuals interested in learning about naturopathic modalities and practice.Some state associations also provide a conference for its members. For example, the California StateNaturopathic Medical Association also offers a conference on an annual basis for members in thestate of California. Table 19 provides information on national professional associations in the field of naturopathy, and includes total membership, categories of members, and requirements for membership. Manyassociations have membership categories for individuals who are retired or full-time students.Associate memberships are often available for those who are not practicing naturopaths but wishto support the efforts of the association. The American Naturopathic Medical Association iscommitted to the philosophy and science of natural therapies and primarily opposes legislationthat may prohibit the professional scope of practice for naturopaths. The Coalition for NaturalHealth also supports the naturopathic practitioner 's right to practice as well as the consumer 's freedom of choice regarding natural health practitioners and therapies. \"CNH actively opposes legislation that would restrict or revoke a naturopath 's right to provide consultation and make rec- ommendations aimed at educating the consumer about natural health-related techniques andchoices that promote a healthier lifestyle. CNH actively supports legislation that protects rightsof naturopaths and other practitioners of holistic health modalities to practice. \"(Coalition for Natural Health, 2000) Several state associations have also been organized for naturopaths. Most state naturopathic associations require proof of graduation from a school of naturopathy for membership. Members ofstate associations may also include students, retirees, or individuals interested in supporting the Chapter Two: Naturopathy 75Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practice76 Chapter Two: NaturopathyUCSF Center for the Health Professions TABLE 19.

Some of the state associations have considerable numbers of members. For example, the California State Naturopathic Medical Association (an affiliate of the AmericanNaturopathic Medical Association) reports having 550 members and the California NaturopathicAssociation reports having 98 members. 18Chapter Three: Health Care Professionals Using Naturopathic Modalities Some health care professionals who are trained and licensed in their initial profession are expanding their practices to include naturopathic treatments and modalities. This group of individuals is hard todelineate 19and do not constitute a single emerging profession as the model template of questions was envisioned to address. However, we include some information about these professionals in this casestudy of naturopathic practice because their presence contributes to the complexity of the emergingprofessions of naturopathic medicine and naturopathy. Allopathic medical doctors make up the majority of this group. Many physicians who have trained in conventional medical schools are choosing to add holistic therapies, including many of the naturopathicmodalities, to their practice. Allopathic physicians trained in naturopathic or other complementary andalternative medicine techniques have the ability to practice both allopathic and naturopathic medicinebecause state Medical Practice Acts generally provide the medical profession all-inclusive practiceauthority, which includes all health care services (Finocchio et al., 1998). In light of this move towardintegrative medicine, states such as Texas are initiating practice guidelines for physicians practicingalternative and complementary medicine (Texas Administrative Code title 22, part 9 \u00a7 200.3, 1998). Education and training in naturopathic practice for health care professionals cover a broad range of options, length of program and quality of coursework. Some schools of naturopathy offer specializedtraining for persons holding a doctorate or a health practitioner license, e.g., Doctor of Medicine(M.D.), Doctor of Osteopathy (D.O.), Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.), Licensed Acupuncturist(L.Ac.), Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.), Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), Doctor of VeterinaryMedicine (D.V.M.), Physician 's Assistant (P .A.), Registered Nurse (R.N.), etc. Because many of these health professionals already have a science and/or clinical background, training primarily consists ofcourses in naturopathic modalities. Table 20 provides information about some of the schools providingsuch coursework for health care professionals.

Naturopathic medicine is distinguished bythe principles which underlie and determine its practice. These principles are based upon theobjective observation of the nature of health and disease, and are continually reexamined in the lightof scientific advances. Methods used are consistent with these principles and are chosen upon the basisof patient individuality. Naturopathic physicians are primary health care practitioners, whose diversetechniques include modern and traditional, scientific and empirical methods. The following principlesare the foundation for the practice of naturopathic medicine: Principles The Healing Power of Nature ( Vis Medicatrix Naturae ) The healing power of nature is the inherent self-organizing and healing process of living systems which establishes, maintains and restores health. Naturopathic medicine recognizes this healing process to beordered and intelligent. It is the naturopathic physician 's role to support, facilitate and augment this process by identifying and removing obstacles to health and recovery, and by supporting the creationof a healthy internal and external environment. Identify and Treat the Causes ( Tolle Causam ) Illness does not occur without cause. Causes may originate in many areas. Underlying causes of illness Appendix A 81Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practiceand disease must be identified and removed before complete recovery can occur. Symptoms can be expressions of the body 's attempt to defend itself, to adapt and recover, to heal itself, or may be results of the causes of disease. The naturopathic physician seeks to treat the causes of disease, rather than tomerely eliminate or suppress symptoms. First Do No Harm ( Primum Non Nocere ) Naturopathic physicians follow three precepts to avoid harming the patient: Naturopathic physicians utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful effects, and apply the lease possible force or intervention necessary to diagnose illness andrestore health. Whenever possible the suppression of symptoms is avoided as suppression generally interferes with the healing process. Naturopathic physicians respect and work with the vis medicatrix naturae in diagnosis, treatment and counseling, for if this self-healing process is not respected the patient may be harmed. Doctor As Teacher ( Docere ) The original meaning of the word \"doctor \"is teacher. A principal objective of naturopathic medicine is to educate the patient and emphasize self-responsibility for health. Naturopathic physicians alsorecognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. Treat the Whole Person Health and disease result from a complex of physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physiciansencourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. Naturopathic medicinerecognizes the harmonious functioning of all aspects of the individual as being essential to health.The multifactorial nature of health and disease requires a personalized and comprehensive approachto diagnosis and treatment. Naturopathic physicians treat the whole person taking all of thesefactors into account. 82 Appendix AUCSF Center for the Health ProfessionsPrevention Naturopathic medical colleges emphasize the study of health as well as disease. The prevention of disease and the attainment of optimal health in patients are primary objectives of naturopathicmedicine. In practice, these objectives are accomplished through education and the promotion ofhealthy ways of living. Naturopathic physicians assess risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to disease,and make appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness. Naturopathicmedicine asserts that one cannot be health in an unhealthy environment and is committed to thecreation of a world in which humanity may thrive. Practice Naturopathic Methods Naturopathic medicine is defined primarily by its fundamental principles. Methods and modalities are selected and applied based upon these principles in relationship to the individual needs of each patient.Diagnostic and therapeutic methods are selected from various sources and systems and will continue toevolve with the progress of knowledge. Naturopathic Practice Naturopathic practice includes the following diagnostic and treatment modalities: utilization of all methods of clinical and laboratory diagnostic testing including diagnostic radiology and other imagingtechniques; nutritional medicine, dietetics and therapeutic fasting; medicines of mineral, animal andbotanical origin; hygiene and public health measures; naturopathic physical medicine includingnaturopathic manipulative therapies; the use of water, heat, cold, light, electricity, air, earth,electromagnetic and mechanical devices, ultrasound, and therapeutic exercise; homeopathy,acupuncture; psychotherapy and counseling; minor surgery and naturopathic obstetrics (naturalchildbirth). Naturopathic practice excludes major surgery and the use of most synthetic drugs. Prepared for the Special Committee on the Definition of Naturopathic Medicine Dr. Pamela Snider and Dr. Jared Zeff, Co-Chairs Appendix A 83Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic PracticeGuidelines of Naturopathic Medical Practice Notice: Guidelines, by their very nature, cannot apply to all situations, and they are not intended to substitute for clinical and professional judgment. They provide a context for practice, rather than a prescription. I. INTRODUCTION A. The purpose of guidelines of practice is to: 1. Provide general criteria as guidelines for the daily practice of naturopathic medicine. 2. Identify the responsibilities of the naturopathic physician to the public and to maintain public safety. 3. Ensure that the interests of public health are maintained.4. Provide state boards, licensing and federal agencies guidelines with which to evaluate professional actions. 5. Provide a template for newly licensed states to develop guidelines based on licensing laws.6. Provide assurance of uniform agreement among the naturopathic profession as to the principles and practice of naturopathic medicine. 7. Periodically review and, where necessary, modify guidelines of practice and care in order to assure public safety, compliance with public health standards and to accommodate the ongoing advances in medical thought. B. Definition of terms: 1. Guidelines - general rules, criteria or models established by custom or authority for comparison or measurement. 2. Care - supervision, charge; in the care of a doctor. 84 Appendix AUCSF Center for the Health Professions3. Practice - the use by a health care professional of knowledge and skill to provide a service in the: a. Prevention of illness.b. Diagnosis and treatment of disease.c. Maintenance of health. 4. Service - to be of assistance, to render aid.5. Guidelines of Practice - the general authority, custom or model by which health care is delivered by the naturopathic physician shall include, but not be limited to: a. Prevention of illness/disease.b. Diagnosis and treatment of illness/disease.c. Maintenance of health. 6. Guidelines of Care - the general models, criteria or rules by which the physician undertakes supervision or care of the individual patient. C. Definition of naturopathic medicine: Please refer to the \"Definition of Naturopathic Medicine \"which accompanies this document. This document is incomplete and not to be reproduced without including the accompanying definition . D. Scope of practice: 1. The scope of a naturopathic physician 's practice is eclectic and dynamic in nature. 2.

Individual physicians may choose to specialize in certain methods, modalities or areas of practice within the 86 Appendix AUCSF Center for the Health Professionsscope of general practice. In those instances the physician is obligated to: 1. Notify the patient and their colleagues of the nature of any such limitations. This may be accomplished by notification at the time of first visit; on the physician 's letterhead or business care; or by advertisement. 2. Any physician who has a limited practice is obligated to make appropriate referrals if requested by the patient or deemed necessary by the physician. 3. A naturopathic physician trained as a primary care family practice physician may choose to emphasize or specialize in a specific area either singly or within the scope of a general practice. F. Code of ethics: Refer to position paper entitled Code of Ethics. G. Naturopathic physician 's responsibility: Naturopathic physicians are trained as primary care family practice physicians and have a responsibility to the patient to provide the best health care available.

Appropriate physical examination.5. Appropriate laboratory and radiographic analysis.6. Appropriate referral when necessary.7. Thorough history.8. Appropriate follow up.9. Accurate diagnosis. Appendix A 87Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic PracticeH. Patients are entitled to: 1. Compliance with state, local and public health guidelines by naturopathic physicians. 2. Treatment with respect and dignity.3. Respect for privacy.4. Honest and ethical treatment.5. Confidentiality. I. The responsibility of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicans: The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians through its membership and House of Delegates is responsible for the development, ongoing review, modification and implementation ofguidelines of practice and care. These shall be subject to review every 5 years at the discretion of theBoard of Directors. II.PATIENT EVALUATION A.Record Keeping 1. All naturopathic physicians should keep clear and concise chart notes documenting patient care. 2. It is important that the record be legible, orderly, competent, and that abbreviations/symbols employed are commonly used and understood. 3. There are several important reasons for keeping charts. a. Memory for ongoing care.b. Communicating with other health care professionals.c. In-office research.d. Important administrative and legal documents.e. Basis of peer review process. 88 Appendix AUCSF Center for the Health Professions4. It is recommended that the Problem Oriented Medical Record, also known as the SOAP format, be used as the standard form for keeping records. B. Data collection sources: 1. The individual affected. 2. Family, friends.3. Medical records may be obtained from previous physicians, or other health care providers, for the purpose of patient evaluation. C. Subjective: The History 1. The written record of the patient history should include the following information. Patient intake forms may be used for these purposes. a. Identifying Data: Name, sex, age, relationship status, occupation, nationality.b. Chief Complaint: Best done in the patient 's own words and a priority of complaints from most to least important may be assigned. c. Present Illness: State the problem(s) as it is at the moment, clarifying the time course in a chronological manner. Include any concurrent medical problems. d. Past Medical History: Previous illnesses, surgeries, medications, hospitalizations, childhood illnesses, accidents or injuries, pregnancies. e. Current Health Status: Allergies (drug, food or inhalant), current medications and supplements (prescription and OTC), immunization history, tobacco, alcohol or recreational drug use, exercise and leisure activities, sleep habits, diet (breakfast,lunch, dinner, snacks), environmental hazards. f. Family History: Diagramming familial tendencies, genetic predispositions and infectious diseases. g. Psychosocial: Brief biography, family/home situation, occupation, lifestyle, emotional maker-up, stressors, typical day 's events. Appendix A 89Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practiceh. Review of systems: Placed in a structured system-by-system ROS section, or simply writing out the positive findings and the pertinent negatives. D. Objective: Physical Exam, mental status, lab findings. 1. Using a form will simplify the process. A standard format includes: Patient 's general appearance, vital signs and the results of the rest of the examination, be it regional or comprehensive. 2. If a mental status exam was done it should be included here, as well as results of pertinent laboratory studies. E. Assessment: 1. In the establishment of the diagnosis, the following types of diagnostic criteria may be used by the naturopathic physician. a. Conventional medical diagnostic criteria, as found under section IIC & IID.b. Other diagnostic criteria may be used, including those of non western medical traditions such as Ayurvedic, oriental etc. c. A combination of conventional and other diagnostic methods 2. Diagnostic criteria must be consistent with other health care disciplines with utilize the same criteria. 3. Physicians utilizing diagnostic criteria which are other than conventional and/or experimental are also encouraged to apply conventional forms when: a. The patient is also being evaluated by another health care provider for the same or a related condition, in order to maintain continuity among the different disciplines of medicine and to assure quality patient care. b. When faced with a life threatening or degenerative illness when there is a possibility that interventive therapies may be needed. c. The physician knows that the patient will need referral for the same or other illness. 90 Appendix AUCSF Center for the Health Professionsd. At the patient 's request. e. As required by state laws. F. Plan: The naturopathic physician develops a specific written health plan for each patient which is: 1. Rational, i.e., it is: a. Based on identified needs.b. Realistic in its goals.c. Practical in light of the patient 's condition and situation. d. In the best interest of the patient.e. Logical in sequence and internally consistent.f. Prioritized to the patient 's most pressing conditions. g. Compatible with other therapies the patient may be undergoing.h. Cost effective.i. Flexible to accommodate new developments/findings.j. Experimental only with informed consent and only in areas of doctor expertise. 2. Based on proper assessment, including: a. Ruling out/identifying life-threatening or hidden condition with appropriate history, examination and testing, including referral for specialized evaluation,when appropriate. b. Allowing for timely ongoing reassessment. 3. Based on Naturopathic principles including: a. Stimulating the patient 's vital force to promote healing or, in special instances, supplementing or replacing the action of the vital force when the patient is unable to respond to curative treatment. b. Removing the cause of conditions, when known.c. Choosing treatments which pose the least risk of patient harm.d. Individualizing treatments to the whole patient, including referral to appropriate adjunctive health resources for specialized therapies. Appendix A 91Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practicee. Educating the patient to participate responsibly in his or her own health care and to learn principles for building of health and preventing future disease. f. Involving, when appropriate, others significant to the patient in the treatment plan.g. Prevention of disease. 4. Based on a self-evaluation model: a. A mechanism for timely evaluation of plan effectiveness.b. A mechanism for timely modification of plans, including referral to other appropriate practitioners. III. EVALUATION OF PATIENT 'S PROGRESS A. Physician/patient responsibility - Progress is ultimately determined by the physician, in concert with the patient. Family members may be involved in assessment of progress, and may beconsulted by the physician to aid in these determinations. Although final assessment must restwith the physician, this is only meaningful when the patient understands and accepts the adviceof the physician. If the patient disagrees with the physician over assessment of progress, which cannot be resolved by the application of objective criteria, the patient should be encouraged to seek asecond opinion. B. How the evaluation is made: 1. Evaluation of medical progress includes two aspects, the subjective and the objective. a. Subjective evaluation or assessment is primarily the determination of the patient. Such assessment is solicited and recorded by the physician, and is a gauge of progress. b. Objective measurement of progress occurs in several forms. 1. The first form is in determining the restoration of function or decrease in symptom. This can be done by physical measurements, function scales, etc. 2. Another method is by laboratory or radiographic analysis.3. Objective measurements may also include the traditional or empirical such 92 Appendix AUCSF Center for the Health Professionsas pulse, tongue, iris, reflex point, \"applied kinesiology \"or whichever of the traditional methods the physician employs, including experimental. 4. A fourth kind of objective assessment would include the experimental forms. Physicians are encouraged to develop the practice of naturopathic medicine by experimenting with methods of assessment, as appropriate.Experimental methods should be used in conjunction with conventional and traditional methods of evaluation (see guidelines for education and research). 2. Evaluation: The evaluation would begin with an \"abstract \"of the history and physical, recapping the findings in a way that supports the differential diagnosis or working diagnosis.Included would be some explanation of the analysis and reasoning that went into it.This may also include: a. What type of care is needed, including immediacy, acute, chronic, long or short term.b. A discussion of naturopathic considerations would include: Tolle Causam , Vis Medicatrix Naturae or vital force. c. The patient 's ability to respond to treatment would also be assessed by the physician. The judgment is based on past medical history and the physician 's subjective assessment. C. Physician response 1. A patient 's progress measured against the physician 's prognosis will determine the physician 's response to treatment. a. If assessed progress is deemed appropriate, the treatment plan would be continued. Treatment would be discontinued when sufficient progress has been achieved, or revised, based upon the patient 's response. b. Lack of appropriate progress could indicate the need for reevaluation of the treatment plan, or it may indicate need for reevaluation of the condition or underlying basis of the condition being treated. Appendix A 93Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practicec. In cases where no progress is made, at some point the determination to refer the patient for consultation with another physician may be necessary. This prerogative always lies with the patient but is also the responsibility of the physician. If the physician determines that s/he has reached the limit of time or expertise after which no further progress could be expected, referral may be appropriate. The timing of this determination is based in part upon the prognosis in the patient 's case. It is assumed that a referral for this purpose will be made in a timely manner, to preserve the health of the patient. IV. PATIENT PARTICIPATION IN HEALTH A. Patient 's rights - recognizing that patients are inherently responsible for their own health, the naturopathic physician is committed to their right of: 1. Informed consent.2. To have all information provided for them to make informed and educated decisions. a. The naturopathic physician is obligated to present the patient with all the options for medical care in an unbiased manner. b. The physician has the right to, and may express, opinions as to the quality of the different types of health care options, if the patient requests these options. 3. Freedom of choice in health care. B. Choice of medical care is understood to ultimately be the patient 's. 1. Recognizing that the disease process is the patient 's, the decision for treatment is ultimately also the patient 's. 2. The physician is strongly encouraged not to make the choice for the patient if requested by him/her. 94 Appendix AUCSF Center for the Health ProfessionsC. Physician 's role in patient 's illness is to: 1. Provide guidance for the patient. This may include the use of printed educational or informational materials, counseling or referral to appropriate agencies. 2. Provide optimal care, which may include referral to institutions or physicians which can better provide those services. 3. Inform patients of their progress, by letter or phone consultation, through family or individual conferences, by periodic or yearly evaluations. 4. Refer patient if no progress is being made in their treatment after a reasonable length of time.5. Change treatment protocol based upon reevaluation of the case. D. Appropriateness of patient participation 1. Patient participation in their own health care is encouraged by naturopathic physicians as it is recognized that such participation leads to better compliance and a faster recovery. 2. The physician must assess whether the patient has the ability to participate; this assessment should include: a. Ability of the patient to understand the nature of the illness.b. Ability of the patient to understand the medical options available and their consequences. c. The patient 's mental status. d. Ability of the patient to make an informed consent. E. Setting priorities and goals: 1. Who may determine: a. The physician, patient or a combination of both may set the goals and priorities.b. If in the opinion of the physician, the patient makes a choice that may be harmful, the physician may: Appendix A 95Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practice1. Refuse to participate further in the health care of the patient. This is accomplished both verbally and in writing. 2. Refer the patient to other qualified health care providers. 2. Family participation: a. Family members may participate at the discretion of the patient or the physician.b. In the event that patients are unable to make choices for themselves or participate in their health care, their spouse, parent, eldest or designated child or court appointed guardian or advocate may participate on their behalf. F. Revising health care plans - Health care plans need to be reviewed periodically, as determined by the physician. These commonly occur at each visit and would be also reviewed at other times if thepatient fails to progress. V. NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIAN 'S ROLE IN HEALTH PROMOTION A. Prevention 1. Naturopathic medicine emphasized the prevention of disease. This is accomplished through education and the promotion of healthy ways of living. The naturopathic physician assesses risk factors and hereditary susceptibility to disease, and makes appropriate interventions to prevent illness. Naturopathic medicine asserts that one cannot be healthy in an unhealthy environment, and strives to create a world in which humanity may thrive (see the Definition of Naturopathic Medicine). 2. Naturopathic physicians therefore have a wellness orientation. a. Encouraging the individual towards independence and self-direction.b. Viewing health optimization as the ultimate goal rather than crisis intervention.c. Assisting health optimization as the ultimate goal rather than crisis intervention.d. Reinforcing positive behavior patterns. 96 Appendix AUCSF Center for the Health ProfessionsB. Public health 1. The naturopathic physician follows the guidelines of the public health service. a. Reporting diseases: Observe and be subject to all laws and regulations relative to reporting births and all matters pertaining to the public health, with equal rights and obligations as physicians and practitioners of other schools of medicine (from Hawaii Revised Status 455-8 and ORS 685.040). b. Keeping up with public health data. 1. Center for Disease Control updates.2. State health department updates. c. Informing the public. 2. Methods by which prevention and maintenance of health may be achieved. a. Employ a variety of naturopathic interventions to assist individuals to achieve their optimum health. b. Periodic screening for common risk factors such as: 1. Elevated serum (blood) cholesterol2. Hypertension3. Obesity c. Periodic screening for specific diseases such as: 1. Cancer2. Coronary artery disease3. Diabetes4. Glaucoma5. Osteoporosis6. Thyroid dysfunction d. Immunization 1. Seen AANP position paper2. Informed consent Appendix A 97Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practicee. Preventive methods 1. Natural foods diet, allergen avoidance2. Antioxidants3. Quality air and sunshine4. Avoidance of environmental hazards (sunburn, fluorescent lights, VDT 's, etc.) 5. Hygiene and sanitation6. Elimination of body wastes (colonic irrigation, etc.)7. Exercise and posture8. Botanical and homeopathic medicines9. Stress reduction and management10. Mental hygiene11. Self actualization f. Health education a. Identify the learning needs of the individual.b. Use appropriate teaching techniques to meet the individual 's learning needs. c. Evaluate the teaching carried out. VI. Guidelines for education and research (These recommendations do not supercede established state guidelines.) A. Continuing education recommendations 1. Continuing education requirements shall be recommended for all naturopathic physicians, including those who practice in unlicensed states. The physician should complete a minimum of 20 hours annually which may come from the following sources: a. Professional level courses which pertain directly to the medical aspect of naturopathic practice. 98 Appendix AUCSF Center for the Health Professions1. These include approved CE hours in licensed states. 2. Business courses are not applicable. b. Independent study which includes preparation time for those who teach medical students or for professional level courses. 1. This does not include public talks, preparation time for handouts or visual aids. c. Group study with case review, one hour for every three hours.d. Preceptorships with licensed physicians or institutions, one hour for every three hours. e. Involvement with examination writing, cut scoring, review and research, one hour for every three hours. 2. Each physician shall keep a record of continuing education activities, which may be done by the state Board of Naturopathic Examiners. B. Research guidelines - recommendations 1. Clearly explain to the patient verbally and in writing: a. What the protocol involves.b. What other treatment options exist.c. The length of time of the protocol.d. The level of safety/risks of the protocol or its individual parts.e. The cost of the protocol. 2. The studies must be humanitarian in that they do not knowingly or by neglect cause bodily harm or significant emotional harm to the participants. 3. Review of the study design by a review committee would be required for those studies which present potential risk to the participant, and would be recommended for those studies which present little possibility of harm to the patient. a. The review committee shall consist of three or more physicians or specialists in the related field(s) which shall review and approve the study. Appendix A 99Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practiceb. At least one member of the review committee shall be knowledgeable in the area of research design. c. The physician in charge of the study shall be responsible for obtaining approval from an appropriately qualified review committee and for keeping written documents of the approval until completion and publication of the study. 4. Documentation of research a. Case studies - no documentation is required other than standard charting procedures. 1. Careful and detailed follow-up is recommended.2. It is recommended that case study protocols and their results be kept on file so that they may be used for providing the basis of further study and research. b. Formal studies - the following documentation is recommended: 1. Statement of purpose.2. Summary of pertinent literature review.3. Study design and protocol.4. Screening requirements for participants.5. Participant consent forms.6. Analysis of methods.7. Raw data.8. Data analysis and conclusions. C. Critical review of studies and new methods. 1. Introduction: Critical review of new methods in medicine needs to take into account the potential that the methods have for causing harm to the public. The naturopathicmedical profession endeavors to avoid unnecessary judgment of new methods and theories but rather to review them critically, embracing those which stand the test of time and scientific scrutiny. 100 Appendix AUCSF Center for the Health Professionsa. Peer review - as per section VIII B3. b. Peer review infractions: 1. In the event that the guidelines under section VIII B are not met by a physician conducting a case study or formal study protocol,a review may be undertaken by the Research Review Committee (RRC) of the AANP . 2. The RRC may notify the physician that they are in violation of the research guidelines and may take other actions as appropriate. D. Publication 1. There are no additional guidelines for publication of research in natural medicine than those which already exist. Articles submitted to the different publications, including the Journal of Naturopathic Medicine , shall follow the guidelines established by those publications. 2. The naturopathic physician is strongly encouraged to publish the results of any research conducted. For those physicians who are conducting clinical trials with marginally proven therapies or diagnostic procedures, the profession of naturopathic medicine considers it crucial that the results of their studies be made available for other physicians to critically and unbiasedly examine. Principal Authors: Rita Bettenburg, ND, Thomas A. Lori the 1995 AANP Appendix A 101Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic PracticeAppendix B: Standards of Practice \u2014Canadian Naturopathic Association 1.0 INTRODUCTION Standards of practice are the criteria which guide the day to day actions of naturopathic doctors in the delivery of care and service to the patient and the community. They also serve as the basis for theevaluation of the behavior of practitioners by disciplinary and judicial functions. This document provides basic standards for the most predictable circumstances, means for developing standards for specific conditions, methods for applying them in the assessment of the actions ofpractitioners, ways they can be modified and finally the necessity for disseminating them to regulatedpractitioners. All standards are derived from the same body of knowledge that practitioners use to provide services. Methods of identifying this body in a concise and universally accepted form are described herein. The objectives of this document are to identify the responsibilities of naturopathic doctors to the public and to establish a means for evaluating their professional actions. The purpose of this document is to provide a clear, unambiguous and consistent format for the identification, development and implementation of standards of practice that applies to naturopathicdoctors in the delivery of direct patient care services and other times where the practitioner is in aposition of public trust. 102 Appendix BUCSF Center for the Health Professions2.0 BASIC STANDARDS OF PRACTICE Each naturopathic doctor shall: 1. Have knowledge of and comply with the laws and regulations governing the practice of naturopathic medicine in the jurisdiction of practice. 2. Provide a level of care consistent with each patient 's individual condition. 3. Actively consult with and/or refer to other health professionals when the patient condition so warrants in providing optimal care. Consultation or referral may occur with or without continuingnaturopathic care as appropriate to the patient condition and situation. 4. Treat each patient with respect and human dignity regardless of the individual 's health condition, personal attributes, national origin or handicap and shall not discriminate on the basis of age, sex,race, religion, economic or social status, or sexual preferences in the rendering of naturopathicmedical services. 5. Respect the patient 's right to privacy by protecting all confidential information. 6. Deal honestly with all patients, colleagues, public institutions and legal bodies, and refrain from giving any false, incomplete or misleading information. 7. Report any health care provider whose character or competence are deficient or who is grossly negligent or reckless. 8. Maintain clear and adequate patient care and billing records for at least three years after the last visit by the patient. Appendix B 103Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practice9. Formulate an assessment / diagnosis to a level consistent with the patient based on the knowledge, training, and expertise of the naturopathic doctor and the technology and the tools available to theprofession. 10. Communicate the appropriate assessment to the patient and only communicate a diagnosis to the patient which has been conclusively determined using the training and tools available to thenaturopathic profession. 11. Advise the patient regarding significant side effects from the treatment plan.12. Monitor each patient at a level consistent with the degree of management being exercised.13. Refrain from providing primary care management for any patient where the relationship with the patient (such as family member, close personal friend) would serve to interfere with the doctor 's objective judgment. 3.0 CASE SPECIFIC STADARDS -GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS It is recognized that the basic standards cannot anticipate every potential situation faced by a practitioner, nor predict the changes in technology and knowledge with time. This section is a guidefor the development of standards of practice for a particular incident or presentation. 1. Identify the scope of the doctor, i.e. primary care management, co-treatment, consulting treatment, expert testimony, etc. 2. Identify the scope of the problem, i.e. the complaint, the specific naturopathic medical area of concern, (e.g. manual manipulation, allergy, diagnostic radiology, etc.), and all other pertinent datasuch as history, diagnosis, other diagnostic data, etc. 104 Appendix BUCSF Center for the Health Professions3. Identify the body of knowledge to be used in assessing the problem in accordance with the following criteria:a) Clearly and concisely cover the problem. While it is rare to find a particular situation specificallyaddressed in the literature, the entirety of the problem must be dealt with in such a manner thatall conclusions reached are clearly and concisely drawn from a body of information that isapplicable to the problem with no possibility of an incorrect conclusion being drawn by materialout of context.b) Universally accepted by the naturopathic profession. The information used must be from sourcesaccessible and generally accepted by the profession. Such sources include textbooks, journals,information taught in the naturopathic colleges, and recognized experts in the naturopathiccommunity or in the specialty in question. As with all health care professions, reliable expert dataand testimony from sources outside of the naturopathic community is acceptable.c) Verify in writing when testimony from experts or consultants is used and by specific citation withliterature. 4. Basis for a decision. Each decision shall be based on the following: a) Protection of the public and the public interest. This includes risk of physical or mental harm,misrepresentation to the public, billing or costs not consistent with fair and accepted practices, fulldisclosure of treatment and its effects, appropriateness of referral, etc.b) Compliance with applicable law. 4.0 CASE SPECIFIC STANDARDS TO BE APPLIED BY THE NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR TO EACH PATIENT 1. Identify the naturopathic doctor 's role for this specific case. 2. Identify the extent of the patient 's problem: a) Obtain a relevant and complete case history to the need of the specific case and presentation.b) Perform a relevant and complete physical examination. Appendix B 105Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practicec) Obtain or perform relevant and approved screening or diagnostic tests. d) Collect and evaluate all data.e) Make appropriate referral if indicated at this point to the need of the specific case.f ) Make appropriate communication with other involved health professionals. 3. Formulate a relevant assessment and/or diagnosis where possible, based on the history, examination findings, data collected, training and expertise of the naturopathic doctor and the legal scope ofpractice of the profession. 4. Communicate the assessment or diagnosis to the patient.5. Formulate a plan of treatment for the patient based on the best interests of the patient 's welfare, need for and appropriateness of referral, accepted practices and naturopathic body of knowledge. 6. Implement the plan of treatment with informed consent.7. Amend the plan of treatment as appropriate and implement with informed consent. 5.0 APPLICATION OF STANDARDS OF PRACTICE Standards of practice must be evaluated in every case to be certain that they are appropriate and complete. The Board or judicial function must also ensure that the standards being used arechronologically consistent with the case being evaluated, since technology procedures and treatmentprotocols can change rapidly. 6.0 MODIFICATION OF STANDARDS OF PRACTICE As noted, standards of practice are designed to be modified to suit the conditions of the case and the current state of the art of naturopathic medicine. Each time such a change is made, the reasons for the change must 106 Appendix BUCSF Center for the Health Professionsbe documented in the same manner used for the development of new standards, for the purpose of allowing a transparent record for appeal as well as ensuring clear precedent for ensuing cases. The CanadianNaturopathic Association will distribute changes to all other jurisdictions as they are received. 7.0 PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF STANDARDS OF PRACTICE The basic standards of practice and case specific standards of practice shall be distributed to all registrants in a timely manner. Care shall be taken with the case specific standards to protect theprivacy of all involved in their development. 8.0 DEFINITIONS Body of knowledge: The clear, concise information, generally accepted by the naturopathic profession, from which standards of practice are derived. Co-treatment: Treatment of a patient in concert with the doctor providing primary care management of the patient. Consulting treatment: Providing a second opinion or ancillary care for a patient whose primary care management is being provided by another doctor. Disciplinary authority: Any Licensing Board, Disciplinary Board or other governmental function having jurisdiction over the practitioner and acts being investigated. Judicial Function: Any court or other judicial forum with legal jurisdiction over the practitioner and acts being investigated.

Itstheorists widely maintained that all disease was the result of incorrect lifestyle, a poor diet, andimproper care of the body. Germs are not the reason for disease (after all they 're present in a healthy body). Rather, disease is produced by the weakened body 's inability to rid itself, naturally, of these accumulated toxins. Naturopathy in America was founded and named by Benedict Lust (pronounced Loost). German born, Lust moved the America in 1892. He returned to Germany shortly thereafter, dying of tubercu-losis. In 1896, he returned to America, cured, and ready to share the reason why. Lust pioneered manyaspects of natural health in America. Lust opposed many activities deemed dangerous today: the processing of foods, the administration of drugs and narcotics, and legislation restricting personal choice of healthcare. In 1901 he founded Lust 's American School of Naturopathy, offering degrees, through both classroom education and home study. Traditional naturopathy has been practiced in this country steadily since the time of Lust following the principles he set down, although this practice, for a time, was largely overshadowed by the scientificbreakthroughs that catapulted conventional medicine into the forefront. Today 's economic challenges facing the medical industry, combined with other evident limitations of the allopathic medical model(e.g. numerous strains of bacteria developing an immunity to a variety of antibiotics) have many par-ticipants giving traditional naturopathy a serious second look. 110 Appendix DUCSF Center for the Health ProfessionsAppendix E: Complementary and Alternative Health Care Client Bill of Rights, Minnesota 146A.11 Complementary and alternative health care client bill of rights.
