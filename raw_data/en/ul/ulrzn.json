It has following unique features: No added sugars and completely free of molasses. This makes the muesli highly suitable for sober breeds or horses that need a reduced sugar-intake With a correct omega 3/6 ratio to contribute to an improved fertility, stamina, hoof quality, skin, fur, and ability to concentrate and performance The high fibre level and coarse composition of the muesli stimulate chewing. This results in a high saliva production, which neutralizes fluctuations in pH caused by feed. High level of spelt wheat with natural glucosamine. Glucosamine plays an important role in the development and regeneration of cartilage which is important for flexible and vital joints Garlic is traditionally one of the most used herbs due to its many attributed positive effects on health.
