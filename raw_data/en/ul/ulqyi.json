In fact, an average of 45 million Americans go on a diet every year and spend over $33 billion on detox, cleansing and weight loss products. We spend so much time fixated on our physical body and diet, why not our spiritual body? Perhaps it's time for a Spiritual Cleanse? 5 Signs You Need a Spiritual Cleanse 1.) Are you carrying around baggage from your past? Do you have reoccurring thoughts or stories that you just can't seem to drop and let go of? 2.) Do you feel guilty for something that you did or said? Are you carrying around resentment, or are you feeling burdened by your regrets? 3.) Are you lacking direction or feel confused over what path to take? Do you feel stuck, lost or unmotivated? Does something about your life feel \"off\" to you? 4.) Are you in denial or do you have a hard time accepting events as they are? Are you constantly wishing for things to be different, are you constantly searching for change? 5.) Do you have pent up emotions that are bubbling to the surface? Do you feel wronged or taken advantage of by others? If any of these resonated for you, chances are you in are in need of a Spiritual Cleanse. What is a Spiritual Cleanse? When we do a physical cleanse (diet) there are often a series of rules- eat this, not that, exercise this way etc etc....In a spiritual cleanse however, it is more about [aligning with your truth](http://www.foreverconscious.com/3-ways-to-connect-with-your-soul) and what you need in this present moment. Here are 10 Spiritual Cleanse \"Tasks\", use all of them, or just the ones you feel drawn to. Chances are if you feel a strong emotion towards one as you read it, you need it! Task 1: What Needs to Go: \"The Brain Dump\" Start writing, fast and furiously about everything that is in your mind. This is the brain dump phase where everything needs to come out and be released. This is not a time to hold back, write whatever comes into your mind, challenge yourself to keep writing even if the ideas are not flowing. Aim to write, non-stop for at least 5 minutes until everything that is in your mind is out on paper. Task 2: Sit In Your Emotions Now that you have dumped the thoughts onto the page in front of you, chances are there are a lot of emotions surfacing and bubbling around. Sit in them, allow yourself to fully feel them by crying, screaming, jumping, dancing, drawing etc...do whatever you need to release them. When you resist emotions, they become blocked and develop into [ subconscious patterns](http://www.foreverconscious.com/breaking-the-negative-patterns-of-your-subconscious-mind) that hold you back. When you allow yourself to jump into the emotion fully and freely you can swim past it and come out the other side. Task 3: Sit With your Emotions Now that you have physicalized your emotional mind set and used your body to do some release work, now it is time to really sit with your emotions, in peace and surrender. When you allow yourself to accept your emotions without judgement, when you allow yourself to feel but not engage, when you give yourself permission to feel however you need to feel, that is when you allow the healing and cleansing to occur. Allow any emotions to wash over you, allow yourself to feel them but don't judge or engage with them. Just sit with them, honoring them for all they have taught you, allowing them to move within you without constraint. Task 4: Breath Work: \"Exercise for Your Soul\" Start breathing deeply and slowly. As you take a breath feel the expansion of your belly, rib cage and chest and as you release your breath, feel your stomach soften inwards and your ribs and chest relax. As you take another breath, visualize the breath moving deep through your body- inhale the breath straight down to your toes and up into your head. Imagine the breath is a broom, sweeping out all the old debris of the past. Repeat this process for 5-10 minutes. Task 5: Meditate with Healing Music Put on some meditation or healing music ( I recommend Snatam Kaur) and either lie down or sit in lotus position with your eyes closed. Begin meditating and as you do, allow the music to fill your being and cleanse you. Sit and relax into the song and allow your mind, heart and soul to rest into the vibration. If any thoughts come in, try not to engage but instead focus on watching them as an observer. Aim to meditate for at least 20 minutes. Task 5: Set an Intention, Say a Prayer As soon as you come out of your meditative state, begin writing down or saying aloud a prayer or intention for your cleansing. Go with whatever comes into your heart and mind first, as often that is what your soul is calling upon you to release. Don't spend too much time thinking about your intention, keep it quick, simple and short. Task 6: Forgive and Let Go: \"The Purge\" With your intention in hand, now it is time to release to allow space for your intention to be received. Understand and allow yourself to let go, [forgive yourself](http://www.foreverconscious.com/how-to-honor-and-respect-yourself-in-10-simple-steps), forgive others, find space in your heart to move on from all that does not serve you. You may find it beneficial to write a letter stating your intention to release past experiences or fears and to accept what is. This step can be the most challenging, so be patient and gentle with yourself. Task 7: Ask for Divine Support As part of your \"purge\" ask the divine (your guardian angels, spirit guides or deity) to step in and help you to release and allow forgiveness to enter your heart, mind, body and soul. Ask your [divine support system](http://www.foreverconscious.com/how-to-communicate-with-your-spirit-guides) to help release all that is holding you back from achieving your highest purpose. Ask them to guide you and support you through this process and to deliver to you any necessary people or messages that may help you. Task 8: Receive Your Blessing It is now time for you to reach out to your divine support system and ask for their blessings. Allow yourself to receive their blessings and feel your heart open and expand. You are worthy, you are appreciated and you deserve to receive this blessing- allow yourself to understand and sit with that too. Then, feel the blessings wash over you like waves. Task 9: Give Thanks Now that you are cleansed, it is time to thank all that were part of your journey and process, your divine support system as well as yourself for taking the steps to cleanse and honor your soul and heart. Give thanks to all that has helped and guided you, give thanks to all that threw you off your path, give thanks for all that you have and all that you are. Task 10: Soul \"Maintenance\" Just like any diet plan, if you don't keep up the good habits you acquired during your cleanse, you will soon find yourself back at the beginning. Make the effort to take time out of every day to honor your soul and spiritual self. Meditate, do something creative, take a walk in nature, journal/ write, practice gratitude, do breath work, make it a priority to do things that feel good to you. You can also practice saying this Cleansing Prayer daily (or write your own): \"I cleanse my mind, body and spirit of all resentments, negativity and fears from the past, present and future. I call upon the light of the divine to nourish my heart and soul and to guide me towards my highest path. For this I give my thanks.\" The benefits of a Spiritual Cleanse are endless so, what are you "}
