We work with worker's compensation, auto insurance, and Medicare; please feel free to learn more about our [insurance and payment options](https://danielsdc.com/payment-options). Chiropractic care is made up of holistic adjusting therapies created to support the body's full and proper function by eliminating soft tissue, joint, and spine dysfunctions. The treatments are non-invasive and prioritize the body's natural healing process, intending to avoid surgeries and pain medication. Chiropractors have a unique skill set, focusing on the spine and the musculoskeletal system, which consists of the ligaments, tendons, muscles, nerves, other connective tissues, and joints. Through manipulation of affected areas, pain is relieved, and movement and flexibility are restored. | | Hands-only | | Table-assisted | | Instrument-assisted At our clinic, we rely on manual and instrument-assisted techniques to help your body find its balance naturally. Our thorough assessment will ensure we target the precise area of concern, effectively ending your symptoms. Chiropractic adjustments are the most common way for a chiropractor to realign the spine. This therapy can help with both acute and chronic injuries and offers proven results. While adjustments are generally given to the spine, they can be delivered to other areas of the body. When a vertebra becomes restricted or moves out of place, chiropractic adjustments or spinal manipulations are an effective way to restore it quickly. The primary focus of [your treatment](https://danielsdc.com/what-expect) will be to reestablish the normal position and movement of your spine's vertebrae. We use three different adjustment approaches to help you feel, move, and live better. This hands-only approach is called either Gonstead or Diversified. It's a manual method that provides pressure to a targeted area. Generally, there is a small movement of the vertebrae, releasing air from the joint, which creates a slight noise similar to knuckles cracking. We use the Thompson Drop technique, which offers less pressure on the body than the hands-only approach. During the treatment, the table does most of the work, moving specific areas so the spine and soft tissues can move into the desired place. Using either Activator or Impulse techniques, our doctors use specially designed instruments to create a gentle repetitive tapping sensation over the affected area, aligning and balancing the body. These methods often provide immediate relief and improved movement patterns and range of motion. Other chiropractic services that we may pair with adjustments include: Using in-clinic modalities that work for your body and injury, as well as take-home exercise and stretching techniques, will promote a faster, safer healing process. Spinal manipulations are safe and trusted around the world and have been for centuries. We've seen remarkable results using chiropractic adjustments on multiple patients of varying ages and abilities. Adjusting is fast, painless, and allows the body to heal naturally. Chiropractic care offers several benefits that can improve your overall quality of life, including: Chiropractors emphasize the importance of how the body functions overall. When one area becomes compromised, injuries can occur elsewhere, so understanding how the spine and musculoskeletal system are performing will tell us how to proceed with care. While many healthcare providers depend on pain medication, downtime, and invasive procedures, chiropractic believes in organic healing. In some cases, rest is necessary; however, more complications often occur when we're sedentary for extended periods. Pain can leak into many areas of life and cause stress, anxiety, lack of focus, and make work, socializing, and participating in physical activities challenging. Chiropractic care combines evidence-based support for the body and nurtures physical, mental, and emotional good health. Our clinic has seen success in treating patients with many injuries and symptoms: When you work with Daniels Chiropractic, you can expect a tailored treatment plan built around you.
