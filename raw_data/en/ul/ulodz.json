The world is rapidly changing and these changes will affect everyone. How we meet these changes will depend on our ability to maintain an alignment with the guiding spiritual forces within. At Whitsun, we celebrate that humanity is blessed with a surge of cosmic support that enhances our inner capacity to hold fast with the divine spiritual world \u2014 even in times of great uncertainty. Having experienced an inner shift through the cosmic Easter festival, we are now quickened with forces to help others, so that together we may take a step towards our collective spiritual destiny. "}
