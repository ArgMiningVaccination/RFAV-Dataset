People no longer live and work in homogeneous marketplaces; they are now part of a worldwide economy with competition coming from nearly every continent. For this reason, organisations need diversity to become more creative and open to change. Therefore, maximizing and capitalizing on workplace diversity has become an important issue for management today (Mazur, 2010). South Africa was not immune to this global trend. Pressure is still mounting post-1994, after the creation of the democratic state, to increase the representation of people from diverse backgrounds, especially the previous disadvantaged (women, Blacks, including Coloureds and Indians, and people with disabilities) on various levels in the workplace. Phrases such as \"Affirmative Action\" (AA), Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment\" (BBBEE) and \"employment equity\" (EE) have become common phrases in public discourse due to various government and legislative frameworks and initiatives such as The Basic Conditions of Employment Act (RSA, 1997), The Employment Equity Act (RSA, 1998), the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act (RSA, 2000) and the creation of the Employment Equity Commission (EEC) that requires organisations to submit annually employment equity plans. Since the abolishment of apartheid, the legal basis of this segregation and discrimination, in 1994, a number of legislative frameworks were put in place to reduce discrimination in South Africa in general, but more specifically in the workplace. These developments have resulted in increments in intercultural contacts in the workplace. All of these initiatives have ultimately led to an increase in diversity in the 'New South African' workplace, but it unfortunately, did not prevent discrimination in the workplace. Whites, especially males, still dominate the higher echelons of company hierarchies in especially the private sector and professional services (EEC, 2017). This trend necessitates effective diversity management of organisations in South Africa. This thesis focusses on various features of the organisational climate that could enhance or jeopardize the diversity experiences of employees in the South African workplace. Diversity management The diverse nature of the workforce is a global feature of organisational life and diversity is regarded as a major challenge for many managers globally. There is empirical evidence that highlights the challenges that managers face in managing diversity and equality in the workplace with a number of studies conducted in various fields, such as the health sector (Ali, Burns, & Grant, 2013), sports (Spracklen, Hylton, & Long, 2006), local councils (Senyucel & Phillpott, 2011), public sector (Harrisr & Foster, (Desivilya, Borochowitz, Bouknik, Kalovski, Lavy, & Ore, 2017), and in private sector (Hvidman & Andersen, 2013). Benefits of diversity management Workplace diversity is associated with higher organisational benefits (Joubert, 2017). For instance, cultural diversity is associated with organisational advantages, such as strengthening the organisation's culture, improving the company's global reputation, increasing creativity and innovation, company performance or building loyalty among customers of different origins (Cox & Blake, 1991; Franken, Monga, 2015). It is also associated with increases in productivity, goal attainment, creativity, client- 9 focused services, and an interesting work environment (Joubert, 2017) as well as work team cohesion (Trivedi, 2008). In addition, when diversity is managed effectively, employees learn more about each other so that communication is improved, with less stereotyping and discrimination among the employees (Joubert, 2017). Organisations promoting initiatives based on a multicultural ideology can be expected to be particularly attractive to minorities because diversity is acknowledged and retained (Verkuyten, 2005). Diversity models A number of models have been proposed to explain the nature of diversity; some address processes in multicultural teams (Pelled, Eisenhardt, & Xin, 1999). Other models make a distinction between diversity categories that are noticeable and unchangeable (e.g., age, gender, race, and ethnic background) and those that are underlying, attained, and changeable (e.g., education, technical abilities, functional background, and tenure) (Milliken & Martins, 1996; Pelled, 1996; Pelled et al., 1999). Subjective experience has come to the fore of diversity research with the Social Identity Salience Theory of Garcia-Prieto et al. (2003), building on Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1986); the model emphasizes the flexibility of team members' numerous social identities. Models have also been suggested that explain the effects of diversity, such as the Categorization-Elaboration Model (Van Knippenberg, De Dreu, & Homan, 2004) and Cox's (1993) Interactional Model of Cultural Diversity (IMCD) and the quality of relations in diverse settings (Blau, 1977). The contact hypothesis (Pettigrew, 1998; Pettigrew, Tropp, Wagner, & Christ, 2011) suggests that social contact and interaction are positively related to attraction and liking in heterogeneous groups. However, there are also theories that do not predict improved intergroup relations after contact, such as competition theories (e.g., Mannix & Neale, 2005), according to which ethnic groups compete for scarce resources in society such as education and jobs. The theory of social attraction (Newcomb, 1968) predicts that similarity in attitudes, values, and beliefs facilitates interpersonal attraction and liking. In line with cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957), some have suggested that people will avoid communicating with those they dislike or with those who hold opinions or views differing from their own to reduce the strain produced by the disagreement (Rosenbaum, 1986), which would suggest less communication in heterogeneous organisations than in homogenous organisations. Extant models often deal with the relative (in)effectiveness of heterogeneous (as compared to homogeneous organisations); This thesis would argue that South African organisations need a model that emphasizes the conditions under which people from diverse backgrounds meet and interact in the workplace (forced contact and interaction) and the psychological consequences of such conditions. Acculturation and diversity in the workplace. The diversity that is addressed here results from the difference between the usually monocultural home environment and the multicultural workplace. This way of dealing with diversity has been extensively studied in the acculturation literature (e.g., Berry, 1997). Graves (1967) indicated that acculturation is a term used to describe the process of bidirectional change that takes place when two ethno-cultural groups come into sustained contact with each other. This definition of acculturation implies that dominant and non-dominant cultural groups are influenced 10 and transformed by their intercultural contacts and are expected to modify some aspects of their respective culture as a means of adaptation to ethno-cultural diversity. Acculturation refers to the process of changes as a consequence of continuous first-hand contact between individuals from different cultures (Redfield, Linton, & Herskovits 1936). A central assumption of this thesis is that diversity in the South African workplace, the object of study of this thesis, can be viewed as an acculturation phenomenon. People (mainstreamers and ethnics or migrants) getting into contact with a different cultural background on a frequent basis in the workplace (the dominant culture of the workplace, which is often based on the White business culture in South Africa) are confronted with two decisions to make, namely maintenance of their home (or ethnic) culture in the workplace and participation in the dominant workplace culture. The two independent dimensions (decisions) yield four possibilities when considered in conjunction; these are referred to as acculturation orientations (also labelled styles and strategies). Individuals are called multicultural (mainstreamers) or integrated (ethnics) when they adhere to both cultures, Melting pot (mainstreamers) or assimilated (ethnic) when they adhere to the business culture only, segregated (mainstreamers) or separated (ethnic) when they adhere to their own ethnic culture only, and exclusion (mainstreamers) or marginalized (ethnic) when they adhere to neither. Based on this literature and in line with the interactional model of cultural diversity (Cox, 1993), this thesis distinguishes between acculturation conditions, individual orientations, and outcomes that are relevant for diversity (Arends-T\u00f3th & Van de Vijver, 2006). Conceptual Model of Diversity A conceptual model of diversity is proposed, tested and confirmed in this thesis. The model draws on relevant diversity models mentioned above and on two theoretical frameworks: acculturation models, as studied in cross-cultural psychology (Arends-T\u00f3th & Van de Vijver, 2006; Berry, 1997), and a dual process model of occupational health (Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004). Both models are explained below. The conceptual model is graphically presented in Figure 1 below. Figure 1. Conceptual Dual Process model for Diversity Note: Signs indicate hypothesized directions of the expected relations between variables Positive Antecedents:Acculturation ResourcesNegative Antecedents:Acculturation DemandsIntegration / Approach coping Separation / successPhysical and Psychological Ill-Health Quitting intentions++--++ ++ -Diversity enhancing stream Diversity encumbering stream 11 The Conceptual Model of Diversity proposes positive and negative workplace diversity outcomes (job satisfaction, organisation commitment, subjective experiences of work success and productivity, and intentions to quit and physical and psychological ill-health, respectively), facilitating conditions for diversity in organisations (such as diversity-enhancing practices, e.g. multiculturalism and tolerance), and diversity-constraining conditions (encumbering features such as discrimination, racism, and segregation) to influence occupational adjustment. An ideal workplace would combine the presence of facilitating conditions and the absence of inhibiting conditions. It is assumed that segregation demands, discrimination, and subtle racism contribute to separation orientations of individuals and workplace ill-health and intentions to quit. By contrast, an organisational climate that is supportive of diversity promotes integration orientations and subjective experiences of work success. Organisations with weak pro-diversity practices are likely to pose higher occupational health risks for their employees than those with stronger pro-diversity policies, and in addition, erode the benefits that would have accrued as a result of a diversity enhancing climate. The discussion shifts now to the elements of the conceptual model. Mainstream diversity enhancing antecedents or conditions The conditions in which coping with diversity takes place are important for process and outcomes (Berry, 1997; Bourhis, Moise, Perreault, & Senecal, 1997). Bourhis et al. (1997) stressed the importance of the intergroup attitudes preferred by the majority as determinants of diversity outcomes. Diversity antecedents or conditions define the context and involve both factors dealing with the diverse context (e.g., support and tolerance for diversity, discrimination, racism, and segregation demands) the ethnic context (e.g., ethnic vitality and ethnic social support; Ait Ouarasse, 2004) and individual intercultural (acculturation) orientation. The mainstream or dominant group acculturation conditions that are considered in this thesis include multicultural norms, multicultural norms and mainstream tolerance. Multiculturalism is an ideology aimed at supporting the incorporation of ethnic diversity in the general structure of society (Kallen, 1982). In this thesis, multicultural norms relate to rules prescribing behaviour in a multiethnic context where multicultural practices refer to behaviours that are related to these rules such as respect for differences. Multicultural practices, on the other hand, refer to the actual acknowledgement, recognition, and appreciation of diverse backgrounds in the workplace. Tolerance, acceptance, being open, understanding, and respectful are important aspects of multiculturalism. Tolerance refers to minimization or elimination of discrimination and prejudice (Schalk-Soekar, 2006). This conceptualisation of the interrelatedness of tolerance and multiculturalism is very much in line with the requirements for multiculturalism according to Berry and Kalin (1995), namely intercultural contact and participation in society by all groups, and general support for cultural maintenance by immigrants, low levels of prejudice and intolerance in the population (no discrimination), positive attitudes towards each other should exist among the diverse ethno-cultural groups, a degree of attachment to the larger society should exist, without the derogation of its essential ethno-cultural groups. Mainstream diversity encumbering antecedents or conditions Multiculturalism implies intercultural contact. However, not all intergroup contact reduces prejudice. Some situations prompt enhanced prejudice. Such negative intergroup contact 12 has received less research attention, but renewed consideration to the issue has shed light on this phenomenon (Pettigrew, Tropp, Wagner, & Christ, 2011). Negative contact typically involves situations where the participants feel threatened and do not choose to have contact (Pettigrew et al., 2011), which could be the case in the current workplace in South Africa. These situations frequently occur in work environments characterized by intergroup competition (Pettigrew et al., 2011), such as in the (especially) South African public sector where much emphasis is placed on affirmative action, the redress of past inequalities and black economic empowerment. This thesis focuses on the role of discrimination, racism, and segregation as diversity encumbering conditions in individual acculturation orientations in employee attitudes. Causes of discrimination could be ascribed to different reasons and intentions from different individuals or groups, ranging from the isolation of individuals or groups to attitudes of individuals or groups. Roscigno (2007) reported that allegations of racial discrimination in employment are more likely to arise in the high-wage service and public sectors, and it is perceived that racial discrimination complaints are most likely to be of alleged discriminatory termination or firing, while complaints of discrimination in hiring or promotion are fewer. Vernellia (2008) defines racism as any action or attitude, conscious or unconscious, that undermines an individual or group based on his or her skin colour or race. Friedman (2000) reported that there is no issue other than racism that needs to be so urgently addressed. Dovidio and Gaertner (2000) reported that white employers were less likely to recommend black candidates for positions in the workplace or admission to colleges than white candidates, when the formers' qualifications for the position or admission were less obvious, or even that the appropriate decision to allow blacks to succeed was more ambiguous. Zagefka and Brown (2002) indicate that segregation is about demands exerted on ethnicities to keep to their own, while racism and discrimination refer to negative attitudes during intercultural contact. Barrette, Bourhis, Personnaz, and Personnaz, (2004) have reported that host members do not wish minorities to contaminate their culture, and hence accept that minority groups uphold their heritage culture on condition that they keep their distance. For Berry, Phinney, Sam and Vedder (2006), on the other hand, segregation occurs when individuals or groups become separated from each other, implying minimal or no contact between groups from different cultures. Hofmeyr (2006) has reported that South Africans have little contact with people from other ethnic groups and do not wish to increase future contact with other groups in their private space. It has been suggested that the acculturation strategies, of immigrants (also referred to as orientations or attitudes), also depend on the attitudes held by the larger society and the characteristics of the country of settlement (Berry, 2006). Bourhis et al. (1997), in their Interactive Acculturation Model (IAM), call for the investigation of the role of both mainstream (multicultural or pro-diversity conditions or requirements at work) as well as minority contextual features (integration and separation orientation at work) and attitudes simultaneously. Ethnic and individual acculturation orientations According to Bourhis et al. (1997), a common shortcoming of acculturation models is the lack of importance given to how the host community and the integration policy of the state can shape especially the acculturation preferences of minority group members. The IAM (Bourhis et al., 1997) suggests that the acculturation orientations of ethnic minority members are related to the acculturation orientations of host majority members and should be emphasized and included 13 in empirical studies. Berry's (1980, 2003) bidimensional model of attitudinal acculturation orientations towards one's original culture and a new one is also considered in this thesis. Berry (1980) distinguished four different ethnic and individual acculturation strategies, orientations or attitudes, namely assimilation, integration, separation and marginalization. This thesis considers the mediating role of separation and integration in the relationship between diversity encumbering and diversity-enhancing features, on the one hand, and employee outcomes, on the other hand, respectively. Ethnic separation demands and an individual separation acculturation strategy Various ethnic groups have different attitudes towards cultural adherence and toward having contact with the dominant groups. Research with adolescents (Berry et al., 2006) concluded that separation is an acculturation strategy aimed at preventing the influence dominant groups have on minority groups. Separation is an acculturation strategy that refers to the minority groups who accept their own cultural principles and uniqueness and reject the dominant culture's principles (Berry, 2001). Belonging to the ethnic profile was associated with poorer sociocultural adaptation while belonging to the national profile was associated with moderately poorer psychological and sociocultural adaptation (Berry, 2001). In this thesis, ethnic separation demands refer to pressure from co-ethnics to keep to themselves while and an individual separation strategy refers to an individual's preference to have only contact with co-ethnics. Ethnic integration norms and vitality and an individual integration acculturation orientation Integration involves some degree of maintenance of the home culture, while at the same time members of an ethnic cultural group seek to participate as an integral part of the larger social (diverse) network (Berry, Poortinga, Breugelmans, Chasiotis, & Sam, 2011). In this thesis, ethnic integration norms at work refer to pressure or expectations from own ethnic members to retain one's own culture, but also to participate in and adopt the culture of the workplace, which combines a largely European business culture and plural ethnic cultures among colleagues (the latter concept is known in South Africa as the Rainbow Nation). In Berry's (1997) bidimensional model, an integration acculturation orientation, strategy or attitude refers to an immigrant's preference to maintain one's own culture, but also to participate in the mainstream culture. In the context of the present thesis an integration acculturation orientation, strategy or attitude refers to individual preferences in the workplace to have contacts with own but also other ethnicities. Berry (1997) has argued that integration is the individual-level orientation that corresponds to multiculturalism at an organisational or societal level. The concept of ethnic vitality, adapted from linguistics (Harwood, Giles, & Bourhis, 1994), refers to ethnic institutions that can support the diversity process, such as the availability of places of worship, shops, recreational opportunities and educational resources for specific ethnic groups (Galchenko, 2006). In the context of this thesis, ethnic vitality refers to the availability of services for diverse groups in an organisation, such as availability of and catering for ethnic-specific food and freedom to engage in ethnic practices (language usage, clothing and prayers), which are the consequence of support for multicultural climate, as implemented in diversity policies. Overwhelming support seems to exist for the notion that integration strategies are usually the most successful, and separation strategies are intermediate (Berry, 2003; Berry & Kim, 1988; Berry & Sam, 1997). However, 14 Ward (2001) has argued that minority groups may easily move to a separation strategy should the dominant groups react negatively to their integration strategy. Ethnic and individual acculturation orientations mediating variables Psychologists often conduct research to establish whether and to what extent one variable affects another. However, the discovery that two variables are related to each other is only one small part of the aim of psychology. Deeper understanding is gained when we comprehend the process that produces the effect (Preacher & Hayes, 2004). A variable may be called a mediator to the extent that it provides an explanation for the relation between the predictor and the criterion (Baron & Kenny, 1986). The proposed conceptual model of diversity in this thesis uses individual integration orientation as a mediator in the relationship between a multicultural or diversity enhancing climate and employee well-being. This thesis considers the mediating role of ethnic and individual acculturation orientations, strategies or attitudes in the relationship between mainstream features (antecedents) and acculturation outcomes. Acculturation outcomes Acculturation outcomes can be grouped under two major types: psychological (\"being or feeling well\" in the new cultural context, often measured by mental and physical health) and sociocultural (\"doing well\", often measured by school and work success). The literature seems to be based on the tacit assumption that orientations affect all outcomes in a fairly similar manner although it has been demonstrated that psychological and sociocultural outcomes have different sets of predictors (Ward, Bochner, & Furnham, 2001). Job satisfaction, organisation commitment, intentions to quit and ill-health are here treated as psychological diversity outcome indicators, while subjective experiences of work success are treated as an indicator of sociocultural adjustment. Employee attitudes and health as indicators of psychological and sociocultural diversity outcomes Job satisfaction is an affective (emotional) reaction to a job (Cranny, Smith, & Stone, 1992). According to Weiss, Dawis, England, and Lofquist (1967), employees seek to achieve and maintain correspondence with their environment. Correspondence with the environment can be described in terms of the individual fulfilling the requirements of the environment, and the environment fulfilling the requirements of the individual (Cook, Hepworth, Wall, & Warr, 1981). This means that employees would experience job satisfaction if they feel that their individual capacities, experience and values can be utilised in their work environment and that the work environment offers them opportunities and rewards (Dawis, 1992). Organisation commitment here reflects the extent to which an individual identifies with and approves the goals and values of the organisation and is committed to its goals. Using mainly an affective approach to organisation commitment and consistent with Mowday, Steers, and Porter (1979), organisational commitment is defined here as consisting of an individual's approval of the goals and values of the organisation (e.g. support for a multi-ethnic environment), eagerness to exert effort on behalf of the organisation and intentions to remain with the organisation. 15 Bennett and Murphy (1997) defined health (physical and psychological) as a state of complete mental and social wellbeing and as a sense of wholeness and happiness on a physical, cultural, spiritual, and mental level. Studies have consistently linked perceived racism, discrimination, with poor psychological outcomes (e.g. Gee, Ro, Shariff-Marco, & Chae, 2009). With regards to intentions to quit, it can be construed as thoughts that are often triggered when the minority groups do not abide by or adapt to the dominant cultures. Intentions to quit can be seen as a psychological acculturation outcome indicator as they convey information about how well the individual feels in the acculturation context (Ward & Kennedy, 1999). Perceived experiences of work success is a sociocultural diversity outcome indicator in this study, which refers to the extent employees perceive that they are meeting and exceeding standards and that they are performing well at work. The concept also refers to the respect that employees earn from co-workers as consequences of being successful at work. Context: The history and current state of race relations in South Africa Following the establishment of the first democratic state (1994), we saw the promulgation of various laws, such as the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 (RSA, 1995), the Employment Equity Act No 55 of 1998 (RSA, 1998) and the Basic Conditions of Employment Act No 75 of 1997 (RSA, 1997), that was aimed at demolishing discrimination, enhancing national cohesion, and the creation of a Rainbow nation (a term framed by Bishop Desmond Tutu to refer to the multi-ethnic composition of the South African society). Despite these and other corrective initiatives to combat discrimination, reports still surface that portray South Africa as one of the most unequal societies. In general, 53% of South Africans live below the national poverty line, with 9.4% earning less than $1.25 per day. It has also been established that rural poverty is twice that of urban poverty in South Africa (Statistics South Africa, 2014). The country's Gini coefficient, the international standard for inequality (for 2014 was .658, which was up on the figure for 1980 (.569), compared to Brazil (.515) the Russian Federation (.399) (BRICS comparison / India's figure not available) (World Bank, 2014; n.d.). Formal unemployment (the narrow definition that excludes those who had given up on looking for work) is above 25%. The United Nations compiles a Human Development Index (HDI) that takes into account a whole range of factors, including education, health, employment, and income per capita. South Africa's HDI rating for 2015 was 0.666, which puts the country in the 'medium human development' category of countries and places the country 116th out of 174 countries (UNDP 2016). A recent phenomenon is the rise of a new black consciousness movement among a new generation of young black people (mostly academics, students, and middle-class professionals) (Haffajee 2015). This new generation of young black people (organized in groups such as #Feesmustfall, #Rhodesmustfall, OpenStellenbosch, ReformPuk and Black First, Land First), is opposed to and attack the power of white privilege and the disadvantage of being black in South Africa today. An important aspect is their demand to return the land (to Blacks) that had been 'stolen by whites' (Ellof, 2017). A spike in racist incidents and remarks (especially on social media) is observed in South Africa. The most well-known incident was the remarks of the estate agent Penny Sparrow, who described the black South Africans on the beaches of KwaZulu-Natal as 'monkeys'. The new root of white racism could be a combination of loss and fear. This is loss of past privilege and fear of the future as an ever-smaller minority (Eloff, 2017). Jail sentence of 16 three years was recently given to Penny Sparrow, a white lady for using the \"k\" word and showing no remorse for actions during the trial. Criminalizing racism is being perceived by Blacks as a step in the right direction. No industries in the South African workplace were unaffected by the sociopolitical changes, such as BBBEE and AA or the challenges faced by the South African society as a result of these changes. Although they have tried to transform the landscape of the South African workplace, issues such as racism and discrimination still prevail (Smith, Stones, & Naidoo, 2003). Slabbert (2001) concluded that racist perceptions and stereotypes remain very prevalent and active in the South African society. The prevalence of such negative stereotypes held by various ethnic groups in South Africa was recently confirmed by Moloto, Brink and Nel (2014), twenty years later in the \"new\" South Africa. Demographic difference in support for diversity There are theoretical models as well as data obtained elsewhere that have a bearing on expected support for diversity in South African organisations. There is evidence that more powerful and dominant groups will be less supportive of diversity than less powerful groups (e.g., Arends-T\u00f3th & Van de Vijver, 2003). Ethnic groups are viewed more negatively and support for diversity is less when minority groups are more viewed as threats to scarce resources, such as jobs (Realistic Conflict Theory; e.g., Duckitt, 1994). Whites, especially males, still dominate the hierarchy in the private sector in South Africa. Africans constituted less than 14.4% of top management in 2016, yet they constitute 78% of the workforce of the country. Whites constitute 68.5% of top management in 2016, yet they constitute only 9.5% of the workforce (RSA, 2017). The legacy of gender and racial discrimination still persists in South Africa; women of all races are overrepresented of managers are men; and women earn less than men in all labour market positions (Statistics South Africa, 2016). These findings have implications for how ethnic group members and women in South African organisations may experience diversity. Diversity policies such as AA programmes that focus on the advancement of previously disadvantaged groups will be more supported by these groups than by members of the dominant group, especially White males. This is confirmed by some who perceive AA and BBBEE as reverse discrimination (Herman, 2000). Therefore, it seems fair to expect different levels of support for diversity policies among Blacks and Whites. Research objectives Based on the above-mentioned, this thesis was aimed at: Section 1 Investigating the relationship between multiculturalism or diversity enhancing features of the workplace, ethnic integration and employee well-being and or attitudes (research question 1); Determining the mediating role of ethnic integration in the relationship between multiculturalism or diversity enhancing features of the workplace in and employee attitudes (research question 2); Investigating demographic (race) differences in the experiences of multiculturalism or diversity enhancing features of the workplace, ethnic integration and employee attitudes (research question 3); 17 Testing for invariance of a model of multiculturalism in the workplace for different demographic (race) using multigroup analysis (research question 4); Section 2 Investigating the relationship between adverse intercultural conditions or diversity encumbering features of the workplace, ethnic separation and employee attitudes (research question 5); Determining the mediating role of ethnic separation in the relationship between adverse intercultural conditions or diversity encumbering features of the workplace and employee attitudes (research question 6); Investigating demographic (gender and race) differences in the experiences of adverse intercultural conditions or diversity encumbering features of the workplace, ethnic separation and employee attitudes (research question 7); Testing the invariance of a model of adverse intercultural conditions or diversity encumbering features of the workplace for different demographic (gender and race) using multigroup analysis (research question 8); Section 3 Determining the invariance of the dual process model of diversity for different demographic groups (race) (research question 9); Determining if an employee's avoidance coping style or separation orientation (fully or partially) mediates the relation between the negative antecedent conditions and psychological adjustment (research question 10); Determining if an employee's approach coping style or integration orientation (fully or partially) mediates the relation between positive antecedents and sociocultural adjustment, as measured by subjective experiences of productivity (research question 11); and Investigating if minorities (based on relative power and status in the workplace in the private and public sector: blacks or whites) experience less conducive diversity conditions than Whites in the South African workplace (research question 12). Thesis outline This thesis contains seven empirical chapters (Chapter 2-8) presented in three sections, namely (1) diversity enhancing features, integration and employee attitudes at work, (2) diversity encumbering features, separation and employee attitudes at work, and (3) a conceptual (dual process) of diversity in the workplace: proposal, test and confirmation. It is the aim of this thesis to make sense of the complexity of diversity management through the lenses of enhancing and encumbering acculturation antecedents, mediators and outcomes. Each section contains research questions that relate to this objective. These are presented in the empirical chapters that address hypotheses related to these questions and are related to the conceptual model (Figure 1). The first section, heading diversity enhancing features, integration and employee attitudes at work (The diversity enhancing stream in the conceptual model of diversity, Figure 1), investigate in chapter 2 the mediating role of integration in the relationship between multiculturalism and employee attitudes such as job satisfaction, organisational commitment and subjective experiences of work success and ill-health. Using Multigroup Structural Equation 18 Modelling, Chapter 2 looks for invariance of the proposed model for Black and White miners (N = 241) from the North West province in South Africa. The second section focus on diversity encumbering features, separation and employee attitudes at work (The diversity encumbering stream in a conceptual (dual process) of diversity, Figure 1). It investigates in two chapters (3 and 4) in two separate empirical studies with two different samples, the mediating role of separation in the relationship between discrimination, racism and segregation on the one hand, and employee attitudes and well-being using indicators such as intentions to quit and subjective experiences of work success and ill-health on the other hand. Using Multigroup Structural Equation Modelling, Chapter 3 addresses the invariance of the proposed diversity encumbering model for Black and White miners (N = 241) from the North West province in South Africa, while Chapter 4 investigates invariance of the proposed model for Blacks and Whites (N = 327) in a variety of organisations in South Africa. The last section, entitled a conceptual (dual process) of diversity in the workplace: proposal, test and confirmation (The conceptual (dual process model) of diversity, Figure 1), investigates in three separate chapters (5, 6 and 7) in four separate empirical studies with four different samples, and using Multigroup Structural Equation Modelling, the stability and invariance of a dual process model for ethnic and gender groups. Chapter 6 proposes and tests a conceptual (dual process) model of diversity with a South African Police (SAPS) officer sample (N = 158) using avoidance and approach coping styles as mediators in the diversity encumbering and enhancing paths of the conceptual model of diversity, respectively. Chapter 7 proposes and tests a conceptual (dual process) model of diversity using a South African Police (SAPS) office-based staff sample (N = 296) using separation and integration as mediators in the diversity encumbering and enhancing paths of a conceptual (dual process) model of diversity, respectively. Chapter 8 confirms the structure of a conceptual (dual process) model of diversity with two different sample [Employees from various workplaces in South Africa in study 1: (N = 966) and Miners from the North West province of South Africa in study 2: (N = 241)] using separation and integration as mediators in the diversity encumbering and enhancing paths of the dual process model respectively. The final chapter (Chapter 9) presents a general discussion where the findings of the empirical studies are summarized and implications and recommendations for future research are discussed.

Research purpose: The authors addressed the relationship between conditions that are considered to be conducive to multiculturalism and the practices perceived to accomplish this, vis-\u00e0 vis multiculturalism and well-being, as measured by ill-health and subjective work success. Motivation for the study: Although multiculturalism has been recommended as an effective way of dealing with diversity at societal and local levels, little is known about its effects in the workplace. Research design, approach and method: Following a quantitative approach, the authors utilised a cross-sectional design with a convenience sample of 241 Black employees and White employees from a mine in North-West Province for the research. Exploratory factor analyses and Cronbach alpha coefficients were used to test scale validity and reliability. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) and effect sizes was used to determine the effect of race on the experiences of miners, and multigroup path analysis (AMOS) was used to investigate whether or not identical relations between multiculturalism, work success, and ill-health could be found for Black employees and White employees. Main findings: Multiculturalism and mainstream tolerance coupled with ethnic integration demands at home and work were associated with success at work but not with ill-health. Black employees experienced the workplace slightly more positively. Practical/managerial implications: Multiculturalism and integration are related to subjective experiences of work success and, as such, should be supported in the workplace. Contribution/value-add: Our findings suggest that multiculturalism is relatively well supported by both groups in the workplace. This positive finding should not be regarded as obvious because empirical research has suggested that the majority of members of the host culture do not always favour multiculturalism. Key Words: Multiculturalism, integration, tolerance, work success, ill-health 25 Introduction The 1994 democratic elections have brought a new order to South Africa which encapsulates the protection of human rights. The fundamental goal of the African National Congress (ANC) remains to construct a non-racial, non-sexist, democratic society in South Africa. Increasingly, South African organisations are implementing employment equity and affirmative action programmes as organisations commit themselves to a process of redressing previous imbalances, because of discriminatory legislation, which has resulted in a very diverse workforce composition. These trends pave the way for multiculturalism as the dominant strategy for dealing with pluralism in South African society. Multiculturalism is expected to have positive effects on ethnic groups and intergroup relations. Although multiculturalism has been recommended as an effective intervention at societal and local levels, little is known about its effects in organisations (Richeson & Nussbaum, 2004; Wolsko, Park, Judd & Wittenbrink, 2000). It has been suggested that the impact of multiculturalism may differ between ethnic minority and majority groups. Bekker and Leild\u00e9 (2004), in attempting to answer the question 'Is multiculturalism a working policy in South Africa?' concluded that it appears that multiculturalism, both as a policy and as an outcome, has had a measure of success in the new South Africa. However, multiculturalism has been criticised on several grounds. Some have suggested that multiculturalism can lead to group distinctions, conflict and separatism (Brewer, 1997) whilst others have argued that multiculturalism endangers social unity and cohesion, and it also contradicts individualism and the ideal of meritocracy (Barry, 2001; Bissoondath, 1994; Schlesinger, 1992). Given the divergent views about the benefits of multiculturalism, it seems relevant and important to investigate its relationship with well-being in a diverse workforce. Relating to this, acculturation studies focus on issues arising when groups or individuals from different cultures come into continuous first-hand contact with one another, with subsequent changes taking place in the original cultural patterns of either or both groups. Literature Our theoretical framework draws on a mediation model of acculturation (Arends-T\u00f3th &Van de Vijver, 2006). Predictors in the model, called multicultural conditions, refer to contextual conditions with a presumed influence on multicultural orientations, such as descriptive norms about the need to adopt and appreciate multiculturalism in a culturally diverse group. Mediating variables, called integration (orientations), refer to the way that individuals perceive their environment as either preferring to embrace multiculturalism (aimed at an integration of ethnic groups) or segregation (aimed at independent co-existence of ethnic groups); thus, our argument is that perceived practices and norms, vis-\u00e0-vis multiculturalism, will create perceived demands (to integrate or segregate) on the individual. These norms and practices (as antecedents to the research) and perceived demands (as mediating variables) will influence the outcomes of the process, such as well-being and work performance. The present study examines the multicultural model in a mine in the North-West Province and addresses differences in support for multiculturalism amongst Black employees and White employees. 26 The current study differs from conventional acculturation studies that include mainstream majority and immigrant minority groups. However, Jansen (2011) cautioned against the use of the term 'minority' because South Africans are building a common identity as citizens of a new country, where they no longer refer to each other by skin colour or demographic count, but by allegiance to higher values and commitments. He also warned that the term 'majority', in the new South Africa, should not be mistakenly interpreted as Black or African people, which is in line with our conceptualisation of the acculturation of ethnic groups in relation to the evolving new national identity. Heeding these warnings, we defined the context of adjustment as the new, multicultural South Africa. No ethnic group has a background that corresponds to this multicultural reality. So, we can safely assume that all groups are involved in an acculturation process, of dealing with this new reality, by either choosing to integrate with or segregate from other groups, most notably in the workplace. So, even though our study does not have the usually clear demarcation of mainstream and minority groups, we argue that acculturation theory provides a useful framework for studying the multicultural Sout African workplace. Antecedents: Mainstream multiculturalism conditions The impact of acculturation orientation of the host culture, dealing with the issue of how the dominant group prefers the immigrants to deal with the ethnic and mainstream culture, has been taken into account and is increasingly emphasised in studies relating to acculturation (Arends-T\u00f3th 1997). The Model (Bourhis et al., 1997) takes the acculturation strategies (from the bidimensional model) of both the mainstream and minority culture into account. This model has been developed as a means to describe intergroup relations in a multicultural society, but can be readily extended to multiculturalism in the workplace. The conjunction of multicultural preferences, held by the various ethnicities in the workforce, gives rise to various kinds of intergroup relations ranging from conflicting (e.g. all groups favour segregation and do not endorse integration) to consensual relations (e.g. groups favour multiculturalism). The nature of this relationship can be expected to have a similar impact on multiculturalism, as it has had on acculturation outcomes (Zagefka & Brown, 2002). We examine multicultural practices and norms and mainstream tolerance as antecedent conditions: Multicultural norms refer to descriptive rules about how diversity is dealt within the organization, practices refer to behaviours, prevalent in the organisation, conducive to intercultural contact and tolerance emphasizes non-discrimination during intercultural contact. Multiculturalism and mainstream tolerance Multiculturalism in the workplace refers to the co-existence and integration of the diverse cultures represented in the workforce. Multiculturalism is an ideology designed for dealing with cultural diversity, entailing the quality and positive evaluation of different groups within a society. Certain conditions must be met to establish and maintain a multicultural society (Berry & Kalin, 1995). These conditions involve certain criteria: There should be contact between the ethnic groups. The society should be tolerant toward immigrant (minority) groups. 27 All cultural groups should have positive attitudes toward each other and consider themselves attached to the larger society, without losing their cultural background. Empirical research, however, has suggested that the majority of host culture members do not always favour multiculturalism (Breugelmans & Van de Vijver, 2004). Hofmeyr (2006) tried to establish the extent to which people, from different population groups, are being exposed to one another in their daily routines, and whether or not they want to increase contact with people from other groups. He found that more than half of their South African sample indicated that they never communicate informally with people from other ethnic groups on an average day and that just less than a third of respondents indicated that they would like to increase their frequency of conversations with groups other than their own. Unlike the private domain where people have a choice about whom they communicate with, communicating with other group members in the workplace remains a reality, and given the rarity of such contacts in the personal sphere, one can only speculate about the impact forced contact exerts on well-being at work. Recent studies have indicated that multicultural practices and norms and mainstream tolerance in the workplace have been associated with lower levels of physical and psychological ill-health as well as increased subjective experiences of work success (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004; Molokoane, 2007; Swart, 2009). However, the following questions arise: Are these associations the same for both Black people and White people? Do these groups experience these acculturation conditions in the same fashion? Mediating variables: Perceived integration demands In this article, ethnic integration demands refer to pressure, from co-ethnics at home and work, to recognise diversity and to adopt the multicultural (Rainbow) identity. Few studies have addressed the consequences of multicultural attitudes. However, various studies have addressed the closely related concept of acculturation orientations that deal with the question of how immigrants want to deal with their culture of origin and with the culture of the country of settlement. Berry, Phinney, Sam and Vedder (2006), in a large international study of immigrant youth in 13 countries, examined how these immigrant youth live and perform within and between two cultures. They concluded from their findings that the integration profile was the most common method of dealing with two cultures. Respondents with this profile reported relatively high scores on involvement in both their ethnic and national cultures, and on both ethnic and national identities. They also had peer contacts with both their group and the national group and appeared to be comfortable in both their ethnic and national contexts. Immigrant youth, in the integration profile, obtained psychological and socio-cultural adaptation scores that were above the grand mean. These results supported their expectation that an ethnic orientation would contribute positively to psychological adaptation, and a national orientation would positively influence sociocultural adaptation. Positive relations between integration demands, and subjective experiences of success at work as well as lower levels of ill-health, were also confirmed in recent studies (Ait Ouarasse, 2004; Molokoane, 2007; Swart, 2008). There is overwhelming evidence for the positive effects of integration compared to the other 28 ethnic acculturation strategies on adjustment and adaptation, yet, Neto, Barros and Schmitz (2005), when comparing the effects of integration and separation on 118 Portuguese immigrants in Germany, found no differences in acculturative stress, self-esteem, or satisfaction with life. The authors argued that these findings can probably be explained by the fact that the majority of Portuguese immigrants have been living in Germany for a long time and that their (objective) acculturation stress is low because these migrants have already developed efficient acculturation strategies. Research has often shown that integration is the strategy most favoured by minority members (e.g. Pham & Harris, 2001; Zagefka & Brown, 2002). However, they may shift to separation if the mainstream culture reacts negatively to their integration (Ward, 2001). A host society that does not permit cultural diversity is not likely to favour integration but tends to favour minority assimilation rather than integration (Ait Ouarasse, 2004). Similarly, Jasinskaja-Lahti, Liebkind, Horenczyk and Schmitz (2003) found that immigrants who preferred the separation option reported fewer stress symptoms than those who preferred the assimilation or integration options. Born (1970) and Berry (1970, 1980) presumed that the modes of acculturation are responsive options for coping with acculturative stress, such that that the following is likely: high levels of stress cause people to choose acculturative withdrawal (separation or marginalisation with resulting lower or fewer stress symptoms after a period of time) low levels of stress cause people to choose acculturative engagement (assimilation or integration). Sam (2000) found that immigrant adolescents in Norway who preferred integration suffered increased acculturative stress. People who preferred to separate themselves were less exposed to unwelcome, hostile attitudes and behaviour from the 'others'. It could be speculated that separation strategies will only be successful in contexts where this option is viable and the immigrant can withdraw into an ethnic pocket without having to frequently interact with the mainstream culture. We can only speculate about the association between pressure from co-ethnic members to integrate with multiculturalism and mainstream tolerance on the one hand and psychological and sociocultural adaptation on the other hand in a diverse work context in South Africa. Outcomes: Well-being and work success We draw (again) on the acculturation literature to distinguish between two types of outcomes (Ward, Bochner& Furnham, 2001). Psychological outcomes are mainly studied in the stress and coping tradition and concern mental health and general satisfaction with work: Does the employee feel well in the workplace? Sociocultural outcomes, on the other hand, are studied in the culture learning tradition, and refer to successful participation in the workforce: Does the employee do well in the workplace? Psychological and sociocultural adaptation are positively related (Berry, 2003; Ward et al., 2001; Ward & Kennedy, 1999) and the strength of the association is related to the cultural distance and the degree of integration of cross-cultural travellers in the social milieu. Thus, the larger the cultural distance, the weaker the association between psychological and sociocultural adaptation; the more the orientation toward the host 29 society (assimilation or integration), the stronger the relation (Ward & Rama-Deuba, 1999). Psychological and sociocultural outcomes may have different antecedents (Ward et al., 2001). The present study It seems reasonable to expect multiculturalism to be present in the mining industry, following the post-apartheid constitution of 1997 and the ensuing introduction of affirmative action and Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) in the labour sector. The reality according to the Commission for Employment Equity (CEE) Annual Report 2009/2010 (Department of Labour, 2010), however, indicates the slow pace of transformation in the industry. The gender and racial distribution of the workforce in the sector is hardly reflective of the workforce diversification that the department had envisaged. The CEE report observes that after 10 years of affirmative action having been adopted as policy, progress on diversification of management, core-skilled management, and core-skilled workers remains minimal (Khuzwayo, 2010). Given this state of affairs, the following questions arise: Do mine workers, in a mine in the North-West Province, actually experience multiculturalism and mainstream tolerance and well-being? Do members of the Black and White ethnic group in South Africa, employed at this gold mine, promote the idea of integration and active participation in the workplace? Does the same multicultural mediation model (of antecedent, mediating, and outcome variables) apply to Black groups and the White group? Research method Research design Research approach This research began with a quantitative approach, followed by a cross-sectional survey design whereby a sample was drawn from a population at one point in time, and this sample was used to obtain the research objectives. Cross-sectional designs are appropriat where groups of participants, at various stages of development, are studied simultaneously, whereas thesurvey technique of data collection gathers information from the target population using questionnaires (Burns & Grove, 1993). This design is used to assess interrelationships amongst variables within the population. Sampling and research participants The participants of this study were a convenience sample of gold miners in the North-West Province. A total of 500 miners were approached. A response rate of 59% was achieved, of which 288 responses (98%) could be utilised. However, some of the Indian respondents were deleted from the final multigroup analysis because of their small sample size. Black and Coloured miners were combined as a single Black group to create a Black group and a White group for further analysis. The sample (N = 241: 83.7% of the initial usable sample) consisted of 208 males (86.3%) and 33 females (13.7%), 170 30 Black miners (70.5%) and 71 White miners (29.5%) with an average age of 31.65 years and 8.77 years of experience. Coloured miners comprised only 2.4% of the sample. Despite their cultural differences, given the history of the country as well as the low representation of Coloured miners, we decided to combine Black miners and Coloured miners for multigroup analyses. As an aside, it may be noted that our definition is in line with the Employment Equity Act in which all previously disadvantaged groups are called Black: 'Black people' is a generic term which means Africans, Coloureds and Indians in the South African Employment Equity Act 55 of 1998. Within the context of the present study, both groups share a history as the victims of institutionalised racism and oppression, and they share the same position in the commonly perceived divide of 'black' and 'white' in South Africa (Makhalemele, 2005): The original separation strategy of the National Party after the 1948 election only distinguished between black or 'non-white' and white. Apartheid created race as a mechanism for violence. Race, in and of itself, was the social and psychological reality through which repression and violence functioned. Racism was institutionalised, legalised and internalised.\" South Africans saw the world in 'black' and 'white' terms and violence was commonly used to maintain the status quo. (n.p.) Measuring instruments Some instruments, with well-established psychometric properties used in other cultural contexts, were adapted (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). Adaptations involved replacing the original words 'Dutch' and 'Moroccan' with 'South African' and 'own All acculturation scales follow a 5-point Likert format ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree) and, where needed, item scores were reversed before the analyses. Adaptation of mainstream domain instruments: multicultural norms tolerance by the mainstream multicultural practices. Multicultural norms (developed for the study by the researchers involved): This is a 6-item measure of the participants' attitudes to multiculturalism and the prevalence of multicultural values within an organisation. The scale contains items like 'I think that most of my co-workers think that the idea of a 'Rainbow Nation' with a core set of values, such as equality for all South Africans, does not work in our organisation' (reverse scored). An exploratory factor analysis suggested the unifactorial nature of the scale, and the same was found for all other scales in the study ( = 0.65). Tolerance by the mainstream (adaptation of Ait Ouarasse and Van de Vijver, 2004): This is an 8-item measure of the extent to which participants think that mainstream members take an open stance toward the ethnic minority in the South African workplace. Tolerance is the desire on the part of the mainstream to see the minority members actively involved in public life without necessarily dropping their original culture. The scale contains items like 'I think that most of my co-workers from other cultures are most welcoming people' ( = 0.76). 31 Multicultural practices: This new instrument is a 7-item measure of the participants' actual multicultural behaviour and theprevalence of multicultural practices within an organisation. The scale contains items like 'My co-workers generally show respect for people from other cultures in our organisation' ( = 0.77). Adaptation of ethnocultural domain instruments: Perceived ethnic integrationist demands (General) Perceived ethnic integrationist demands (Workplace) Perceived Ethnic Integrationist Demands - General (adaptation of Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004): This is a 6-item measure of the extent to which participants think that members of their ethnicity allow them to establish contact with the South Africans and participate in public life. The scale contains items like 'Most members of my cultural group want me to deal with people from different cultural groups' ( = 0.75). Perceived Ethnic Integrationist Demands - Workplace (adaptation of Ait Ouarasse and Van de Vijver, 2004): This is a 6-item measure of the extent to which participants think members of their group allow them to establish contact with members of other ethnic groups members at work. The scale contains items like 'My group members are positive about diverse work teams' ( = 0.71). Psychological and socio-cultural acculturation outcomes: well-being work success. Well-being: This is an adapted version of the 18 physical health symptoms of the PSI of Spector and Jex (1998), complemented with a list of 9 common psychological complaints based on a slightly modified version of the World Health Organization Cross-National Survey of Psychological and Somatic Symptoms (1988). This scale employs a frequency format that ranges from 1 (never) to 5 (every day). The self-report measure asks respondents to indicate whether or not, in the past three months, they had suffered any of the mentioned symptoms. Some examples of symptoms included in the scale are headaches, backache, fatigue, eye strain and trouble sleeping, concentrating and constant anxiety or panic attacks ( = 0.94 and 0.89 for physical and psychological ill-health, respectively). Work success (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004): This is a 14-item measure of participants' success at work. All of the items are positively phrased. It contains items about task completion, punctuality, status, and recognition at work, relationships with supervisors, and relationships with fellow workers. The scale contains items like 'I am always on time for my work', 'I do my work exactly as instructed by my supervisor' and 'I have a good reputation among my co-workers' ( = 0.85). A Biographical questionnaire is included to enable the description of the population. It includes basic biographical questions like age, sex, race, and experience. Research procedure The research project was initiated after discussions with the Human Resource Department of a major gold mine in the North-West Province of South Africa, and permission was obtained from the mine's management. Various information sessions were held on-site and pamphlets were distributed to inform employees about the aim of the 32 project and to encourage them to attend sessions on site where participants would complete questionnaires. Managers were also encouraged to allow employees to attend the sessions for completion of the questionnaires whilst the anonymous and voluntary nature of the project was constantly emphasised during the information sessions. Five sessions were scheduled for questionnaire completion with two facilitators being present to clarify issues raised by the participants. Each session lasted two and a half hours and included two 15 minute breaks to prevent survey administration fatigue. Statistical analysis The statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS- programme (SPSS Inc, 2010) and the AMOS 18 programme (Arbuckle, 2010). Descriptive statistics were used to explore the data whilst Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was carried out with race (two levels: Black and White) as independent variable and the mean scores of the scales as dependent variables. A MANOVA tests whether or not mean differences amongst groups of people, on a combination of dependent variables, are likely to have occurred by chance when, as was the case in our data as documented below, the dependent variables are correlated (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). Effect sizes (Cohen, 1988) were included, in addition to statistical significance, to determine the significance of relationships. Effect sizes indicate whether or not obtained results are practically important (whereas statistical significance may often show results which are of little practical relevance). Exploratory factor analyses and Cronbach alpha coefficients were used to determine the unidimensionality, homogeneity, and internal consistency of the measuring instruments (Clark & Watson, 1995). Cronbach's alpha coefficient contains important information regarding the proportion of variance of the items of a scale, in terms of the total variance explained by that particular scale. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients are used to specify the relationship between the variables. Effect sizes (Steyn, 1999) are used to decide on the practical significance of the findings. A cut-off point of 0.30 (medium effect; Cohen, 1988) was set for the practical significance of correlation coefficients. In terms of statistical significance, the value was set at a 95% confidence interval level (p 0.05). The mediating role of the demands of ethnic integration was investigated in the relations between positive antecedent mainstream conditions and well-being. To investigate these, structural equation modelling (multigroup analysis) was performed using AMOS 18 (Arbuckle, 2010). Results The results consist of three parts, namely: factor analysis and relationships between positive antecedents and intervening variables and well-being for Black miners and White miners testing of the mediating role of integration demands in the relations between antecedents of multiculturalism and well-being similarities and differences amongst Black miners and White miners in antecedents and intervening variables and well-being. 33 Exploratory factor analyses and associations between antecedent conditions, intervening variables and well-being for Black miners and White miners The results obtained from exploratory analyses and inspections of the scree plots indicated that all scales used were unifactorial, explaining 32.6% of the variance in multicultural norms, 46.6% in mainstream tolerance, 43.6% in multicultural practices, 44.8% in ethnic integration demands at home, 41.3% in ethnic integration demands at work, 47.8% in physical ill-health and 52.6% in psychological ill-health and 35.5% in perceived work success. The correlation matrix depicting construct associations for the Black (upper section of the matrix) and White (lower section of the matrix) group are presented in Table 1.

A model of the mediating role of ethnic integration demands in the relations between positive acculturation antecedent mainstream conditions and well-being To investigate the mediating role of ethnic integration demands in the relations between positive antecedent mainstream conditions and well-being, structural equation modelling (multigroup analysis) was performed using AMOS 18 (Arbuckle 2010). There are three positive acculturation mainstream antecedent conditions in this model, namely multicultural norms, mainstream tolerance and multicultural practices. There is a single latent variable (well-being at work) that is measured using three indicators, namely physical and psychological ill-health (psychological adjustment) and work success (sociocultural adjustment). Finally, there is an ethnic latent variable (ethnic integration) that is measured using two indicators, namely ethnic integration demands at home and work. The tested model postulates that acculturation mainstream conditions influence well-being at work through ethnic integration. The similarities and differences between the Black and White race groups were explored by testing the fit of a hierarchy of models with increasing constraints on the number of invariant parameters (see Table 2). 34 Table 2: Results of the multigroup structural equation model analysis Model 0.05 11.39* 4 *p < .05. **p < .01. Figure 1. The results of the multigroup structural equation model analysis Inspection of Table 2 revealed that the structural residuals model (see Figure 1) was the most restrictive model with an acceptable fit: 2(48, N = 241) = 71.61, p < 0.05; 2/df = 1.49 (recommended, 3.00). Other indices confirmed the good fit of the model: The adjusted goodness of fit index (AGFI) was 0.90 (recommended, 0.90), the Tucker Lewis index (TLI) was 0.95 (recommended, 0.90), the comparative fit index (CFI) was 0.95 (recommended, 0.90), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) was 0.05 (recommended, .05). The results of the structural residuals model are presented in Figure 1. In this model, the regression coefficients of the antecedent mainstream acculturation conditions and factor loadings on well-being at work, through ethnic integration and the latent variable as a mediating variable, were assumed to be invariant across both Black and White race groups. As can be seen in Figure 1, an increase in positive mainstream multicultural norms, mainstream tolerance and multicultural practices are associated with increased ethnic integration demands at home and work. Stronger associations were observed between mainstream tolerance and integration compared to the associations between integration and multicultural practices 0.03Multicultural norm sMainstream toleranceMulticultural practicesEthnic Integration dem ands at hom e Ethnic Integration dem ands at workPhysical Ill-HealthPsychological a bl e ) 35 and norms. Figure 1 also indicates an insignificant path from integration to well-being, whereas a significant path was observed from integration to (only) work success. This finding suggests that the perceived multicultural climate, practices and demands are unrelated to well-being in this sample, but are related to work success. Employees who are more supportive of multiculturalism showed more (self-reported) work success. Mediating effects of integration demands The hypothesised model is a mediation model in which positive antecedent conditions influence ethnic integration demands, which in turn impact on the well-being of mine workers. We made a closer examination of their direct and indirect effects to evaluate their relative quantities and to establish whether or not indirect effects were significant. There is quite some literature on the testing of mediation effects that describes alternatives to the commonly employed Baron and Kenny (1996) procedure (Holmbeck, 1997; Hoyle & Kenny, 1999; Judd & Kenny, 1981; Kline, 1998; Preacher & Hayes, 2004). It has been found that the method proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986) can have a low statistical power and that joint significance tests involving the product of coefficients showed greater statistical power than other procedures, including the Baron and Kenny approach (MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West & Sheets, 2002). Therefore, we kept within the structural equation framework to compute the significance of indirect effects by using the bootstrap procedure, as implemented in the AMOS program. The results of the analysis can be found in Table 3 Table 3: Mediation Effects of Integration Demands in the Workplace (Standardized Effects) Physical Ill-health Psychological Ill-health Work success Predictor Direct Indirect Total Direct Indirect Total Direct Indirect Total Multicultural practices 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.13** 0.13** -0.01 0.50 Note. *p < .05. **p < .01. Closer inspection of Table 3 indicated that, in agreement with observations from Figure 1, total and indirect effects where observed of subjective experience on work success but not on physical and psychological ill-health. Also, the insignificance of all direct effects suggests that the link with subjective work success is fully mediated by integration demands. Positive antecedent variables have, therefore, an indirect and significant influence on subjective experience of work success. It can be concluded that integration demands fully mediate the path from mainstream positive conditions to sociocultural adjustment and that multiculturalism (integration) matters for the experience of subjective work success. 36 Comparisons of Black groups and White groups Black and White group differences were examined, in the experience of mainstream antecedent conditions, ethnic integration demands at home and work and also well-being. To examine these, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was carried ou with race (two levels: Black and White) as an independent variable and the mean scores of the scales as dependent variables. As can be confirmed in Table 1, various dependent variables showed significant correlations, therefore, we decided to conduct a MANOVA. The mean scores of the scales per race group are presented in Table 4. Table 4: Mean scores (SD) per scale for the sample, Black and White group Black M Black SD White M White SD Cohen's d Item mean range 1.

Work success 3.86 (0.56) 3.85 (0.59) 0.02 3.37 - 4.01 *p < .05 (small effect size). The multivariate effect of race was not significant (Wilks's lambda = 0.957, F(8, 232) = 1.297, p = 0.25). The only significant univariate effect was found for multicultural norms. Black miners experienced higher multicultural norms at work compared to White miners. The last column presents Cohen's d values, which gauge the size of the race differences. Only negligible differences to small effect sizes were observed. Thus, even though Black miners tend to show somewhat higher scores on the antecedent and mediating variables, the effect sizes are small. Moreover, given that all score means are well above the scale midpoints, our data suggest that the work force of our study is well aware of the multicultural aspects of the workplace, and seems to acknowledge that their environment wants them to adapt to this diversity. Although the impact of social desirability cannot be ruled out, our data suggest that multiculturalism is relatively well supported by both groups, and that the attitudes amongst employees are conducive for establishing and maintaining good intergroup relations in the workplace. All dimension scores are high, and well above the midpoint of the scale, which suggest that the multicultural conditions experienced by these mine employees are favourable. Black miners seem to experience a slightly more favourable multicultural environment, although the differences are very small and are only significant for multicultural norms. Although scale scores were above thescale midpoint, analysis of group differences, on item-level, suggested an average item mean for the two groups on multicultural norms that ranged between 2.90 and 3.70. Furthermore, these differences, with a small effect size, only exist in the experience of item 'I think that most of my co-workers do not recognise that we are a workforce that consists of groups from different cultural backgrounds' (reversed scored) (d = 0.46), with Black miners scoring higher than White miners, and that the smallest difference (d = 0.03), between Black miners and White 37 miners, was reported for the item 'I think that most of my co-workers believe that a workgroup with members from a variety of cultural groups can better tackle new problems of our organisation'. The average item mean for the two groups on multicultural practices ranged between 3.43 and 3.85, with the smallest difference on item-level experienced for the item 'I think that most of my co-workers accept the fact that we have different cultural practices' (d = 0.02) and the largest differences, yet still with a small effect size, was experienced for the item 'My co-workers generally show respect for other cultures in our organisation', with White miners experiencing the items more positively than Black miners. Furthermore, we also observed that the average item mean for the two groups on mainstream tolerance ranged between 3.24 and 3.57. The largest difference (with a small effect size) between the two groups were seen in the scores of the item 'I think that most of my co-workers from other cultures do their best to understand and help people from other cultures' (d = 0.32) and the smallest difference was for the item 'I think that most of my co-workers believe that cultural minorities should be helped to preserve their cultural heritage' (d = -0.08), with Black miners scoring higher than White miners. Results also indicated that the average item mean for ethnic integration demands in general ranged between 3.36 and 3.81, that the largest difference, with a medium effect size, was observed in the item 'Most members of my cultural group want me to be a good member of my cultural group and the larger South African society' (d = 0.50), with Black miners scoring higher than White miners. The smallest difference (d = 0.03) was for the item 'Most members of my cultural group like to see its members playing a positive role in society'. Lastly, our results from the item-level analyses also indicated that the average item means for ethnic integration demands at work ranged between 3.36 and 3.78 with the largest difference being found between the groups for the item 'Most members of my cultural group want me to show my cultural values and respect those of others' (d = 0.25, small effect size), with Black miners scoring higher than White miners, and the smallest difference was for the item 'My cultural group members are positive about diverse work teams' (d = 0.03). It can be concluded that race differences were fairly small on average and that, if present, Black miners tended to have higher scores than White miners. Furthermore, there is no simple patterning of which items show large (or small) differences. Furthermore, it is a striking finding that almost all items showed mean scores well above the scale midpoint. This observation could not be simply dismissed as acquiescence, as we also included some reverse scored items. We cannot exclude the role of social desirability; yet, the multicultural practices scale correctly, which are mostly related to associated behaviours and may, therefore, be least susceptible to the influence of social norms. This also has item means well above the scale midpoint. Furthermore, we know, from cross-cultural studies, that countries and the ethnic groups within them often differ considerably in social desirability (van Hemert, Van de Vijver, Poortinga & Georgas, 2002). Thus, if anything, social desirability would have increased the size of the cross-cultural differences. Discussion The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between mainstream antecedent conditions, ethnic intervening variables, and well-being at work for both Black 38 miners and White miners. Antecedent mainstream conditions were positively related to ethnic integration demands and work success and unrelated to ill-health. This implies that a work environment characterised by increased multicultural norms and practices and tolerant mainstreams, is more likely to contribute to members of a particular ethnicity encouraging each other to participate in mainstream multiculturalism, as well as experience higher levels of subjective work success (Molokoane, 2007; Swart, 2008). In this study we assumed that the association between acculturation mainstream antecedent conditions and well- being through a latent mediating variable, namely integration, would be invariant for Black and White group members in a mine in the North-West Province. Our hypothesis was confirmed, as we found an acceptable fit between the empirical data and the conceptual model. The fit between the data and the conceptual model indicates that the relations between antecedent conditions and well-being at work, through integration, were the same for Black miners and White miners. Thus, more multicultural norms, mainstream tolerance coupled with ethnic integration demands at home and work resulted in a more subjective experience of success at work. This result confirmed the positive relations found in previous studies (Berry et al., 2006; Biela, 2008; Molokoane, 2007; Nchabeleng, 2008) between multicultural norms and practices, mainstream tolerance, integration demands and work success. It also confirmed the importance of taking both the mainstream and ethnic conditions into consideration in acculturation studies, as recommended by the proponents of the Integrated Acculturation Model (Bourhis et al., 1997). It, therefore, seems likely that a workplace culture that promotes the ethnic cultural maintenance of people, from diverse backgrounds, coupled with encouragement to participate in the mixed culture of South Africa, both at home and work, would contribute to the experience of higher levels of subjective work success. We were also interested in the mediating effect of this integration, in the path from positive antecedent variables to well-being, as measured by ill-health symptoms and subjective experience of work success. Our findings suggest an indirect and significant influence of positive conditions on subjective experience of work success. It could, therefore, be concluded that integration mediates the path from mainstream acculturation conditions to work success (sociocultural outcomes), but that it is unrelated to ill-health (psychological outcomes). Remarkably, positive acculturation conditions and orientations were unrelated to ill-health. It could be speculated that positive conditions in the workplace, about diversity, are probably more related to positive health outcomes (for instance, job satisfaction or life satisfaction) than to negative outcomes (such as ill-health). Positive and negative symptoms seem to have nomological networks that only show partial overlap. Our findings also seem to confirm Ward's et al. (2001) reasoning that psychological and sociocultural acculturation outcomes may have their own antecedents, because multiculturalism and mainstream tolerance coupled with co- ethnic integration demands were very strongly related to the subjective experiences of work success, whilst they were not related to physical and psychological ill-health symptoms. It can be concluded that integration demands fully mediate the path from mainstream positive conditions to sociocultural adjustment, and that multiculturalism matters for the experience of subjective work success. 39 Another aim of the study was to determine whether or not Black miners and White miners experience the mainstream antecedent conditions, intervening variables, and well- being at work differently. The results indicated that only multicultural norms were experienced differently by Black miners and White miners. Black miners experience higher levels of multicultural norms at work compared to White miners. This means that Black miners adhere more to multicultural norms in their environment than White miners. This result is in line with previous national surveys (HSRC, 2004, 2006) which indicated that Black miners are, in general, more optimistic than White miners about the new South Africa. Yet, we would like to emphasise that the effects are relatively small and, given that the means observed were well above scale midpoint, our findings suggest that multiculturalism is relatively well supported in both groups in the workplace. Analyses of group differences on item-level, for the various scales, also seem to suggest that most items were strongly endorsed, with little difference in the endorsement of the items in the two groups. The only exception, where medium effect sizes were observed between the two groups, was for the item on expectations from 'members of your cultural group want you to be a good member of your cultural group' as well as for South African society at large, where White miners scored lower than Black miners. However, it should be noted that support for multiculturalism should not be regarded as a given. Our results seem to differ from those obtained in previous European studies, as far as support for multiculturalism is concerned. More specifically, research in the Netherlands suggests that the level of support for multiculturalism varies significantly between the public and private domains, that cultural pluralism is not perceived as an important asset of society, and that mainstream society is not inclined to put much effort into minority integration. Verkuyten and Thijs (2002) found that the majority of members of Dutch society often emphasise the desirability of assimilation of ethnic minorities to the dominant culture. However, minorities will accentuate their own identity and the necessity of cultural maintenance, and they will expect more tolerance and participation from the mainstream culture (Arends-T\u00f3th & Van de Vijver, 2000). The Dutch mainstream are less supportive of multiculturalism than Dutch immigrants, presumably because mainstreamers will gain less from support of a plural society than immigrants. However, our findings suggest a different pattern of support in South Africa. Members of both ethnic groups have the same perception of reality, they evaluate the cost and benefits of multiculturalism in the same fashion, and the attitudes amongst the employees are conducive for establishing and maintaining good intergroup relations in the workplace. The means, of the Black miners and White miners, were quite similar on almost allinstruments. Future studies should examine whether or not the support for diversification in the workplace, which is found in this study, is also found in other sectors. The findings of the study contribute to the growing literature on acculturation in South Africa, about how South Africans cope with the new evolving national identity, namely the Rainbow Nation. However, this study extends national surveys, that look at race perceptions of changes in the new South Africa, as it combines the influence of both mainstream and ethnic perceptions in predictions of well- being in the workplace of the New South Africa. Contrary to public perception and discourse, the results indicated that mainstream conditions impact in the same way on well-being at work for both Black 40 miners and White miners. The results also indicate that both of these groups do not differ much in their experiences of these acculturation conditions and outcomes in this sample. The biggest limitation of study relates to the sample size, sample specificity, the choice of negatively phrased items as well as the design used. Future studies could consider other industries with larger sample sizes as well as longitudinal design to firmly establish cause and effect, as well as the impact of the issues covered in this study. In the light of recent xenophobic attacks on foreigners, future research could consider the experience of Indians and also various immigrant groups. References Ait Ouarasse, O. (2004).

We investigated relations between adverse acculturation conditions, separation and well-being in Black and White miners. We utilized a cross- sectional design with a convenience sample of 241 Black and White miners. We then considered the effect of race in the experiences of miners and also used multigroup path analysis to determine whether identical relations between multiculturalism, work success, and wellbeing were could be found for Blacks and Whites. Mainstream segregation demands, discrimination, subtle racism and separation were strongly related to ill-health symptoms, but not to work success. In addition, these relationships were identical for Blacks and Whites. Separation fully mediated the relation between segregation and subtle racism and ill-health. Adverse conditions matter for ill-health and well-being and therefore warrant the attention of supervisors in the workplace. Future studies should consider the role of multiculturalism in well-being. Key words: Discrimination, racism, segregation, separation, ill-health 45 Introduction The goal of the large scale socio-political and economic changes since the abolishment of Apartheid was to transform South African (SA) business organizations and Public Service from discriminatory structures to ones which reflect the demographic composition and values of South African society as a whole. However, achieving this goal is still far away. For example, many previously advantaged members perceive measures like affirmative action that are aimed at enhancing the position of previously disadvantaged groups as reverse discrimination (Herman, 2000). Reviews of South African residential segregation, post-1994, concluded that little has changed since majority rule and that black and white South Africans remain starkly segregated (Christopher, 2001, 2005). Although 72.5% of a national sample indicated that they did not experience discrimination in the past six months prior to the survey, 33.4% Whites indicated that race relations have deteriorated, and the reasons provided for the findings were the sudden loss of political power and the vulnerability in the face of the governments affirmative action and black economic empowerment policies (Grossberg, 2002). Given the racial construction of privilege and discrimination in South Africa and the country's racist history, it seems very optimistic to think that huge strides have been made in the eradication of separatism, racism and discrimination. Even though national surveys do give some idea about the current state of intercultural relations in the broader South African society, there still remains a lack of empirical evidence on the prevalence of such negative conditions in the workplace. In addition, one can only speculate about the role of ethnic separation demands and orientations in the presence of those negative conditions on the well-being of employers in the New South African workplace. Acculturation studies typically focus on issues arising due to individuals or groups from different cultures coming into continuous first-hand contact (a seemingly permanent feature of the SA work context), with subsequent changes in the original culture patterns of either or both groups, making it an ideal framework for investigating the intercultural contact dynamics in the South African workplace. The theoretical framework of the present study draws on a mediation model of acculturation (Arends-T\u00f3th & Van de Vijver, 2006). Predictors in the model, called acculturation conditions, refer to contextual conditions with a bearing on the acculturation process, such as perceived racism. Mediating variables, called here separation, refer to the way individuals perceive their environment as preferring to stick to their culture and not to adopt the mainstream business culture. We assume that support for separation is influenced by contextual variables such as perceived racism. In turn, separation attitudes will influence outcomes of the acculturation process such as ill-health and work performance. The present study examines the suitability of the model in a mine in the North West province and examines differences in support for separation among Black and White employees. Literature review Antecedents: Mainstream Acculturation Condition The impact of acculturation orientation of the host culture has been taken into account and is increasingly emphasized in studies (Arends-T\u00f3th & Van de Vijver, 2000; Bourhis, 1997). (Bourhis 46 et al., 1997) integrates the acculturation strategies from, the bidimensional model, of the mainstream and those used by the minority culture. The model has been developed for describing intergroup relations in a multicultural society, but can be readily extended to intergroup relations in the workplace. The combination of acculturation preferences held by the various ethnicities in the workforce gives rise to various kinds of intergroup relations ranging from conflicting (e.g., all groups favour segregation and do not endorse integration) to consensual (e.g., groups favour multiculturalism). The nature of this relationship has an impact on acculturation outcomes (Zagefka & Brown, 2002). We examine mainstream segregation demands, subtle racism and discrimination as antecedent conditions. Mainstream segregation demands entail pressure exerted on ethnicities to keep to their own while subtle racism and discrimination refer to negative attitudes during intercultural contact. Mainstream Segregation Demands All plural societies consist of both mainstream as well as minority groups (Berry, 2006). Segregation refers to the degree to which two or more groups are separated from each other (Echenique& Fryer, 2007). Segregationists accept that minority groups maintain their heritage culture on condition that they keep their distance, as majority host members do not wish minorities to contaminate their culture (Barrette,Bourhis, Personnaz, & Personnaz, 2004). Segregation demands involve the demands imposed on acculturating groups to keep their own culture without becoming involved in the dominant culture. Tredoux and Finchilescu (2007) argued that despite legislative reform, segregation remains pervasive in South Africa and concluded that contact between groups does not necessarily unfold as a consequence of mere encounter and that spontaneous self-segregation may, in fact, be a more common outcome. In a study in French Canada, French majority undergraduates who endorsed segregation were more likely to perceive problematic relations with out-group members compared to integrationists and were more likely to feel that their cultural identity as French host majority members were threatened by the presence of North African immigrants and did not perceive North Americans as victims of discrimination (Barrette et al., 2004). Despite the South African agenda of national unity supported by initiatives such as hosting international events and celebrating national heroes, surveys seem to suggest that South Africans do not have much contact with people from other ethnic groups and do not wish to increase future contact with other groups (Hofmeyr, 2006). In line with the contact hypothesis, according to which increased contact leads to improve intergroup relations (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006), we assumed that high levels of segregation demands would negatively influence the well-being of employees at a mine in the North West province Perceived Discrimination in South Africa The SA Constitution(Act No. 108of 1996)explicitly seeks to eliminate unfair discrimination and this new political dispensation that has been taking place in South Africa since then gave rise to sociocultural and socioeconomic transformation (Horn, 2006) such as an increasingly diverse labour force. However, some have even argued 47 that members of the old advantaged groups reject racial programmes that force them out of a shrinking labour market and equate it to \"ethnic cleansing\" (Buys, 2000: 5). Whites often feel that black workers are favoured and claim that they are the victims of reversed discrimination (Easton-Leadley, 1994). Clayton (1996) argues that unfairness and reverse discrimination arguments are based on misconceptions, such as the idea that racism and sexism have been largely wiped out and that women and members of historically disadvantaged groups are already on a level playing field compared to other groups. He recognizes the continued existence of racism but maintains that equal opportunity is an acceptable substitute without the necessity of implementing proactive measures to avoid or redress the effects of racial discrimination and that affirmative action is not fair, and violates the fundamental premise that individuals should be evaluated solely on the basis of their own merit and not on the basis of their group membership (Franchi, 2003). Given the prevalence of actual and perceived discrimination in South Africa, it is important to study its role in wellness in the workplace. Discrimination, Subtle Racism and Well-being The nature of prejudice itself has changed from old-fashioned and blatant forms to modern, subtle, and rationalizable forms (Swim, Aikin, Hall, & Hunter, 1995). The perception of a 'new racism' goes beyond national boundaries and has been suggested in the US (Essed, 1991), Britain (Reeves, 1983), South Africa (Durrheim & Dixon, 2004), Australia (Augoustinos, Tuffin, & Rapley, 1999), New Zealand (Wetherell & Potter, 1992) and throughout Western Europe (Essed, 1991; Pettigrew & Meertens, 1995). Everyday discrimination may become more common, as blatant racism becomes less prevalent among dominant group members (Deitch Barsky, Butz, Chan, Brief, & Bradley, 2003). The primary doctrine of modern racism (Wetherell & Potter, 1992), which is closely related to subtle racism, holds that discrimination is a thing of the past because Blacks now have the freedom to compete in the marketplace and to enjoy those things they could not afford before; Blacks are pushing too hard, too fast, and into places where they are not wanted. These tactics and demands are unfair; therefore, recent gains are undeserved and the prestige-granting institutions of society are giving Blacks more attention and status than they deserve. In addition, modern racists are convinced that these assumptions do not constitute racism because they are empirical facts and that blatant racism is bad (McConahay, 1986). There is empirical evidence to prove the negative effects of subtle racism in daily life as well as in the workplace. An investigation into recommendations for college admission by Hodson, Dovidio, and Gaertner (2002) identified a key mechanism underlying modern racism, the credence that people give to different types of information when they make their decisions and found that more racially biased Whites consider the weaker aspect of the applicant's credentials such as standardized test scores or high school grades as more important for admissions decisions when the candidate was Black than when the candidate was White. Dovidio and Gaertner (2000) reported that when the candidates' qualifications for the position were less obvious and the appropriate decision was more ambiguous (moderate qualifications), White participants recommended Black candidates significantly less often than White candidates. Moreover, when the responses of 48 participants in the US from 1989 were compared to those of 1999, overt expressions of prejudice declined over this 10-year period, but the pattern of subtle discrimination in selection decisions remained essentially unchanged. In a recent review, Gee, Ro, Shariff-Marco, and Chae(2009)investigated the role of discrimination in health outcomes using global markers of psychological and physical functioning. It was found that a vast majority of the studies reported associations in the hypothesized direction (discrimination was associated with increased risk of mental and physical health problems). Their review suggests that negative mental health outcomes and health-related behaviours are related to self-reported experienced racism and that racism precedes ill-health rather than vice versa. Mediating Variables: Ethnic Acculturation Condition Racial and ethnic identity maintenance are typically used to help explain how minority individuals and groups adapt to living in a multicultural context. Ethnic identity is considered to develop over time through social comparison (Heim, Hunters, & Jones, 2010), and is a component of one's self-concept, which is derived from belonging to, identifying with, and participating in social and cultural practices of an ethnic group and it helps maintain self-esteem in the face of racism (Phinney, 1990, 1995). Perceived discrimination seems to accentuate ethnic identification, which in turn benefits well-being (Greig, 2003; Heim et al., 2010). Berry, Phinney, Sam, and Velder (2006) found that being involved in both cultures (integration acculturation orientation) serves to promote better psychological and socio-cultural adaptation, while not being involved in any culture or being confused about one's situation (diffuse) undermines both forms of adaptation. Belonging to the ethnic profile was associated with poorer sociocultural adaptation while belonging to the national profile was associated with moderately poorer psychological and socio-cultural adaptation. We were interested in the role of ethnic separation demands and orientation in a diverse work context characterized by adverse conditions in predicting well-being. Individual Separation Strategy and Ethnic Separation Demands at Work Ethnic identity relates to one's sense of self in terms of membership in a particular ethnic group (Liebkind, 2001; Phinney, Horenczyk, Liebkind, & Vedder, 2001). In addition, the question of acceptance by one's own ethnic group and ingroup hassles may be even more stressful and problematic for ethnic minority members than negative reactions of the majority group (Lay & Nguyen, 1998; Verkuyten, 2000). Separation is a strategy that is aimed at the prevention of mainstream influence on minority ways. Berry, Phinney, Sam, and Vedder (2006) concluded from their findings in a large internal study of adolescents that the separation profile scored low on assimilation, national identity, and contacts with the national group. Adolescents with this profile are largely embedded within their own culture and show little involvement with the larger society. Research has often shown that integration is the strategy most favoured by minority members (e.g., Pham & Harris, 2001; Zagefka & Brown, 2002); however, they may shift to separation if the mainstream reacts negatively to their integration (Ward, 49 2001). There seems to be overwhelming support for the notion that integration is usually the most successful, marginalization is the least, and assimilation and separation strategies are intermediate (Berry & Kim, 1988; Berry & Sam, 1997). Studies of separation have yielded somewhat mixed results with regard to acculturation outcomes. Neto, Barros, and Schmitz (2005) compared the effects of integration and separation on 118 Portuguese immigrants in Germany and found no differences in acculturative stress, self-esteem, or satisfaction with life whereas research adolescent ethnic repatriates to Israel, Germany and Finland who preferred the separation option reported fewer stress symptoms than those who preferred the assimilation or integration options (Jasinskaja-Lahti, Liebkind, Horenczyk, & Schmitz, 2003). Similarly, an ethnic orientation (including separation attitudes) was a significant positive predictor of psychological well-being (Vedder, Van de Vijver, & Liebkind, 2006). Research results also suggested that second-generation Moroccans in the Netherlands would look for support for school success more in the direction of their own community than in the direction of the mainstream (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). The latter finding may give a clue about the synthesis of the conflicting findings regarding separation. Separation may work well for immigrants with an ethnic community support network who can \"afford\" not to have many contacts with the mainstream but not for immigrants without a support network in their own ethnic community. Psychological and Sociocultural Acculturation Health and Wellbeing Outcomes Although acculturation researchers have used a multitude of variables as acculturation outcomes, the variables can be grouped under two major types: psychological outcomes and sociocultural outcomes (Ward, Bochner, & Furnham, 2001). Psychological adaptation is mainly studied in the stress and coping tradition and involves mental health and general satisfaction with life in the host milieu whereas sociocultural adaptation is studied in the culture learning tradition, and is mainly a matter of successful participation in the host society. It has been argued that psychological adaptation and sociocultural adaptation are linked; their correlations have been reported to be in the range of 0.4 and 0.5 (Berry, 2003). Higher scores on assimilation and integration preferences were also associated with higher correlations between psychological adaptations and sociocultural adaptation(e.g. Ward & Rana-Deuba, 1999). Perceiving oneself as a victim of discrimination by members of a dominant group is one of the major acculturative stressors that is associated with psychological symptomatology (Dion, Dion,& Pak, 1992; Liebkind & Jasinskaja-Lahti, 2000; Sanchez &Fernandez, 1993; Sandhu & Asrabadi, 1994; Ying, 1996). Murphy (1965) has argued that prejudice is likely to be less prevalent in culturally plural societies, but it is by no means absent (Berry & Kalin, 1995). Indeed, Fernando (1993) has designated racism as the most serious problem and risk factor facing immigrants and their mental health. Contextualizing the Study Despite the many social and political changes that have occurred in South Africa over the past decade, racism and the accompanying social divisions along racial lines 50 continue to be central features of the South African landscape (Smith, Stones, & Naidoo, 2003). The mining industry is not immune to the changes and challenges faced by the South African society. Newspaper headlines such as \"Miners set to strike over racism\" (Maponya, 2004) and \"What SA Really Wants: Simple respect, a racism-free, crimeless society, a good education system and employment ... some of the things South Africans ask for...\" (Anonymous, 2010); \"Opportunists will play the race card until civil society faces the challenges of living in a new democracy: We let ET, Malema hog limelight. It is also a sad reality that this lunatic was allowed to occupy centre stage of public discourse in the first place\" (Khumalo, 2010); \"Tree op teen volksmoord!\" - Act against genocide (Anonymous, 2010); \"Xenophobia another form of racism in SA\" (Anonymous, 2010); and \"Magazine say sorry for writer's racist blog\" (Anonymous, 2010) continually remind us that challenges related to race and intercultural contact is not only an issue in the mining sector but also a prominent feature in other spheres of the South African society that warrant investigation. Given this reality, we addressed the question to what extent Black and White mine workers in the North West province actually experience segregation demands, discrimination and racism and how these factors are related to their well-being. Goals of the Study were: To test the mediating role of separation in the relation between adverse acculturation conditions and well-being of mine employees in the North-West province; To examine Black and White group differences in the experience of mainstream antecedent adverse conditions, separation, and well-being. Research methods Research Design, Participants and Procedures A cross-sectional design, utilizing surveys, was used to achieve the research objectives. Research permission was obtained from management. Participants were informed about the aim of the project and were encouraged to attend sessions on site where questionnaires were administered. The anonymous and voluntary nature of the project was emphasized during the information session. The participants of this project was a convenience sample of miners in the North West Province. A total of 500 were targeted. A response rate of 59% was achieved, of which 288 responses (98%) could be utilized. However, some of the Indian respondents were deleted from the final multigroup analysis because of the low number of representation of Indians in the initial sample. Blacks and Coloured were combined in a single Black group so that the final analyses involved a Black and White group. The sample (N = 241: 83.7% of the initial usable sample) consisted of 208 males (86.3%) and 33 females (13.7%), 170 Blacks (70.5%) and 71 Whites (29.5%) miners with an average age of 31.65 years and 8.77 years of experience. Measuring instruments 51 Some instruments with well-established psychometric properties used in other cultural contexts were adapted (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). Adaptations involved replacing Dutch and Moroccan with South African and own ethnic group respectively. All acculturation scales follow a five-point Likert format ranging from strongly agree (1) to strongly disagree (5) and some item scores were reversed before the analyses so that higher scores reflect more endorsement of the underlying attitude. Mainstream domain instruments. The following measures were employed in this domain. Mainstream segregation demands (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). This is a 12-item measure of the extent to which participants think that mainstream members hold segregationist attitudes towards minority members. An example item is \"I think that most of my fellow residents would be happy to have people from other cultures than their own to be thrown out of our organisation\" ( = 0,87). Perceived discrimination (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). The scale is an 11-item measure of the extent to which participants think the situation in the organisation discriminate and requires them to drop their cultural characteristics. Discrimination is pressures exerted on the minorities to apply fully to the regulations and the general atmosphere regardless of whether these regulations encroach on minority sensitivities. The scale contains items like \"I experience discrimination in the dormitory\" ( = 0,87). Subtle racism (Subtle Racism Scale of Duckitt, 1991). This is a 10-item (four of these items were filter items and were not used in the final analysis) measure of the extent to which co-workers hold subtle racist attitudes. Sample items from this measure include \"Some groups in South Africa are getting too demanding in pushing for equal rights\", and \"Some cultural groups have a better future in our country than my cultural group\" ( = 0,86). Ethnocultural domain instruments Individual Separation Acculturation Orientation (Jackson, Van de Vijver & Biela, submitted). This is a three-item measure of the extent to which participants prefer contact with their own ethnic group members and do not seek participation in the Rainbow culture. The scale contains items such as \"I actually avoid contact with members from other cultures\" ( = 0,64). Perceived co-ethnic separation demands at work (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004) is a four-item measure of the extent to which participants think their own ethnic members want them to keep away from the majority culture. Separation is a strategy that is aimed at the prevention of mainstream influence on minority ways. The scale contains items like \"My cultural group members do not want me to make contact with members from other cultural groups\" ( = 0,72). Psychological and socio-cultural acculturation outcomes The Physical Symptoms Inventory (PSI), developed by Spector and Jex (1998), was used to assess employee physical and somatic health symptoms or ill-health with a scale that ranges from never (1) to every day (5). The PSI is a self-report measure in which respondents are asked to indicate whether or not in the past three months they had suffered any of the mentioned symptoms. Some examples of symptoms included on the scale are headaches, backache, fatigue, 52 eyestrain and trouble sleeping ( = 0,94 and 0,89 for physical and psychological ill-health respectively). Work success (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). This is a fourteen-item measure of participants' success at work. All of the items are positively phrased. It contains items pertaining to task completion, punctuality, status, and recognition at work, relationships with supervisors, and relationships with fellow workers. The scale contains items like \"I am always on time for my work\" and \"I have a good reputation among my co-workers\" ( = 0,85). A Biographical questionnaire is included in order to be able to describe the population. It includes basic biographical questions like age, sex, and race. The research project was initiated after discussions with the Human Resource Department of a major gold mine in the North-West Province of South Africa and permission was obtained from mine management and research proposal accepted at a research proposal meeting of the WorkWell Research unit. Various information sessions were held on site and leaflets were distributed to inform employees about the aim of the project and to encourage them to attend sessions on site where participants would complete questionnaires. Managers were also encouraged to allow employees to attend the sessions for completion of the questionnaires while the anonymous and voluntary nature of the project was emphasized during the information session. Five sessions were scheduled for questionnaire completion with two facilitators being present to clarify issues raised by participants.. Each session lasted two and a half hours and included two 15 minute breaks to prevent survey administration fatigue. Data Analysis The statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS-programme (SPSS Inc., 2003) and the AMOS 18 programme (Arbuckle, 2010). Exploratory factor analyses and Cronbach alpha coefficients were used to determine the internal consistency, homogeneity, and dimensionality of the measuring instruments (Clark & Watson, 1995). The Cronbach alpha coefficient contains important information regarding the proportion of variance of the items of a scale in terms of the total variance explained by that particular scale. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients are used to specify the relationship between the variables. Effect sizes (Steyn, 1999) are used to decide on the practical significance of the findings. A cut-off point of 0.30 (medium effect; Cohen, 1988) was set for the practical significance of correlation coefficients. In terms of statistical significance, the value was set at a 95% confidence interval level (p0.05). while Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to test race differences on the scales (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001). Race was the independent variable (two levels: Black and White) while the mean scores of the scales were the dependent variables. Effect sizes (Cohen, 1988) were again used in addition to statistical significance to determine the salience of relationships. To investigate the mediating role of separation in the relations between adverse antecedent mainstream conditions and well-being, structural equation modelling (SEM-multigroup analysis) was performed using AMOS 18 (Arbuckle, 2010). 53 Results Exploratory Factor Analyses of the Scales Used Exploratory factor analyses were conducted first to confirm that the hypothesized items load on the factors or latent variables (acculturation conditions, intervening ethnic demands and individual orientation, as well as the well-being indicators). Items with factor loadings higher than .30 were considered as sufficient descriptors of the latent variable. The results indicated that all scales used were uni-factorial; the first factor explained 48.06% of the variance in Perceived Mainstream Segregation Demands, 33.48% in Pressure by Management to Conform, 43.19% in Subtle Racism at Work, 41.87% in Perceived Discrimination at Work, 39.50% in Ethnic Separation Demands at Work, and 58.19% in the Separation Acculturation Strategy, 46.56% in Physical Ill-Health, 49.22% in Psychological Ill-Health and 57.85% in Perceived Work Success. Associations Between Main Constructs for Blacks and Whites Next descriptive analyses were conducted to assess the correlations between the main study construct. The correlation matrix depicting construct associations for the Black (above diagonal) and White (below diagonal) group is presented in Table 1. Table 1: Correlation matrix with all variables for Blacks (above diagonal) and Whites (below diagonal) Variables 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1.

Mediation Effect of Separation on Well-being for the Black and White Miners In this hypothetical model three perceived adverse mainstream attitudes vis \u00e0-vis multiculturalism (segregation demands, discrimination and subtle racism at work) are antecedent conditions that impact on a single latent variable (well-being at work) that is measured using three indicators namely physical and psychological ill-health (psychological adjustment) and Work success (sociocultural adjustment) through a mediating latent variable (involving ethnic separation) that is measured by two indicators namely ethnic integration demands at home and at work. We used various indices to assess the goodness of fit of the model. Black and White race group similarities and differences were examined by testing the fit of a hierarchy of models with increasing constraints on the number of invariant parameters to the data (see Table 2). Change in chi-square (2) was used to assess the relative merits of competing models, and all 54 comparisons were constructed so that the baseline model allowed differences across ethnic groups while the comparison model represented the constrained model (where there were no ethnic group differences). A nonsignificant 2test result reflects no decrement in fit, and therefore the more parsimonious and restrictive of the two models is selected. Table 2: Results of the multi-group structural equation model analysis Model 2/df 2 df Unconstrained 1.65 0.95 0.05 - - Measurement weights 1.59 0.94 0.89 0.95 0.05 4.78 4 Structural weights 1.56 0.94 Structural 0.95 0.05 11.11* 4 Inspection of Table 2 revealed that the structural residuals model (see Figure 1), in which the regression coefficients of the antecedent mainstream acculturation conditions and factor loadings on well-being at work through ethnic separation, the latent variable as mediating variable were assumed to be invariant across both Black and White race groups, was the most restrictive model with an acceptable fit: 2 (48, N = 241) = 73.72, p < .05; 2/df = 1.54 [the 2/df (recommended value in small samples, < 3), the adjusted goodness of fit index (AGFI) was .89 (recommended, .90), the Tucker Lewis index (TLI) was .95 (recommended, .90), the comparative of fit index (CFI) was .96 (recommended, .90),and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) was .05 (recommended, .05) and 2 (nonsignificant values represent good fit)]. The acceptable fit of the empirical data to the conceptual model indicates that mainstream acculturation conditions are associated with well-being at work as measured with three indicators namely physical and psychological ill-health and work success through separation as the intervening variable in the same way for Blacks and Whites in a mine in North-West Province. The results of the multigroup structural equation model analysis assuming invariant associations for Blacks and Whites are presented in Figure 1. 55 Figure 1: The results of the multigroup structural equation model analysis (structural residuals model) When we compared the likelihood 2 statistic for each fitted model we noticed that the data did not depart significantly from any of these models. Furthermore, at each step up the hierarchy from the unconstrained model (configural invariance) to the measurement residual model, the increase in 2 was never much larger than the increase in the degrees of freedom (Arbuckle, 2006); only when we fitted the measurement residual model, the increase in 2 was much larger. Therefore, we adopted the structural residuals model as describing the relations in our samples most adequately. Most of the standardized regression weights in the hypothesized model (Fig. 1) as well as the correlations (Table 1) were significant and showed the expected signs. However, it should be noted that not all parameter estimates were statistically significant. Although this information might be due to the limited sample size (Byrne, 2001; Hoelter, 1983), it could indicate that some hypothesised paths were relatively unimportant in the model. There appears to be strong evidence that the parameters in the Black group do not differ from those of the White group. Discrimination, racism, and separation work in the same adverse way for Blacks and Whites. Figure 1 also depicts a nonsignificant direct path from (the latent variable) separation to work success with a very small regression weight compared to the significant path from separation to well-being. This difference, as well as the negative significant path from well-being to subjective experience of work success, could be indicative of the relatively unimportant role of work success in the model (and in well-being). Our data suggest that separation is associated with ill-health and lack of subjective well-being and that separation mediates the path from mainstream acculturation conditions to well-being. More specifically, higher levels of mainstream segregation demands, discrimination and subtle racism at work coupled with ethnic separation demands at work and an individual separation acculturation strategy were related to lower well-being at work as measured by higher ill-health symptoms and lower subjective work success experiences Mediating Effects of Separation Demands 56 The hypothesized model is a mediation model in which adverse antecedent conditions influence ethnic acculturation separation demands, which in turn impact on the well-being of mine workers. We made a closer examination of the direct and indirect effects to evaluate their relative sizes. There is quite some literature on the testing of mediation effect (e.g., Baron & Kenny, 1986; Holmbeck, 1997; Hoyle & Kenny, 1999; Judd & Kenny, 1981; Kline, 1998; Preacher & Hayes, 2004). It has been found that the method proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986) can have a low statistical power in most situations and that joint significance tests involving the product of coefficients have been found to have greater statistical power than that of other formal methods of assessing mediation, including the Baron and Kenny approach (MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, & Sheets, 2002). Therefore, we stayed within the structural equation framework to compute the significance of mediation effects by using the bootstrap procedure as implemented in the AMOS program. The results of the mediation analysis can be found in Table 3. Table 3: Mediation Effects of Separation in the Workplace (Standardized Effects) Physical Ill-health Psychological Ill-health Work success Predictor Direct Indirect Total Direct Indirect Total Direct Indirect Total effects are significant (p < .01) / * effects are significant (p < .05) Closer inspection of Table 3 indicated that various indirect effects were significant. Given the insignificance of all direct effects of antecedent conditions on well-being or its components, we can conclude that the link of the antecedents with physical and for psychological ill-health is fully mediated by separation demands. Segregation and subtle racism showed significant, indirect effects on both physical and psychological ill-health, but not on work success. So, adverse acculturation conditions (except for discrimination) such as mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism have therefore an indirect and significant influence on physical and psychological ill-health. In contrast, perceived work success is only significantly linked with separation and not with the antecedent factors. It can be concluded that separation demands fully mediate the path from mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism to psychological adjustment and that adverse acculturation conditions (except for discrimination) matters for the experience of subjective work success. Comparisons of Black and White Groups In order to examine Black and White group differences in the experience of mainstream antecedent conditions, ethnic intervening separation at work and an individual separation strategy as well as well-being, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was carried out with race (two levels: Black and White) as independent 57 variable and the mean scores of the scales as dependent variables. The mean scores of the scales per race group are presented in Table 4. Table 4 Mean scores (SD) per scale for the Black and White group Variables Black M Black SD White M White SD Cohen's d 1.

Univariate analyses showed that subtle racism at work was the only dependent variable that showed a significant race difference. Blacks reported more subtle racism attitudes at work compared to Whites. The last column of Table 4, presenting Cohen's d values, which gauge the size of the race differences, shows that this effect size is small. Our data suggest that the workforce of our study is well aware of negative acculturation conditions of the workplace and seems to acknowledge that their environment puts pressure on them to act in a certain fashion in relation to its diversity. Scores on discrimination at work are rather high compared to the scores on the other scales, which suggest that this is the most common adverse acculturation condition faced by these mine employees Discussion Adverse mainstream conditions were positively related to ethnic separation demands and work and an individual separation strategy, ill-health and negatively related to subjective feelings of work success. This implies that a work environment characterized by more mainstream segregation, discrimination and subtle racism is more likely to contribute to ethnic members encouraging each other to separate and limited mainstream contact as well as higher levels of ill-health symptoms. Our finding seems to concur with previous consistent links between perceived racism, discrimination, and poor psychological out- comes (Clark, Anderson, Clark, & Williams, 1999; Gee, Ro, Shariff-Marco, & Chae, 2009). In this study, we tested whether the association between acculturation mainstream antecedent conditions and well-being through separation as a latent mediating ethnic variable would be invariant for Black and White group members in a mine in the North West province. Our hypothesized model was confirmed in a multigroup path analysis. 58 This means that more mainstream segregation demands, discrimination, and subtle racism coupled with a dominant ethnic separation acculturation strategy and co-ethnics demanding that their members keep to themselves at work (with limited or no intercultural contact) are associated with the experience of higher physical and psychological ill-health. In addition, mainstream segregation demands, compared to subtle racism and discrimination showed much stronger associations with an ethnic preference to separate. This result supports the positive relations found (Berry et al., 2006; Heim, Hunter, & Jones, 2010) between negative acculturation conditions, separation and ill-health as well as the importance of taking both the mainstream and ethnic conditions in consideration in acculturation studies as recommended by the Integrated Acculturation Model (Bourhis et al., 1997). It, therefore, seems likely that a workplace culture that promotes ethnic cultural separation coupled with encouragement by ethnic members at work contributes to the experience of higher levels of ill-health symptoms. We were also interested in the mediating effect of the integration in the path from adverse antecedent variables to well-being as measured by ill-health symptoms and subjective experience of work success. Our findings suggest that an indirect and significant influence of adverse conditions (excluding discrimination) on physical and psychological ill-health symptoms. It could, therefore, be concluded that separation mediates the path from mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism to physical and psychological ill-health symptoms, but that it is unrelated to subjective experience of work success. It is noteworthy that adverse acculturation conditions and orientations were unrelated to subjective experience of work success. It could be speculated that adverse conditions in the workplace with regard to diversity are probably more related to negative health outcomes than to positive outcomes (subjective experience of work success). Our findings also seem to validate Ward et al.'s (2001) reasoning that psychological and sociocultural acculturation outcomes may have their own antecedents because mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism coupled with co-ethnic separation demands were very strongly related to physical and psychological ill-health symptoms but they were hardly related to the subjective experiences of work success. It can be concluded that separation demands fully mediates the path from mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism to psychological adjustment and that mainstream adverse conditions matters for the experience of well-being at work. Our findings are in line with a recent review of discrimination and health that suggests that racism precedes, rather than follows negative mental health outcomes and health-related behaviours (Gee, Ro, Shariff-Marco, & Chae, 2009). Our study challenges public perception and discourse that portrays some groups as victims and others as perpetrators of negative intercultural attitudes. We examined whether Blacks and Whites experience the mainstream antecedent conditions, intervening variables and well-being at work differently. The results indicated that only subtle racism was reported by Blacks as more common in the workplace than by Whites although the effects were relatively small. Blacks still see more discrimination in their work environment. The results did not show major differences in perception of adversity 59 in the workplace; we also found that adverse mainstream conditions impact in the same way on well-being at work for both Blacks and Whites and that these groups also do not differ that much in their experiences of these acculturation conditions and outcomes. Therefore, our main conclusion is that White and Black miners perceive the adverse conditions vis-\u00e0-vis separation and segregation in largely the same manner. It is remarkable that we found so many similarities and so few differences in racism, segregation demands, separation, and ill-health levels for different groups and that racism, discrimination and segregation are still prevalent in the mine we studied. This study extends the psychological knowledge by incorporating cross-cultural and social-psychological theories into a framework for explaining the dynamics involved in the relationship between segregation, racism, discrimination, separation and well-being of the workplace. The findings of the study contribute to the growing literature on acculturation in South Africa in relation to how South Africans cope with the separatism, discrimination and racism at work. This study also extends national surveys that look at race perceptions on changes in the new South Africa in the sense that it combines the influence of both mainstream and ethnic perception in predicting specifying paths to possible well-being of Black and White miners in the workplace of post-Apartheid South Africa. These findings are important in an effort to facilitate better future race relations in a very fragile and young democracy. It is recommended that institutions with a multicultural work force deal with overt and, even more importantly, subtle racism in the workplace. A strong separation orientation among the employees is conducive for the development of ill-health. A comprehensive diversity management programme is called for in these institutions that on the one hand targets reporting discriminatory experiences and reducing segregations demands, and on the other hand, encourages a culture that is inclusive so as to minimize separation and racism. The main limitations of our study involve the limited sample size and the cross-sectional design used. Future studies could consider other industries with larger sample sizes as well as longitudinal design to firmly establish cause and effect as well as the impact of the issues covered as well other issues of relevance for sound race relations in South Africa. In the light of recent xenophobic attacks on foreigners, future research could consider the experience of Indians as well as various immigrant groups in the workplace of the \"New\" South Africa.

Acculturation conditions such as racism, discrimination, segregation and separation were evaluated as predictors to ascertain how it affects acculturation outcomes such as intentions to quit and ill-health, both physical and psychological, of workers in the workplace. A convenience sample (N = 327) was taken from various sectors, for example retail, banking, mining, police service, and the municipality. The study aimed to test the mediating role of separation in the relation between adverse acculturation conditions and wellbeing as measured by ill-health and intentions to quit. The results indicated that racism, discrimination, segregation and separation, ill-health and intentions to quit were positively related. The hypothesised model was confirmed in a structural equation modelling analysis. This meant that more mainstream segregation demands, discrimination, and subtle racism, coupled with a dominant ethnic separation acculturation strategy and co-ethnics demanding that their members keep to themselves at work (with limited or no intercultural contact), were associated with the experiences of higher physical and psychological ill-health, and frequent thoughts of intentions to quit. In addition, mainstream segregation demands, compared to subtle racism and discrimination, were much more strongly associated with ethnic preference to separate. Blacks reported higher segregation demands and discrimination experiences at work (conditions), an individual separation acculturation strategy and physical ill-health at work (outcomes) compared to Whites, although the effects were relatively small. Recommendations for future research are provided Keywords: Segregation, discrimination, racism, separation and ill-health 66 Introduction Since 1994, with the eradication of the apartheid system, South African businesses and public sectors have been confronted with large scale socio-political, cultural and economic challenges. Bhorat and Kanbur (2006) have reported that businesses were compelled to convert their unfair or discriminatory structures to ones which can accommodate the broader South African 'Rainbow Nation'. This implied transforming into institutions that are represented by the larger group of interest and still meet the needs of the economy in a sustainable manner. This is where the post-1994 transition was seen as the basis for redressing the economic deficit suffered by the majority of the South African population. As a result, apartheid policies were abandoned and policies such as employment equity, affirmative action and black economic empowerment were introduced (Bhorat & Kanbur 2006) that gave rise to a more multicultural workforce. Contrary to the aim of policies such as employment equity, affirmative action and black economic empowerment, research conducted after 1994 concluded that little change has been seen regarding deprived citizen's sociopolitical and economic conditions since liberation, and that black and white South Africans remain segregated (Christopher, 2001). In addition, recent events such as the killing of White farmers including the right-wing Afrikaner Weerstand Beweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement) leader, poor representation of Blacks in top management positions as well as general Black unemployment and poverty levels seem to suggest that the South African society still suffer from and struggle with racial polarization. These occurrences impact on acculturation conditions and its associated outcomes in the broader society as well as in the workplace. We propose and test a model of a negative acculturation context, mediators and outcomes in the workplace. Literature review A Model of Negative Acculturation Context, Mediators and Outcomes in the Workplace Our theoretical framework combines a mediation model of acculturation in the broader society (Arends-T\u00f3th & Van de Vijver, 2006) and in the workplace (Jackson, Van de Vijver, & Burckard, 2011). The acculturation context variables, racism, discrimination, segregation and individual separation strategy, are being investigated in the workplace and this study aims to test the mediating role of ethnic separation as measured by ethnic separation demands and an individual separation strategy in the relation between adverse acculturation conditions such as segregation demands, subtle racism and discrimination and wellbeing as measured by ill-health and intentions to quit. Acculturation Acculturation studies focus on issues arising when groups/individuals from different cultures come into continuous first-hand contact, with subsequent changes in the original culture patterns of either or both groups. Marisol, Rojas, Mar\u00eda, and Pablo (2007) argue that the acculturation concept started to be used by various American social anthropologists towards the end of the 19th century and they added that one of the first definitions of acculturation as a process came from American social anthropologists. Graves (1967) further indicated that acculturation is a term used to describe the process of bidirectional change that takes place when two ethno-cultural groups come into sustained contact with each other. This definition of acculturation implies that dominant and non-dominant cultural groups are influenced and 67 transformed by their intercultural contacts and are expected to modify some aspects of their respective culture as a means of adaptation to ethno-cultural diversity. Mainstream acculturation context Bourhis, Moise, Perreault, and Senecal (1997) indicated that attitudes of dominant groups are important for the outcome of the acculturation process. In addition to the aforementioned, Berry, Phinney, Sam, and Velder (2006) have reported that all pluralist societies consist of both dominant and mainstream as well as minority groups. Mainstream acculturation conditions such as racism, discrimination, segregation and separation have been considered in previous research (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004; Jackson, Van de Vijver & Burckard, 2011) and it was reported (Gee, Ro, Shariff-Marco & Chae, 2009) that racism by majority group members impacts negatively on the mental health of immigrants and that discrimination was associated with and impacts on mental and physical health adversely. In this study the focus is on establishing the role that contextual variables such as mainstream segregation demands, subtle racism, discrimination, and separation play in the workplace and how they impact on ill-health and intentions to quit. Segregation Zagefka and Brown (2002) indicate that segregation is about demands exerted on ethnicities to keep to their own, while racism and discrimination refer to negative attitudes during intercultural contact. Barrette, Bourhis, Personnaz, and Personnaz, (2004) have reported that host members do not wish minorities to contaminate their culture, and hence accept that minority groups uphold their heritage culture on condition that they keep their distance. For Berry et al., (2006), on the other hand, segregation occurs when individuals or groups become separated from each other, implying minimal or no contact between groups from different cultures. Dahlberg, Fredriksson and Monseny (2010) reported that high levels of segregation are observed in the US and elsewhere. Hofmeyr (2006) has reported that South Africans have little contact with people from other ethnic groups and do not wish to increase future contact with other groups in their private space. However, contact in the workplace is unavoidable. The positive relation between mainstream segregation demands, subtle racism, discrimination, separation and ill-health have been confirmed in previous studies in the South African workplace (Jackson, van de Vijver & Burckard, 2011). Considering that inter group contact is on the increase in the South African workplace, this study aims to assess the role of mainstream segregation demands in the workplace in health outcomes and intentions to quit. Discrimination Causes of discrimination could be ascribed to different reasons and intentions from different individuals or groups, ranging from isolation of individuals or groups to attitudes of individuals or groups. Ong, Fuller-Rowell and Burrow (2009) have reported that a large-scale national survey established that almost 49% of Black respondents encountered some form of discrimination in their lifetime, for example, in not being given promotion at work, hassled by police, or even being denied service. 89.7% of these respondents reported race as a reason for the discrimination. In addition, research with adolescents found that 36% of African American adolescents reported having been called a racially insulting name, 46% believed that racial discrimination resulted in them receiving a lower grade than they deserved, and a further 75% 68 reported having been bothered by store personnel because of their race (Fisher, Wallace, & Fenton, 2000). 70% reported racial experiences of others perceiving them as a threat, for example being treated suspiciously, being perceived as incompetent or being talked down to. Roscigno (2007) reported that allegations of racial discrimination in employment are more likely to arise in the high wage service and public sectors, and it is perceived that racial discrimination complaints are most likely to be of alleged discriminatory termination or firing, while complaints of discrimination in hiring or promotion are fewer. Pavalko et al. (2003) reported that a growing body of research points to an association between discrimination and physical and mental health outcomes. Reports and research documenting discriminatory experiences leave little doubt that these events are frustrating and stressful and do impact on physical and emotional health (Feagin 1991; Feagin & Vera 1995). Most research investigating the association between discrimination and health has found a significant relation between discrimination and psychological wellbeing (e.g., Broman & Clifford 1996). Ayalon and Gum (2011) documented that overall research (Kessler, Mickelson, & Williams, 1999) has shown that everyday discrimination, for example, minor but daily hassles, take a greater toll on one's health than major lifetime discrimination, such as major life events. Research by Moomal Jackson, Stein, Herman, Myer, Seedat, Madela-Mntla, and Williams (2009) on discrimination and health reported that the broad perception of unfair treatment tends to adversely affect people's health, regardless of whether the discriminatory behaviour is attributed to race or other factors. Racism Vernellia (2008) defines racism as any action or attitude, conscious or unconscious that undermines an individual or group based on their skin colour or race. Friedman (2000) reported that there is no issue other than racism that needs to be urgently addressed. Racism continues to dominate society and will do so for decades if assumptions held by whites regarding black incompetence are not outgrown. In addition, the defensiveness in reaction from black people allows political interference in what people think, say and do in the economy. The last 30 years have witnessed a change in the way racial attitudes are measured (Durrheim, Baillie, & Johnstone, 2006). Early measures of racism have been characterised as old-fashioned or blatant, containing crude expressions of hate and stereotypes of racial inferiority. Heaven and Moerdyk's (1977) adaptation of Ray's anti-black scale, for example, included such items as \"Blacks are not very hygiene-conscious\" and \"Blacks are a rather ugly race\". On the other hand, Swim, Aikin, Hall, and Hunter (1995) reported that the nature of racism has transformed from old-fashioned and blatant types to modern and subtle types. Deitch Barsky, Butz, Chan, Brief, and Bradley (2003) have reported that everyday discrimination may become more general, as blatant racism becomes less established among dominant group members. Hodson, Dovidio, and Gaertner (2002) point to empirical evidence of the adverse effects of subtle racism in the daily life of people as well as in the workplace. Recommendations for admission to colleges were investigated and a key mechanism underlying subtle racism was identified to be the credibility that people give to different types of information when they make their decisions. It was found that more racially biased white people sees the weaker aspect of a black applicant's credentials as more important for admission decisions than when the candidate was white. Dovidio and Gaertner (2000) reported that white employers were less likely to recommend black candidates for 69 positions in the workplace or admission to colleges than the white candidates, when the formers' qualifications for the position or admission were less obvious, or even that the appropriate decision to allow blacks to succeed was more ambiguous. Ethnic acculturation context Heim, Hunters, and Jones (2010) reported that racial and ethnic identity is measured on how it develops over time through comparing identities on a social level, and that it is an element of how one sees oneself. Phinney (1990) argued that the way one perceives oneself is derived from belonging to, identifying with, and/or participating in the social and cultural practices of a dominant ethnic group. This normally helps to uphold one's self-esteem when faced with racism (Phinney, 1995). Mallinckrodt and Leong (1992) reported that ethnic social support is crucial for positive wellbeing and is providing people with coping tools when they experience stressful life changes, including the stress when adjusting to unfamiliar customs, whilst Heim et al. (2010) reported that discrimination appears to draw attention or put emphasis on ethnic identification, which turns out to benefit wellbeing of minority groups. For Berry et al. (2006), separation from cultures or even confusion about where one fits in make adaptation very difficult. This study aims to establish the mediating effect of ethnic separation in the relationship between adverse mainstream conditions and ill-health, as well as intentions to quit. Ethnic separation demands and an individual separation acculturation strategy Various ethnic groups have different attitudes towards cultural adherence and toward having contact with the dominant groups. Separation research on adolescents (Berry et al., 2006) concluded that separation is an acculturation strategy aimed at preventing the influence dominant groups have on minority groups. Research (Pham & Harris, 2001; Zagefka & Brown, 2002) suggests that minority groups of adolescents are mostly rooted within their own culture and show little involvement with the dominant groups. Separation is an acculturation strategy that refers to the minority groups who accept their own cultural principles and uniqueness and reject the dominant culture's principles (Berry, 2001). Belonging to the ethnic profile was associated with poorer sociocultural adaptation, while belonging to the national profile was associated with moderately poorer psychological and sociocultural adaptation (Berry, 2001). In this study ethnic separation demands refer to pressure from co-ethnics to keep to themselves while and individual separation strategy refers to an individual's preference to have only contact with co-ethnics. Overpowering support seems to exist for the notion that integration strategies are usually the most successful, and separation strategies are intermediate (Berry & Kim, 1988; Berry & Sam, 1997). However, Ward (2001) has argued that minority groups may easily move to a separation strategy should the dominant groups react negatively to their integration strategy. Ward, Bochner and Furnham (2001) reported that minority groups will adopt an integration strategy, attempting to be similar to the members of the dominant group, rather than a separation strategy. Acculturation outcomes Ward and Kennedy (1992) reported that sociocultural outcomes related to minority groups' participation and acceptance of the dominant group's surroundings. Acculturation outcomes can be grouped under categories, namely individual acculturation outcomes, family acculturation outcomes and health (physical and psychological) outcomes. Different types of 70 individual acculturation outcomes, for example integration, separation, assimilation, rejection and deculturation, have been studied. Integration refers to the process of successfully combining aspects from both cultures and this has been empirically supported as the healthiest acculturation outcome (Cuellar & Paniagua, 2000). Separation has been defined as to remain separate from dominant cultures, whereas assimilation is the replacement of home culture and language by the new culture, and rejection occurs when the individual rejects the native culture for new culture or vice versa (Goldstein, 2004). Assimilation and integration preferences were highly related to psychological health and sociocultural adaptation (Ward & Rana-Deuba, 1999). Deculturation takes place when the individual accepts neither home culture nor the new culture. We were interested in the mediating role of ethnic separation, a combination of ethnic separation demands and a separation acculturation strategy in the relation between negative acculturation conditions and well-being at work using ill-health and intentions to quit as indicators. Psychological acculturation outcomes: Ill-health and Intentions to quit Bennett and Murphy (1997) defined health (physical and psychological) as a state of complete mental and social wellbeing and as a sense of wholeness and happiness on a physical, cultural, spiritual, and mental level. Research (Berry, 2003; Berry & Sam, 1997) indicated that those minority groups who integrate are usually achieving the most encouraging outcomes as opposed to those who separate themselves. Parker, Chan and Tully (2006) suggested that minority members who do not integrate with the dominant group would more likely show signs of depression. Noh, Beiser, Kaspar, Hou, and Rummens, (1999) reported that it has been widely known that the experience of race discrimination indeed has a significant negative effect on a person's wellbeing. They also alluded to the fact that racism is the most serious factor facing minority groups and their mental health. With regards to intentions to quit, it can be construed are thoughts that are often triggered when the minority groups do not abide by or adapt to the dominant cultures. Intentions to quit can be seen as a psychological acculturation outcome indicator as they convey information about how well the individual feels in the acculturation context, and can be linked to education and length of stay of minority groups (Ward & Kennedy, 1999). Group Differences in the Experience of Intercultural Relations in South Africa Recent surveys, both national and also international, investigating ethnic differences in opposition to such policies, suggested an element of group self-interest at play in the policy attitudes (Durrheim, 2010; Van de Vijver, Breugelmans, & Schalk-Soekar, 2008). Members of the group that had most to gain from the policies (usually the groups with the least power in society) rated them most favorably, whereas members of the group that had most to lose rated the policies most negatively. The self-interest hypothesis that was proposed as an explanation for resistance to racial policies has received mixed support (Durrheim, 2010). Initial research found that unlike group or collective self-interest (Bobo, 1983), individual self-interest was not related to racial policy attitudes (McConahay & Hough, 1976; Sears & Allen, 1984). Opposition to policies like affirmative action was therefore not so much influenced by the possibility of individuals being personally affected by the policy as well as by the extent to which their group as a whole was likely to be affected by the policy (Bobo, 1988). Recent studies have indicated that Whites still experience the recent South African diverse workplace more positive compared 71 to non-Whites despite recent legislative changes such as the Employment Equity Act (RSA, 1998) and the use of affirmative action policies that favor non-whites in both private and public institutions (Jackson, Van de Vijver & Ali, 2011; Jackson & Van de Vijver, submitted). Contextualising the study No industries in the South African workplace are untouched by the socio-political changes, such as Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) and affirmative action, or the challenges faced by the South African society as a result of these changes. Although they have transformed the landscape of the South African workplace, issues such as racism and discrimination prevail (Smith, Stones, & Naidoo, 2003) and are implied under with news headlines such as \"Employees of leading accounting firm KPMG are embroiled in a racial clash after a night of drinking at the company's action-cricket league finals\" (Van Wyk, 2011) and \"For the first time today I was able to feel what discrimination felt like when our payroll department phoned me to enquire what race I was\" (David, 2011), \"Recently a gender audit by the South African National Editors Forum found that white male journalists are paid more and hold more top positions in the South Africa's newsrooms\" (Anonymous, 2011). Such alleged incidents are continual reminders that the challenges related to racism, discrimination and challenges in cultural contact remain prominent in various spheres of South African society, including the workplace. Given this reality, the study aimed at establishing the extent of employees in the workplace experiencing racism, discrimination, segregation and separation, and how these conditions influence employees' intentions to quit and their wellbeing. The goals of the study were therefore to: investigate the associations between mainstream adverse conditions such as racism, discrimination, segregation, ethnic separation, and wellbeing at work, as measured by ill-health and intentions to quit; to test whether or hypothesized mediation model holds for Black and white group or whether systematic differences in components of the model can be observed; determine the mediating effect of ethnic separation in the relationship between adverse acculturation conditions and well-being in the workplace; and compare experiences of mainstream adverse conditions of racism, discrimination, segregation, ethnic separation, and wellbeing at work, as measured by ill-health and intentions to quit for Black and white race groups in the workplace. Research method Research design and procedure The aim of the research design is to explain the approach the research will follow. The research design used is classified as quantitative. Welman, Kruger, and Mitchell, (2005) explain quantitative research as an array of interpretive techniques that seek to describe, decode, translate and otherwise come to terms with the meaning of naturally occurring phenomena in the social world. The specific methods used include questionnaires to gather information. Survey questionnaires were distributed to conveniently selected employees in various sectors of the workplace. These employees were mostly the colleagues and co-workers of network members and acquaintances. In addition, permission was acquired through formal verbal requests to line managers during fiscal visits to various workplaces to gather data from employees not acquainted 72 with the researcher filling out the questionnaires. The purpose, anonymity and voluntary nature of the research and its advantages were explained to prospective participants after permission were granted during lunch break briefings. Participants were given two weeks to complete the questionnaires, which were then to be dropped in a sealed box in the HR section that were later collected by the researcher. Sampling and Participants Participants were conveniently sampled from different sectors in the workplace. The usefulness of this sampling technique is that it allows one to gather basic data and trends and is useful in identifying relationships among different phenomena. The participants of this study were therefore employees from various sectors in the South African workplace that were available for, and willing to answer questions on race relations in the workplace (conveniently selected). Table 1 (below) represents some of the characteristics of the participants. Table 1: Participant Characteristics Item Description Category Frequency Percentage Gender Male 146 44.65 Female 181 55.35 Age 18 - 25 76 23.24 26 - 33 133 40.67 34 - 41 82 25.08 42 - 49 24 7.34 50 - 60 12 3.67 Race White 77 23.55 Black 109 33.33 Coloured 113 34.56 Indian 26 7.95 Other 2 0.61 Qualifications Grade 12 101 30.89 Certificate 74 22.63 Diploma 82 25.08 Degree 41 12.54 Postgraduate 25 7.65 The sample (N = 327) consisted mainly of female employees (55.35%), in the age range between 26 and 33 years (40.67%), coloured (34.56%) and holding a grade 12 or National Senior certificate (30.89%). Despite their cultural differences, given the history of the country we decided to combine Blacks and Coloureds in the multigroup analyses, thereby maintaining adequate sample size for these groups. There are various cultural differences between these ethnic groups, which would be an argument against their combination. However, we argue that for the purposes of our research, the combination is adequate. It may be noted that our combination of groups is in line with the Employment Equity Act in which all previously disadvantaged groups are called Black: 'Black 73 people' is a generic term which refers to Africans, Coloureds and Indians in the South African Employment Equity Act 55 of 1998 (RSA, 1998). Furthermore, both Blacks and Coloureds share a history as the victims of institutionalized racism and oppression, and they share the same position in the commonly perceived divide of 'Black' and 'White' in South Africa (Makhalemele, 2005). Measuring instruments Some instruments with well-established psychometric properties used in other cultural contexts were adapted (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). Adaptations involved replacing Dutch and Moroccans with South African and own ethnic group respectively. All acculturation scales follow a five-point Likert format ranging from strongly agree (5) to strongly disagree (1), and some negatively phrased item were reversed before the analyses so that higher scores reflect more endorsement of the underlying attitude. The measuring instrument consisted of four sections, namely the mainstream domain, the ethnic domain, work-related psychological acculturation outcomes and a biographic section to facilitate comparisons. Mainstream domain instruments Mainstream segregation demands (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). This is a 12-item measure of the extent to which participants think that mainstream members hold segregationist attitudes towards minority members. A sample item is \"I think that most of my fellow residents would be happy to have people from other cultures than their own to be thrown out of our organisation\". Percieved discrimination (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). The scale is an 11-item measure of the extent to which participants think the situation in the workplace is discriminatory and requires them to drop their cultural characteristics. Discrimination refers to pressure exerted on the minorities to apply fully to the regulations and the general atmosphere regardless of whether these regulations encroach on minority sensitivities. The scale contains items such as \"I experience discrimination in our organisation\". Subtle racism (Subtle Racism Scale of Duckitt, 1991). This is a 10-item (four of the items were filter items and were not used in the final analysis) measure of the extent to which co-workers hold subtle racist attitudes. A sample item includes \"Some groups in South Africa are getting too demanding in pushing for equal rights\". Ethnic domain instrument Perceived co-ethnic separation demands at work (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004) is a four-item measure of the extent to which participants think their own ethnic members want them to keep away from the majority culture. Separation is a strategy aimed at the prevention of mainstream influence on minority ways. The scale contains items such as \"My cultural group members do not want me to make contact with members from other cultural groups in our organisation\". Individual separation acculturation strategy. This new instrument is a three-item measure of the extent to which participants prefer contact with their own ethnic group members and do not seek participation in the 'Rainbow Nation' culture. The scale contains items such as \"I actually avoid contact with members from other cultures\". Psychological acculturation outcomes 74 Well-being: This is an adapted version of the 18 physical health symptoms of the PSI of Spector and Jex (1998), complemented with a list of 9 common psychological complaints based on a slightly modified version of the World Health Organization Cross-National Survey of Psychological and Somatic Symptoms (1988). The scale employs a frequency format that ranges from never (1) to every day (5). The self-report measure asks respondents to indicate whether or not in the past three months they had suffered any of the mentioned symptoms. Some examples of symptoms included in the scale are headaches, backache, fatigue, eyestrain and trouble sleeping, concentrating and constant anxiety or panic attacks. Intentions to quit (develop for the study). This is a three-item measure of participants' intentions to quit their work. All of the items are positively phrased. It contains items pertaining to. A Biographical questionnaire was also included, dealing with basic biographical questions such as age, sex, and race. Data analysis The statistical analysis was completed with the help of the SPSS-programme (SPSS Inc., 2003). Descriptive statistics (e.g. means, standard deviations, skew and kurtosis) was used to scrutinize data. Cronbach alpha coefficients were used to determine the internal consistency, homogeneity and uni-dimensionality of the measuring instruments (Clark & Watson, 1995). Coefficient alpha contains important information regarding the variance proportion of the items on a scale in terms of total variance explained by that particular scale. Exploratory factor analyses were carried out to determine construct validity of the measuring instruments. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were used to specify the relationship between the variables in terms of statistical significance; we set the value at a 95% confidence interval (p < 0,05). Effect sizes (Steyn, 1999) were used to decide on the practical significance of the findings. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were used to specify relationships between the variables. A cut-off point of .30 (medium effect, Cohen, 1988) was set for the practical significance of correlation coefficients. To investigate the mediating role of ethnic separation in the relations between adverse mainstream conditions and wellbeing for Black and White employees, structural equation modelling (SEM-) with multigroup analysis was performed using AMOS 18. Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was carried out with race (two levels: Black and White) as independent variable and the mean scores of the scales as dependent variables. A MANOVA tests whether mean differences among groups on a combination of dependent variables are likely to have occurred by chance when, as was the case in our data as documented below, the dependent variables are correlated (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). Effect sizes (Cohen, 1988) were used in addition to statistical significance to determine the significance of relationships. Effect sizes indicate whether obtained results are practically important (whereas statistical significance may often show results which are of little practical relevance). Results The results of this study consist of three parts: (1) the descriptive statistics of measuring factors/variables and correlation between adverse acculturation conditions or characteristics, mediating variables and wellbeing (the acculturation psychological outcomes as measured by physical and psychological ill-health and intentions to quit); (2) the testing of the mediating role 75 of ethnic separation in the relationship between the adverse acculturation antecedents and wellbeing amongst employees in the South African workplace; and (3) comparisons of Black and White groups. Exploratory factor analyses and associations between antecedent conditions, intervening variables and wellbeing at work. Exploratory factor analyses were conducted first to confirm that the hypothesised items load on the factors or latent variables. Items with factor loadings higher than .30 were considered as sufficient descriptors of the latent variable. The results indicated that all scales used were uni-factorial; the first factor explained 56.60% of the variance in Perceived Mainstream Segregation Demands; 45.87% in Subtle Racism at Work; 60.33% in Perceived Discrimination at Work; 56.29% in Ethnic Separation Demands at Work; 62.48% in Individual Separation Acculturation Strategy; Ill-Health; 61.20% in Psychological Ill-Health; and 81.12% in Intentions to quit. The descriptive statistics the product-moment correlation coefficients between the different constructs used in this research project are presented in Table 2 (below). Inspection of Table 2 shows that all the alpha coefficients were higher than the guideline of the alpha coefficient larger than .70 (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). Table 2 also revealed that Segregation demands are statistically significantly related to perceived discrimination (with a large effect for both groups), subtle racism (large effect for both groups), ethnic separation demands (large effect for Blacks and medium effect for Whites), and individual separation strategy (large effect for both groups). Perceived Discrimination is statistically and significantly correlated to subtle racism (with a large effect), ethnic separation demands (large effect for Blacks and medium effect for Whites), and individual separation strategy (with a medium effect for both groups). Subtle Racism is statistically significantly related to ethnic separation demands (large effect for Blacks and medium effect for Whites) and individual separation strategy (large effect for Whites and medium effect for Blacks). Physical health is statistically significantly related to psychological health (large effect for both groups).

In this hypothetical model three perceived adverse mainstream attitudes (segregation demands, discrimination and subtle racism at work) are antecedent conditions that impact on a single latent variable (wellbeing at work) that is measured using three indicators, namely physical and psychological ill-health and intentions to quit (psychological acculturation outcomes) through a mediating latent variable (involving ethnic separation) that is measured by two indicators, namely ethnic integration demands at work and an individual separation acculturation strategy. The similarities and differences between the Black and White groups were explored by testing the fit of a hierarchy of models with increasing constraints on the number of invariant parameters. We used various indices to assess the goodness of fit of the model. However, the solutions for the different hierarchical models prove to be not admissible. This means that in this model the regression coefficients of the antecedent negative acculturation conditions and factor loadings employee attitudes at work through ethnic separation, the latent mediating variable on acculturation outcomes, were variant or not constant across both Black and White groups. This also indicates that some variance estimates were negative, or that some exogenous variables have an estimated covariance matrix that is not positive definite. It therefore suggests either that your model is wrong or that the sample is too small (J\u00f6reskog & S\u00f6rbom, 1984). We then decided to report the fit statistic for the hypothetical model using the total sample as this model yielded acceptable results. We used various indices to assess the goodness of fit of the model. The structural equation model analysis (see Figure 1) yielded an acceptable fit: 2(15, N = 1.51 [the 2/df (recommended value in small samples, < 3), the adjusted goodness of fit index (AGFI) was .96 (recommended, . 90), the Tucker Lewis index (TLI) was .99 (recommended, .90), the comparative of fit index (CFI) was .99 (recommended, 0 .90), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) was .04 (recommended, .05). As can be seen in Figure 1, the acceptable fit of the empirical data to the conceptual model indicates that mainstream acculturation conditions are associated with wellbeing at work as measured with three indicators, namely physical and psychological ill-health and intentions to quit through separation as the intervening variable. Figure 1: Results of the Mediating Acculturation Model Analysis /*p < .05. **p < .01. 77 Figure 1 (above) indicated that the paths from mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism to ethnic separation were significant, with mainstream segregation demands yielding the strongest association with ethnic separation compared to the other mainstream adverse conditions and ethnic separation. In addition, the path from ethnic separation to wellbeing at work was also significant. This finding suggests that a perceived mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism are related to wellbeing at work in this sample. Employees who experience more mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism at work also reported better wellbeing at work. We can therefore conclude that perceived mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism are significant factors in wellbeing at work. Mediating effects of ethnic separation The hypothesized model is a mediation model in which adverse antecedent conditions influence ethnic separation, which in turn impacts on wellbeing of workers. We made a closer examination of the direct and indirect effects to evaluate their relative sizes. There is some literature on the testing of mediation effect (e.g., Baron & Kenny, 1986; Holmbeck, 1997; Hoyle & Kenny, 1999; Judd & Kenny, 1981; Kline, 1998; Preacher & Hayes, 2004). It has been found that the method proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986) can have a low statistical power in most situations and that joint significance tests involving the product of coefficients have been found to have greater statistical power than that of other formal methods of assessing mediation, including the Baron and Kenny approach (MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, & Sheets, 2002). Therefore, we stayed within the structural equation framework to compute the significance of mediation effects by using the bootstrap procedure as implemented in the AMOS programme. The results of the mediation analysis can be found in Table 3 (below). Table 3: Mediation Effects of Separation in the Workplace (Standardized Effects) Physical Ill-health Psychological Ill-health Intentions to Quit Predictor Direct Indirect Total Direct Indirect Total Direct Indirect Total < .01. Closer inspection of Table 4 indicated that in line with observations from Figure 1, total and indirect effects were observed for physical and psychological ill-health as well as intentions to quit. In addition, the insignificance of all direct affects suggests that the link with physical and psychological ill-health as well as intentions to quit is fully mediated by ethnic separation. Mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism have, therefore, indirect and significant influence on psychological acculturation outcomes (physical and psychological ill-health as well as intentions to quit). It can be concluded that ethnic separation fully mediates the path from mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism to psychological acculturation outcomes and that mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism matter for the experience of wellbeing at work. Comparisons of Black and White groups 78 In order to examine Black and White group differences in the experience of mainstream antecedent conditions, ethnic intervening separation at work and an individual separation strategy as well as well-being, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was carried out with race (two levels: Black and White) as independent variable and the mean scores of the scales as dependent variables. The mean scores of the scales per race group are presented in Table 3. The multivariate effect of race just was significant, Wilks' Lambda = 0.94, F(8, 290) = 2.531, p = 0.01. Univariate analyses showed that segregation demands and discrimination at work (conditions), an individual separation acculturation strategy and physical ill-health at work (outcomes) were the only dependent variable that showed a significant race difference. Blacks reported higher segregation demands and discrimination experiences at work (conditions), an individual separation acculturation strategy and physical ill-health at work (outcomes) compared to Whites. The last column of Table 4, presenting Cohen's d values, which gauge the size of the race differences, shows that this effect size is small.

Our data suggest that the participants of our study are well aware of negative acculturation conditions and outcomes of the workplace and seem to acknowledge that their environment puts pressure on them to act in a certain fashion in relation to its diversity. Scores on discrimination at work are rather high compared to the scores on the other scales, which suggest that this is the most common adverse acculturation condition faced by these mine employees. Discussion The aim of the study was to determine the relationships between adverse acculturation conditions (pressure to segregate and overt and covert discrimination), separation attitudes, and wellbeing at work. Adverse mainstream conditions were positively related to ethnic separation demands and work and an individual separation strategy, ill-health and intentions to quit. This implies that a work environment characterised by more mainstream segregation, discrimination and subtle racism is more likely to contribute to ethnic members encouraging each other to separate and limited mainstream contact as well as higher levels of ill-health symptoms and frequent thoughts of intentions to quit. Our finding seems to concur with previous consistent links between perceived racism, discrimination, and poor psychological outcomes (Clark, Anderson, Clark, & Williams, 1999; Gee, Ro, Shariff-Marco, & Chae, 2009). 79 The study also tested the association between acculturation mainstream antecedent conditions and wellbeing through separation as a latent mediating ethnic variable. The hypothesised model was confirmed in a structural equation modelling analysis. This means that more mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism, coupled with a dominant ethnic separation acculturation strategy and co-ethnics demanding that their members keep to themselves at work (with limited or no intercultural contact), are associated with the experience of higher physical and psychological ill-health and frequent thoughts of intentions to quit. In addition, mainstream segregation demands, compared to subtle racism and discrimination, were much more strongly associated with ethnic preference to separate. This result supports the positive relations found (Berry et al., 2006; Heim, Hunter, & Jones, 2010; Jackson et al., 2011) between negative acculturation conditions, separation and ill-health as well as the importance of taking both the mainstream and ethnic conditions into consideration in acculturation studies, as recommended by the Integrated Acculturation Model (Bourhis, 1997). It therefore seems likely that a workplace culture that promotes ethnic cultural separation coupled with encouragement by ethnic members at work contributes to the experience of higher levels of ill-health symptoms (Jackson et al., 2011). The study also focussed on the mediating effect of the separation in the path from adverse antecedent variables to wellbeing, as measured by ill-health symptoms and intentions to quit. Our findings suggest an indirect and significant influence of adverse conditions (excluding discrimination) on physical and psychological ill-health symptoms and intentions to quit. It could, therefore, be concluded that separation mediates the path from mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism to physical and psychological ill-health symptoms and intentions to quit. It can be concluded that separation demands fully mediate the path from mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism to psychological acculturation outcomes at work, and that mainstream adverse conditions matter for the experience of wellbeing at work. Our findings are in line with a recent review of discrimination and health that suggests that racism precedes, rather than follows negative mental health outcomes and health-related behaviours (Gee et al., 2009; Jackson et al., 2011). Our study also challenges public perception and discourse that portrays some groups as victims and others as perpetrators of negative intercultural attitudes (Jackson et al., 2011). Therefore another aim of the study was to determine whether Blacks and Whites experience the mainstream antecedent conditions, intervening variables and well-being at work differently. The results showed that segregation demands and discrimination at work (conditions), an individual separation acculturation strategy and physical ill-health at work (outcomes) were the only dependent variable that showed a significant race difference. Blacks reported higher segregation demands and discrimination experiences at work (conditions), an individual separation acculturation strategy and physical ill-health at work (outcomes) compared to Whites, although the effects were relatively small. Our findings differ from those of Jackson et al (2011) who found that only subtle racism was reported by Blacks as more common in the workplace than by Whites. Blacks still see more discrimination in their work environment. The results did not show major differences in perception of adversity in the work place. Therefore, our main conclusion partly support public perception and discourse that portrays Blacks as victims of negative intercultural attitudes and that racism, discrimination and segregation are still prevalent in the workplaces that we studied. 80 This paper extends the psychological knowledge by incorporating cross-cultural and social-psychological theories into a framework for explaining the dynamics involved in the relationship between segregation, racism, discrimination, separation and well-being of the workplace. The findings of the study contribute to the growing literature on acculturation in South Africa in relation to how South Africans cope with the separatism, discrimination and racism at work. This study also extends national surveys that look at race perceptions on changes in the new South Africa by combining the influence of both mainstream and ethnic perception in predicting specifying paths to wellness at workplace of post-Apartheid South Africa. These findings are important in an effort to facilitate better future race relations in a young democracy with a history of bad ethnic relations. It is recommended that institutions with a multicultural workforce deal with overt and, even more importantly, subtle racism in the work place to increase wellness at work to support national initiatives to facilitate better intercultural relations. The main limitations of the study involve the limited sample size and the cross-sectional design used. Future studies could consider specific industries with larger sample sizes as well as longitudinal design to firmly establish cause and effect as well as the impact of the issues covered as well other issues of relevance for sound race relations in South Africa. In the light of recent racial polarisation in South Africa, future research could consider the experience of Indians as well as various immigrant groups in the workplace of the \"New\" South Africa.

Research purpose - We test a dual process model of diversity outcomes in which we distinguish a positive (work-related) stream that links positive diversity conditions through active coping to work outcomes and a relatively independent (health-related) stream of negative antecedents, mediating passive coping skills, and ill-health related outcomes. Motivation for the study - We wanted to test the viability of a dual process model to understand diversity outcomes in the workplace. Research design, approach and methods - A convenience sample (n = 158) was recruited from members of the SAPS in Gauteng, using a cross-sectional design. Instruments used in previous acculturation research were adapted to measure contextual factors, coping and diversity outcomes. Main findings - We obtained a very good fit for our proposed hypothetical model. Approach coping partially mediated the relation between positive acculturation conditions and subjective experience of work success whereas avoidance coping fully mediated the relation between discrimination and ill-health symptoms are related to ill-health symptoms. Practical/managerial implications - Mainstream facilitating conditions and discrimination influence individual coping styles which in turn impact on ill-health and the subjective experiences of work success. In addition, ill-health also impacts negatively on work success experiences among the sampled SAPS members. It, therefore, would make sense for the SAPS to sanction discrimination. Contribution/value add - We developed, tested and found support for a variation of the mediated dual process model for diversity (Jackson & Van de Vijver, submitted), using coping strategies as mediators. The model adds to our insight into diversity in organisations. Keywords: Multiculturalism, tolerance, discrimination, acculturation, health and work success 87 Introduction South Africa is culturally diverse. So are its organisations. Employees have to deal with this diversity in two ways. The first involves the plural composition of the workforce; South-African workers at all levels have colleagues from other cultural groups at the same or different rank. The second involves differences between the employee's home culture and the culture of the workplace. There is a disparity between the cultures of the home and the workplace for many South Africans. The business world as currently conceptualised and structured in most South African corporations is generally cast in a Eurocentric mould (Khoza, 2002). The differences with Afrocentric styles are big; the latter focus more on interpersonal relations. As a consequence, many Black groups (although being considered as the mainstream from a political perspective based on their ability to mobilize votes) experience their economic (work) life as belonging to a different culture. If little or no consideration is given to indigenous cultures and worldviews, there is a serious danger of imposing the business culture on employees and alienating them from their organisations. South Africa has a long history of discrimination but the dawn of the democratic dispensation post-1994 we saw the introduction of a number of initiatives aimed at addressing past injustices such as the use of affirmative action practices in appointments and promotions in especially the private sector. The introduction of these practices unfortunately also led to newspaper headlines such as \"Whites not truly welcome\", \"Union challenges prisons AA police\", \"Solidarity in new affirmative action case\" and \"Union goes to court over AA\" (http://www.fin24.com/Economy/Whites-not-truly-welcome-20120713). Two decades after the first democratic elections South Africans are still struggling with intercultural contact in especially the workplace. Dynamics involved in intercultural contact/interaction are issues typically covered in diversity and acculturation studies. The primary objective of this research was to explore the impact of acculturation context and individual variables on diversity outcomes of SAPS members. Theoretical models of acculturation are employed that have been developed in cross-cultural psychology. The core constructs of the study are constituted by positive or facilitating acculturation context variables and discrimination or a restraining acculturation contextual variable as antecedent variables, approach and avoidance coping strategies as intervening variables and subjective work success and ill-health symptoms as outcome variables. Literature review Background of the dual process model of diversity outcomes The current study addresses the question of how employees of the South African Police Service (SAPS) cope with intercultural relations in their increasingly diverse organisation. Knowledge about how individuals cope with interpersonal problems is important because we spend a lot of our time interacting with others (Carpenter & Scott, 1992). Negative social interactions and interpersonal stressors have been found to be negatively related to psychological and physical well-being (Ewart, Taylor, Kraemer, & Agras, 1991; Herbert Walen & Lachman, 2000). Walen and Lachman (2000) provided evidence that social tension was negatively related to health, life satisfaction, and positive mood, while it was positively related to health problems and negative mood. Our theoretical framework draws on mediation models of coping (Folkman & Lazarus, 1988), acculturation (Arends-T\u00f3th & Van de Vijver, 2000, 2006), 88 and the Job Demands-Resources model (Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, & Schaufeli, 2001). We were interested in whether we can understand acculturation and diversity outcomes such as subjective experiences of work success and ill-health using a coping perspective in a dual process framework linking acculturation demands and resources. We describe the relevant theoretical frameworks below. The Job Demands-Resources Model The Job Demand-Resources (JD-R) model tries to explain how employees combine job demands and job resources in processes of work wellness and burnout. The model assumes that two underlying psychological processes play a role in burnout and disengagement (Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, & Schaufeli, 2001). Schaufeli and Bakker (2004) extended the JD-R model by including engagement and by adding indicators for health impairment and organisational withdrawal in the Comprehensive Burnout and Engagement (COBE) Model. The COBE model also assumes that the energetic process links job demands with health problems via burnout while the motivational process links job resources via work engagement with organisational outcomes. The Job Demand-Resources (JD-R) model has effectively been used to explain organisational commitment (Jackson, Rothmann, & Van de Vijver, 2006), job satisfaction (Martinussen, Richardsen & Burke, 2007), absenteeism (Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004), performance (Xanthopoulou Bakker, Demerouti & Schaufeli, 2009), and workplace bullying (Van den Broeck, Baillien, & De Witte, 2011). More recently the basic premises of the Job Demand-Resources (JD-R) model have also been extended to a dual process model to explain adaptation in the acculturation process (Jackson & Van de Vijver, submitted), psychosomatic complaints (Hakanen, Bakker & Schaufeli, 2006), as well as mental health, including depression (Antaramian, Huebner, Hills, & Valois, 2010; Hakanen, Schaufeli & Ahola, 2008). These studies demonstrated that the JD-R model is informative in explaining workers' health as well as a meaningful and insightful framework for understanding organisations' productivity. Acculturation Acculturation is a process of interaction of cultures and it can be defined as what happens when groups of individuals having different cultures come into continuous first-hand contact, with subsequent changes in the original culture patterns of either or both groups (Redfield, Linton, & Herskovits, 1936). A bidimensional acculturation model is adopted here which postulates that ethnic and host cultures constitute two independent dimensions and the adherence to the one may not affect adherence to the other (Berry, 1997). When considered in conjunction, the independent dimensions yield four acculturation strategies at the disposal of mainstreamers, namely melting pot (full adaptation to the mainstream culture while giving up the home culture), multiculturalism (maintenance of home culture and adopting the mainstream culture), segregation (full maintenance of the home culture, mainstream culture is not adopted) and exclusion (adherence to neither culture). From the perspective of the immigrants, these four are called assimilation, integration, separation, and marginalisation, respectively. The present research makes use of the above frameworks of acculturation to explain diversity experience in the SAPS. We restrict the discussion of antecedent, intervening, and outcome variables to those that were deemed relevant for understanding diversity in SAPS and that were addressed in the present study. In our view, acculturation and multiculturalism are 89 fruitful frameworks to study diversity in South Africa, because we can use extant concepts and models of intercultural contacts and acculturation to describe intercultural contact and acculturation, the SAPS organisational culture and to understand the structure and dynamics of multicultural teams in SAPS. Antecedent factors The conditions in which coping with diversity takes place are important for process and outcomes (Berry, 1997; Bourhis, Moise, Perreault, & Senecal, 1997; Jackson, 2012; Jackson, Van de Vijver, & Burckard, 2011). Bourhis et al. (1997) stressed the importance of the intergroup attitudes preferred by the majority as determinants of diversity outcomes. Jackson, Van de Vijver and Ali (2012) pointed to the importance of intergroup attitudes preferred by the (majority and) minority ethnics as determinants of diversity outcomes. In this study acculturation, antecedents are multiculturalism, tolerance (positive majority context), ethnic vitality and social support (positive ethnic context) and discrimination (negative majority context). Multiculturalism Scholars from various disciplines have attempted to define the construct of multiculturalism. The definition differs somewhat across disciplinary perspectives. Psychologists, for example, define the construct at the micro-level to include elements of tolerance and respect, while organisational scholars define it at a meso-level to include elements of a diversity climate. Demographers and sociologists tend to define multiculturalism at a macro-level as involving a society with multiple cultures. These differences in disciplinary perspectives gave rise to four categories of definitions, depending on whether they were based on relativism based, polarities, typologies, or dimensions (Munusamy, 2009). The first two perspectives have been quite controversial. For example, there has been quite some discussion on the desirability and feasibility of creating a coherent society based on multiple ethnic groups that agree on basic values of the society. A good example is the discussion in Western Europe on the need for all groups to accept basic freedoms, civic attitudes, and democratic rights as organizing principles of society. In line with the theoretical perspective (acculturation and organisational psychology), we adopted a typological and dimensional approach of multiculturalism, as frequently adopted in psychology. We view multiculturalism as one of four possible acculturation strategies (type) according to Berry (1997). Therefore, in this study multicultural norms (policy to management of diversity dimension) relate to rules prescribing behaviour in a multiethnic context where multicultural practices (implementation dimension) highlight examples of behaviour that are related to these rules such as respect for differences, in line with the dimension or level approach for investigating and understanding the concept (Eldering, 1996; Vertovec, 1996). Psychological research (e.g., Breugelmans & Van de Vijver, 2004) shows that in as much as a multicultural ideology is perceived as a solution for managing plural societies, support for it should not be taken for granted and differs both across individuals and ethnic groups. Minorities, who stand to gain from this policy, are usually more supportive than the majority or dominant group; the latter may see these policies as a threat to their dominant position. Support for multiculturalism is negatively related to ethnocentrism, perceived ethnic threat, intergroup competition, exclusion of immigrants in the larger society (Citrin, Sears, Mutse, & Wong, 2001; 90 Raijman, 2005; Verkuyten & Brug, 2004) and preference for ethnic integration strategies, work success and reduction of ill-health symptoms in the workplace (Jackson, Van de Vijver, & Ali, 2012). Tolerance Tolerance, acceptance, being open, understanding, and respect are important aspects of multiculturalism. Tolerance is related to the principle of reciprocity and amounts to showing respect for the rights, opinions and practices of others or not imposing your views on others (Munusamy, 2009). This conceptualisation of the interrelatedness of tolerance and multiculturalism is very much in line with the requirements for multiculturalism according to Berry and Kalin (1995), namely intercultural contact and participation in society by all groups, and general support for cultural maintenance by immigrants, low levels of prejudice and intolerance in the population (no discrimination), positive attitudes towards each other should exist among the diverse ethno-cultural groups, a degree of attachment to the larger society should exist, without the derogation of its essential ethnocultural groups. The importance of tolerance or the absence of prejudice and discrimination is perhaps best described by the negative impact of racism and discrimination on well-being in the acculturation process as demonstrated in various studies (Gee, Ro, Shariff-Marco, & Chae, 2009; Jackson, Van de Vijver, & Burckard, 2011; Jackson & Van de Vijver, submitted). Many previously advantaged members perceive measures like affirmative action that are aimed at enhancing the position of previously disadvantaged groups as reverse discrimination (Herman, 2000). Discrimination In the most simplistic sense, discrimination refers to any practices and policies that advantage or benefits one group at the expenses of another or the inequitable treatment based on group membership. Discrimination, individual or group-based, involves a group of individuals being given preferential treatment over others (Cascio, 2010). South Africa has a historical legacy of deeply entrenched racial discrimination. However, this changed after 1994 with the adoption a New Constitution (RSA, 1996), that \"prohibits unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds, including race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth\" (RSA,1996: 3). The extensive use of affirmative action in promotions in especially the public sector, has recently seen an increase in discrimination cases against state departments such as SAPS by especially Whites, Indians and Coloureds. The experience of discrimination may have short or long term consequences for the victims. The effects of perceived discrimination on well-being include psychological effects such as higher stress levels, anxiety, and depression (Huynh, Devos, & Dunbar, 2012; Noh & Kaspar, 2003). Work-related consequences of perceived discrimination include increased absenteeism and lower productivity (Abbas, Hameed, & Waheed, 2011), job dissatisfaction (Channar, Abbassi, & Ujan, 2011), reduced commitment (Channar et al., 2011; Goldman, Slaughter, Schmit, Wiley, & Brooks, 2008), reduced organisational citizenship behaviour (Ensher, Grant-Vallone, & Donaldson, 2001), and turnover intentions (Goldman et al., 2008). Discrimination in the workplace was also negatively associated with work success and positively related to subtle 91 racism, segregation demands, and ill-health symptoms (Jackson, Van de Vijver & Burkard, 2011). All of these may have severe consequences for the continued existence of the organisation. Ethnic vitality Ethnic minority acculturation features have an impact on acculturation outcomes. A group's capacity for information sharing and resource mobilization may be characterized in terms of its social capital. Social capital refers to the resources or information available through, and embedded within, the network of relationships among individuals or among social units (Nahapiet & Ghosphal, 1998). Social capital is based on the relationships that can be developed by exchanging resources, information or support with others. It is different from human capital, which is usually defined as individual ability. In contrast, social capital is more likely to be defined as opportunities of the individual that could be advantageous (Burt, 1997). Since the nature of diversity reflects the relationships among individuals, it is rational to examine diversity dynamics from a social capital perspective, as a feature of ethnic vitality, network and support perspective (Chang, 2009). Ethnic vitality can be regarded as a feature of social capital. In this study, the concept of ethnic vitality refers to ethic institutions that can support the acculturation process, such as the availability of places of worship, shops, recreational opportunities, and educational resources (e.g., Adelman, 1988; Malewska-Peyre, 1982). Being psychologically close and sharing more or less the same acculturation experiences, members of the same minority could be very useful in providing social networks for support and expertise about how to deal with the dominant culture. A minority that is vital and supportive acts as both springboard from which minority individuals can deal with the mainstream culture, which is seen in the positive effects on relationships and work success, and as a safety net that provides support to deal with negative acculturation experiences, which is done indirectly via relationships with co-ethnics. There is a controversy, though, as to the role of ethnically vital pockets (Ait Ouarasse, 2004). It is thought that although ethnic gatherings can have the potential to provide a source for help and an opportunity for feeling ventilation, they also can dissociate minority members from engagement in the mainstream context and impede integration (Richardson, 1974). Social support Social support is defined as the general availability of friends and family members that provide psychological and material resources. Much research in sociology (Stack, 2000) and psychology has reported on the beneficial effects of social support. Many psychological studies provide evidence that even the mere perceived availability of social support can have a direct beneficial effect on health and mood (Leskel\u00e4, Ryts\u00e4l\u00e4, Nezlek & Allen, 2006). Research showed that perceived social support may protect individuals against stressful life events (You, Van Orden, & Conner, 2010). There is a direct positive effect of social support networks on immigrants' adjustment (Leong & Ward, 2011). In addition, the effect of social support has been shown to depend on the stress level but to be much less beneficial to well-being in the absence of stress (Komproe, Rijken, Ros, Winnubst, & Hart, 1997). Social support may enhance the well-being especially when individuals perceive much discrimination. Experiences of discrimination in an acculturation 92 context are exacerbated when support networks are limited or lacking (Finch & Vega, 2003; Jasinskaja-Lahti & Liebkind, 2001; Noh & Kaspar, 2003). Relationships with hosts showed positive relations with mainstream integration, mainstream tolerance, and perceived minority vitality, and school and work success (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). Little is known about the role of ethnic vitality and social support in the acculturation process in the South African workplace. Intervening factors The study of mediating variables has gained prominence in the last decades in psychological theory and research. A mediating variable transmits the effect of an independent variable to a dependent variable (MacKinnon, Fairchild, & Fritz, 2007). One of the primary reasons for the popularity of mediating variables in psychology is the historical authority of the stimulus-organism-response model (Hebb, 1966). In this model, mediating mechanisms in the organism translate how a stimulus leads to a response. Various aspects were treated as mediators in acculturation studies, such as acculturation strategies (Jackson & Van de Vijver, submitted). Another reason for the popularity of mediation is the development of statistical theory and the availability of software to deal with mediation models. We were interested in the mediating effect of approach and avoidance coping in the relationship between positive or facilitating contextual factors and discrimination and subjective work success and ill-health symptoms. Coping has been studied as a variable that mediates the relation between context variables and acculturation outcomes. Coping Understanding how individuals cope with interpersonal problems is of great importance, given that all relationships, at some point in time, involve problems or tensions that can be stressful to an individual (Carpenter & Scott, 1992). Negative social interactions and interpersonal stressors (social strain) were negatively associated with health, life satisfaction, and positive mood, whereas it was positively associated with health problems and negative mood (Walen & Lachman, 2000). Coping refers to \"cognitive and behavioral efforts to master, reduce, or tolerate the internal and/or external demands that are created by the stressful transaction\" (Folkman, 1984: 843). Before actually coping with a situation, it has to be cognitively evaluated as potentially stressful. This appraisal goes through two cognitive mechanisms which are primary and secondary appraisals. Primary appraisal is an assessment of what is at stake. What is at stake categorize the situation as being a threat, a challenge or a loss (Berjot & Gillet, 2011). Although negatively correlated (Berjot & Girault-Lidvan, 2009), threat and challenge appraisals can occur simultaneously. Secondary appraisal is an assessment of coping resources and indicates confidence in one's ability to cope with the situation. Resources can be physical including health and energy, social including social support one can get from family, friends and social network, psychological including beliefs, self-esteem, perceived control, and morale, or material including financial and tools (Berjot & Gillet, 2011). Three main coping strategies are used to deal with stress namely, emotion-focused, problem-focused (Compas, Connor-Smith, Saltzman, Thomsen & Wadsworth, 2001), and strategies (Endler & Parker, 1990). The use of transactional models of stress represents real progress in that it permits to better explain the variety of responses when encountering discrimination and prejudice, as well as 93 the effect of discrimination and prejudice on self-esteem and other adjustment related variables (Major, McCoy, Kaiser & Quinton, 2003). It also highlights the fact that people are not passive when confronted with discrimination and that individual and situational factors interact to create a specific appraisal of the situation and stimulate specific coping strategies. However, studies that tried to test or directly apply transactional models of stress often failed to show adequate results (Berjot & Gillet, 2011). Barnes and Lightsey Jr. (2005) asked college students to answer a measure of perceived racism, coping, and perceived stress and found that perceiving discrimination is stressful. However, the perception of discrimination did not predict coping, and coping did not moderate the effects of discrimination on stress. Other authors have tried to test the transactional model of stress for the study of stereotype threat. The results of Berjot, Girault-Lidvan, Scharnitsky and Gillet (2010) revealed that stereotype threat enhanced the use of emotion-focused strategies and decreased the use of problem-focused strategies. Still, the transactional model of stress failed to explain the whole process by which performance decreases for threatened individuals (Berjot & Gillet, 2011). It can be concluded to bed with you in the context of acculturation, the role of coping as mediating between antecedent variables and outcomes has a better theoretical than empirical underpinning. Acculturation outcomes Berry (1992) proposed a definition of adjustment as a state whereby change occurs in the individual in a direction of increased fit and reduced conflict between the environmental demands and the individual attitudinal and behavioural inclinations. Successful adjustment, therefore, can be characterised as a state of equilibrium whereby an individual maintains a balanced psychological state which results in effective functioning (Torbiorn, 1982). Two facets of adjustment are relevant for our study: psychological adjustment (physical and psychological ill-health symptoms) and sociocultural adjustment (subjective experiences of work success). Psychological and sociocultural adaptation is positively related (Berry, 2003; Ward & Kenndy, 1999), and the strength of the association is related to the cultural distance and the degree of integration of cross-cultural travellers in the social milieu. a larger cultural distance will be accompanied by a weaker association between psychological and sociocultural adaptation (Ward & Rana-Deuba, 1999). Berry, Phinney, Sam, and Vedder (2006) found that being involved in both cultures (labelled integration) was associated with more psychological and sociocultural adjustment while being involved in neither culture or being confused about one's situation (diffuse) undermines both forms of adaptation. Belonging to the ethnic profile was associated with poorer sociocultural adaptation while belonging to the national profile was associated with somewhat poorer psychological and sociocultural adaptation. The dual process model of diversity outcomes We argue that there are two, fairly independent processes that influence diversity outcomes, including well-being at work, namely a negative effort-driven process also referred to as the health erosion pathway (Idris, Dollard, & Winefield, 2011). In this pathway, discrimination or other integration-thwarting conditions lead to poor psychological adjustment (physical and psychological ill-health symptoms). In addition, there is a positive motivation-driven process where the presence of, and experience of positive conditions or acculturation resources lead to better sociocultural adjustments (increase experiences of subjective work success). 94 In their dual process model for acculturation outcomes, Jackson and Van de Vijver (submitted) propose that in the negative stream, acculturation demands or inhibiting intergroup features such as discrimination are related to a (passive) avoidance coping style which mediates the relation between discrimination and ill-health. Similarly, in the positive stream, acculturation resources or facilitating intergroup features such as a multicultural climate, tolerance of mainstreamers, ethnic vitality and social support are related to an (active) approach coping style which mediates the relation between positive acculturation conditions and subjective experiences of work success. In the Dual Process Model, the positive and negative stream operates in a relatively independent manner. The negative stream is particularly salient as creating conditions for ill-health, where the positive stream is salient for creating conditions for positive work outcomes. The negative stream deals with the prerequisites of positive outcomes. This argument draws on positive psychology where health is seen as not just the absence of disease but also the presence of positive aspects such as well-being. Analogously, in our model, an organisation can only be successful in dealing with diversity if scores on instruments in the negative stream are low and scores in the positive stream are high. The absence of negative factors, such as discrimination, is a prerequisite for positive work outcomes. Such outcomes also require the presence of factors that are conducive for diversity, such as respect for all ethnicities in an organisation. The underlying idea is that positive and negative streams constitute the major lines of causation and that relations within a stream are much stronger than relations across streams. \"Crossover relations\" in the model (i.e., associations between the positive and negative stream) are much weaker than the relations within each of the streams and there are no direct crossover relations between positive antecedents and negative mediators and between negative antecedents and positive mediators. Similarly, there should be no direct relation from a negative antecedent or mediator to a positive outcome. Crossover relations can only occur within a single layer; for example, positive and negative antecedents may be correlated. Based on the above-mentioned, the following hypotheses are tested in the current study: 1. Perceived positive and facilitating acculturation conditions and approach coping are positively related to subjective experiences of work success and constitute a positive or motivational stream; 2. Discrimination, avoidance coping and ill-health symptoms are positively related and constitute a negative or restraining stream or health erosion pathway; 3. Approach coping mediates the relation between positive acculturation conditions and subjective experience of work success; and 4. Avoidance coping mediates the relation between discrimination and ill-health symptoms. Contextualizing the study We test the Dual Process Model of Diversity Outcomes in SAPS. We assume that SAPS, being a multicultural public organisation in a multicultural country, provides a good context for testing diversity and its outcomes. South Africa has a long history of discrimination but when the Nationalist Party came to power in 1948, the government set about drawing up diabolic laws that would further entrench and extend racial discrimination and segregation (e.g., The Population Registration Act (1950), the Prohibition of Mixed Marriage Act (1949), the Immorality Amendment Act (1950), the Group Areas Act (1950), the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act 95 (1953), the Bantu Education Act (1953), and the Extension of University Education Act (1959), the \"Pass Laws\" legislation of 1952). Post-1994 the adoption of the New Constitution (RSA, 1996) nullified all these discriminating laws and introduced a number of laws designed to redress past injustices and discriminatory practices. Examples of such post-apartheid laws are the Labour Relations Act (RSA, 1995), the Employment Equity Act (RSA, 1998) and the widespread use of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment and Affirmative Action in especially the public sector. One would, therefore, expect the current workplace to be less discriminatory and characterised by a multicultural climate in especially institutions of the state. However, recent events seem to suggest otherwise. The upsurge of Labour Court cases involving discrimination against Whites (country-wide), Coloureds (in Cape Town) and Indians (Kwazulu Natal) with promotions in state departments as a result of affirmative action could be explained by the experiences of relative deprivation by these ethnic groups. Relative deprivation is a perception that others are getting more than their fair share of the economic pie (Dambrun, Taylor, McDonald, Crush & M\u00e9ot, 2006). So, it appears that even if discrimination has become much less rampant, it is still a problem in modern South Africa and now involves more ethnic groups than before. Research Method Research approach A cross-sectional design, utilizing surveys, was used to achieve the research objectives. The study was initiated after discussions with the Strategic Management Services of the SAPS in Pretoria. Participants and sampling The participants used in the research were conveniently sampled from all volunteers and full-time members of the South African Police Service, based in the Pretoria Area. 158 fully completed questionnaires were received from the 200 that were distributed resulting in a 79% response rate. The characteristics of the sample are displayed in Table 1. 96 Table 1: Sample Characteristics Characteristics Category Percentage Gender Male Female 57.5 42.5 Age 18-25 26-35 36-45 46-55 56-60 9.2 4.6 5.3 1.3 2.6 15.1 4.6 6.6 9.9 Qualifications Matric Certificate Diploma Degree Post Degree 24.1 9.5 22.6 25.5 18.2 Unit Operational Support 49.3 50.7 Rank Admin Clerks Constable Sergeant Inspector Captain Superintendent Senior Superintendent Director 16.4 11.8 6.6 21.7 26.3 12.5 3.3 1.3 Years of experience 0-5 yrs 6-10 yrs 11-20 yrs More than 20 yrs 37.4 8.4 41.3 11.9 Note. Not all categories add up to 100% due to missing data. According to Table 1, the majority of participants were males (57.5%) from support services (50.7%) and had an education level equivalent to a degree (25.5%). Most of the participants were between the age of 36-45 (93.1%) and had between 11-20 (87.7%) years of experience. The largest language group was Afrikaans (23.0%) and the modal rank was captain (26.0%) and. Measuring Instruments Some instruments with well-established psychometric properties used in other cultural contexts were adapted (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). Adaptations involved replacing 97 Dutch and Moroccan with South African and own ethnic group respectively. All acculturation scales follow a five-point Likert format ranging from strongly agree (5) to strongly disagree (1) and some item scores were reversed before the analyses so that higher scores reflect more endorsement of the underlying attitude. Mainstream domain instruments. Multicultural norms (developed for the study by the researchers involved). This is a thirteen-item measure of the participants' multiculturalism attitudes and the prevalence of multiculturalism values within the organisation. The scale contains items like \"I think that most of my co-workers do not recognize that we are a workforce that consists of groups from different cultural groups\" (reverse scored). Tolerance by the mainstream (an adaptation of Ait Ouarasse and Van de Vijver, 2004). This is an eight-item measure of the extent to which participants think that mainstream members take an open stance toward the ethnic minority in the South African workplace. Tolerance is the desire on the part of the mainstream to see the minority members actively involved in public life without necessarily dropping their original culture. The scale contains items like \"I think that most of my co-workers from other cultures are most welcoming people\". Multicultural practices. This new instrument is a thirteen-item measure of the participants' actual multiculturalism behaviour and support for multiculturalism practices within the organisation. The scale contains items like \"My co-workers generally show respect to other cultures in our organisation\". Perceived discrimination (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). The scale is an 11-item measure of the extent to which participants think pressure exerted on the minorities to apply fully to the regulations and the general atmosphere regardless of whether these regulations encroach on minority sensitivities. The scale contains items like \"I experience discrimination in the dormitory\". Perceived Ethnic Vitality (an adaptation of Ait Ouarasse, 2004). This is a six-item measure of the extent to which participants think their own ethnic group has succeeded in creating an infrastructure for the provision of services of a secular and recreational nature. The scale contains items like \"Social functions at work make provision for my cultural customs and habits (e.g. music, food, etc.)\". Co-ethnic social support at work (an adaptation of Ait Ouarasse and Van de Vijver, 2004). This is a six-item measure of the amount of perceived support, assistance and protection available from c-ethnic members in the workplace. The scale contains items like \"I can count on the help of my cultural group members in our organisation\". Individual intervening instrument Coping skills were measured with the 33-item Coping Strategy Indicator (Amirkhan, 1990). The scale measured three types of coping strategies: problem-solving, seeking social support and avoidance. Participants were asked to imagine themselves in a period when they experienced a serious problem and to indicate how they dealt with it (indicating agreement or disagreement with possible reactions). Psychological and sociocultural acculturation outcomes. 98 Ill-Health: This is an adapted version of the 18 physical health symptoms of the PSI of Spector and Jex (1998), complemented with a list of 9 common psychological complaints based on a slightly modified version of the World Health Organization Cross-National Survey of Psychological and Somatic Symptoms (1988). The scale employs a frequency format that ranges from never (1) to every day (5). The self-report measure asks respondents to indicate whether or not in the past three months they had suffered any of the mentioned symptoms. Some examples of symptoms included in the scale are headaches, backache, fatigue, eyestrain and trouble sleeping, concentrating and constant anxiety or panic attacks. Work success (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). This is a fourteen-item measure of participants' self-reported success at work. All of the items are positively phrased. It contains items pertaining to task completion, punctuality, status, and recognition at work, relationships with supervisors, and relationships with fellow workers. The scale contains items like \"I do my work exactly as instructed by my supervisor\" and \"I have a good reputation among my co-workers\". A biographical questionnaire is included in order to be able to describe the population. It includes basic biographical questions like age, sex, first language, and experience. Research procedure The Strategic Management Services of the SAPS in Pretoria gave permission to carry out the project. English questionnaires with the letter of permission from the Strategic Management Services of the SAPS and a letter emphasizing the voluntary and anonyms nature of the study were distributed to police units or departments in Gauteng at various SAPS offices in the Pretoria area. Statistical analysis The data were captured in an Excel spreadsheet, checked for mistakes, and statistically analysed with the SPSS-program (SPSS Inc., 2010). The participants used in the research were all volunteers and full-time members of the SAPS, based in the Pretoria Area. Table 1 presents some of the characteristics of the participants (N = 158). Results The Results section has two parts. The first section presents descriptive statistics of the measures and their relationships, while the second part addresses the proposed model and mediating effects of the intervening variables. Factor analysis, descriptive statistics, and relations between measures Exploratory factorial analyses were conducted on the scales to examine their dimensionality. Items with factor loadings higher than 0.30 were considered as sufficient descriptors of the latent variable. Scree plots suggested that unifactorial solutions were obtained for acculturation context and outcomes scales: Multicultural Norms (41.8% explained by first factor), Multicultural Practises (42.7%), Tolerance (47.7%), Ethnic Vitality at Work (35.6%), Ethnic social support at Work (44.7%), Discrimination at work (43.5%), Work Success Scale (38.6%), Ill-Health (86.83%). In line with the literature, we found three salient factors for the Coping Strategy Indicator of Amirkhan (1990), which were labelled Approach Coping, 99 Avoidance Coping, and Seeking Social Support. The three factors explained 44.9% of the variance. We also merged the means scale scores of multicultural norms, multicultural practices, tolerance, ethnic vitality, and ethnic social support into a single observed factor in an exploratory factor analysis and extracted a single factor, which we labelled positive acculturation conditions (that explained 39.1% of the variance of the factor). Descriptive statistics and internal consistency of the measuring instruments used in this study are reported in Table 2. Inspection of Table 2 shows that acceptable Cronbach alpha coefficients (> 0.70) were obtained for all the scales used, except for the positive conditions scale. Cronbach's alpha values below 0.70, according to Kline as quoted by Field (2009) can, realistically, be expected, when working with psychological constructs, because of the diversity of the constructs comprising positive conditions. Moreover, as we did not want to overload the path model with observed variables we decided to use the positive conditions as a single variable. The correlations coefficients between the different measures used in this study are also presented in Table 2. All correlations showed the expected signs. Positive conditions were positively significantly related to one another and with work success while they were also very weakly negatively associated with ill-health, while discrimination was negatively related to positive conditions and work success and positively significantly associated with ill-health symptoms.

We postulated a model in which a split was made in positive and negative antecedent conditions, two coping strategies (active coping as positive coping strategy and avoidance coping as a negative coping strategy), and two types of outcomes (perceived work success as a positive outcome and ill-health as negative outcome). More specifically, five positive acculturation antecedent conditions (the combination of the average scale scores of multicultural norms, mainstream tolerance, multicultural practices, ethnic vitality, social support) impact on subjective work success (sociocultural adjustment), both directly and indirectly through active coping. Similarly, discrimination impacts on ill-health (psychological adjustment), both directly and indirectly through avoidance coping. The antecedent conditions were allowed to covary; no direct relations were allowed between the coping strategies. Finally, we predicted that ill-health would predict work success (in line with a previous study among miners in South Africa; Jackson & van de Vijver, submitted). The argument behind the latter association is that the absence of ill-health is a prerequisite for work success. We tested the model by fitting the empirical data to the hypothetical model by using various indices to assess the goodness of fit of the model. The results of the structural equation model are presented in Figure 1 below. We obtained a very good fit for our proposed hypothetical model (see Figure 1): 2(7, N = 158) = 11.60, p = 0.12; 2/df = 1.66 (recommended 3.00), adjusted goodness of fit index (AGFI) = 0.93 (recommended 0.90), the Tucker Lewis index (TLI) = 0.90 (recommended 0.90), the comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.96 (recommended 0.90), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) was 0.07 (recommended .05). Positive mainstream and ethnic acculturation conditions are associated with approach coping as the intervening variable, which in turn is related to subjective experiences of work success. Positive conditions (i.e., more positive mainstream multicultural norms, mainstream tolerance and multicultural practices, ethnic vitality and social support) are associated with an approach coping style at work and higher subjective experiences of work success. More discrimination was associated with an avoidance coping style and more physical and psychological ill-health symptoms. Finally, the model shows that ill-health was negatively associated with subjective work success. Figure 1. The results of the structural equation model analysis of the Dual Process Model *p < .05 / ** p < .10 Discrimination Positive conditions Av o i d a n c e of 7Probability level = 0.12N= 158 102 The standardised coefficients of Figure 1 also indicate that the path from discrimination via avoidance coping to ill-health had a fair standardized regression weight (0.39), as did the path from positive conditions via approach coping to subjective work success (0.37); the proportion of variance explained in subjective work success (0.21) was comparable to that of ill-health (0.18). The direct path from discrimination to ill-health was statistically nonsignificant, while the path from ill-health to work success was negative and bordered on significance (p < 0.06). Mediating effects of approach coping The hypothesized model is a mediation model in which positive antecedent conditions and discrimination influence approach and avoidance coping styles, which in turn impact on work success and ill-health symptoms, respectively. We made a closer examination of the direct and indirect effects to evaluate their relative sizes. There is quite some literature on the testing of mediation effects (Baron & Kenny, 1986; Holmbeck, 1997; Hoyle & Kenny, 1999; Judd & Kenny, 1981; Kline, 1998; Preacher & Hayes, 2004). It has been found that the method proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986) can have low statistical power and that joint significance tests involving the product of coefficients showed greater statistical power than other procedures, including the Baron and Kenny approach (MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, & Sheets, 2002). Therefore, we kept within the structural equation framework to compute the significance of mediation effects by using the bootstrap procedure as implemented in the AMOS program. The results of the mediation analysis can be found in Table 3. Table 3: Mediation Effects of Integration Demands in the Workplace (Standardized Effects) Work success Ill-health symptoms Predictor Direct Indirect Total Direct Indirect Total Positive conditions 0.16* .05. An inspection of Table 3 indicated that in line with observations from Figure 1, positive conditions had total, direct, and indirect effects on subjective experience on work success but not on ill-health symptoms. In addition, the significance of both the direct and indirect effects indicates that the link with subjective work success is partially mediated by approach coping. Positive antecedent conditions have, therefore, a salient influence on subjective experience of work success. Direct and indirect effects were all positive and reinforced each other, as expected in the Dual Process Model. It can be concluded that approach coping partially mediates the path from positive acculturation conditions to sociocultural adjustment and that multiculturalism, ethnic vitality, and social support are important for the experience of subjective work success but not for ill-health symptoms in the SAPS employees of this sample. Discrimination had only significant total and indirect effects on ill-health symptoms. It can therefore also be concluded that avoidance coping fully mediates the relation between discrimination and ill-health symptoms 103 and that discrimination and avoidance coping matter for ill-health symptoms for members in the SAPS of this sample. Discussion The first objective of this study was to test a mediation dual process model for diversity (Jackson & Van de Vijver, submitted) among members of the South African Police Service in Gauteng. We hypothesized that perceived positive or facilitating acculturation conditions, and approach coping are all strongly positively related to subjective experiences of work success and that discrimination and avoidance coping is related to ill-health symptoms but negatively to subjective experiences of work success. Antecedents in the model, called acculturation conditions, refer to contextual conditions with a bearing on the acculturation process, such as multiculturalism, tolerance, ethnic vitality and social support. Mediating variables, active and avoidance coping strategies, refer to the way individuals prefer to handle conflict and stressful situations. We assume that support for and the experience of acculturation-facilitating conditions (Jackson & Van de Vijver, submitted), when coupled with an approach coping orientation, will positively influence outcomes of the acculturation process such as perceived subjective experience of work success. On the other hand, discrimination, when coupled with an avoidance coping style, positively impacts on ill-health symptoms. Analysis of the correlation matrix, regression weights obtained from our model testing as well as the very good fit obtained revealed relations and associations between variables in the expected directions. We can conclude that more mainstream multiculturalism, mainstream tolerance, ethnic vitality and social support coupled with an approach coping orientation were associated with more subjective experience of work success, whereas more discrimination and an avoidance coping style were associated with more ill-health symptoms. We, therefore, found support for our Dual Process Model. Furthermore, we found that direct and indirect effects all go in the same direction and tend to reinforce each other. These findings, therefore, provided support for the acceptance of Hypotheses 1 and 2. These results confirm previous empirical findings (Jackson, Ali & Burkard, 2006; Jackson & Van de Vijver, submitted) that also supported the Dual Process Model of Diversity. In the previous study, involving miners in the North-West province, we also found positive correlations between markers of a multiculturalism climate, such as relationships with host members, tolerance of mainstreamers, multicultural practices, ethnic vitality at work, ethnic social support and relationship with co-ethnics. The positive link of these diverse city-enhancing conditions with work outcomes is in line with the cross-cultural literature which shows that good sociocultural adaptation is predicted by cultural knowledge, degree of contact, and positive intergroup attitudes (Berry et al., 2002). The findings of the present study concur with the findings obtained in the dual process model for diversity (Jackson & Van de Vijver, submitted) that argue that the \"crossover relations\" in the model between the positive and negative stream are much weaker than the relations within each of the streams. The second objective of the study was to determine the mediating effects of approach and avoidance coping styles in the relation between positive or facilitating acculturation conditions, discrimination and subjective experience of work success and ill-health respectively. Our findings indicated that positive conditions had total, direct and indirect effects on subjective experience on work success but not on ill-health symptoms. Positive antecedent conditions have therefore a 104 significant direct and indirect influence on subjective experience of work success. It can be concluded that approach coping partially mediates the path from positive acculturation conditions to sociocultural adjustment and that multiculturalism, ethnic vitality and social support are important for the experience of subjective work success while avoidance coping only fully mediates the relation between discrimination and ill-health symptoms in the SAPS sample. These results provided support for the acceptance of Hypothesis 3 and 4 and confirm that an approach coping style or problem-focused strategies are active problem-solving methods used to resolve the stressful relationship between the self and the environment (Compas, Connor-Smith, Saltzman, Thomsen & Wadsworth, 2001). Our findings also concur with the results obtained by Ward and Kennedy (2001) that the most powerful predictor of poor psychological adjustment was an avoidant coping style. It has been argued that avoidant responses may have some utility during primary appraisal by temporarily distancing the individual from an overwhelming stressor (Carver et al., 1989); however, distancing behaviour cannot be sustained for long periods where forced contact takes place such as in the workplace. This finding is also supported by Chataway and Berry's (1989) findings, who found that detachment is associated with increased psychological distress. Implications The implications of our results are that mainstream and ethnic positive or facilitating conditions and discrimination are important for and influence individual coping styles which in turn impact on ill-health as well as the experiences of work success. In addition, ill-health also impacts negatively on work success experiences among the sampled SAPS members. It therefore would make sense for higher ranking officers in the SAPS to sanction discrimination and monitor positive conditions and also reward behaviour associated with positive conditions to encourage SAPS members to treat colleagues from different ethnic background in a fashion that enhances the experiences of positive or facilitating conditions such as multiculturalism and tolerance as well as to provide social support to own ethnic members. Taking measures to curb discrimination is expected to increase the wellness at work of employees while stimulating diversity conditions can be expected to lead to more positive work-related outcomes. Both positive and negative diversity conditions can be influenced by institutional policies. Thus, diversity training could be considered that focus on basic awareness of differences, skills for dealing with differences and cultural competence. Most organisations focus on awareness for the initial training session. This helps participants understand their own biases and values and get a better understanding of other people's perspective, helping to build empathy and increase intercultural communication in a diverse group of employees. Skills building should start with managers and senior staff but should ultimately be extended to employees as well. The training should be focused on developing an organisation that is inclusive with regard to ethnicity and where adverse practices like discrimination are clearly sanctioned. This approach is most effective following an initial awareness training programme (Kay & Stringer, 2003). It is advised that this training should be experiential in nature, meaning that real organisational incidents should be simulated or relevant cases studies and videos should be utilized as teaching aids to increase the effectiveness of the training (Tan, Morris & Romero, 2003). In addition, the policies related to diversity issues should be transparent and accessible for all and the content thereof should be discussed, reviewed and 105 updated so that workshop contents reflect current realities and employees are aware of the institutional agenda vis-\u00e0-vis diversity. Intergroup contact in SAPS creates opportunities for people of different backgrounds to understand and appreciate members of other groups (Leong & Ward, 2011), has the potential to reduce intergroup prejudices, disconfirms negative stereotypes, enhances knowledge of the out-group, and reduces interpersonal anxiety (Pettigrew & Machleit, 1989). It is regrettable that the South African society is so strongly segregated, which implies that interethnic contact is relatively sparse outside of the work context, even though such contact would foster intergroup relations interpersonal and work sphere. Experiences in various countries with positive discrimination are not always encouraging. It is relatively common to find resistance against positive discrimination by groups that are no longer favoured. This also constitutes a potential risk for South Africa, as there are indications that feelings of discrimination can now be observed in all ethnic groups. Limitations of the present study include the sampling procedure (our sample was limited to police officers in Gauteng), as this may influence the possibility of generalisation of the findings to the total study population. Suggestions for future research. Future studies could benefit from using a stratified random-sample design, which would ensure sufficient representation of the different groups in the total population. Future studies should also focus on longitudinal designs where interferences in terms of cause and effect could be made. References Abbas, Q., Hameed, A. & Waheed, A. (2011).

The study participants were a convenience sample of 296 public service employees (Blacks = 73.3%, females = 59%, 90.7% between the age 18 and 40 years; Whites = 25.7%, females = 58%, 67.1% between the age of 18 and 40 years). They completed measures of acculturation antecedents (positive and negative conditions), mediators (integration as a positive strategy to deal with diversity and separation as a negative strategy), and outcomes (work success and ill-health). Using multigroup path analysis, we found race-based invariance of the Dual Process Model, with Black employees self-reporting diversity relations more favourably way compared to White employees. We conclude that the Dual Process Model is supported and for research use in the South African workplaces. Keywords: Diversity; integration; separation; dual-process model 113 Introduction Workplaces are increasingly becoming diverse in terms of race, age, gender, sexual orientation, religion following and other personal characteristics. This diversity representation has consequences for organization productivity, performance (Joubert, 2012; Kirton & Greene, 2016), and occupational health and safety (Fisher, 2010). For instance, Joubert (2017) tried to qualitatively identify the advantages of diversity at work. Her respondents mentioned that the benefits at employee level can include more learning among employees from each other, improved communication, friendships, increased trust and respect amongst colleagues, increased teamwork and a decrease in stereotypes and discrimination among employees. From an organizational perspective, the benefits of diversity management can include increased productivity, better attainment of organizational goals, increased employee creativity, client-focused service, and an interesting work environment. Evidence-based models would assist in the design and implementation of diversity-oriented initiatives in workplaces addressing race/ethnicity, gender, age, and other socio-demographics that impact the quality of work life. Literature review Benefits of Workplace Diversity to the Organization Workplace diversity is associated with higher organizational benefits (Joubert, 2017) and performance (Choi & Rainey, 2010). For instance, cultural diversity is associated with organizational advantages, such as strengthening the organization's culture, improving the company's global reputation, increasing creativity and innovation or building loyalty among customers of different origins (Cox & Blake, 1991; Franken, 2015; Shen, Chanda, D'Netto & Monga, 2015;Thomas & Ely, 1996). It also is associated with increases in productivity, goal attainment, creativity, client-focused services, and an interesting work environment (Joubert, 2017) as well as work team cohesion (Cashmore, 2003; Trivedi, 2008). Also, when diversity is managed effectively, employees learn more about each other so that communication is improved, with less stereotyping and discrimination among the employees (Joubert, 2017). Nonetheless, people might experience the workplace differently by this diversity by race/ethnicity, gender, age, and other demographic variables. For instance, Sue and Capodilupo (2008) reported that women experience a variety of gender micro-aggressions and discrimination that undervalue their work contributions. Women of racial minority background were at elevated risk for micro-aggressions and discrimination including being considered a second class citizen and being sexually objectified. Hewat and Arndt (2009) investigated body image attitudes in a non-clinical sample of Black and White older professional women in the workplace in South Africa. They found that Black women appeared to experience increasing levels of body concern the more obese they become; however, white professional women's body concerns seemed to decrease once they move from the overweight category on the BMI to obese or extremely obese. The legacy of gender and racial discrimination persists in South Africa; women of all races are overrepresented in pink-collar jobs (Jaga, Arabandi, Bagraim, & Mdlongwa, 2017). For example, in community and service occupations, women occupy 60.4% of the positions and 94.6% in domestic work. In contrast, men dominate occupations such as manufacturing (62%), construction (82%), and finance (57%). Two-thirds of managers are men; and women earn less than men in all labour market positions (Statistics South Africa, 2016). Racial micro-aggressions, characterized by discrimination, racism, and separatism, are associated with negative 114 psychological outcomes such as greater depression, anxiety, anger, stress, somatic symptoms, and negative affect (Hyunh, 2012; Nadal, Wong, Sriken, Griffin, & Fujii-Doe, 2015; Ong, Burrow, Fuller-Rowell, Ja, & Sue, 2013). Older workers were likely to be channelled to lower-paid jobs than young workers, potentially affecting their standard of living (Drydakis, MacDonald, Chiotis & Somers, 2018). About 16% lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals (LGBT) individuals reported experiencing employment discrimination, with 41% being harassed at work (Badgett, Lau, Sears, & Ho, 2007). Badgett et al. (2007) also reported that gay men earned 10-32% less than equally qualified heterosexual men. Self-identified transgender respondents in a US national survey revealed that 44% were denied a job due to their transgender or gender nonconforming status; of those who were employed, 50% experienced harassment at work; 26% lost their job; and 23% were denied a promotion (Grant, Mottet, Tanis, Harrison, Herman, & Keisling, 2011). In countries with a history of race-based segregation such as South Africa, racial group membership is salient to perceptions of workplace diversity. We sought to test an explanatory model for understanding race-based workplace diversity in the South African public sector. The South African Public Services' Work Relations More than two decades after the abolishment of apartheid, racial identity remains salient to the South African work setting (Department of Labour, 2016; SA Human Rights Commission, 2017; Stevens, Plaut, & Sanchez-Burks, 2008). Both Black and White employees appear to experience major difficulties in celebrating diversity among employees, as has been documented over two decades past the end of apartheid (Carrim, 2016; Gordon, 2007; Jackson, Van de Vijver, & Burckard, 2011; Seekings, 2008). For instance, Carrim (2016) explored the perceptions of South African Black employees of gossip by White peers directed at them or other Black colleagues. Carrim (2016) reported that negative gossip targeted Black employees by White peers and that these gossips undermined the morale and performance of the Black employees. Joubert (2017) found in her qualitative study that if diversity is not properly managed, it could harm both the employees and the organization through the negative consequences of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination, misunderstandings, disrespect of others, and language or communication gaps. Moreover, both Carrim (2016) and Joubert (2017) were of the view that poorly managed diversity in their organization could lead to relationship problems among employees that impacted worker morale and workplace climate. Along the same line, Jackson et al. (2011) reported that subtle racism can contribute to ill-health and lack of well-being at work and therefore warrants the attention of supervisors in the workplace. In summary, segregation demands, discrimination, and subtle racism contribute to workplace ill-health. By contrast, an organizational climate that is supportive of diversity and individual integration orientation promotes subjective experiences of work success. Organizations with weak pro-diversity practices likely pose higher occupational health risks for their employees than those with stronger pro-diversity policies. Prospective Dual Process Model of Diversity in the Work Place The Dual Process Model of Diversity (Jackson & Van de Vijver, submitted; Jackson, Van de Vijver, & Molokoane, 2013), proposes positive and negative workplace diversity outcomes (subjective experiences of work success and ill-health, respectively), facilitating conditions for 115 diversity in organizations (such as diversity-enhancing practices), and diversity-constraining conditions (such as discrimination, racism, and segregation) to influence occupational adjustment. An ideal workplace would combine the presence of facilitating conditions and the absence of inhibiting conditions. We sought to replicate the results of previous studies (Jackson & Van de Vijver, submitted; Jackson, Van de Vijver, & Molokoane, 2013) that tested a structural model of diversity, linking diversity antecedents or conditions, mediators, and outcomes and test it in a state department in South Africa. Goals of the Study. We sought to test our Dual Process Model of Workplace Diversity to address the question of whether an employee's racial separation orientation mediates the relation between diversity attitudes and workplace psychological adjustment. Our specific research questions were as follows: How do Black and White public sector employees in South Africa experience positive and negative diversity antecedent conditions, mediators, and outcomes? What are the relationships (strength and direction) between positive and negative diversity antecedent conditions (resources and demands), mediators, and outcomes for Black and White public sector employees? Does integration serve as a mediator in the relationship between positive diversity resources and subjective experiences of success? Does separation serve as a mediator in the relationship between negative diversity demands and ill-health? Does the dual-process model of diversity hold for both Blacks and Whites amongst public sector employees? Research Method Participants and Setting The study participants were a convenience sample of 296 public service employees (Blacks = 73.3%, females = 59%, 90.7% between the age 18 and 40 years; Whites = 25.7%, females = 58%, 67.1% between the age of 18 and 40 years). Table 1 presents some of the characteristics of the participants. The majority of the participants were single (55.1%) and with less than one year of experience (56.4%). 116 Table 1: Characteristics of Participants (N = 296) Item Category Frequency Percentage Gender Males 119 40.2 Females 174 58.8 Age 18-25 years 64 2.6 25-30 years 94 31.8 30-35 years 57 19.3 35-40 years 40-45 years 45-50 years 50-55 years 55- years 31 17 16 8 4 10.5 5.7 5.4 2.7 1.4 Marital status Single 163 55.1 Engaged 21 7.1 Married 80 27.0 Divorced 19 6.4 Separated 5 1.7 Remarried 2 0.7 Race Black Africans 39 13.2 White Africans 37 12.5 Tenure in the state department Less than a year 167 56.4 1-2 years 8 2.7 2-5 years 25 8.4 5-8 years 22 7.4 8-12 years 10 3.4 More than 12 years 52 17.6 Measures The employees completed the six diversity orientation antecedents, two mediators, and two outcomes measures. In addition, they also completed measures of psychological adjustment (well-being). All scales employed a five-point Likert format ranging from strongly agree (1) to strongly disagree (5). Negatively phrased item scores were reversed before the analyses so that higher scores reflect more endorsement of the underlying construct. Antecedent measures Positive diversity conditions. The employees responded to the following instruments: Tolerance by the Mainstream. This is an eight-item measure of the extent to which participants think that mainstream members take an open stance toward ethnic minorities in the South African workplace (adaptation of Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). The scale contains items like \"I think that most of my co-workers from other cultures are most welcoming people\". We observed an = .87 for scores from the Tolerance by the Mainstream measure in the present sample. Diversity / Multicultural Norms (Jackson, Van de Vijver, & Ali 2012). This is a thirteen-item measure of the participants' diversity attitudes and the prevalence of diversity-enhancing values within the organization. The scale contains items like \"I think that most of my co-workers do not recognize that we are a workforce that consists of groups from different cultural groups\" 117 and \"I think that most of my co-workers do not recognize that we are a workforce that consists of groups from different cultural backgrounds\" (both reversed scored). In the present study, we observed an value of .66 for scores from the Diversity/Multicultural Norms scale. Diversity / Multicultural Practices (Jackson et al., 2012). This instrument is a thirteen-item measure of the participants' actual multiculturalism behaviour and the commonness of diversity practices within the organization. The scale contains items like \"My co-workers generally show respect for other cultures in our organisation\" and \"I think that most of my co-workers appreciate the fact that we are different\". In the current study, we observed an alpha value of .89 for scores from the Diversity/Multicultural Practices scale. Negative diversity conditions (antecedent measures). The following diversity conditions measuring instruments were completed by the employees: Mainstream Segregation Demands. This is a 12-item measure of the extent to which participants think that mainstream members hold segregationist attitudes towards minority members (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). An example item is \"I think that most of my fellow residents would be happy to have people from other cultures than their own to be thrown out of our organisation\". We observed an = .93 for scores from the Mainstream Segregation Demands measure in the present sample. Perceived Discrimination. The scale is an 11-item measure of the extent to which participants think the situation in their workplace is discriminatory and requires them to drop their cultural characteristics (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). The scale contains items like \"I experience discrimination in my workplace\". We observed an = .91 for scores from the Perceived Discrimination scale in the present sample. Subtle Racism. This is a 10-item (four of these items were filter items and were not used in the final analysis) measuring the extent to which co-workers hold subtle racist attitudes (Duckitt, 1991). Sample items from this measure include \"Some groups in South Africa are getting too demanding in pushing for equal rights\". The reliability of scores from the Subtle Racism scale achieved an = .89 in the present sample. Mediator measures. We utilized the following instruments to assess for integration orientation and separation orientation, Integration Orientation. This is a three-item measure of the extent to which participants prefer contact with their ethnic group members and mainstreamers and seek participation to the Rainbow culture1 (Jackson, Van de Vijver, & Ali, 2012). The scale contains items such as \"I want to maintain my own culture as well as seek contact and participate in the mainstream culture\" ( = .53). Separation Orientation. This is a three-item measure of preference to contact own ethnic group members and not seek participation in the Rainbow culture (Jackson et al., 2011). The scale contains items such as \"I actually avoid contact with members from other cultures\". The reliability of scores from the Separation Orientation scale was an = .69 in the present sample. Psychological and sociocultural adjustment (well-being) measures. The following measuring instruments were used as (un)wellness indicators Ill-Health. This is an adapted version of the 18 physical health symptoms of the PSI of Spector and Jex (1998) complemented with a list of 9 common psychological complaints based on a slightly modified version of the World Health Organization Cross-National Survey of 118 Psychological and Somatic Symptoms (1988). The scale employs a frequency format that ranges from never (1) to every day (5). The self-report measure asked respondents to indicate whether or not in the past three months they had suffered any of the mentioned symptoms. Some examples of symptoms included on the scale are headaches, backache, fatigue, eye strain and trouble sleeping, concentrating and constant anxiety or panic attacks. Scores from the Ill-Health yielded an = 0.92 and 0.87 for physical and psychological ill-health, respectively, in the present sample. Work Success. This is a fourteen-item measure of participants' success at work (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). All items are positively phrased. It contains items about task completion, punctuality, status, and recognition at work, relationships with supervisors, and relationships with fellow workers. The scale contains items like \"I am always on time for my work\" and \"I have a good reputation among my co-workers\". We observed an = .88 for scores from the Work Success in the present sample. Biographical details. Participants self-reported their demographics on a biographical questionnaire, including age, gender, marital status, home language and job tenure. Procedure The Economic and Management Faculty's Ethics Committee of North-West University approved of the study. Participants gave their consent. We explained to the participants regarding the anonymous and voluntary nature of the study and their right to withdraw from the study without penalty. Data Analysis We applied multigroup path analysis (using AMOS version 24) to test for mediating of diversity conditions and employee outcomes (well-being) by individual acculturation. The mediation model was based on the reasoning that more distal variables (antecedent) conditions influence more proximal variables (diversity orientation), which in turn influence outcomes (all within the same stream). Moreover, we computed a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to examine racial group differences in the diversity and workplace well-being outcomes. Cohen's d values were used to gauge the size of the ethnic differences. We conducted a closer examination of the direct and indirect effects to evaluate their relative sizes, using the bootstrap procedure as implemented in the AMOS program. Results Descriptive Statistics Table 2 and 5 present the descriptive statistics of the psychological scales. From these Tables, it is apparent that Black workers to score higher on the positive diversity resources, lower on the negative diversity demands and higher on subjective experiences of work success and lower on ill-health than their White counterparts 119 Table 2: Correlation Matrix for Germanic (Above Diagonal) and African (Below Diagonal) Variable Variance explained 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 1.

Dual Process Model Effects on Diversity Orientation and Workplace Health We used a multigroup model to test the model (see Figure 1). An inspection of the fit indices of Table 3 revealed that the structural weights model was the most restrictive model with a good fit: 2(19, N = 296) = 26.94, 1.42; .93, TLI = .96, CFI = .97, RMSEA = .04. 121 Figure 1: Dual Process Model for Diversity (DPMD) The proportion of variance accounted for in the models showed medium to large effect sizes; more specifically, diversity orientations and ill-health showed medium effect sizes (integration: R2 = .10; separation: R2 = .11; ill-health: R2 = .05), whereas work success showed a large effect size (R2 = .16). This means that positive mainstream diversity norms, mainstream tolerance, and diversity practices, coupled with an individual integration orientation, were positively associated with subjective experiences at work. By contrast, mainstream segregation demands, discrimination and subtle racism, which made up the negative antecedent conditions, coupled with an individual separation orientation, were positively associated with physical and psychological ill-health symptoms. Only the direct path coefficient within the encumbering stream was significant, implying the absence of any mediation. This means that diversity demands such as segregation, discrimination, and racism had a direct effect on ill-health. In addition, employee health was negatively affected if they experience these negative diversity demands even without having to endorse a separation strategy. In contrast, for the positive stream, the effects of the antecedent on the outcomes are both direct and indirect. This means that experiences of positive diversity resources were not only linked to higher levels of perceived work success, but also to the endorsement of an integration strategy; so, both factors, separately and jointly, are positively linked to perceived work success.

The multivariate effect of race was significant (Wilks' Lambda = .84, F(13, 278) = 3.99, p < .001) (Table 5). Univariate analyses showed significant racial differences in diversity demands [F(1, 290) = 4.51, p < .05], subtle racism at work [F(1, 290) = 16.17, p < .001], subjective experiences of work success [F(1, 290) = 12.82, p < .00], ill-health = 6.43, p < .05], and psychological ill-health [F(1, 290) = 8.26, p < .001]. Specifically, Black employees tended to show somewhat higher scores on the positive antecedents (diversity resources), lower on the negative antecedents (diversity demands), lower on ill-health, and higher on perceived work success. Discussion We found support for a model in which diversity comprises two components: a set of positive aspects, such as diversity-conducive work conditions, and negative aspects, such as discrimination. The positive and negative aspects are not strongly correlated. This is in line with the proposition that negative aspects of organizational climate define prerequisites (such as the absence of discrimination at the work floor), that are necessary, yet insufficient conditions for real diversity (see Thomas & Ely, 1996). By this proposition, genuine workplace diversity is characterized by absence of negative aspects like discrimination, complemented by the presence of conducive conditions, such as management-supported proactive approaches to achieve inclusiveness. In our view, the negative conditions are not a prerequisite; the positive and negative aspects can (and in practice often will) work independently from one another; what is essential for our approach is that both streams deal with other outcomes. Work success is mainly related to positive conditions whereas negative conditions are related to ill-health. So, if we want to capture diversity in organizations, we need to examine both conducive and inhibiting 123 conditions. We found Black workers to score somewhat higher on the positive antecedents (diversity resources), lower on the negative antecedents (diversity demands) and higher on outcomes (adjustment) (higher on subjective experiences of work success and lower on ill-health) than their White peers in this sample. Better diversity experiences of Blacks in this sample could possibly be explained by better representation of Blacks on all levels of the hierarchy in the public sector in South Africa post-apartheid (EEC, 2017). Moodley (2000) established that climate factors, such as understanding, tolerance, and acceptance, were perceived to be vital ingredients to helping diverse people feel accepted and wanted in the company. Empirically, support for multiculturalism was correlated with dominant group members' tolerance (Berry, 2006; Berry, Kalin, & Taylor, 1977), while support for multiculturalism strongly predicted social tolerance (Van der Noll, Poppe, & Verkuyten, 2010). We also observed that negative diversity attitudes were associated with more self-reported physical and psychological ill-health symptoms (see also Berry, Phinney, Sam, & Vedder, 2006; Clark, Anderson, Clark, Gee, Ro, Shariff-Marco, & Chae, 2009; Heim, Hunter, & Jones, 2010). The relatively lower scores on subtle racism and the higher scores on integration (compared to separation) given the South African discriminatory race relations history are encouraging as they serve as a proxy measure of progress with the nation's reconciliation mission. This finding is in line with, for instance, pro-integration attitudes among South Africans (Potgieter, 2017) and consistent with the aims of the Employment Equity Act (RSA, 1998) valuing of workplace racial diversity. Integration is linked to an inclusive identity, as it combines identities; in the acculturation literature, this combination often amounts to a combination of an ethnic and a mainstream identity. Some researchers (e.g., Ait Ouarasse, 2004; Berry, Kim, Minde, & Mok, 1987; Berry, Phinney, Sam, & Vedder 2006; Hui, Chen, Leung, & Berry, 2015) have suggested that the integration orientation resulted in the best adaptation because immigrants can manage to have a common identity with the receiving culture. Translated to the South African setting, this means employees with a strong inclusive identity would value their cultural and ethnic heritage or identity as well as that of others (see also Zagefka & Brown, 2002). Not only does this dual affiliation and identity possibility create a welcoming workplace environment, but also employees would experience cultural inclusiveness. Implications for Diversity Oriented Human Resources Practice Our findings suggest that employees view diversity initiatives seriously and expect the visibility of such efforts in organizations. By implication, employers should invest in initiatives for promoting diversity, especially race and ethnic diversity, for employees to feel that their organization is committed to diversity. Diversity investment will not only be useful for improving positive employee attitudes and behaviours towards the organization but also for employee performance. Organizations should convey the intent of diversity initiatives to embrace all employees, to demonstrate fairness and equity, and mitigate potential negative perceptions on the part of employees (Kundu & Mor, 2017). The results further suggest that organizations should continue making systematic and continuous efforts to communicate diversity goals to employees (Soni, 2000) to ensure the positive receptivity of employees to diversity and diversity management. Diversity efforts can only be sustained through the establishment of a dedicated diversity 124 management section either within the Human Resource department or as a stand-alone strategic section with a diversity director under the direct supervision of the CEO. Our Dual Process Model further suggests that the effects of demographic diversity are dependent on leadership, culture and climate, and organizational strategy, with external strategy and an innovative culture being associated with success in leveraging diversity for financial advantage (Gilbert & Ivancevich, 2000). Providing a supportive organizational context is essential to success. Merely changing workforce demographics without properly designed organizational development interventions may produce more harm than good (Kossek, Markel, & McHugh, 2003). In addition, organizations need effective team processes to make diversity policies and practices successful (Ely, 2004). Pro-diversity practices are those for fostering equality and inclusion to encourage contact, cooperation, and common goals between members of diverse groups, and equal treatment of all groups. Limitations and suggestions for further research Limitations of the study include the fact that the study was conducted among a convenience sample of office-based employees of one state department, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Secondly, the primary data for the study were collected using a self-reporting questionnaire, making it possible that a common- method variance inflated the relationships between variables (Podsakoff et al., 2003). To constrain the occurrence of common-method bias, future empirical studies in this area should collect data using multiple methods (e.g. interviews, surveys, peer reports, etc.). A further limitation of the study was the cross-sectional measurement. It was not possible to test the causal relationships proposed in the theoretical framework, and longitudinal assessment would provide further validation of specific relationships. Future studies should consider longitudinal designs and recruiting samples from various other state departments in the public sectors as well as various organizations from various sectors in the private sector and not for profit organizations using, using mixed methods and according to Adkoli (2017, p. 38) multiple methods, tools and techniques, such as Grounded Theory (to develop a theoretical model based on actual ground realities), phenomenology (to understand a phenomenon from participants' perception), ethnography (to gain insights of the organization culture), case study (to develop in-depth understanding of a case) and narratives (to capture long personal experience). It is advised that researchers interact with the participant in a 'naturalistic setting' as opposed to an artificial 'lab setting' and helps in describing and exploring an issue to 'contextualization' rather than 'generalization'. A method of 'triangulation' should be used for validating the results. This will facilitate the use of the correct context-specific interventions. Conclusion In conclusion, a diversity process model which addressed employee separation and integration orientation (fully or partially) explains employee diversity attitudes and workplace health and work success. Diversity demands only have direct effects on workplace health and success. This finding applied more to Black than White South African public services employees. By implication, the use of pro-diversity resources can lead to subjective experiences of workplace success through an integration strategy. 125 Footnote 1Rainbow culture- a phrase coined by the South African Nobel Prize laureate bishop Desmond Tutu, to refer to the diverse nature of the South African society.

Several models have been proposed to explain the nature of diversity in the workplace. We intend to replicate and extend the results of a previous study that tested a Dual Process Model of Diversity in two new, multicultural samples. Also, we wanted to test if the model holds (is invariant) for both Black and White employees. Our model draws on various diversity models and two theoretical frameworks namely acculturation models, as studied in cross-cultural psychology and a dual-process model of occupational health, as a novel approach to gain greater insight in diversity dynamics in the workplace. We administered a cross-sectional survey in a South African convenience sample (N = 966 employees of various commercial companies in Study 1 and N = 241 mine employees in Study 2). Using multigroup path analysis, invariant and predicted relations were found for Blacks and Whites. Whites experienced mainstream acculturation conditions in a slightly more favourable way, whereas Blacks showed a higher preference for an integration diversity orientation despite experiencing diversity conditions slightly more negatively. The Dual Process Model suggests that diversity interventions should ideally have two components. Firstly, interventions should address conditions that impede diversity, such as discrimination, to ensure that employees are less likely to drop out because of ill-health. Secondly, addressing adverse conditions is not enough; positive work success requires a set of diversity-conducive conditions, such as support for diversity. These two components can and should be independently addressed. Our findings suggest that the acculturation theories used specifically in the Western world to understand the issues affecting immigrant's adjustment in foreign countries and the Dual Process Model (from IO psychology) can be integrated into a framework to understand diversity in the workplace in South Africa. Keywords: Diversity; integration; separation; dual-process model 132 Introduction South African workplaces, like workplaces in many other countries around the globe, are becoming more diverse (Moloto, Brink, & Nel, 2014; Sharma & Hussain, 2016). Many South African companies implemented diversity programs to deal with diversity after the abolishment of Apartheid in 1994 (Wentling & Palma-Rivas, 2000). Recognizing these evolving workplace trends, the topic has also attracted much scholarly attention (Carter, 2000; Cox, 2001) as well as public policy attention (Enchautegui-de-Jes\u00fas, Hughes, Johnson, & Joo Oh, 2006). Various scholars have proposed models to explain either the nature of diversity (Garcia-Prieto, Bellard, & Schneider, 2003) or the effects of diversity on individual and organizational outcomes (Van Knippenberg, De Dreu, & Homan, 2004), whereas others have focused on models that explored the dynamics involved in explaining the quality of relations in diverse settings (Pettigrew, 1998). Harrison and Klein (2007) use the term \"diversity\" to describe the distribution of differences among the members of a unit concerning a common attribute, such as tenure, ethnicity, conscientiousness, task attitude, or pay. Diversity is a compositional construct. Diversity is also attributed to specifics and that a unit is not diverse per se, but rather, it is diverse with respect to one or more specific features of its members. The diversity that we address here results from the distribution of differences in member composition, focusing on the attribute of ethnicity (e.g., the usually monocultural home environment versus the intended transformed multicultural workplace). The terms race and ethnicity are often used interchangeably. While ethnicity tends to emphasize the rhetoric of culture and lifestyle, race tends to be associated with physical distinctions. Both rest not on objective criteria, but perception (Arora-Jonsson, 2017). Differences between them are matters of tendency, not an absolute distinction (Sollors, 2002). Ethnicity has been defined as the social group a person belongs to, and either identifies with or is identified with by others, as a result of a mix of cultural and other factors including language, diet, religion, ancestry and physical features traditionally associated with race (Bhopal, 2014). National, religious, geographic, linguistic and cultural groups do not necessarily coincide with racial groups and the cultural traits of such groups have no demonstrated genetic connection with racial traits. Because serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the term \"race\" is used in popular parlance, it would be better when speaking of human races to drop the term \"race\" altogether and speak of ethnic groups (UNESCO, 1951:6). 'Race' serves as codes and as the manifestation of power (Essed & Goldberg, 2002). The foundation of apartheid was the system of racial categorisation enshrined in law by the 1950 Population Registration Act (and subsequent amendments). The Act provided for all South Africans to be classified into one of three basic racial categories. A white person is one who in appearance is, or who is generally accepted as, a white person, but does not include a person who, although in appearance obviously a white person, is generally accepted as a Coloured person. A native is a person who is in fact or is generally accepted as a member of any aboriginal race or tribe of Africa. A Coloured person is a person who is not a white person nor a native. Later, a fourth category Indian was added, for people of South Asian descent, the label 'native' was replaced by the labels 'Bantu' and 'Black'. Racial classification was recorded in official identity documentation. From 1970, the 'black' category was further sub-divided into ethnic or linguistic groups (such as Zulu and Xhosa) (Christopher 2002). South Africans tend to see their society in racialised terms (Seekings, 2008). Research in Cape Town shows that how people categorise 133 themselves also accords closely with how other people see them. In other words, there remains a close correlation between official apartheid-era racial classifications, post-apartheid self-classification and post-apartheid classification by other people (Seekings, Jooste, Langer, & Maughan-Brown, 2005). For many South African employees diversity in the workplace refers to the difference between the (usually monocultural) home and the (often transformed) multicultural workplace with its often White business culture. The national post-1994 agenda emphasizes an increase in representation of previously disadvantaged groups (the South-African term to refer to the groups that were discriminated against under Apartheid, namely women, the disabled, Coloureds, Indians, and in particular Blacks) in the workplace. However, national employment equity reports suggest that very little progress has been made to increase the numbers of previously disadvantaged groups in, especially higher-level positions. In addition, ethnic integration has not come easily after 1994 (Hofmeyr, 2006; Seekings, 2008). National surveys indeed indicate that South Africans hardly have contact with people other than their ethnicity in the private space (HSRC, 2006). According to Hofmeyr (2006), trust, optimism, and the degree of interactions with people from other racial groups have decreased and racial polarization has been on the rise, which could influence forced interaction in the workplace. We were interested in how both Blacks and Whites experience diversity conditions and its resultant psychological consequences in the workplace. Research Purpose We investigated the replicability of the results of a previous study (Jackson, Van de Vijver, & Molokoane, 2013) that tested a structural model of diversity, linking antecedents or conditions, mediators, and outcomes of diversity and test the model in two studies in South Africa. The present study involves larger samples and tests the cross-cultural generalizability of the conceptual model. The model, labelled the Dual Process Model of Diversity, holds that positive and negative diversity outcomes (productivity and ill-health, respectively) largely have their own antecedents. On the one hand, there are facilitating conditions for diversity in organizations (such as diversity-enhancing practices) that positively influence sociocultural adjustment (work success and productivity) in the facilitating or \"positive\" stream; on the other hand, there are constraining conditions (such as discrimination, racism, and segregation) that influence psychological adjustment (negative employee attitudes and ill health) in the encumbering or \"negative\" stream. Crossover relations between the positive and negative stream are much weaker (if present at all) than relations within streams. So, diversity conditions in our model combine the presence of facilitating conditions and the absence of inhibiting conditions. In the present study we addressed two positive employee outcomes of diversity conditions, subjective experiences of work success (study 1) and productivity (study 2); more specifically, in study 1 we addressed the feeling of adding value to the company by being productive (you earn what you are being paid for), as well as negative employee attitudes job dissatisfaction (not feeling content with current job) and intentions to quit (study 1); in study 2 we also addressed ill-health. Before describing the model in more detail, we briefly review relevant diversity literature. Literature review Diversity Models 134 Several have been proposed to explain the nature of diversity; some address processes in multicultural teams (Pelled, 1996; Pelled, Eisenhardt, & Xin, 1999). Other models make a distinction between diversity categories that are noticeable and unchangeable (e.g., age, gender, race, and ethnic background) and those that are underlying, attained, and changeable (e.g., education, technical abilities, functional background, and tenure) (Milliken & Martins, 1996; Pelled, 1996; Pelled et al., 1999). Subjective experience has come to the fore of diversity research with the Social Identity Salience Theory of Garcia-Prieto et al. (2003), building on Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1986); the model emphasizes the flexibility of team members' numerous social identities. Models have also been suggested that explain the effects of diversity, such as the Categorization-Elaboration Model (Van Knippenberg, De Dreu, & Homan, 2004) and Cox's (1993) Interactional Model of Cultural Diversity (IMCD) and the quality of relations in diverse settings (Blau, 1977). The contact hypothesis (e.g., Pettigrew, Tropp, Wagner, & Christ, 2011) suggests that social contact and interaction are positively related to attraction and liking in heterogeneous groups. However, some theories do not predict improved intergroup relations after contact, such as competition theories (e.g., Mannix & Neale, 2005), according to which ethnic groups compete for scarce resources in society such as education and jobs. The theory of social attraction (Newcomb, 1968) predicts that similarity in attitudes, values, and beliefs facilitates interpersonal attraction and liking. Some have suggested that people will avoid communicating with those they dislike or with those who hold opinions or views differing from their own to reduce the strain produced by the disagreement (Rosenbaum, 1986), which would suggest less communication in heterogeneous organizations than in homogenous organizations. Extant models often deal with the relative (in)effectiveness of heterogeneous (as compared to homogeneous organizations); our model starts from a different premise. In a globalizing world in which the number of cross-cultural organizations is steadily increasing, the question of relative efficiency due to diverse workforce composition is less important from a societal perspective than the question of how we can deal with diversity. Therefore, we focus on positive and negative diversity conditions and the psychological consequences of diversity conditions, which include wellness and health, alongside perceived effectiveness. Our model, therefore, emphasizes the conditions under which people from diverse backgrounds meet and interact in the workplace (where they are forced to meet and interact) and the psychological consequences of such conditions. A Dual Process Model of Diversity in the Workplace. Our model draws on relevant diversity models mentioned above and on two theoretical frameworks: acculturation models, as studied in cross-cultural psychology (Arends-T\u00f3th & Van de Vijver, 2006; Berry, 1997), and a dual-process model of occupational health (Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004). Both models are explained below. Acculturation and diversity in the workplace. The diversity that we address here results from the difference between the usually monocultural home environment and the multicultural workplace. This way of dealing with diversity has been extensively studied in the acculturation literature (e.g., Berry, 1997). Based on this literature and in line with the interactional model of cultural diversity (Cox, 1993), we distinguish conditions, orientations, and outcomes that are relevant in diversity (Arends-T\u00f3th & 135 Van de Vijver, 2006). Diversity antecedents or conditions define the context and involve both factors dealing with the diversity context (e.g., support for diversity, discrimination, racism, and segregation demands) and the ethnic context (e.g., ethnic vitality and ethnic social support; Ait Ouarasse, 2004; Jackson et al., 2013). People getting into contact with a different culture frequently in the workplace (the dominant culture of the workplace, which is often based on the White business culture in South Africa) are confronted with two decisions, namely maintenance of their home culture in the workplace and participation in the dominant workplace culture. The two independent dimensions yield four possibilities when considered in conjunction; these are referred to as acculturation orientations (also labelled styles and strategies). Individuals are called integrated when they adhere to both cultures, assimilated when they adhere to the business culture only, separated when they adhere to their own ethnic culture only and marginalized when they adhere to none. The acculturation literature provides ample evidence that orientations have substantial relationships with outcomes: integration is usually the most successful and marginalization the least, with assimilation and separation yielding intermediate results (Berry, Poortinga, Breugelmans, Chasiotis, & Sam, 2011). Acculturation outcomes can be grouped under two major types: psychological (\"being or feeling well\" in the new cultural context, often measured by mental and physical health) and sociocultural (\"doing well\", often measured by school and work success). The literature seems to be based on the tacit assumption that orientations affect all outcomes in a fairly similar manner although it has been demonstrated that psychological and sociocultural outcomes have different sets of predictors (Ward, Bochner, & Furnham, 2001). We argue that these models and findings also apply to diversity in the workplace and follow Ward et al.'s (2001) reasoning in our Dual Process Model that both outcomes may have their own antecedents. A Dual Process Model of Work Wellness and Burnout. The Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model tries to explain how employees combine job demands and job resources in processes of work wellness and burnout. The model posits that two underlying psychological processes play a role in burnout (as one aspect of wellness at work): an effort-driven process in which excessive job demands lead to exhaustion and a motivation-driven process in which lacking resources lead to disengagement (Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, & Schaufeli, 2001). Schaufeli and Bakker (2004) extended the JD-R model by including engagement and by adding indicators for health impairment and organizational withdrawal in the Comprehensive Burnout and Engagement (COBE) Model. The COBE-model also assumes that the energetic process links job demands with health problems via burnout, whereas the motivational process links job resources with organizational outcomes via work engagement. Job resources may play either an intrinsic motivational role through the fostering of employee's growth, learning and development, or they may play an extrinsic motivational role by being instrumental in achieving work goals. The model was confirmed in various empirical studies (e.g., Jackson, Rothmann, & Van de Vijver, 2006; Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004). A Dual Process Model of Diversity. We argue that there are two underlying processes that influence adjustment or wellness at work in a diverse setting, namely an effort-driven process (the encumbering or negative stream) in which excessive adverse mainstream conditions or diversity demands lead to poor 136 psychological adjustment (negative employee attitudes and ill-health symptom) and a motivation-driven process (facilitating or positive stream) where the presence and experience of positive mainstream conditions or diversity resources lead to better sociocultural adjustments (increased actual or perceived productivity and work success). Our distinction between the two streams bears resemblance to the discrimination-and-fairness and integration-and-learning perspectives on diversity described by Ely and Thomas (2001); in the literature on diversity in education the perspectives refer to avoiding discrimination, fostering equality and inclusion (sometimes called colour-blindness) versus acknowledging and promoting cultural pluralism (e.g., Hachfeld et al., 2011). The encumbering stream deals more with the legal framework (discrimination-and-fairness) and prerequisites of diversity outcomes, whereas the facilitating stream deals more with integration-and-learning, focusing on interactions between group members in which diversity is viewed as a resource. Various studies (Ait Ouarasse, 2004; Ayalon Moomal et al., 2009) have demonstrated the link between discrimination, racism, separatism and negative psychological outcomes. Therefore in line with living experiences of the South African society and empirical facts (Jackson & Van de Vijver, submitted; Jackson, et al., 2013), in our dual process model, diversity demands or restraining intergroup features, such as segregation demands, discrimination, and overt or subtle racism (separately or jointly making up negative acculturation/diversity conditions, labelled the negative stream), are related to an individual separation orientation (pointing to a refusal to accept the plural composition of the organization and focus on employees of one's own ethnicity). An individual separation orientation mediates the relationship between these negative acculturation / diversity antecedents or conditions and negative employee attitudes and ill-health. Given the reasoning and arguments above, the following hypothesis was formulated: Hypothesis 1 (negative stream): An employee's separation orientation (fully or partially) mediates the relation between the negative antecedent conditions and psychological adjustment. In the positive stream, there are diversity resources or facilitating intergroup features, such as a climate supportive of diversity/acculturation and tolerance of all employees for ethnic diversity/difference of the organization. These resources are taken to be related to an individual integration orientation, which mediates the relation between positive diversity conditions or setting, tolerance (in study 1 and 2), diversity or multicultural norms and practices (only in study 2), and subjective experiences of work success. It is known from the literature that there are relations between integration and separation and also between psychological and sociocultural outcomes (e.g., Berry, 1997; Ward et al., 2001). Given the reasoning and arguments above, the following hypothesis was formulated: Hypothesis 2 (positive stream): An employee's integration orientation (fully or partially) mediates the relation between positive antecedents and sociocultural adjustment, as measured by subjective experiences of productivity. Furthermore, we argue, in line with assumptions and findings of other dual-process models (e.g., Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004) that \"crossover relations\" between the positive and negative stream in the diversity model are much weaker (if present at all) than the relations within each of the streams and that there are no direct crossover relations to layers (columns) that come later in 137 the model; for example, there should be no direct relation from a negative antecedent to a positive outcome. Crossover relations can only occur within antecedents, mediators, or outcomes; for example, positive and negative antecedents may be correlated, and positive antecedents will be linked to positive mediators but can only be indirectly linked to negative mediators. The notion that facilitating intergroup contact features or positive diversity conditions influence sociocultural adjustment (productivity in the context of our study) directly but psychological adjustment only indirectly (if at all) is at the core of our model; analogously, the presence of restraining intergroup contact features or negative diversity conditions leads to negative acculturation orientations and poor psychological adjustment, which in turn can diminish or erode the credits of sociocultural adjustment accrued as a result of the presence of facilitating features. We also assumed that the basic structure of the model (two separate streams, with each stream consisting of diversity conditions, setting features of diverse contact or antecedents, acculturation orientations as mediators, and psychological and sociocultural adjustment as indicators of wellness) would hold for both Black and White groups. This was examined by testing the fit of a hierarchy of models with increasing constraints on the number of cross-culturally invariant parameters to the data (notably invariance of the number and patterning of factors, of factor loadings; and covariances among the latent variables. Given this reasoning and arguments, we tested the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 3: The dual-process model of diversity holds for both Blacks and Whites. Support for Diversity in South Africa. We test our model in South Africa, which provides a unique context for diversity research. Historically, South Africa is a deeply segregated society. Since the abolishment of Apartheid in 1994, many organizations see a need to become more diverse and to develop an inclusive organizational identity. However, the remains of segregation still trouble many organizations. Slabert (2001, p. 125) examined the relative status of racist paradigms in South Africa and reported \"distressing\" and \"disappointing\" findings. He found racist stereotypes and ethnocentrism in all groups. He concluded that racist perceptions and stereotypes remain very prevalent and active in South African society. The prevalence of such negative stereotypes held by various ethnic groups in South Africa was recently confirmed by (Moloto, et al., 2014), twenty years later in the \"new\" South Africa. There are theoretical models as well as data obtained elsewhere that have a bearing on expected support for diversity in South African organizations. There is evidence that more powerful and dominant groups will be less supportive of diversity than less powerful groups (e.g., Arends-T\u00f3th & Van de Vijver, 2003; Berry & Kalin, 1995; Verkuyten & Thijs, 1999). Ethnic groups are viewed more negatively and support for diversity is less when minority groups are more viewed as threats to scarce resources, such as jobs (Realistic Conflict Theory; e.g., Duckitt, 1994), or important cultural symbols and group identity (Stephan & Stephan, 2000). A recent study in the US (Unzueta & Binning, 2010) examined which racial groups are associated with the concept of diversity and found that regardless of perceivers' racial in-group, minorities (Asians, Blacks, and Latinos) tend to be more associated with diversity than Whites are. Research suggests that minority participants tend to perceive higher levels of identity-based trust and comfort in organizations that endorse diversity more than organizations that reject diversity by endorsing colour-blindness (Le, Lai, & Wallen, 2009; Purdie-Vaughns, Steele, 138 Davies, Ditlmann, & Crosby, 2008). The presence of minority in-group members is most likely to contribute to the perception that a given diverse environment is supportive and welcoming of their particular identity (Stevens, Plaut, & Sanchez-Burks, 2008). These findings have implications for how ethnic group members in South African organizations may experience diversity. Diversity policies such as affirmative action programmes that focus on the advancement of previously disadvantaged groups, which were denied various rights and opportunities in the Apartheid days, will be more supported by these groups than by members of the White dominant group, especially White males. These differences in support for diversity may be reinforced by the prevailing power differential in many South African organizations, where the management positions are still predominantly filled by White males. The most recent South African census found that Whites earn on average six times the salaries of Blacks (Statistics South Africa, 2012). Therefore, it seems fair to expect more support for diversity policies and a more negative evaluation of current work and diversity conditions in Black groups than in White groups. Given the reasoning and arguments above, the following hypothesis was formulated: Hypothesis 4: Blacks experience less conducive diversity conditions than Whites in the South African workplace. The model and hypotheses were tested in two independent studies, using different samples. Study 1 Methods Research Approach, Work Context and Sample The quantitative approach was selected based on the nature of the data and the objectives of the study. A cross-sectional design, utilizing surveys, was used to test these hypotheses and achieve the research objectives. The participants (N = 966) of this study were a convenience sample from different South African companies in the manufacturing, retail, and construction sectors. The workplace in South Africa, including the organizations where the data was gathered, is characterized by a few common features. The workforce is ethnically diverse. As for the diversity of these groups, blue-collar workers (majority blacks) are normally led by a white supervisor/team leader with much higher qualifications (e.g., engineer) than the average blue-collar black. Top-level positions are normally taken by White males, and only recently did members of previously disadvantaged groups start to join higher levels in the hierarchy but filling mostly staff positions in human resource management, while white males still dominate key line positions in higher levels in strategic functional areas, such as production and finance. Because of the status of white males in especially the private sector workspace, many still perceive them as the dominant group in the workplace. This means that Whites are being perceived as the economically dominant group and Blacks as the politically dominant group. Sixty percent of the sample were male. There were 462 Whites, 402 Blacks, 51 Coloured, 27 Indian, and 7 from other groups. Black and Coloured workers were combined in a single Black group so that the final analyses involved a Black and a White group. The Indian and other groups were dropped for the subsequent analysis due to low numbers in the sample. This definition is in line with the Employment Equity Act 55 (1988) in which 'Black people' is a 139 generic term denoting Africans, Coloureds, and Indians. Within the context of the present study, both groups (African and Coloureds) share a history as the victims of institutionalised racism and oppression, and they share the same position in the commonly perceived divide of 'black' and 'white' in South Africa (Makhalemele, 2005). The average age was 39.01 years (SD = 10.74). The minimal level of education was completed secondary school. Measures Some instruments with well-established psychometric properties used in other cultural contexts were adapted (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). Adaptations involved replacing Dutch and Moroccan with South African and own ethnic group, respectively. All scales employed a five-point Likert format ranging from strongly agree (1) to strongly disagree (5). Negatively phrased item scores were reversed before the analyses so that higher scores reflect more endorsement of the underlying construct. Diversity conditions or antecedent measures: The following diversity conditions measuring instruments were used: Tolerance by the Mainstream. This is an eight-item measure of the extent to which participants think that mainstream members take an open stance toward ethnic minorities in the South African workplace (adaptation of Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). The scale contains items like \"I think that most of my co-workers from other cultures are most welcoming people\" ( = .77). Perceived Discrimination. The scale is an 11-item measure of the extent to which participants think the situation in their workplace is discriminatory and requires them to drop their cultural characteristics (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). The scale contains items like \"I experience discrimination in my workplace\" ( = .89). Subtle Racism. This is a 10-item (four of these items were filter items and were not used in the final analysis) measure of the extent to which co-workers hold subtle racist attitudes (Duckitt, 1991). Sample items from this measure include \"Some groups in South Africa are getting too demanding in pushing for equal rights\" ( = .88). Mediator measures: The following mediator measuring instruments were used: Integration Orientation. This is a three-item measure of the extent to which participants prefer contact with their ethnic group members and mainstreamers and seek participation to the Rainbow culture [a phrase coined by the South African Nobel Prize laureate bishop Desmond Tutu, to refer to the diverse nature of the South African society] (Jackson, Van de Vijver & Ali, 2012). The scale contains items such as \"I want to maintain my own culture as well as seek contact and participate in the mainstream culture\" ( = .59). Separation Orientation. This is a three-item measure of the extent to which participants prefer contact with their ethnic group members and do not seek participation in the Rainbow culture (Jackson, Van de Vijver & Burckard, 2011). The scale contains items such as \"I actually avoid contact with members from other cultures\" ( = .62). Outcome measures: The following employee attitudes used as outcomes (wellness indicators): Negative work-related outcomes. These were measured with two items (\"I am dissatisfied with my job\" and \"I intend to quit my job\") to determine negative psychological work-related employee attitudes or outcomes (intentions to quit and job dissatisfaction; = .68). 140 Subjective productivity at work. A single item (\"I am productive at work\") was used to measure the sociocultural outcome. Such a global approach simply asks if the worker is overall productive on the job and suggests that productivity experiences are more than the sum of its parts or dimensions of behaviour that define productivity at work (Oshagbemi, 1999). Finally, a biographical questionnaire was also included, dealing with biographical questions, such as age, sex, and ethnicity. The low internal consistencies of some of the measures are presumably due to their small number of items. Research Procedure and ethical considerations. This study used data collected by students in a change management MBA second-year module as part of an organizational diagnosis assignment that carried credits for the module's final mark. It was expected from students to provide proof that ethical issues of anonymity and the voluntary participation were adhered to using written consent of all participants involved and permission from top management to conduct the study. Data Analysis Approach The statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS program. Exploratory factor analyses (EFA) were conducted on the measures to examine the dimensionality of the scales and sub-scales. Descriptive statistics including Cronbach alpha coefficients were determined to assess the reliability of the measuring instruments. Pearson product-moment correlation was used to identify the relationships between the variables. Structural Equation Modelling using multigroup analysis was performed using the AMOS 23 programme to test for mediating effects of acculturation orientations, in the relation between diversity conditions and employee outcomes (well-being). To examine Black and White group differences in the experience of mainstream antecedent conditions, an individual separation and integration orientation, and well-being, as measured by employee outcomes, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was carried out with ethnicity as independent variable and the mean scores of the scales as dependent variables. Cohen's d values was used to gauge the size of the ethnic differences Results Exploratory factor analysis: EFA was used here for a check of dimensionality. Items with factor loadings higher than .30 were considered as sufficient descriptors of the latent variable. The results obtained from separate exploratory factor analyses and inspections of the scree plots and eigenvalues of the factors indicated that all scales used to assess antecedents and mediators were one-dimensional. The choice for one factor was based on problems in interpreting multifactorial solutions and on the sharp decrease of the eigenvalues after the first factor. The variance explained for each scale is presented in Table 1. The correlation matrix of the scales for the Black (above diagonal) and White (below diagonal) group are presented in Table 1. 141 Table 1: Correlation Matrix for Blacks (Above Diagonal) and Whites (Below Diagonal) Scale Variance explaineda 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1.

Testing the fit of a hierarchy of models with increasing constraints on the number of cross-culturally invariant parameters to the data was deemed important because, in line with dual-process model and cross-cultural convention and assumptions, we also proposed that the basic structure of our dual-process model would hold for both Black and White groups. We allowed the error terms of the two diversity orientations to be correlated. Inspection of Table 2 revealed that the structural weights model (see also Figure 1) was the most restrictive model with a good fit, although the global 2 test was significant: 2(26, N = 966) = 79.55, p < .01; 2/df = 3.06 (recommended 3.00; Kline, 1998). Other indices confirmed the good fit of the model: The adjusted goodness of fit index (AGFI) was 0.95 (recommended .90; Schumacker & Lomax, 2004), (TLI) was 0.92 (recommended .90; Schumacker & Lomax, 2004), the comparative fit index (CFI) was .95 (recommended .90; Schumacker & Lomax, 2004), and the root mean approximation (RMSEA) was .05 (recommended .05; Schumacker & Lomax, 2004). The model implies that the path coefficients of the antecedent and mediating variables are invariant across Black and White groups. The parameters of the model are presented in Figure 1. 142 Figure 1. SEM analysis of the Dual Process Model: Study 1 The invariance of all path coefficients suggests that the antecedent conditions and acculturation orientations worked the same way for Blacks and Whites. The path coefficients within the encumbering stream were positive and significant (the latter for subtle racism only). The relation between diversity demands (antecedent) and negative work-related attitudes (outcome) was direct; the indirect effect (through separation orientation) was not significant. The elements of the facilitating stream showed the same pattern of positive, significant relations. The relation between resources (antecedent) and perceived productivity at work (outcome) was only indirect, yet significant (through integration orientation). The analysis confirmed the assumption of the Dual Process Model that there were only crossover relations within a single layer and not across layers. The correlation between negative and positive conditions was not significant. Negative work-related attitudes (outcomes) were a negative predictor of perceived productivity at work. The proportion of variance accounted for in the models showed small to medium effect sizes; more specifically, diversity orientations and negative work-related outcomes showed medium effect sizes (integration: R2 = .09; separation: R2 = .07; negative work-related outcomes: R2 = .09), whereas work success showed a small effect size (R2 = .04). In line with hypothesis 1 and 2, we found support for the existence of two fairly independent streams of diversity experiences that link diversity conditions to outcomes where the crossover effects between the two streams are much weaker than the effects within each of the streams. The positive stream is related to how well employees perform (sociocultural outcomes), whereas the negative stream is related to well the employees feel (psychological outcomes). 143 Mediation: The model that we tested was a mediation model in which antecedent conditions influence orientations, which in turn impact on outcomes (all within the same stream). The Dual Process Model does not specify whether the mediation should be complete or partial. We made a closer examination of the direct and indirect effects to evaluate their relative sizes. We were interested in the significance of the direct and indirect effects. We stayed within the structural equation framework to compute the significance of mediation effects by using a bootstrap procedure (90% bias-corrected CI using 200 samples) as implemented in the AMOS program. As can be seen in Figure 1, we found partial mediation for the positive but not the negative stream. This is confirmed in Table 3, which gives an overview of the significance of all indirect effects. No significant, indirect effects were strong.

Comparisons of means of Black and White groups: We were interested in ethnic group differences in the experience of diversity in the workplace. Therefore, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was carried out with ethnicity (two levels: Black and White) as independent variable and the mean scores of all scales of the model of Figure 1 as dependent variables. The mean scores of the scales per ethnic group are presented in Table 4. Table 4: Mean Scores and Standard Deviations per Scale for the Black and White Group Whites Blacks Scale Mean SD Mean SD Cohen's d Tolerance 3.36 0.52 3.27 0.64 0.14 Discrimination Quitting 1.86 1.12 2.29 1.27 -0.34** Dissatisfaction 1.97 0.94 2.36 1.01 -0.42** < .05. **p .01. The of ethnicity was significant (Wilks' Lambda = .87; F(8, 855) = 16.55, p < .01). Univariate analyses showed a significant ethnic difference for all variables except 144 for tolerance and racism. Compared to Blacks, Whites showed a stronger preference for a separation orientation, perceived their productivity levels to be higher, and were less likely to consider quitting and were more satisfied with their jobs. In contrast, Blacks showed a stronger preference for an integration orientation despite experiencing diversity more negatively, reporting more experiences of discrimination, and negative work-related attitudes coupled with lower subjective experiences of productivity. The average scores were below the midpoint of the scale for discrimination, subtle racism, and separation but above the midpoint for tolerance and an integration orientation. Therefore, the findings seem to suggest that the respondents were fairly supportive of diversity and they experienced a climate in which the negative diversity conditions are not strong. Discussion Outline of the results We set out to replicate and extend the results of a proposed a model of diversity in the workplace consisting of a facilitating stream that links diversity-enhancing conditions or diversity resources, such as tolerance for cultural differences in the workplace, to positive work-related outcomes, such as perceived subjective productivity, and a fairly independent, restraining stream that links diversity-impeding conditions or demands, such as discrimination and subtle racism, to psychological outcomes or negative work-related attitudes, such as intentions to quit and job dissatisfaction. We tested the model among Black and White employees of various companies in South Africa. Multigroup analysis yielded a good fit between our hypothetical model and the empirical data, thereby confirming the first three hypotheses and the dual-process model. The model indicates that diversity resources are linked to sociocultural outcomes through an integration orientation whereas negative conditions are linked to psychological outcomes through a separation orientation, thereby supporting our first three hypotheses; yet, the proportions of explained variance of the path model were not large in either ethnic group. Lastly, we hypothesized that Blacks would experience diversity less favourably than Whites in the South African workplace. Compared to Blacks, Whites experience others slightly more tolerant toward them in the workplace; yet, Whites showed stronger preference for a separation orientation and perceived their productivity levels to be higher and were less likely to consider quitting or being dissatisfied with their jobs. Blacks, on the other hand, had a stronger preference for an integration orientation despite experiencing diversity more negatively, reporting more experiences of discrimination, subtle racism, and negative work-related attitudes coupled with lower subjective experiences of productivity. These findings are in line with studies of multiculturalism elsewhere (Arends-T\u00f3th & Van de Vijver, Verkuyten & Thijs, 1999). This finding also led to the partial acceptance of Hypothesis 4. The average scores for discrimination, subtle racism and separation were below the midpoint of the response scale and the averages for tolerance and integration were above the scale midpoint. This pattern seems to suggest that the respondents were well aware of the importance of diversity in their workplaces and that they largely supported it. We cannot rule out the impact of social desirability on these findings as South Africa has a strong climate of political correctness. Study 2 145 We set out to replicate our first study in a different work environment. The second study was conducted in a gold mine in North West Province (South Africa), an area rich in deposits of gold, platinum, manganese, diamonds, chromium, vanadium, and coal. In addition, we were interested in testing whether the structure of the model, direction and strength of the relations between the different elements of the dual-process model would hold if we substitute work-related positive psychological diversity outcomes with personal psychological outcomes that are more related to health. Even though the work environments of the two studies differ considerably, both environments share important features. The first is that participants in both studies were able to read and write and communicate in English. In addition, organizations in both studies were characterized by the domination of Whites in top positions, whereas the majority of lower-level workers is mainly non-White. Finally, in both studies, the labour force is multicultural and cross-cultural contacts are everyday experiences for all workers. We tested the same hypotheses as in the first study. Methods Research Approach, Work Context and Sample The quantitative approach was selected based on the nature of the data and the objectives of the study. A cross-sectional design using questionnaires was selected as the most applicable method in obtaining data for this study. The participants of this study were a convenience sample of miners in the North West Province. A total of 500 were approached. A response rate of 59% was achieved, of which 288 responses (98%) could be utilized. However, Indian respondents were deleted from the final multigroup analysis because of the small number of participants. The sample was limited to those that could read and write and therefore excluded the lower level, mostly underground black workers. Blacks and Coloureds were combined in a single Black group so that the final analyses involved a Black and a White group. The sample (N = 241: 83.7% of the initial usable sample) consisted of 208 males (86.3%) and 33 females (13.7%), 170 Blacks (70.5%) and 71 Whites (29.5%) miners with an average age of 31.65 years and 8.77 years of experience. Measures Some instruments with well-established psychometric properties used in other cultural contexts were adapted (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004) as well as in study 1 were administered. All scales follow a five-point Likert format ranging from strongly agree (1) to strongly disagree (5) and some item scores were reversed before the analyses so that higher scores reflect more endorsement of the underlying attitude. Positive diversity antecedent measures: The following positive diversity antecedent measuring instruments were used: Tolerance by the Mainstream. The same scale was used in study 1 ( = .76). Diversity / Multicultural Norms (Jackson et al., 2012). This is a thirteen-item measure of the participants' diversity attitudes and the prevalence of diversity-enhancing values within the organization. The scale contains items like \"I think that most of my co-workers do not recognize that we are a workforce that consists of groups from different cultural groups\" and \"I think that most of my co-workers do not recognize that we are a workforce that consists of groups from different cultural backgrounds\" (both reversed scored). Jackson et al. (2013) obtained a Cronbach 146 alpha coefficient of .70 with a South African Police Service sample. In the present study, we found = .65. Diversity / Multicultural Practices (Jackson et al., 2012). This instrument is a thirteen-item measure of the participants' actual multiculturalism behaviour and the commonness of diversity practices within the organization. The scale contains items like \"My co-workers generally show respect for other cultures in our organisation\", \"I think that most of my co-workers appreciate the fact that we are different\" and \"I think that most of my co-workers appreciate the fact that we are different\". Jackson et al. (2013) obtained a value of Cronbach's alpha coefficient of .75 with a South African Police Service sample; in the current study, we found a value of .77. Negative antecedent diversity measures: The following negative diversity antecedent measuring instruments were used: Mainstream Segregation Demands. This is a 12-item measure of the extent to which participants think that mainstream members hold segregationist attitudes towards minority members (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). An example item is \"I think that most of my fellow residents would be happy to have people from other cultures than their own to be thrown out of our organisation\" ( = .87). Perceived Discrimination. This is the same scale used in study 1 ( = .87). Subtle Racism (Duckitt, 1991). This is the same scale used in study 1 ( = .86). Mediator measures: The following mediator measuring instruments were used: Individual Integration Orientation. The same scale was used in study 1 ( = .64). Individual Separation Orientation. The same scale was used in study 1 ( = .64). Psychological and sociocultural adjustment (well-being) measures: The following measuring instruments were used as (un)wellness indicators Ill-Health. This is an adapted version of the 18 physical health symptoms of the PSI of Spector and Jex (1998) complemented with a list of 9 common psychological complaints based on a slightly modified version of the World Health Organization Cross-National Survey of Psychological and Somatic Symptoms (1988). The scale employs a frequency format that ranges from never (1) to every day (5). The self-report measure asked respondents to indicate whether or not in the past three months they had suffered any of the mentioned symptoms. Some examples of symptoms included on the scale are headaches, backache, fatigue, eye strain and trouble sleeping, concentrating and constant anxiety or panic attacks ( = 0.94 and 0.89 for physical and psychological ill-health, respectively). Work Success. This is a fourteen-item measure of participants' success at work (Ait Ouarasse & Van de Vijver, 2004). All of the items are positively phrased. It contains items about task completion, punctuality, status, and recognition at work, relationships with supervisors, and relationships with fellow workers. The scale contains items like \"I am always on time for my work\" and \"I have a good reputation among my co-workers\" ( = .85). Finally, a biographical questionnaire was also included, dealing with biographical questions, such as age, sex, and ethnicity. Research procedure and ethical considerations Research permission was obtained from management. Once permission was granted, prospective participants were invited to information session on site. The anonymous and 147 voluntary nature of the project was emphasized during the information session. Participants were also informed about the aim of the project and were encouraged to attend sessions on-site where questionnaires were administered. Proposals outlining the study were also defended at research meetings of the research unit where steps to adhere to the ethical standards were scrutinized by seasoned research unit members of the ethical committee. Five sessions were scheduled for questionnaire completion with two facilitators being present to clarify issues raised by the participants. Each session lasted two and a half hours and included two 15 minute breaks to prevent survey administration fatigue. Data Analysis Approach The statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS program. Exploratory factor analyses (EFA) were conducted on the measures to examine the dimensionality of the scales and sub-scales. Descriptive statistics including Cronbach alpha coefficients were determined to assess the reliability of the measuring instruments. Pearson product-moment correlation was used to identify the relationships between the variables. Structural Equation Modelling using multigroup analysis was performed using the AMOS 23 programme to test for mediating effects of acculturation orientations, in the relation between diversity conditions and employee outcomes (well-being). In order to examine Black and White group differences in the experience of mainstream antecedent conditions, an individual separation and integration orientation, and well-being, as measured by physical and psychological ill-health symptoms, and subjective experiences of work success, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was carried out with ethnicity as independent variable and the mean scores of the scales as dependent variables. Cohen's d values was used to gauge the size of the ethnic differences. Results Exploratory factor analyses. The results obtained from separate EFAs and inspections of the scree plots and eigenvalues of the factors indicated that all scales used to assess antecedents and mediators were one-dimensional. The choice for one factor was based on problems in interpreting multifactorial solutions and on the strong decrease of the eigenvalue after the first factor. The results indicated that all scales used were unifactorial, and variances explained for each scale are presented in Table 5. The correlation matrix of the scales for the Black (above diagonal) and White (below diagonal) group are presented in Table 5.

We used a multigroup model to test the model (see Figure 2). An inspection of the fit indices of Table 6 revealed that the structural residuals model (see Figure 2) was the most restrictive model with a good fit: 2(27, N = 241) = 32.40, p = .22; = 1.20; AGFI = = .96, RMSEA= .03. The proportion of variance accounted for in the models showed medium to large effect sizes; more specifically, diversity orientations and ill-health showed medium to large effect sizes (integration: R2 = .09; separation: R2 = .12; ill-health: R2 = .11), whereas work success showed a large effect size (R2 = .20). The path coefficients within the encumbering stream were positive and significant. The relation between diversity demands (antecedent) and ill-health (outcome) was both direct and indirect (through separation orientation). The elements of the facilitating stream showed the same pattern of positive, significant relations. So, more mainstream segregation demands, discrimination and subtle racism, which made up the negative antecedent conditions, coupled with an individual separation orientation, were positively associated with physical and psychological ill-health symptoms. Positive mainstream diversity norms, mainstream tolerance, and diversity practices, coupled with an individual integration orientation, were positively associated with more ethnic integration demands at home and work. The analysis confirmed the assumption of the Dual Process Model that there are only crossover relations within a single layer and not across layers. The correlation between negative and positive conditions was not significant. The analysis provided evidence that in line with the dual-process model of diversity, antecedent conditions, diversity orientations, and outcomes were related in the expected way and the same relationships were found for Blacks and Whites. These data corroborated the first three hypotheses. Figure 2. SEM analysis of the Dual Process Model: Study 2 149 Mediation. We tested a mediation model in which more distal variables (antecedent) conditions influence more distal variables (diversity orientation), which in turn influences outcomes (all within the same stream). The conceptual model does not specify whether the mediation should be complete or partial. We conducted a closer examination of the direct and indirect effects to evaluate their relative sizes, using the bootstrap procedure as implemented in the AMOS program.

Figure 2 makes clear that in the present study we found partial mediation. The results of the mediation analysis can be found in Table 7. Two findings are striking. Firstly, all indirect effects are significant, which suggests that the effects of the antecedent effects on the outcomes are both direct and indirect. All direct effects in the positive and negative stream were significant. The significance of all direct and indirect effects suggests that the association within both the negative and positive stream comply with Baron and Kenny's (1986) requirements for partial mediation. Secondly, the indirect effects were much smaller than the direct effects. The weakest direct effect was stronger than the largest indirect effect.

In order to examine Black and White group differences in the experience of mainstream antecedent conditions, an individual separation and integration orientation, and well-being, as measured by physical and psychological ill-health symptoms, and subjective experiences of work success, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was carried out with ethnicity (two levels: Black and White) as independent variable and the mean scores of the scales as dependent variables. The mean scores of the scales per ethnic group are presented in Table 8. The last column presents Cohen's d values, which gauge the size of the ethnic differences. The multivariate effect of ethnicity was significant (Wilks' Lambda = .91, F(11, 229) = 2.21, p < .05). Univariate analyses showed that diversity norms [F(1, 239) = 5.98, p < .05], subtle racism at work [F(1, 239) = 8.50, p < .01], and integration [F(1, 239) = 8.17, p < .01] were the only dependent variables that showed a significant, yet small ethnic difference. This finding provided partial support for Hypothesis 4. So, even though Blacks tended to show somewhat higher scores on the antecedent and mediating variables, the effect sizes were small, as can be confirmed in Table 8. Moreover, given that all score means were well above the scale midpoints, our data suggest that the workforce of our study was well aware of diversity aspects of the workplace and seemed to acknowledge that their environment wants them to adapt to this diversity. Scores on individual integration orientation, diversity practices and mainstream tolerance were rather high compared to the scores on the other scales, which points to their endorsement by these mine employees. Although the impact of social desirability cannot be ruled out, our data suggest that diversity is relatively well supported in both groups and that attitudes among employees are rather conducive for establishing and maintaining good intergroup relations in the workplace. Discussion Outline of the results The purpose of the second study was to test the cross-sample stability of our dual-process model of diversity in the workplace. We hypothesized that an individual separation orientation would mediate the relation between adverse mainstream conditions or diversity demands and personal psychological adjustment or health. Secondly, we hypothesized that an individual integration orientation would mediate the relation between positive mainstream conditions or diversity resources and sociocultural adjustments, such as experiences of subjective work success. In addition, we hypothesized that the dual-process model for diversity would hold for both Blacks and Whites. Using multigroup analyses we found, like in Study 1, support for the existence of a dual process model (Demerouti et al., 2001; Jackson, Rothmann, & Van de Vijver, 2006; Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004). We found two relatively independent streams linking encumbering diversity demands to ill-health via separation and a facilitating process linking diversity resources to increased subjective work success experiences via integration. In addition, our analyses confirmed that the crossover relations between the encumbering and facilitating streams were much weaker than the relations within each of the streams for Black and White workers in a South African mine. Comparison of the two models tested in the two studies revealed noteworthy similarities and rather minor differences. As for the similarities, we confirmed the structure of a dual-process model of diversity in both studies. The dual-process model was confirmed in a new 151 organizational context, even if we replaced work-related with personal psychological indicators of adjustment. The direction and strength of the relations between the different elements of the dual-process model were rather similar in the two studies. There were also some differences. The second study showed a direct link between diversity resources and sociocultural outcomes which was not found in the first study. Additionally, differences between the two models were also observed between the strength of the relation between subtle racism and separation in Study 1 and demands and an individual separation orientation in Study 2. A weak relation between discrimination and separation in Study 1 compared to the relation observed between demands and separation observed in Study 2. Another difference between the two models relates to the role of the mediators in the models. In both studies, we proposed a mediation model in which there is antecedent, mediating, and outcome variables and followed the reasoning of the interactional model of cultural diversity (Cox, 1993) as well as the acculturation literature (Arends-T\u00f3th & Van de Vijver, 2006). We view diversity conditions (setting) in the work context as an acculturation issue and therefore investigate the mediating role of acculturation orientations in the relation between acculturation conditions and outcomes in the two independent streams. Our findings in Study 1 seem to suggest that the effects of mainstream tolerance on subjective productivity are fully mediated through an integration orientation. In Study 2 our mediation analysis suggested that separation and integration partially mediate the relation between diversity demands and ill-health and diversity resources and subjective experience of work success, respectively. We can, therefore, conclude that our dual mediating model is well supported in both studies, despite minor differences. General Discussion The aim of the two studies was to replicate and extend the findings of a previous study (Jackson et al., 2013) and test our dual-process model of diversity in the workplace in a new cross-cultural context. Dual-process models are popular in psychology; examples can be found in the domain of work-related health (e.g., Demerouti et al., 2001) and emotion and motivation (Caccioppo & Berntson, 1994; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). We postulated the co-existence of two rather independent systems of diversity aspects in organizations. The distinction draws on the discrimination-and-fairness and integration-and-learning perspectives on diversity distinguished by Ely and Thomas (2001). In our model, there are diversity-inducing and -impeding aspects, which have their own dynamics. In addition, we argued that diversity can be conceptualized as a system with antecedents, mediating variables, and outcomes. The two studies we conducted support the model according to which diversity is a two-pronged system, with each subsystem having their own contingencies. We were interested in ethnic group mean differences in the experience of diversity in the workplace in both studies. Findings in both studies suggested that Blacks experience more negative antecedent conditions (discrimination and racism). On the other hand, Whites experienced more positive antecedent conditions than Blacks, suggesting a more accommodating climate for Whites. In both studies integration orientations are more supported than separation orientations in both groups; yet, separation was more strongly supported among Whites, whereas integration was more strongly supported among Blacks. This pattern may seem to be internally inconsistent. We know from Western studies that immigrant groups that are supposed to gain more from diversity policies are usually more supportive of diversity than of separation. 152 However, in the South African context, we see that the economically most dominant group, the Whites, are more in favour of separation than Blacks, although Whites experience fewer negative antecedent conditions. We would argue that the deviation from Western studies is due to the unique power differential in South Africa. Whites remain in a much stronger economic position compared to Blacks; as a consequence, Whites are served best by a policy that does not threaten their position. Diversity policies are presumably not seen as threatening the dominant position of the White group. It is only through measures of Broad Base Black Economic Empowerment policies (see http://www.thedti.gov.za/economic_empowerment/bee.jsp) to redress the apartheid inequalities and other forms of positive discrimination that the dominant position of Whites is challenged. It is not surprising that the opposition to these measures among Whites is strong (Herman, 2000). Whites still experience the South African diverse workplace more positive than Africans and Coloureds in this samples despite recent legislative changes such as the Employment Equity Act (RSA, 1998) and the use of affirmative action policies that favour designated groups which include Africans and Coloureds in both private and public institutions (Jackson, Van de Vijver & Ali, 2011; Jackson, Van de Vijver, & Laurie, submitted). Theoretical Implications Our findings suggest that the acculturation theories used specifically in the Western world to understand the issues affecting the adjustment of immigrants in foreign countries can be utilized as a framework to understand diversity in the workplace in South Africa. We therefore argue that our main contribution in the present study is that we demonstrate how the management of diversity (organisation psychology) can be viewed in a model that draws on organizational science (the equity and diversity perspective described by Ely and Thomas, 2001), and applies their ideas in a dual-process model, drawn from the occupational health literature and on acculturation frameworks (typically used to describe immigrant adjustment). Our approach makes the equity and diversity framework open for empirical scrutiny, thereby enabling further examination of the diversity-efficiency loop. Limitations and Future Research Future studies should address the limitations of our study. Firstly, larger samples should be used in the public and private sector. Secondly, the generalizability of the model to workplaces elsewhere in the world should be addressed. The constellation of South Africa with its history of apartheid may not generalize well to other countries. On the other hand, we found the model to hold across very different samples and race groups, which suggests that the dynamics of diversity context experiences are rather similar across race groups. This implies that the model could well apply in other cultural contexts. Empirical tests should be conducted to examine this claim. Practical implications and recommendations Our findings have implications for the management of diversity. The Dual Process Model suggests that interventions should ideally have two components. Firstly, interventions should address conditions that impede diversity, such as discrimination and segregation. Mitigating these encumbering conditions can ensure that employees are less likely to drop out because of ill-health. Secondly, addressing adverse conditions is not enough; positive work success requires a set of diversity-conducive conditions, such as support for diversity. These two components can 153 and should be independently addressed. A successful intervention should reduce both stumbling blocks and facilitate enabling conditions. Diversity audits should, therefore, address both components. Additionally, we recommend that organisations make use of cross-cultural training as intervention, which aims to develop the awareness, knowledge, and skills needed to interact appropriately and effectively with culturally diverse customers and co-workers, which is an important element in the development of cultural competence (Bean, 2006). Cultivating an all-inclusive, diverse workplace also requires organizations to implement changes at the structural level (Kalev, Dobbin, & Kelly 2006), such as the creation of a unit responsible for monitoring diversity efforts at work. Fostering both minority and nonminority leadership and involvement in diversity initiatives is fundamental to an all-inclusive approach in the South African context. The strong link between race, hierarchical position and salary in South African institutions (strongly favouring Whites) makes it difficult to perceive institutions as inclusive for employees. Mentoring and social networking initiatives can practice all-inclusion by including cross-race groupings (Ragins, 1997) because the by-products of such efforts include not only career development benefits for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s but also increased intercultural competence. In conclusion, we replicated the basic structure of the dual-process model in two different samples. Another important contribution of this submission resides in the fact that unlike other diversity models, we focus on the conditions (criteria) under which interaction between diverse groups should take place to ensure successful adjustment of members from different ethnic origins or facilitate employee wellness.

Chapter 8 General Discussion The objective of this final chapter is to provide a general discussion that integrates and synthesizes the empirical work presented in this thesis, in accordance with the conceptual model presented in Chapter 1. The findings of this thesis are presented in three sections. Each section deals with a different section of the conceptual model for diversity. The three sections of the conceptual model include the two different streams in the conceptual model in the first two sections as well as the conceptual model that includes both steams in a dual-process model in the final section. Each section starts with the intended research objectives to address the research questions of the section. This followed by a discussion on the empirical findings (of the different chapters that form the section). Lastly, the major issues of the contextual features, mediator and employee attitudes covered in that stream are discussed in an integrated fashion. This chapter starts by focussing on section one, the diversity enhancing stream. It presents the main research questions, the empirical findings, and major issues of multiculturalism and diversity enhancing features in the workplace are discussed in an integrated manner. Section two focusses on adverse conditions or diversity encumbering features at work and its role in employees' attitudes via a separation acculturation strategy as mediator. It presents the main research questions, the empirical findings, and major issues of diversity encumbering features in the workplace, as well as the mediating role of a separation acculturation strategy in the link between diversity encumbering features and employee attitudes, are then discussed in an integrated manner. Section three then follows with first stating the research objectives. This is followed by a discussion of a dual process for diversity. This results in the provision of a comprehensive definition of multiculturalism or diversity enhancing and encumbering features in the workplace as it stems from this body of work and the presentation of a conceptual model. Finally, this chapter concludes with implications, limitations and provides recommendations for future research. 160 Linking Expectations to Empirical Findings The first section of this thesis, covering the diversity enhancing stream, was aimed at Investigating the relationship between multiculturalism or diversity enhancing features of the workplace, ethnic integration and employee well-being and or attitudes (research question 1); Testing for invariance of a model of multiculturalism in the workplace for different demographic factors (race) using multigroup analysis (research question 2); Determining the mediating role of ethnic integration in the relationship between multiculturalism or diversity enhancing features of the workplace in employee adjustment (attitudes and well-being) (research question 3); Investigating demographic (race) differences in the experiences of multiculturalism or diversity enhancing features of the workplace, ethnic integration and employee attitudes (research question 4); In order to reach its objectives, the first section, entitled diversity enhancing features, integration and employee attitudes at work (The diversity enhancing stream in the conceptual model of diversity, in Chapter 1), investigated in chapter 2 the relationships between variables used in this study (research question 1) and the mediating role of integration in the relationship between multiculturalism and employee attitudes and well-being such as subjective experiences of work success and ill-health (research question 3). Chapter 2 looks for invariance of the proposed model for Black and White miners from the North West province in South Africa. In addition, Chapter 2 also investigated if demographic (gender and race) differences exist in the experiences of multiculturalism or diversity enhancing features of the workplace, ethnic integration and employee adjustment (attitudes and well-being) (research question 4). Findings of Chapter 2 suggest that positive relations could be observed between multiculturalism or diversity enhancing features (multicultural norms and practices and mainstream practices) of the workplace. Positive relations were also observed between ethnic integration variables (ethnic integration at work and home). Positive relations were also observed between diversity enhancing mainstream and ethnic features in the workplace on the one hand and subjective experiences of work success on the other hand. Insignificant relations were observed between diversity enhancing mainstream and ethnic features in the workplace on the one hand and ill-health (physical and psychological) on the other hand (research question 1). Section one was also aimed at testing for invariance of a model of multiculturalism in the workplace for different demographics (race) using multigroup analysis (research question 2). Chapter 2 tested a multicultural model that consists of three components namely antecedents (multiculturalism or diversity enhancing features such as multicultural norms and practices and mainstream practices in the workplace), mediator (a latent variable called ethnic integration that comprises of ethnic integration demands at work and at home - pressure at work and home from co-ethnics to maintain own culture but also to participate in the mainstream) and employee adjustment (called well-being that consist of subjective experiences of work success and physical and psychological ill-health). The tested model postulates that acculturation mainstream conditions influence well-being at work through ethnic integration. Results suggested that the 161 structural residuals model was the most restrictive model with an acceptable fit. In this model, the regression coefficients of the antecedent mainstream acculturation conditions and factor loadings on well-being at work, through ethnic integration and the latent variable as a mediating variable, were assumed to be invariant across both Black and White race groups (research question 2). So, an increase in positive mainstream multicultural norms, mainstream tolerance and multicultural practices was associated with increased ethnic integration demands at home and work. Stronger associations were observed between mainstream tolerance and integration compared to the associations between integration and multicultural practices and norms. Figure 1 (Chapter 1) also suggests an insignificant path from integration to well-being, whereas a significant path was observed from integration to (only) work success. This finding suggests that the perceived multicultural climate, practices and demands are unrelated to (un)well-being in this sample, but are related to work success. Employees who are more supportive of multiculturalism showed more (self-reported) subjective experiences of work success. Section one was also aimed at determining the mediating role of ethnic integration in the relationship between multiculturalism or diversity enhancing features of the workplace in and employee attitudes (research question 3). The results of Chapter 2 suggested that integration demands fully mediate the path from mainstream positive conditions to sociocultural adjustment and that multiculturalism (integration) matters for the experience of subjective work success. Lastly, section one investigated demographic (race) differences in the experiences of multiculturalism or diversity enhancing features of the workplace, ethnic integration and employee attitudes (research question 4). The results of Chapter 2 suggested that the multivariate effect of race was not significant. The only significant univariate effect was found for multicultural norms. Black miners experienced higher multicultural norms at work compared to White miners; yet, only negligible differences to small effect sizes were observed. Thus, even though Black miners tend to show somewhat higher scores on the antecedent and mediating variables, the effect sizes are small (research question 4). Moreover, given that all score means are well above the scale midpoints, our data suggest that the workforce of our study is well aware of the multicultural aspects of the workplace, and seems to acknowledge that their environment wants them to adapt to this diversity. Although the impact of social desirability cannot be ruled out, our data suggest that multiculturalism is relatively well supported by both groups and that the attitudes amongst employees are conducive for establishing and maintaining good intergroup relations in the workplace. The multicultural conditions experienced by these mine employees are favourable. Black miners seem to experience a slightly more favourable multicultural environment, although the differences are very small and are only significant for multicultural norms. The second section of this thesis, covering the diversity encumbering stream, was aimed at Investigating the relationship between adverse intercultural conditions or diversity encumbering features of the workplace, ethnic separation and employee (un)well-being and attitudes (research question 5); 162 Testing adverse intercultural conditions or diversity encumbering features of the workplace for different demographics (gender and race) using multigroup analysis (research question 6); Determining the mediating role of ethnic separation in the relationship between adverse intercultural conditions or diversity encumbering features of the workplace and employee attitudes (research question 7); and Investigating demographic (gender and race) differences in the experiences of adverse intercultural conditions or diversity encumbering features of the workplace, ethnic separation and employee attitudes (research question 8). In order to reach its objectives, the second section, deals with the diversity encumbering stream in the conceptual model of diversity, in Chapter 1). It investigated in two chapters (3 and 4) in two separate empirical studies with two different samples, the relationships between variables used in this study (research question 5). It also discusses the mediating role of separation in the relationship between adverse conditions of diversity and employee (un)well-being as measured by variables such as job satisfaction, organisational commitment and subjective experiences of work success and ill-health (research question 7). Using Multigroup Structural Equation Modelling, Chapter 4 tested the invariance of the proposed model for Black and White miners from the North West province in South Africa, while Chapter 4 investigated the invariance of a proposed diversity enhancing model for Blacks, Coloured, and Whites in a variety of organisations in South Africa (research question 6). In addition, Chapter 4 also investigated if demographic (gender and race) differences exist in the experiences of multiculturalism or diversity enhancing features of the workplace, ethnic integration and employee attitudes (research question 8). In Chapter 3 positive relations could be observed between adverse conditions of diversity (segregation demands, discrimination, and racism at work). Positive relations were also observed between separation variables (an individual separation acculturation strategy and ethnic separation demands at work). Positive relations were also observed between adverse conditions of diversity, separation variables and physical and psychological ill-health and subjective experiences of work success (research question 5). It is important to note that even when outcome variables were changed (subjective experiences of work success were replaced by intentions to quit), we were still able to observe the same relations between the variables in Chapter 4. However, the relations between variables were much stronger in the general sample (Chapter 4) than in the mine sample (Chapter 3) (research question 5). Section two was also aimed at testing the invariance of a model of adverse features of diversity in the workplace for different demographic factors (e.g., race) using multigroup analysis (research question 6). Chapter 3 tested an adverse diversity model that consisted of three components, namely antecedents that included segregation demands, discrimination and racism at work, a mediating latent variable called separation that contained an individual separation acculturation strategy and ethnic separation demands at work and employee adjustment latent variable called well-being that comprised of physical and psychological ill-health and intentions to quit. The results suggest that adverse mainstream acculturation conditions were associated 163 with well-being at work as measured with three indicators namely physical and psychological ill-health and work success through separation as the intervening variable in the same way for Blacks and Whites in a mine in North-West Province. Results from Chapter 4 suggest that mainstream acculturation conditions are associated with wellbeing at work as measured with three indicators, namely physical and psychological ill-health and intentions to quit through separation as the intervening variable in the same way across groups. Figure 1 (in Chapter 4) indicated that the paths from mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism to ethnic separation were significant, with mainstream segregation demands yielding the strongest association with ethnic separation compared to the other mainstream adverse conditions and ethnic separation. In addition, the path from ethnic separation to wellbeing at work was significant. This finding indicates that perceived mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism were related to wellbeing at work in this sample. Employees who experienced more perceived mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism at work reported less well-being at work. We can, therefore, conclude that perceived mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism were significant factors in wellbeing at work Section two was also aimed at determining the mediating role of ethnic separation in the relationship between adverse intercultural conditions or diversity encumbering features of the workplace and employee attitudes (research question 7). Results from Chapter 3 suggest that total and indirect effects were significant. Given the lack of significance of all direct effects of antecedent conditions on well-being or its components, we can conclude that the link of the antecedents with physical and psychological ill-health is fully mediated by separation demands. Segregation and subtle racism showed significant, indirect effects on both physical and psychological ill-health, but not on work success. So, adverse acculturation conditions (except for discrimination) such as mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism have therefore an indirect and significant influence on physical and psychological ill-health. In contrast, perceived work success was only significantly linked with separation and not with the antecedent factors. It can be concluded that separation demands fully mediate the path from mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism to psychological adjustment and that adverse acculturation conditions (except for discrimination) matters for the experience of subjective work success research question 7). Results from Chapter 4 suggested that total and indirect effects were observed for adverse diversity conditions at work on physical and psychological ill-health as well as intentions to quit. In addition, the lack of significance of all direct effects suggests that the link with physical and psychological ill-health as well as intentions to quit is fully mediated by ethnic separation. Mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism have, therefore, indirect and significant influence on psychological acculturation outcomes (physical and psychological ill-health as well as intentions to quit). It can be concluded that ethnic separation fully mediates the path from mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism to psychological acculturation outcomes and that mainstream segregation demands and subtle racism matter for the experience of wellbeing at work (research question 7). 164 Section two also aimed at investigating demographic (race) differences in the experiences of adverse intercultural conditions or diversity encumbering features of the workplace, ethnic separation and employee attitudes (research question 8). The findings in Chapter 3 seem to suggest that Blacks reported more subtle racism attitudes at work compared to Whites (research question 8), yet the effect size was small. The data suggest that the workforce of the study is well aware of negative acculturation conditions of the workplace and seems to acknowledge that their environment puts pressure on them to act in a certain fashion in relation to its diversity. Scores on discrimination at work are rather high compared to the scores on the other scales, which suggests that this is the most common adverse acculturation condition faced by these mine employees. The findings in Chapter 4 showed that segregation demands and discrimination at work, an individual separation acculturation strategy and physical ill-health at work were the only dependent variables that showed a significant race difference. Blacks reported higher segregation demands and discrimination experiences at work (conditions), an individual separation acculturation strategy and physical ill-health at work (outcomes) compared to Whites. However, the effect size of these differences was negligible to small (research question 8). The data suggest that the participants of this study are aware of negative acculturation conditions and outcomes of the workplace and seem to acknowledge that their environment puts pressure on them to act in a certain fashion in relation to its diversity. Scores on discrimination at work are rather high compared to the scores on the other scales, which indicates that this is the most common adverse acculturation condition faced by the employees included in the sample. Section three, focus on the dual-process model of diversity was aimed at Determining the invariance of the dual-process model of diversity for different demographic groups (race) (research question 9); Determining if an employee's avoidance coping style or separation orientation (fully or partially) mediates the relation between the negative antecedent conditions and psychological adjustment (research question 10); Determining if an employee's approach coping style or integration orientation (fully or partially) mediates the relation between positive antecedents and sociocultural adjustment, as measured by subjective experiences of work success and productivity (research question 11); and Investigating if minorities (based on relative power and status in the workplace in the private and public sector: blacks or whites) experience less conducive diversity conditions than Whites in the South African workplace (research question 12). The last section, describing a conceptual (dual process) of diversity in the workplace. It proposes, tests and confirms the conceptual dual-process model of diversity. In three separate chapters (5, 6 and 7) in four separate empirical studies with four different samples, and using Multigroup Structural Equation Modelling, the last section investigated the stability and invariance of a dual-process model of diversity for ethnic and gender groups. Chapter 5 proposes and tests a conceptual (dual process) model of diversity with a South African Police (SAPS) 165 officer sample using avoidance and approach coping styles as mediators in the diversity encumbering and enhancing paths of the conceptual model of diversity, respectively. Chapter 6 proposes and tests a conceptual (dual process) model of diversity using a public sector staff sample using separation and integration as mediators in the diversity encumbering and enhancing paths of a conceptual (dual process) model of diversity, respectively. Chapter 7 confirms the structure of a conceptual (dual process) model of diversity with two different samples [employees from various workplaces in South Africa in study 1 and miners from the North West province of South Africa in study 2] using separation and integration as mediators in the diversity encumbering and enhancing paths of the dual-process model respectively. In line with the recommendation of Bakker and Demerouti (2007), recent studies (Xanthopoulou, Bakker, Demerouti & Schaufeli, 2006, 2009a, 2009b) examined the role of personal resources (self-efficacy, organizational-based self-esteem and optimism) in predicting exhaustion and work engagement. Following this recommendation and trend, Chapter 6 postulated and tested a model in which a split was made between positive and negative antecedent conditions, two coping strategies (active coping as a positive coping strategy and avoidance coping as a negative coping strategy) and two types of outcomes (perceived work success as positive outcome and ill-health as negative outcome) (research question 9). More specifically, five positive acculturation antecedent conditions (the combination of the average scale scores of multicultural norms, mainstream tolerance, multicultural practices, ethnic vitality, social support) impact on subjective work success (socio-cultural adjustment), both directly and indirectly through active coping. Similarly, discrimination impacts on ill-health (psychological adjustment), both directly and indirectly through avoidance coping. The antecedent conditions were allowed to co-vary; no direct relations were allowed between the coping strategies. Finally, it was predicted that ill-health would predict work success (in line with a previous study amongst miners in South Africa) (Jackson & van de Vijver, 2018). The argument behind the latter association is that the absence of ill-health is a prerequisite for work success. The model presented in Chapter 5 was tested by fitting the empirical data to the hypothetical model by using various indices to assess the goodness of fit of the model. A very good fit for the proposed hypothetical model was obtained. Positive mainstream and ethnic acculturation conditions were associated with approach coping as the intervening variable, which in turn was related to subjective experiences of work success. Positive conditions (i.e. more positive mainstream multicultural norms, mainstream tolerance and multicultural practices, ethnic vitality and social support) were associated with an approach coping style at work and higher subjective experiences of work success. More discrimination and more physical and psychological ill-health symptoms were associated with an avoidance coping style. Finally, ill-health was negatively associated with subjective work success. The path from discrimination via avoidance coping to ill-health was significant, as did the path from positive conditions via approach coping to subjective work success. The proportion of variance explained in subjective work success was comparable to that of ill-health. The direct path from discrimination to ill-health was statistically 166 non-significant whilst the path from ill-health to work success was negative and bordered on significance. The proposed structure for a dual-process model of diversity was therefore confirmed in this study (research question 9). Section three also aimed at determining if an employee's avoidance coping style or (fully or partially) mediates the relation between the negative antecedent conditions and psychological adjustment (research question 10) and if an employee's approach coping style (fully or partially) mediates the relation between positive antecedents and sociocultural adjustment, as measured by subjective experiences of productivity (research question 11). The hypothesized model in Chapter 5 was a mediation model in which positive antecedent conditions and discrimination influence approach and avoidance coping styles, which in turn impact on work success and ill-health symptoms, respectively. A closer examination of the direct and indirect effects to evaluate their relative size was performed. In line with the conceptual model presented in Chapter 1 in Chapter 5, positive conditions had total, direct, and indirect effects on subjective experience on work success but not on ill-health symptoms. In addition, the significance of both the direct and indirect effects indicates that the link with subjective work success is partially mediated by approach coping. Positive-antecedent conditions have, therefore, a salient influence on the subjective experience of work success. Direct and indirect effects were all positive and reinforced each other, as expected in the dual-process model. It can be concluded that approach coping partially mediates the path from positive acculturation conditions to socio-cultural adjustment and that multiculturalism, ethnic vitality and social support are important for the experience of subjective work success but not for ill-health symptoms in the SAPS employees of this sample (research question 11). Discrimination had only significant total and indirect effects on ill-health symptoms. It can, therefore, be concluded that avoidance coping fully mediates the relationship between discrimination and ill-health symptoms and that discrimination and avoidance coping matter for ill-health symptoms for members in the SAPS of this sample (research question 10). Section three was also aimed at confirming the invariance of the dual-process model of diversity for different demographic groups (race and gender) (research question 9). Chapter 6 seeks to confirm the Dual Process Model of Diversity (Jackson & Van de Vijver, submitted; Jackson, Van de Vijver, & Molokoane, 2013), proposes positive and negative workplace diversity outcomes (subjective experiences of work success and ill-health, respectively), facilitating conditions for diversity in organizations (such as diversity-enhancing practices), and diversity-constraining conditions (such as discrimination, racism, and segregation) to influence occupational adjustment. An ideal workplace would combine the presence of facilitating conditions and the absence of inhibiting conditions. This chapter sought to replicate the results of previous studies (Jackson & Van de Vijver, 2018; Jackson, Van de Vijver, & Molokoane, 2013) that tested a structural model of diversity, linking diversity antecedents or conditions, mediators, and outcomes and test it in a state department in South Africa. Positive mainstream diversity norms, mainstream tolerance, and diversity practices, coupled with an individual integration orientation, showed the positive associations with subjective experiences at work across groups. 167 In contrast, mainstream segregation demands, discrimination and subtle racism, which made up the negative antecedent conditions, coupled with an individual separation orientation, were positively associated with physical and psychological ill-health symptoms (research question 9). Section three was also aimed at determining if an employee's separation orientation (fully or partially) mediates the relation between the negative antecedent conditions and psychological adjustment (research question 10) and if an employee's integration orientation (fully or partially) mediates the relation between positive antecedents and sociocultural adjustment, as measured by subjective experiences of productivity (research question 11). Findings from Chapter 6 seem to suggest that only the direct path coefficient within the encumbering stream was significant, implying the absence of any mediation. This means that diversity demands such as segregation, discrimination, and racism had a direct effect on ill-health. In addition, employee health was negatively affected if they experience these negative diversity demands even without having to endorse a separation strategy (research question 11). In contrast, for the positive stream the effects of the antecedent on the outcomes are both direct and indirect (research question 10). This means that experiences of positive diversity resources were not only linked to higher levels of perceived work success, but also to the endorsement of an integration strategy; so, both factors, separately and jointly, are positively linked to perceived work success. Section three was also aimed at investigating if minorities (based on relative power and status in the workplace in the private and public sector: women and blacks or whites) experience less conducive diversity conditions than the majority or dominant groups in the South African workplace (research question 12). Black employees tended to show somewhat higher scores on the positive antecedents (diversity resources), lower on the negative antecedents (diversity demands), lower on ill-health, and higher on perceived work success (research question 12). Chapter 7 seeks to confirm the structure of a conceptual (dual process) model of diversity with two different samples [employees from various workplaces in South Africa in study 1 and miners from the North West province of South Africa in study 2] using separation and integration as mediators in the diversity encumbering and enhancing paths of the dual-process model respectively. Findings of study 1 in Chapter 7 suggest that the structural weights model provided the most restrictive model with a good fit. The invariance of all path coefficients suggests that the antecedent conditions and acculturation orientations worked the same way for Blacks and Whites. The path coefficients within the encumbering stream were positive and significant (the latter for subtle racism only). The relation between diversity demands (antecedent) and negative work-related attitudes (outcome) was direct; the indirect effect (through separation orientation) was not significant. The elements of the facilitating stream showed the same pattern of positive, significant relations. The relation between resources (antecedent) and perceived productivity at work (outcome) was only indirect, yet significant (through integration orientation). The analysis confirmed the assumption of the Dual Process Model that there were only relations within a single layer and there were no crossover relations across layers. The correlation between negative and positive conditions was not significant. Negative work-related attitudes (outcomes) were a negative predictor of perceived productivity 168 at work. The findings provided support for the existence of two fairly independent streams of diversity experiences that link diversity conditions to outcomes where the crossover effects between the two streams are much weaker than the effects within each of the streams. The positive stream is related to how well employees perform (sociocultural outcomes), whereas the negative stream is related to how well the employees feel (psychological outcomes) (research question 9). Section three was also concerned with determining if an employee's separation orientation (fully or partially) mediates the relation between the negative antecedent conditions and psychological adjustment (research question 10) and if an employee's integration orientation (fully or partially) mediates the relation between positive antecedents and sociocultural adjustment, as measured by subjective experiences of productivity (research question 11). Findings suggest partial mediation for the positive but not the negative stream. This is confirmed in Table 3 in Chapter 7, which gives an overview of the significance of all indirect effects. No significant, indirect effects were strong. In addition, Section three also seeks to establish if minorities (based on relative power and status in the workplace in the private and public sector: blacks or whites) experience less conducive diversity conditions than Whites in the South African workplace (research question 12). There was a significant ethnic difference for all variables except for tolerance and racism. Compared to Blacks, Whites showed a stronger preference for a separation orientation, perceived their productivity levels to be higher, and were less likely to consider quitting and were more satisfied with their jobs. In contrast, Blacks showed a stronger preference for an integration orientation despite experiencing diversity more negatively, reporting more experiences of discrimination, and negative work-related attitudes coupled with lower subjective experiences of productivity. The average scores were below the midpoint of the scale for discrimination, subtle racism, and separation but above the midpoint for tolerance and an integration orientation. Therefore, the findings seem to suggest that the respondents were fairly supportive of diversity and they experienced a climate in which the negative diversity conditions are not strong (research question 12). Findings of study 2 in Chapter 7 suggest that the relation between diversity demands (antecedent) and ill-health (outcome) was both direct and indirect (through separation orientation). The elements of the facilitating stream showed the same pattern of positive, significant relations. So, more mainstream segregation demands, discrimination and subtle racism, which made up the negative antecedent conditions, coupled with an individual separation orientation, were positively associated with physical and psychological ill-health symptoms. Positive mainstream diversity norms, mainstream tolerance, and diversity practices, coupled with an individual integration orientation, were positively associated with ethnic integration demands at home and work. The analysis confirmed the assumption of the Dual Process Model that there are only relations within a single layer and not across layers. The correlation between negative and positive conditions was not significant. The analysis provided evidence that in line with the dual-process model of diversity, antecedent conditions, diversity orientations, and outcomes 169 were related in the expected way and the same relationships were found for Blacks and Whites. These data corroborated the first three hypotheses (research question 9, 10, and 11). Study 2 in Chapter 7 tested mediation effects of separation and integration. Two findings were striking in the mediation analysis. Firstly, all indirect effects are significant, which suggests that the effects of the antecedent effects on the outcomes are both direct and indirect. All direct effects in the positive and negative stream were significant. The significance of all direct and indirect effects suggests that the association within both the negative and positive stream comply with Baron and Kenny's (1986) requirements for partial mediation. Secondly, the indirect effects were much smaller than the direct effects. The weakest direct effect was stronger than the largest indirect effect (research question 10, and 11). Finally, study 2 in Chapter 7 also tested for group differences in the experiences of the diversity antecedents, mediators and outcomes. Even though Blacks tended to show somewhat higher scores on the antecedent and mediating variables, the effect sizes were small. Moreover, given that all score means were well above the scale midpoints, our data suggest that the workforce of our study was well aware of diversity aspects of the workplace and seemed to acknowledge that their environment wants them to adapt to this diversity. Scores on individual integration orientation, diversity practices and mainstream tolerance were rather high compared to the scores on the other scales, which points to their endorsement by these mine employees. Although the impact of social desirability cannot be ruled out, our data suggest that diversity is relatively well supported in both groups and that attitudes among employees are rather conducive for establishing and maintaining good intergroup relations in the workplace. Defining diversity management comprehensively: An integrative view This thesis argues that that there are two underlying processes that influence adjustment or wellness at work in a diverse setting, namely an effort-driven process (the encumbering or negative stream) in which excessive adverse mainstream conditions or diversity demands lead to poor psychological adjustment (negative employee attitudes and ill-health symptom) and a motivation-driven process (facilitating or positive stream) where the presence and experience of positive mainstream conditions or diversity resources lead to better sociocultural adjustments (increased actual or perceived productivity and work success). The distinction between the two streams bears resemblance to the discrimination-and-fairness and integration-and-learning perspectives on diversity described by Ely and Thomas (2001); in the literature on diversity in education the perspectives refer to avoiding discrimination, fostering equality and inclusion (sometimes called colour-blindness) versus acknowledging and promoting cultural pluralism (e.g., Hachfeld et al., 2011). The encumbering stream deals more with the legal framework (discrimination-and-fairness) and prerequisites of diversity outcomes, whereas the facilitating stream deals more with integration-and-learning, focusing on interactions between group members in which diversity is viewed as a resource. The four studies conducted in three different manuscripts support the basic structure of the model according to which diversity is a two-pronged system, with each subsystem having their own contingencies. The dual-process model 170 was therefore confirmed in different organizational context, even if we replaced work-related with personal psychological indicators of adjustment such as ill-health. The direction and strength of the relations between the different elements of the dual-process model were rather similar than in all four the dual-process models for diversity studies included in this thesis. In addition, it was also shown in the third section of this thesis that the basic structure of the model holds for both race groups. It is also worth mentioning that the support for the mediation was considerably good; yet, the significance of the (in)direct links was not consistently supported. Direct effects could not be confirmed in the negative stream in study 1 of the dual-process models (the link between discrimination and ill-health) and in the positive stream in study 3 (the link between tolerance and subjective productivity, a sociocultural outcome). Although direct effects could be confirmed, indirect effects could not be confirmed either in the negative stream of study 2 of the dual-process models (the link between discrimination and ill-health via an individual separation strategy). This was due to the insignificant path between an individual separation strategy and ill-health. The inconsistencies could be due to different sample sizes used in the four different studies, the use of single constructs versus latent variable that was formed by two or more measured variable as antecedents, the use of different psychological acculturation outcomes (ill-health symptoms versus negative employee attitudes in different studies, in the negative streams of the various dual-process studies. Inconsistencies could also be due to different sample compositions regarding ethnicity majorities (Blacks formed more than two thirds of the sample in study 1, 2 and 4, while Blacks and whites were nearly equally represented in study 4) even different sectors of the economy and society (mainly public sector employees in the study 1 and 2, mainly private-sector employees from a mine in study 4 and a mixture of public and private sector employees in study 3). Irrespective of the inconsistencies mentioned it should in addition be noted that indirect effects (proving mediation) were confirmed in both streams in all four of the studies confirming the dual-process model except for the case mentioned in the negative stream of study 2. This model acknowledges that psychological (how you feel in the new) and sociocultural (how you perform in the new) outcomes or adjustment have different origins. It is known from the literature that there are relations between integration and separation and also between psychological and sociocultural outcomes (e.g., Berry, 1997; Ward et al., 2001). In this dual-process models of diversity studies (Jackson & Van de Vijver, 2018; submitted; Jackson et al., 2013) mediation models were proposed following the reasoning of the interactional model of cultural diversity (Cox, 1993) as well as the acculturation literature (Arends-T\u00f3th & Van de Vijver, 2006) in which there are antecedent, mediating, and outcome variables. Diversity conditions (setting) in the work context are viewed as an acculturation issue and therefore investigate the mediating role of acculturation orientations in the relation between acculturation conditions and outcomes in the two independent streams. As was the case of Chapter 6 and 7 (Jackson & van de Vijver, 2018; submitted), the mediation analysis suggested that separation and integration partially mediate the relation between diversity demands and health and diversity 171 resources and subjective experience of work success, respectively. A weak relation between separation and ill-health was obtained in the study presented in Chapter 6 (Jackson & van de Vijver, 2018) compared to the relation observed between separation and health in the other study presented in Chapter 8 (Jackson & van de Vijver, submitted). Various studies have demonstrated the link between discrimination, racism, separatism and negative psychological outcomes (Ait Ouarasse, 2004; et al., 2009). Therefore, in the dual-process model, diversity demands are related to an individual separation orientation. Separation is pointing to a refusal to accept the plural composition of the organization and focus on employees of one's own ethnicity. An individual separation orientation mediates the relationship between these negative acculturation/diversity antecedents, conditions or demands and negative employee attitudes and ill-health. In the positive stream, there are diversity resources or facilitating intergroup features, such as a climate supportive of diversity/acculturation and tolerance of all employees for ethnic diversity/difference of the organization. These resources, compared to the demands are taken to be related to an individual integration orientation, which mediates the relation between positive diversity conditions or setting, tolerance (in study 1 and 2), diversity or multicultural norms and practices (only in study 2), and subjective experiences of work success. Furthermore, its argued, in line with assumptions and findings of other dual-process models (e.g., Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004) that \"crossover relations\" between the positive and negative stream in the diversity model are much weaker (if present at all) than the relations within each of the streams and that there are no direct crossover relations to layers (columns) that come later in the model; for example, there should be no direct relation from a negative antecedent to a positive outcome. Crossover relations can only occur within antecedents, mediators, or outcomes; for example, positive and negative antecedents may be correlated, and positive antecedents will be linked to positive mediators but can only be indirectly linked to negative mediators. The notion that facilitating intergroup contact features or positive diversity conditions or resources influence sociocultural adjustment (productivity and subjective experiences of work success in the context of this thesis) directly but psychological adjustment (ill-health) only indirectly (if at all) is at the core of this model; analogously, the presence of restraining intergroup contact features or negative diversity conditions leads to negative acculturation orientations and poor psychological adjustment, which in turn can diminish or erode the credits of sociocultural adjustment accrued as a result of the presence of facilitating features. However, unlike in the dual-process models for diversity presented in Chapter 5 and 7 (Jackson & Van de Vijver, 2018; Jackson et al., 2013), the analyses confirmed that the crossover relations between the encumbering and facilitating streams were much weaker (but still significant) than the relations within each of the streams for Black and White workers in a South African state department in Chapter 6. In addition, the crossover relations between the encumbering stream and the facilitating stream were lower for the African group compared to the White group, and relations between diversity resources as well as diversity demands and 172 employee outcomes were also higher for the African group compared to the White group. We can, therefore, conclude that the dual mediating model is well supported in all four studies, despite minor differences. This thesis was also interested in race group differences in the experience of mainstream antecedent conditions, an individual separation and integration orientation, and well-being, as measured by physical and psychological ill-health symptoms, and subjective experiences of work success. Our findings seem to suggest that even though Black respondents tended to show somewhat higher scores on diversity resources, lower on diversity demands and better on outcomes variables, the differences were practically speaking small to medium. Moreover, given that all the diversity demands score means were well below the scale midpoints and all the diversity resources score means were well above the scale midpoints, the data suggest that the workforce of our study was well aware of diversity aspects of the workplace, expected it, and it also seemed to indicate that their environment does match their expectation. Scores in general, are higher on individual integration orientation (lower than scores on individual separation orientation), and diversity practices and were rather lower on segregation demands and separation orientations compared to the scores on the other negative stream scales, which points to their general positive diversity experiences by public sector employees. The relative lower scores on subtle racism and the higher scores on the individual integration orientation (compared to the individual separation orientation) given South African race relations history is encouraging. We could argue that higher scores on integration compared to separation might be the result of persistent positive interpersonal experiences (Contact hypothesis: Allport, 1954; Park & Judd, 2005; Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006), during racial interaction (resulting from improving racial interactions). So, we see that as a result of recent legislative changes such as the Employment Equity Act (RSA, 1998) and the use of affirmative action policies that favour non-whites in both private and especially public institutions (Jackson et al., 2011; Jackson, Van de Vijver, & Laurie, 2018), Black groups are starting to experience the South African diverse workplace more positive than White groups in the public sector, compared to the private sector experiences, where white domination status quo still prevail according to the Employment Equity Report of the Department of Labour (2016). Results from the public sector samples seem to contradict the popular public discourse that racism and discrimination are rife in South Africa. Unfortunately, this sentiment cannot be shared when it comes to the private sector where the status quo pre-1994 seems to persist. Theoretical implications The dual-process model of diversity draws on relevant diversity models mentioned below and on two theoretical frameworks: acculturation models, as studied in cross-cultural psychology (Arends-T\u00f3th & Van de Vijver, 2006; Berry, 1997), and a dual-process model of occupational health (Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004). This model facilitates a multidisciplinary approach to tackling societal issues. By doing this, the model extended the contextual scope of acculturation research. Acculturation research traditionally focussed factors affecting migrant adaptation in the 173 new normally Western society of settlement on a macro- and micro- (individual functioning) level. Through this study, the applicability acculturation research was extended to non-migrant samples in a non-Western meso (workplace) level. Acculturation studies traditionally focus on diversity that originates from differences between the features of the new society of settlement and the features of the migrant background. The diversity that is addressed in this thesis considered the differences as a result of a monocultural home environment (and we now know that South Africans hardly make contact with people from other backgrounds in their private space) versus a multicultural workplace that necessitates intercultural contact. In addition, dual-process models are popular in psychology; examples can be found in the domain of work-related health (e.g., Demerouti et al., 2001) emotion and motivation (Caccioppo & Berntson, 1994; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). We postulated the co-existence of two rather independent systems of diversity aspects in organizations. Therefore, the use of the dual-process model as a framework to shed light on diversity management is a theoretically novel approach. Extant models [e.g., Social Identity Salience Theory (Garcia-Prieto et al., 2003), Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1986), Categorization-Elaboration Model (Van Knippenberg, De Dreu, & Homan, 2004), the Contact Hypothesis (e.g., Pettigrew, Tropp, Wagner, & Christ, 2011), the Theory of Social Attraction (Newcomb, 1968)] often deal with the relative (in)effectiveness of heterogeneous (as compared to homogeneous) organizations; the dual-process model starts from a different premise. In a globalizing world in which the number of cross-cultural or diverse organizations is steadily increasing, the question of relative efficiency due to diverse workforce composition is less important from a societal perspective than the question of how we can deal with diversity. Therefore, the focus on positive and negative diversity conditions and the psychological consequences of diversity conditions, which include wellness and health, alongside perceived effectiveness. This model, therefore, emphasizes the conditions under which people from diverse backgrounds meet and interact in the workplace (where they are forced to meet and interact) and the psychological consequences of such conditions. The focus on diversity conditions and psychological and sociocultural outcomes represents another theoretical contribution. The findings of this thesis suggest that the acculturation theories used specifically in the Western world to understand the issues affecting adjustment of immigrants in foreign countries can be utilized as a framework to understand diversity in the workplace in South Africa. It is therefore argued that our main contribution in the present study is that we demonstrate how the management of diversity (organisation psychology) can be viewed in a model that draws on organizational science (the equity and diversity perspective described by Ely and Thomas, 2001), and applies these ideas in a dual-process model for diversity, drawn from the occupational health literature and from acculturation frameworks and models, as studied in cross-cultural psychology (Arends-T\u00f3th & Van de Vijver, 2006; Berry, 1997) (typically used to describe immigrant adjustment). This approach makes the equity and diversity framework open for empirical scrutiny, thereby enabling further examination of the diversity-efficiency loop. The classical hypotheses that job demands predict job strain and that job resources predict motivation 174 represent conventional pathways, and they have been confirmed by several studies (e.g. Dormann & Zapf, 2002; Wong, Hui & Law, 1998) forms the basis for the structure of the Dual Process Model of diversity and was also confirmed in four different settings. The fact that the structure of the model holds for different ethnic groups in four different settings and industries and sectors (private and public) suggests that the structure of the model would also hold in other societies. In addition, the suggested relationships between the elements of the model (antecedents, mediators and outcomes) selected were also confirmed in previous diversity and acculturation studies (e.g. Ait Ouarasse (2004), Ayalon and Gum (2011), Dovidio and Gaertner (2000, Gee, Ro, Shariff-Marco and Chae (2009), and Moomal et al. (2009) have demonstrated the link between discrimination, racism, separatism and negative psychological outcomes). In addition, all these studies in this thesis were conducted in the workplace of a recently established society (Rainbow nation: post-1994) that consist of different ethnic groups that hold different positions of dominance pre and post establishment further suggest that the structure of the model would also hold in other societies. Although the applicability of the model in other societies is only suggested here, it is therefore strongly suggested that this fact be confirmed in future studies. Practical implications The findings of this thesis have implications for the management of diversity. Our findings suggest that South African employees view diversity initiatives seriously and expect the visibility of such efforts in organizations. By implication, employers should invest in initiatives for promoting diversity, especially race and ethnic diversity, in order for employees to feel that their organization is committed to diversity. Diversity investment will not only be useful for improving positive employee attitudes and behaviours towards the organization but also for employee performance. Organizations should convey the intent of diversity initiatives to embrace all employees, to demonstrate fairness and equity, and mitigate potential negative perceptions on the part of employees (Kundu & Mor, 2017). The results further suggest that organizations should continue making systematic and continuous efforts to communicate diversity goals to employees (Soni, 2000) to ensure the positive receptivity of employees to diversity and diversity management. Diversity efforts can only be sustained through the establishment of a dedicated diversity management section either within the Human Resource department or as a stand-alone strategic section with a diversity director under the direct supervision of the CEO. The Dual Process Model further suggests that the effects of demographic diversity are dependent on leadership, culture and climate, and organizational strategy, with external strategy and an innovative culture being associated with success in leveraging diversity for financial advantage (Gilbert & Ivancevich, 2000). Providing a supportive organizational context is essential to success. Merely changing workforce demographics without properly designed organizational development interventions may produce more harm than good (Kossek, Markel, & McHugh, 2003). In addition, organizations need effective team processes to make diversity 175 policies and practices successful (Ely, 2004). Pro-diversity practices are those for fostering equality and inclusion to encourage contact, cooperation, and common goals between members of diverse groups, and equal treatment of all groups. In as much as we see improved race interaction experiences for the majority workers in especially the public sector, we still notice the indirect, eroding effect of diversity demands such as segregation, discrimination and racism on the benefits accrued as a result of the presence of diversity resources (negative effect on work success). This observation suggests that management will need to focus on both the encouragement of diversity resources such as multicultural norms and practices and tolerance as well as an integration strategy as well as the discouragement of diversity demands. The Dual Process Model, therefore, suggests that interventions should ideally have two components. Firstly, interventions should address conditions that impede diversity, such as discrimination and segregation. Mitigating these encumbering conditions can ensure that employees are less likely to drop out because of ill-health. Secondly, addressing adverse conditions is not enough; positive work success requires a set of diversity-conducive conditions, such as support for diversity. These two components can and should be independently addressed. A successful intervention should reduce stumbling blocks and facilitate enabling conditions. Diversity audits should, therefore, address both components. This means in practice, organizing events at work, such as diversity days, where employees can learn more about other cultural, norms, values, traditions and conventions. This also entails that management deals decisively with those who make derogative comments about others or their cultures through disciplinary processes and publicize the event in internal communique so that all know that respect for fellow human are important. Valuing pluralism goes beyond the prevention of negative consequences of cultural diversity in seeing it as an asset (Schachner, Noack, Van de Vijver, & Eckstein, 2016). It can mean not only learning about topics related to cultural pluralism but also creating a climate that welcomes and appreciates cultural diversity. This could include learning about the history and current situation of different groups in society, learning about culture and traditions of others, and learning about intercultural relations during diversity workshops and diversity days. When cultural diversity is valued, those belonging to an ethnic minority may also perceive a greater interest in their cultural background by others (Schachner et al., 2016). Additionally, we recommend that organisations make use of cross-cultural training as intervention, which aims to develop the awareness, knowledge, and skills needed to interact appropriately and effectively with culturally diverse customers and co-workers, which is an important element in the development of cultural competence (Bean, 2006). Cultivating an all-inclusive, diverse workplace also requires organizations to implement changes at the structural level (Kalev, Dobbin, & Kelly 2006), such as the creation of a unit responsible for monitoring diversity efforts at work. Fostering both minority and nonminority leadership and involvement in diversity initiatives is fundamental to an all-inclusive approach in the South African context. The strong link between race, hierarchical position and salary in South African institutions (strongly 176 favouring Whites) makes it difficult to perceive institutions as inclusive for employees. Mentoring and social networking initiatives can practice all-inclusion by including cross-race groupings (Ragins, 1997) because the by-products of such efforts include not only career development benefits for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s (employees with fewer skills and experiences) but also increased intercultural competence. Limitations and recommendations Limitations of the study include the fact that the study was conducted among South African convenience samples of office-based employees of one state department, mine employees, and a general employee sample based on networks from different organisations, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Firstly, recruiting samples from various other state departments in the public sectors as well as various organizations from various sectors in the private sector and not for profit organizations are recommended for the replication of these studies. In the light of recent xenophobic attacks on foreigners, future research could consider the experience of Indians as well as various immigrant groups. Secondly, generalizability of the model to workplaces elsewhere in the world should be addressed. The constellation of South Africa with its history of apartheid may not generalize well to other countries. On the other hand, we found the model to hold across very different samples and race groups, which suggests that the dynamics of diversity context experiences are rather similar across race groups. This implies that the model could well apply in other cultural contexts. Empirical tests should be conducted to examine this claim. In addition, the primary data for the study were collected using a self-report questionnaire, making it possible that common- method variance inflated the relationships between variables (Podsakoff et al., 2003). To constrain the occurrence of common-method bias, future empirical studies in this area should collect data using multiple methods (e.g., interviews, surveys, peer reports, etc.). A further limitation of the study was the cross-sectional measurement. It was not possible to test the causal relationships proposed in the theoretical framework, and longitudinal assessment would provide further validation of specific relationships. Future studies should consider longitudinal designs, using mixed methods and according to Adkoli (2017, p. 38) multiple methods, tools and techniques, such as Grounded Theory (to develop a theoretical model based on actual ground realities), phenomenology (to understand a phenomenon from participants' perception), ethnography (to gain insights of the organization culture), case study (to develop in-depth understanding of a case) and narratives (to capture long personal experience). It is advised that researchers interact with the participant in a 'naturalistic setting' as opposed to an artificial 'lab setting' and helps in describing and exploring an issue to 'contextualization' rather than 'generalization'. A method of 'triangulation' should be used for validating the results. This will facilitate the use of the correct context-specific interventions. The classical hypotheses that job demands predict job strain and that job resources predict motivation represent conventional pathways, and they have been confirmed by 177 several studies (e.g., De Jonge, Dormann, 2002; Wong, Hui & Law, 1998). But is it also conceivable that employee well-being has an impact on job demands and job resources? In their review, Zapf, Dormann and Frese (1996) identified six out of 16 longitudinal studies, which evidenced reversed causal relationships between working conditions and job stress. Taken together, these findings suggest that job stress and motivation can both be outcomes as well as predictors of job demands and resources, such that higher stress and impaired motivation result in less favourable working conditions over time. A possible explanation for such reversed causal effects could be that employees who experience job stress or disengagement may, because of their own behaviour, create additional demands and fewer resources (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007). From a diversity management perspective, it will therefore be theoretical insightful to explore reversed causal effects such as the role of intentions to quit (or job satisfaction) in perceptions of discrimination (multiculturalism) through an increased sense of separation [or integration (or low or high self-esteem - see argument on personal resources below)]. An important extension of the JD-R model is the inclusion of personal resources in the model. In line with the recommendation of Bakker and Demerouti (2007), recent studies (Xanthopoulou, Bakker, Demerouti, & Schaufeli, 2006, 2009a, 2009b) examined the role of three personal resources (self-efficacy, organizational-based self-esteem and optimism) in predicting exhaustion and work engagement. Lazarus and Folkman (1984) argued that people suffer from stress when they believe they lack the resources to deal with difficult events. They also noted the complex interaction between individuals and their environment and emphasized the role of cognitive processes and individual characteristics (such as appraisal and coping) that may affect the outcome of potentially stressful events. It is important to note that the role of coping strategies was already confirmed in Chapter 6. It is therefore also suggested that future dual-process model of diversity studies explore the mediating role of personal resources used by Xanthopoulou et al. (2006; 2009a; 2009b) as well as psychological capital such as locus of control, hope, resilience and gratitude as these are all relevant issues for better intercultural relations. Most studies on the JD-R model have relied exclusively on self-report measures (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007). Future research should further illuminate to what extent objective business indicators (e.g., work performance, customer satisfaction, sickness absenteeism, sales) are predicted by the dual-process model for diversity. It would also be interesting to examine whether the proposed combinations of job demands and resources can predict objective health outcomes, e.g. cardiovascular risks. Concluding remarks The findings of these studies contribute to the growing literature on acculturation in South Africa in relation to how South Africans cope with the new evolving national identity, the Rainbow Nation. However, this thesis extends national surveys that look at race perceptions of changes in the new South Africa in that it combines the influence of both mainstream and ethnic 178 perception in predictions of well-being in the workplace of the New South Africa. Contrary to public perception and discourse, the results indicated that mainstream conditions impact in the same way on well-being at work for both Blacks and Whites and that these groups also do not differ that much in their experiences of these acculturation conditions and outcomes in these samples. In addition, it is also now known that the negative stream could erode the benefits that accrued through the existence of the positive stream. We suggest that managers should keep an eye on both diversity demands and resources. Unlike initial assumptions, it can now also be confirmed that cross-over relations between streams compared to relations within a single stream, which are stronger, are possible in the dual process model for diversity although the associations tend to be weaker even if these are significant. We also now know that the job demands and resources model as well as acculturations, commonly studied in cross-cultural psychology are two useful frameworks for understanding diversity in the workplace.

Summary Since the abolishment of apartheid, the legal basis of this segregation and discrimination, in 1994, several legislative frameworks were put in place to reduce discrimination in South Africa in general, but more specifically in the workplace. These developments have resulted in increments in intercultural contacts in the workplace. All of these initiatives have ultimately led to an increase in diversity in the 'New South African' workplace, but it, unfortunately, did not prevent discrimination in the workplace. The diversity that is addressed here results from the difference between the usually monocultural home environment and the multicultural workplace. This way of dealing with diversity has been extensively studied in the acculturation literature (e.g., Berry, 1997). Graves (1967) indicated that acculturation is a term used to describe the process of bidirectional change that takes place when two ethnocultural groups come into sustained contact with each other. This definition of acculturation implies that dominant and non-dominant cultural groups are influenced and transformed by their intercultural contacts and are expected to modify some aspects of their respective culture as a means of adaptation to ethnocultural diversity. Acculturation refers to the process of changes as a consequence of continuous first-hand contact between individuals from different cultures (Redfield, Linton, & Herskovits 1936). A central assumption of this thesis is that diversity in the South African workplace, the object of study of this thesis, can be viewed as an acculturation phenomenon. People (mainstreamers and ethnics or migrants) getting into contact with a different cultural background on a frequent basis in the workplace (the dominant culture of the workplace, which is often based on the White business culture in South Africa) are confronted with two decisions to make, namely maintenance of their home (or ethnic) culture in the workplace and participation in the dominant workplace culture. The two independent dimensions (decisions) yield four possibilities when considered in conjunction; these are referred to as acculturation orientations (also labelled styles and strategies). Individuals are called multicultural (mainstreamers) or integrated (ethnics) when they adhere to both cultures, melting pot (mainstreamers) or assimilated (ethnic) when they adhere to the business culture only, segregated (mainstreamers) or separated (ethnic) when they adhere to their own ethnic culture only, and exclusion (mainstreamers) or marginalized (ethnic) when they adhere to neither. Based on this literature and in line with the interactional model of cultural diversity (Cox, 1993), this thesis distinguishes between acculturation conditions, individual orientations, and outcomes that are relevant for diversity (Arends-T\u00f3th & Van de Vijver, 2006). This thesis contains six empirical chapters (Chapter 2-7) presented in three sections, namely (1) diversity enhancing features, integration and employee attitudes at work, (2) diversity encumbering features, separation and employee attitudes at work, and (3) a conceptual (dual process) of diversity in the workplace: proposal, test and confirmation. It is the aim of this thesis to make sense of the complexity of diversity management through the lenses of enhancing and encumbering acculturation antecedents, mediators and outcomes. Each section contains research questions that relate to this objective. These are presented in the empirical chapters that address hypotheses related to these questions and are related to the conceptual model (Chapter 1). The first section, heading diversity enhancing features, integration and employee attitudes at work (The diversity enhancing stream in the conceptual model of diversity, Chapter 1), investigate in chapters 2 the mediating role of integration in the relationship between multiculturalism and employee attitudes such as job satisfaction, organisational commitment and subjective experiences of work success and ill-health. Using Multigroup Structural Equation Modelling, Chapter 2 looks for invariance of the proposed model for Black and White miners from the North West province in South Africa. Main findings of Chapter 2 suggest that Multiculturalism and mainstream tolerance coupled with ethnic integration demands at home and work were associated with success at work but not with ill-health. Black employees experienced the workplace slightly more positively. Practical and managerial implications of Chapter 2 points to the fact that multiculturalism and integration are related to subjective experiences of work success and, as such, should be supported in the workplace. The main contribution to the field of diversity from Chapter 2 is that multiculturalism is relatively well supported by both groups in the workplace. This positive finding should not be regarded as obvious because empirical research has suggested that the majority of members of the host culture do not always favour multiculturalism. The main contribution to the field of diversity from Chapter 2 is that from a conceptual perspective, the model implies that the more distal variable of a multicultural climate influences employee attitudes through a set of more proximal integration attitudes and practices. From a practical perspective, an inclusive climate has more distal characteristics such as the general multiculturalism climate and more proximal characteristics such as ethnic vitality. The second section focus on diversity encumbering features, separation and employee attitudes at work (The diversity encumbering stream in a conceptual (dual process) of diversity, Chapter 1). It investigates in two chapters (3 and 4) in two separate empirical studies with two different samples, the mediating role of separation in the relationship between discrimination, racism and segregation on the one hand, and employee attitudes and well-being using indicators such as intentions to quit and subjective experiences of work success and ill-health on the other hand. Using Multigroup Structural Equation Modelling, Chapter 3 addresses the invariance of the proposed diversity encumbering model for Black and White miners from the North West province in South Africa, while Chapter 4 investigates invariance of the proposed model for Blacks and Whites in a variety of organisations in South Africa. Main findings of Chapter 3 suggest that mainstream segregation demands, discrimination, subtle racism and separation were strongly related to ill-health symptoms, but not to work success. In addition, these relationships were identical for Blacks and Whites. Separation fully mediated the relation between segregation and subtle racism and ill-health. Adverse conditions matter for ill-health and well-being and therefore warrant the attention of supervisors in the workplace. The results of Chapter 4 indicated that racism, discrimination, segregation and separation, ill-health and intentions to quit were positively related. The hypothesized model was confirmed in a structural equation modelling analysis. This meant that more mainstream segregation demands, discrimination, and subtle racism, coupled with a dominant ethnic separation acculturation strategy and co-ethnics demanding that their members keep to themselves at work (with limited or no intercultural contact), were associated with the experiences of higher physical and psychological ill-health, and frequent thoughts of intentions to quit. In addition, mainstream segregation demands, compared to subtle racism and discrimination, were much more strongly associated with ethnic preference to separate. Blacks reported higher segregation demands and discrimination experiences at work (conditions), an individual separation acculturation strategy and physical ill-health at work (outcomes) compared to Whites, although the effects were relatively small. In addition, the findings of Chapter 3 and 4 extend the psychological knowledge by incorporating cross-cultural and social-psychological theories into a framework for explaining the dynamics involved in the relationship between segregation, racism, discrimination, separation and well-being of the workplace. The findings of the study contribute to the growing literature on acculturation in South Africa in relation to how South Africans cope with the separatism, discrimination and racism at work. This study also extends national surveys that look at race perceptions on changes in the new South Africa in the sense that it combines the influence of both mainstream and ethnic perception in predicting specifying paths to possible well-being of Black and White miners in the workplace of post-Apartheid South Africa. These findings are important to facilitate better future race relations in a very fragile and young democracy. The last section, entitled a conceptual (dual process) of diversity in the workplace: proposal, test and confirmation (The conceptual (dual-process model) of diversity, Figure 1), investigates in three separate chapters (5, 6 and 7) in four separate empirical studies with four different samples, and using Multigroup Structural Equation Modelling, the stability and invariance of a dual-process model for ethnic and gender groups. Chapter 5 proposes and tests a conceptual (dual process) model of diversity with a South African Police (SAPS) officer sample using avoidance and approach coping styles as mediators in the diversity encumbering and enhancing paths of the conceptual model of diversity, respectively. Chapter 6 proposes and tests a conceptual (dual process) model of diversity using a South African Police (SAPS) office-based staff sample using separation and integration as mediators in the diversity encumbering and enhancing paths of a conceptual (dual process) model of diversity, respectively. Chapter 7 confirms the structure of a conceptual (dual process) model of diversity with two different sample [Employees from various workplaces in South Africa in study 1and Miners from the North West province of South Africa in study 2] using separation and integration as mediators in the diversity encumbering and enhancing paths of the dual process model respectively. The final chapter (Chapter 9) presents a general discussion where the findings of the empirical studies are summarized and implications and recommendations for future research are discussed. The main findings of Chapter 5 suggest that a very good fit was obtained for the proposed hypothetical model (A dual-process model of diversity). Approach coping partially mediated the relation between positive acculturation conditions and subjective experience of work success whereas avoidance coping fully mediated the relation between discrimination and ill-health symptoms are related to ill-health symptoms. Practical and managerial implications of Chapter 5 suggest that mainstream facilitating conditions and discrimination influence individual coping styles which in turn impact on ill-health and the subjective experiences of work success. In addition, ill-health also impacts negatively on work success experiences among the sampled SAPS members. It, therefore, would make sense for the SAPS to sanction discrimination. The main contribution to the field of diversity from Chapter 5 is that we developed, tested and found support for a variation of the mediated dual-process model for diversity (Jackson & Van de Vijver, submitted), using coping strategies as mediators. The model adds to our insight into diversity in organisations. Chapter 6 was set out to validate the structure of the Dual Process Model of Workplace Diversity in a South African work setting contrasting Black and White African employees. Using multigroup path analysis, we found race-based invariance of the Dual Process Model, with Black employees self-reporting diversity relations more favourably way compared to White employees. We conclude that the Dual Process Model is supported and for research use in the South African workplaces. Chapter 7 was intended to replicate and extend the results of a previous study that tested a Dual Process Model of Diversity in two new, multicultural samples. In addition, we wanted to test if the model holds (is invariant) for both Black and White employees. Using multigroup path analysis, invariant and predicted relations were found for Blacks and Whites. Whites experienced mainstream acculturation conditions in a slightly more favourable way, whereas Blacks showed a higher preference for an integration diversity orientation despite experiencing diversity conditions slightly more negatively. The Dual Process Model suggests that diversity interventions should ideally have two components. Firstly, interventions should address conditions that impede diversity, such as discrimination, to ensure that employees are less likely to drop out because of ill-health. Secondly, addressing adverse conditions is not enough; positive work success requires a set of diversity-conducive conditions, such as support for diversity. These two components can and should be independently addressed. Our findings suggest that the acculturation theories used specifically in the Western world to understand the issues affecting immigrant's adjustment in foreign countries and the Dual Process Model (from IO psychology) can be integrated into a framework to understand diversity in the workplace in South Africa.
