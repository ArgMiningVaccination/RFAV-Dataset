The human biofield is an energy field which extends in all directions around the body. Energy healing is intentional therapy done within this energy field. \"Energy Healing\" can refer to many different modalities. In every method, trained practitioners consciously influence the human energy system, including the chakras (or energy centers) and the biofield (which includes the auras). Energy healing is non-invasive and often no-touch. Certain methods employ the hands (or other tools such as crystals or tuning forks) to clear, energize, and balance the recipient's energy fields, thus affecting physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health. In the broadest sense, the goal of energy healing is to restore balance and harmony, placing the client in the optimal position to self heal. Energy healing is considered a complementary and alternative therapy which can be integrated with traditional medicine and therapies. Increasingly, energy healing modalities (like Reiki and Healing Touch) are being used in hospitals and offered in healthcare settings across the United States. How Does Energy Healing Work? Many theoretical frameworks exist to explain how energy medicine works. This literature is primarily based upon quantum physics and the quantum nature of the body at a subatomic level. However, while the exact mechanisms haven't been definitively isolated at this time, numerous studies of energy healing,intentional vibration-based medicine, and higher consciousness strongly support that \"something is happening,\" with recipients demonstrating changes and benefits even when energy healing techniques are applied from a distance. Energy healing approaches focus on dispelling congested energy and restoring integrated free energy flow by opening, connecting, and balancing the entire human energy system. Clearing imbalances and disturbances allows integration of the body, mind and soul to restore health and promote healing. Energy healing can resolve energy field disturbances which could later result in physical manifestations of illness if left imbalanced. While scientific evidence supports the premise that energy healing is effective, an actual experience is worth a thousand words. Most clients say they feel \"lighter,\" \"unburdened,\" \"refreshed,\" and \"calm.\" Many report the lessening of anxiety, grief, and depression, a clearer sense of self, or clarity about what they need or want. Receiving an energy healing treatment at our spa can do more to convey this experience than a written description. We invite you to explore what energy healing can bring to your life through working with one of our trusted and compassionate providers. How Is Energy Healing Done? Energy healing can be done for your small group utilizing therapeutic discourse, intentional meditation, movement, and sound. Please contact us to discuss your needs and we'll team with you to assist your small group's healing process or growth work. Individual energy healing may be done in person or remotely. It starts with a discussion so that you can express what you're troubled by or want to accomplish with the work. Most often clients come to a session with ideas about what they need to work on. Each practitioner will utilize their specific training and modalities to support the client's process and healing, remaining open to any other needs that might pop up asking for help during the session. Every session will be complete in its own right, providing exactly what you're ready for at the time. In-person sessions will take place in a private room as you recline fully clothed on a comfortable treatment table. With your permission, the practitioner will assess your energy system using either off body touch or dowsing within the energy field (near body but no direct contact) or a gentle (still) touch over various areas of the body. Continuing within the biofield or gently on the body, the practitioner will proceed to clear and balance your energy system. Energy healing facilitates a deep sense of calm and relaxation, and you'll most likely leave feeling nurtured, balanced, focused, and more energized. What could energy healing help you with? Energy healing is a practical way to enhance your life and well-being. Energy healing often leads recipients to feel more clarity and self-awareness, along with improved energy to face life's challenges. People who are struggling emotionally may experience a reduction in negative emotions such as fear, anger, sadness, or grief. Every session offers compassionate support for what you want to accomplish. Group Sessions Group Energy Healing sessions are completed in the salt room for an enhanced experience.
