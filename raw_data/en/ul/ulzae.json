The Bazaar. The more loot you sell, the more bazaar goods you're like to come across. Bazaar goods can be anything from sets of items at discounted prices to rare pieces of equipment you won't see anywhere else, kupo. Wise Moogle The Bazaar is a special shop menu in . Whenever a player sells enough quantities of certain Final Fantasy XII loot, new items will become available. The bazaar can be accessed from any shop, and all item quantities sold are carried over to every shop. Some of the ultimate weapons can only be obtained here. In the Zodiac versions, exclusive weapons replace many of the best-of-their-type weapons obtainable from the bazaar. For example: selling the loot necessary for Orochi in the original will produce the Mesa in Zodiac versions. Some of the items unlocked through the bazaar in the Zodiac versions are also different in ingredients, amount, content and cost (see here). Loot from monsters and the like are crafted into articles fit for sale. Some of these are little more than refinements on the base materials. Others require crystals, concoctions, and alchemy to produce. Few require too much skill or effort, though, making crafted articles a common sight at market, their quality, if not quite their appearance, being hardly distinguishable from that of regularly produced goods. If one is lucky, one might find some articles selling for below the going rate. Bazaar Goods How the Bazaar works [ ] For example, to get the Canopic Jar, the player will need to sell three specific items. The items can be sold at any shop, and do not need to be sold at the same time. It is good to bear in mind though that common ingredients might get used by a different recipe, not the particular one the player is after. To be 100% sure that the item needed is obtained, the player will have to sell just the particular ingredients for that item, all at once in one single sell session, then exit the sell menu to get the item. The player may sell the ingredients at any time, as the game will remember the items sold, and in which quantity. The player must first sell at a store the following: Phobos Glaze x1 Horakhty's Flame x1 Deimos Clay x1 The player must then leave the sell menu and the new item will appear in the bazaar: the Morbid Urn at 250,000 gil, which is revealed to be the Canopic Jar when the player buys it. Bazaar glitch [ ] Final Fantasy XII Zodiac Age-Bazaar trick(Tournesol,Kumbha,Stoneblade,Magepower Shishak,Maximillian) Using the bazaar glitch to the player's advantage. When items are sold at the Bazaar, the game remembers how many items have been sold at any point of the game. While the ingredients can be sold at any time, when any item is purchased at the Bazaar using a certain ingredient, the number of ingredients in stock drops to zero. Therefore, if there are two items that both use, for example, two Bone Fragments to make, and the player has sold six Bone Fragments to the Bazaar when one of the items is purchased, the number of Bone Fragments in the Bazaar's \"memory\" drops to zero, meaning the player will need to farm more Bone Fragments for the second item requiring that ingredient. This glitch, however, also works the other way around to the player's advantage, because if both items become available before either is purchased, the player only needs the two Bone Fragments that can be used for both items, so instead of needing four (two for each item), one would only need two (two is used for both items simultaneously). With this trick, the player can potentially use the same High Arcana to create items for the Tournesol, and make Tournesol and Kumbha at the same time using the same Gemsteels. Original Final Fantasy XII [ ] This is a list of every bazaar good in the original version of Final Fantasy XII. See a list for Zodiac versions below. Once an item has been bought, the ingredient quantity for that item is reduced to 0. Some bazaar goods are available as normal shop items at different prices.

Not gotten by selling different kinds of loot, they are acquired by fulfilling certain conditions. Once these conditions have been met, they will appear in the bazaar like normal, under the name Forgotten Grimoire. Some monsters' monograph drops, such as the Throat Wolf Blood that Worgens drop with the hunter's monograph, are rare and expensive, but many monsters will also drop nearly worthless Pebbles. The monograph drops are independent of the enemy's normal loot drops, though given in the same pouch left behind when an enemy is defeated. An enemy dropping a Pebble means it lacks a specific monograph drop; Pebbles can be seen as a placeholder item in that sense.
