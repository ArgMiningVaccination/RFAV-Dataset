In general, yes. Laws in the U.S. require insurers to cover essential behavioral health care at the same level as other health care services. Most health plans require a medical diagnosis and treatments that are evidence based and medically essential. This means that life coaching and alternative therapies are not covered, nor is therapy without a diagnosis. Call the number on the back or your insurance card or visit your insurance company's website to review your Summary of Benefits. If you have insurance through your employer, your Human Resources department may also be able to answer questions. How much does therapy cost with insurance? The [cost of therapy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy/how-much-does-therapy-cost)depends on your region, how much training and experience your therapist has, and the type of treatment. The rate for talk therapy generally falls between $100 and $250. For a client seeing an in-network provider, the cost of therapy is often similar to the cost of other health care services. Clients pay co-pays and may need to satisfy a plan's deductible before benefits kick in. What is the difference between In-Network and Out-of-Network insurance coverage? An in-network provider has contracted with an insurer to get paid directly for services, and to accept the insurer's rate of compensation. Clients are responsible for deductibles and copays. If a therapist is out of network, that means that the client pays the therapist directly for services at the therapist's regular fee. Out-of-Network providers often give clients a receipt so that they can file for partial reimbursement with their insurance company. Is it difficult to find an In-Network therapist? It is not unusual for therapists to limit the number of insurance patients in their practice, so it's important to check in-network availability when you schedule your first appointment. In regions and times where therapy is in high demand it may [take longer to get scheduled](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/paradigm-shift/201905/cant-find-psychologist-who-accepts-insurance-heres-why)with an in-network therapist. What is the difference between HMO and PPO insurance plans? HMO health plans only cover in-network services, there is no reimbursement for out-of-network providers. PPO plans often cover both in- and out-of-network services, though the client may pay more for out-of-network services. What is a Superbill? A superbill is a receipt for therapy services. It provides all the information required by insurance companies to reimburse you for out-of-network services, including the diagnostic codes for your care, the amount paid, and the dates and duration of care. Does insurance cover Online therapy? Many therapists who shifted their practice to [online therapy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/online-therapy)during the pandemic have kept that arrangement. And most insurers continue to cover telehealth services, with a few exceptions. Preventive care (such as an annual depression screening) is often required to be in-person to be covered, and some states require prescribers of controlled substances to see those patients in person. Does insurance cover Group therapy? Many insurance plans provide coverage for [group therapy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy/what-is-group-counseling)provided there is a medical diagnosis for group members, but there are some noteworthy exceptions. For example, Medicare does not always cover group therapy. Group therapy tends to cost less than individual therapy. Does insurance cover Couples therapy? Most insurance companies do not cover the cost of Learn more about [couples therapy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy/how-does-couples-therapy-work)because there is no medical diagnosis or medically necessary treatment. However, a few plans will offer a limited benefit, so it is still worth checking with your insurance company. Sometimes therapy is covered for a couple when one person has a diagnosis and another family member joins them for joint therapy, but it is considered therapy for the medical condition that includes a family member as a listener or helper, not couples counseling. Without insurance, most clients pay between $100-300 per 60-90 min session for couples therapy. Often clients can find classes or workshops that make it more affordable to work on their relationship. And some employers offer benefit plans that help defray the cost of couples therapy.
