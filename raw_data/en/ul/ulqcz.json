While neutralizing antibody responses wane over time, T cells are instrumental in long-term immunity. We apply machine learning and time-lapse imaging microscopy in nanowell grids (TIMING) to study thousands of videos of T cells with specicity for SARS-CoV-2 eliminating targets bearing spike protein as a surrogatefor viral infection. The data on effector functions, including cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity, provide the rst direct evidence that cytotoxi c T lymphocytes from a convalescent patient targeting an epitope conserved across all known variants of concern are serial killers capable ofeliminating multiple infected target cells. These data have implications for vaccine development and for the recovery and monitoring of infectedindividuals.

The immunity, however, wanes over time and erodes protection, exposing individuals to risk of disease and communities to outbreaksofinfection [2].ThecellularcomponentofadaptiveimmunitymediatedbycytotoxicTlymphocytes(CTLs)playsafundamental role in the recognition and removal of virally infected respiratory cells [3]. Understanding the functional potency of CTLs against SARS- CoV-2 is important in predicting ongoing cellular immunity [4]. Improving our understanding of T-cell responses to COVID-19 will help developnext-generationvaccineswithanabilitytoofferprotectionagainstemergingvariants [5].Furthermore,analysisofT-cellimmunity will help characterize patients with asymptomatic through severe disease. In response to infection and vaccination, the humoral immune response is typically well characterized, primarily because of the ease of studying antibody molecules in vitro [1]. Studying T cell-mediated cellular immune responses is much more challenging, since the response is mediated by the cells and not the soluble T-cell receptors (TCRs) [6]. T cells are capable of a complex array of functions, in- cludingmigrationtoinfectedtissue,activation,killingofinfectedcells,secretionofcytokines /chemokinesandproliferation [6].Mapping all of these functions onto the same cell requires the ability to study the spatiotemporal changes in cellular behavior across thousandsof cells. Assay principle Thismanuscriptdescribestheuseoftime-lapseimagingmicroscopyinnanowellgrids(TIMING),anintegratedmicroscopyandarticialintelligence (AI) platform that can image and prole the dynamics of thousands of cells and cell-cell interactions simultaneously [7]. The properties measured by the TIMING platform can distinguish the behavior of T cells before, during and after synapse formation,including motility, morphology, cytokine secretion, time synapse and time from synapse formation untildeath occurs in the target cell. Further, the TIMING platform can use these parameters to identify unique groups of cells and distinguish various cell behavior upon cell activation. AI algorithms enable high-throughput measurements of properties from single cells and cell- cell interactions that cannot be assessed with image acquisition over a bulk population of T cells and target cells (Figure 1A). TIMING was used to characterize the anti-viral activity of T cells obtained from a convalescent donor. Immortalized cells pulsed with peptides from spike (S) protein were used as targets to mimic infection by SARS-CoV-2. TIMING was adjusted to image sets of single T cells atshortintervalsof5mintoquantifythebehaviorandmovementofcellsalongwiththeircell-cellinteractionsinthepresenceofstimulator cells.

Materials & methods SARS-CoV-2-specic HLA-A*2-restricted cytotoxic T absence of mycoplasma contamination using real-time PCR. We used TIMING to evaluate T cell-mediated cytotoxicity at a single-cell scale, as previously described (Figure 1B) [8]. We prepared PLL-g-PEG (SuSoS, D \u00a8ubendorf, Switzerland) solution by dissolving 1 mg of it in 10 mM HEPES buffer. They used PKH26 and PKH67 dye (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, Cat #PKH26GL and #PKH67GL) for and staining, accordingly.

Results Individual CTLs exhibit heterogeneity in killing efcacy We deposited individual cells from a clonal human all major variants, including the Omicron variant (SupplementaryFigure1).Astargets,weusedtheHLA-A*02cellline,A375cells,pulsedwiththeDD9peptide.Thisprocessofsequential loading of cells yielded 308 nanowells containing a single effector cell and one or two target cells. Within the same nanowell array, 687 nanowells had only a single target cell, and 659 nanowells had only a single effector cell. These served as control experiments formonitoring spontaneous target and effector apoptosis (Supplementary Figure 2A). We subsequently loaded the nanowell array with beads functionalized with antibodies against IFN- /H9253. The beads were used to track IFN- the single-cell level and map IFN- /H9253 secretion onto the multiple dynamic parameters measured using microscopy. Tracking the interaction between effector and target cells revealed marked heterogeneity between individual CTLs. We observed that within all nanowells bearing 1E:1T (N total= 270), 36% of the CTLs formed a stable synapse (conjugation of 10 min) (Figure 1A). Even among CTLs that contributed to such a synapse, only 27% of these cells induced apoptosis within the target cells (Figure 2A & Supplementary Figure 2B). These results demonstrate that there is intra-clonal functional heterogeneity within CTLs and that a minority of effector cells contribute to the majority of the killing observed. These results cannot be obtained when evaluating effector function across populations (Supplementary Figure 3). The superior killing ability observed for a subpopulation of CTLs can be attributed to a subpopulation of serial killer T cells. TIMING allows the direct identication and quantication of serial killing by individual Tcells. This was achieved by analyzing nanowells bearing1E:2T(Figure2B&SupplementaryVideo1).Inthesenanowells,32%ofTcellslysedonetarget,whereas8%ofCTLsparticipatedinserialkilling (eliminated both targets) (Figure 2C). Collectively, these data demonstrate that most of the killing capacity of the virus-specic T cells is from a small fraction of killer and serial killer effector cells.

(B) The micrographs of a killer and a serial killer Tcell (1E:2T). (C)Percentage of Kinetics of Tcell-mediated killing The formation and duration of a synapse between Tcells and target cells are critical parameters that describe the efciency with which killing occurs. The kinetics of T cell and target cell interactions were segmented into three dened stages: tSeek, the amount of time it takes T cells to locate target cells and establish a stable synapse (contact lasting at least 10 min); tContact, the duration of stablesynapse; and tDeath, the time from establishing a stable synapse until induction of apoptosis in a target cell (Figure 3A). tSeek was shorter in killer T cells in comparison with non-killer T cells that formed a synapse but did not induce apoptosis in any target cells (Figure 3B & E & Supplementary Video 2). After establishment of the synapse, killer T cells delivered the lytic hit and detached priorto the induction of apoptosis in target cells (Figure 3C). In contrast to killer T cells, non-killer T cells failed to efciently terminate the synapseandremainedconjugatedtothetargetcellssignicantlylonger(Figure3D).Collectively, theseresultssuggestthatkillerTcells are time efcient at the establishment of synapse, termination of synapse and subsequent detachment. It has been demonstrated thatthis cycle of efcient conjugation and detachment is associated with sustained killing in lymphocytes [9]. Quantifying the motility of single cells A key property of T cells is their ability to migrate in search of target cells. We tracked the motility of individual T cells in nanowellspopulatedwith1E:0T(N total=659)andobservedthattherewasagradientineffectorcellmotilityrangingfrom0.1to3.0 m/min.Wealso evaluated the dynamic shape of T cells and observed that migrating cells had a lower aspect ratio of polarization in comparison withnon-migrating T cells, which were predominantly circular (Figure 4A). We observed signicant differences in the frequency of synapseforming T cells based on their motility (Figure 4B & Supplementary Video 3). These observations highlight the fact that migration and seeking of the target cells are a prerequisite for T-cell effector functionality such as cytotoxicity. We tracked the motility of individual T cells in nanowells in two states: with and without conjugation to a target cell. The motility of T cells without conjugation to a target cell (1E:1T) increased compared with T cells located in wells without a target cell (1E:0T). This suggests that T-cell motility is activated by co-incubation with target cells. Upon conjugation to a target cell, however, there was a noticeable drop in the motility of individual T cells, consistent with the known immunobiology of T cells in arresting motility to optimize effector function (Figure 4C & 4D) [10].

To investigate the relationship between killing and cytokine secretion at single-cell resolution, we tracked individual Tcells that formed a synapse (1E:1T) and mapped the polyfunctionality of killing activity and Vol. 72 No. 4 C/circlecopyrt2022 CellChorus Inc. www.BioTechniques.com 4tSeek (time to first encounter with target (min))500 p = 0.09 400 300 200 100 0 Non-killer Killer tContact (min)160 120 80 40 0 Non-killer KillerTime (min)450 **** 400 350 300250 200 150 02:30 killing.

Polyfunctional cells constituted only 11% of the population, whereas the dominant population of T cells were non- functional(KillingnegIFN-/H9253neg)(Figure5A&SupplementaryVideo4).Next,wecomparedtherateofsecretionofIFN- /H9253betweenkillerand non-killer T cells (based on the intensity of immunofluorescence on the bead [12]) and observed that killer CTLs secreted signicantly higher amounts of IFN- /H9253compared with non-killer T cells (Figure 5B). Collectively, these results illustrate that an elite subpopulation of T cells is capable of both killing and IFN- /H9253secretion. Serial killer CTLs have reduced activation-induced cell death occurrences Activation-induced cell death (AICD) is a negative regulator of Tcells and can titrate the potency and efcacy of effector cells [13].S i n c e TIMING serially tracks apoptosis occurring in both effector cells and target cells, we quantied the frequency of AICD in T cells as afunction of their killing capacity (Figure 6A & Supplementary Video 5). Within all nanowells with evidence of T-cell synapse formation(1E:1T),weobservedanelevatedfrequencyofkillerCTLsundergoingAICDcomparedwithnon-killerCTLs.Thisobservationwasreversed CTLs (1E:2T) (Figure 6B). These observations revealed that serial killer CTLs are more resistant to AICD than non-killer CTLs. Conclusion Current commercial vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 signicantly reduce mortality and morbidity, but the rise of new mutations may challengethesesuccesses [14].Understandingacompleteimmuneresponsebyevaluatingcellularimmunityaswellashumoralresponseiscritical toappreciatethepotentialforvaccinestocontrolnewviralvariantsandtohelpunderstandthosewhohaverecoveredfromviral-induceddisease. Variants of SARS-CoV-2 began to emerge toward the end of 2021 and raised the possibility that these viruses may evolve toelude immune defenses after infection or vaccination [14]. Studies have since investigated whether immunity is protective by examining responses in people who had contracted and recovered from SARS-CoV-2 prior to the widespread emergence of variants. These datareveal that CD8 +T cells remain active against the virus [4,15]. The TIMING platform provides a new approach to understanding the complexity of the cellular immune response. This microscopy technique offers multiple advantages to dissecting T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2.

Second, it analyzes T cells that recognize target cells bearing virally derived peptides. Third, it reveals T cells that are capable of polyfunctionality based on killing, serial killing and secretion of IFN- /H9253. These three groups of data are integrated to reveal the dynamic interplay between T cells and target cells. This study has focused on a single epitope derivedfrom the S protein, and it remains to be seen whether T cells targeting other SARS-CoV-2 proteins such as the nucleocapsid proteincan function as serial killers. The TIMING platform reported here is uniquely positioned to be able to answer these questions related to T-cell polyfunctionality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst report directly demonstrating that a subpopulation of CTLs spe- cic for a conserved SARS-CoV-2 epitope comprises serial killers. The ability of CTLs to efciently kill target cells presenting conservedepitopes illustrates the power of Tcell-mediated immunity and emphasizes the need to study cellular immune responses in the context of infection and vaccines. From a clinical perspective, the direct role of CD8 +T cells in eliminating virally infected target cells is sig- nicant in at least two ways. First, CD8+T cells primed from previous coronavirus infections are predicted to be cross-reactive and it has been hypothesized that these cross-reactive T cells can explain the relatively mild symptoms experienced by most people infectedwith SARS-CoV-2 [16]. Whether these pre-existing CD8+Tcells can kill target cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 antigens needs to be directly tested. Second, T cell-centric vaccines are being developed as next-generation vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, and T cell-mediated killing is one of the primary mechanisms that needs to be elicited for vaccine-induced protection [17]. Morebroadly,TIMINGisanintegratedplatformthatleveragesadvancesinmicrofabrication,microscopyandAItoenabletheproling of thousands of time-lapse microscopy experiments in parallel. As we have shown previously, the ability to integrate the dynamic prole with downstream clonal expansion or linked transcriptional proling makes TIMING the only platform capable of generating dynamic multiomic datasets [18,19]. Future perspective The management of SARS-CoV-2 and other future viruses requires a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune response. The scientic and policymaking communities have traditionally relied heavily on evaluating antibodies to understand immunity and vaccine response. As antibody-related immunity due to prior infection and vaccination declines over time, it is crucial to study Tcells to improvepolicymakingandthedevelopmentofnovelvaccinesandtherapeutics.Justassingle-cellsequencinghasrevolutionizedourunderstand- ing of genomics and transcriptomics, dynamic single-cell analysis will revolutionize ourunderstanding of immune cells in the context of vaccines and immunotherapies. Summary points T-cell response can retain the ability to recognize and kill cells infected by SARS-CoV-2. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes exhibit heterogeneity in killing efcacy against infected cells. The limitation of current techniques in proling the dynamics of cell-cell interaction escalates the importance of a single-cell assay. Time-lapse imaging microscopy in nanowell grids evaluates of cells by measuring cytotoxicity, secretion of cytokines grids identies subsets of cells with unique functional characteristics.
