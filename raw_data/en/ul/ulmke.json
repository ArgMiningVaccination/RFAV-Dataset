The OPBP Program was established to recognize Ohio's beef producers who have attended at least 24 hour s of educational programming and is jointly coordinated by Ohio State University Extension and the Ohio Cattlemen's Association (OCA). Business Development of a Branded Food Product Line: From 2001 until 2005, I served as the Program Director for a branded beef program, Ohio Signature Beef . I directed the market research, and was instrumental in the development of the production and carcass specifications necessary to support a high-quality, branded meat product line designed to be sold in specialty markets and high-end grocery stores. Ohio Signature Beef prohibits the use of any injected antibiotics or hormone implants, as well as any feed- grade antibiotics. The Ohio Signature Beef program was designated as Schedule G55 by the Agricultural Marketin g Service, a division of the United States Department of Agriculture. . The Ohio Signature Beef program is currently marketed through Whole Foods Market. Ohio Signature Beef can be accessed via the web at: http://www.ohiosignature.com . 19Joseph S.

Personal Statement With a primary appointment in teaching, I have authored publications focused on the changing demographics of animal sciences students and effective teaching methods in animal sciences. My research program is focused on lipid metabolism in the pre- and postnatal piglet and is concerned with defining optimal nutritional m anagement of preterm infants and improving piglet survival. My research program allows me to make a significant contribution toward expanding our knowledge in the area of early nutrition and is integrated with my roles of teaching and advising by providing research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.
