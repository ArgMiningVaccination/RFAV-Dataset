Top experts explain the latest news on looking young, feeling stronger, and thinking sharper at every age. Like a less sinister Dorian Gray, Michael Roizen, an internist, anesthesiologist, and chief wellness officer of the Cleveland Clinic, has all the secrets to fighting off aging. Fourteen years ago, he developed the concept of RealAge, a formula that determines how young or old your body really is, based on your health and behavior. His team reviewed more than 35,000 studies on the effects of lifestyle and more on mortality or disability rates, and now he's coauthored You, Staying Young: The Owner's Manual for Extending Your Warranty (Free Press) with cardiothorassic surgeon Mehmet Oz. What are the most important things a woman in her 20s or 30s can do now? First, establish healthy patterns of eating and physical activity that will last a lifetime. Also, try to choose both a job and a partner that you are passionate about. Those who have passion in their lives age less. Your book says memory loss starts at around age 16 and can be common by 40. What can we do to stave it off? Regular exercise helps prevent the arterial aging that contributes to memory loss. It demands concentration and coordination, two activities that require you to fire up those brain neurons and keep them active. Certain nutrients are also known to be \"brain foods,\" the main one being omega-3 fatty acids, found in fatty fish such as salmon and mahi-mahi. These healthy fats help keep your arteries clear and improve the function of your message-sending brain neuro-transmitters. Aim for 13 ounces of fish a week or an ounce of walnuts every day, or, if you prefer supplements, take two grams of fish oil, or DHA, a day. Any other key vitamins? I recommend a multivitamin twice a day as an insurance policy against an imperfect diet. Water-soluble vitamins, such as B and C, get peed out of your body about every eight hours, so you need to take a multi every 12 hours or so to keep them at a stable level. But most don't have enough vitamin D, calcium, or magnesium, so you may need individual supplements. I recommend 400 IU of vitamin D, 1,600 milligrams of calcium, and 400 milligrams of magnesium total. I also recommend four to five daily servings of leafy green vegetables, which are rich in lutein, as well as a teaspoon of mustard made from turmeric (such as Heinz's), an antioxidant that research now shows may help ward off dementia and protect your heart, as well as reduce your risk of cancer. Is there any way to use stress to our advantage, to keep us younger? What we don't realize is that in small amounts, stress is actually good for us. It heightens all of our biological systems so that we can deal with an impending threat, which we needed during caveman times when we were faced with a looming enemy. Your concentration becomes more focused, your reaction time becomes faster, and your strength increases dramatically. The big difference between stress today and 10,000 years ago is that for cavemen, stress was something fleeting. They had periods of high-intensity stress followed by low levels of it. Today we're drowning in a sea of stress, with wave after wave after wave knocking us over. To deal with this, find ways to manage stress\u2014one of the best ways is leaning on friends. Research shows that one of the most vital elements in reducing the negative health effects of stress is to have strong social networks. What are the five biggest causes of aging that women need to be aware of? The first is stress, and often for women, one of the biggest stressors is caregiving. Women in their 20s, 30s, and 40s are often sandwiched between taking care of their children and their parents, as well as dealing with financial stress and marital stress. The second is uncontrolled high blood pressure, which causes your arteries to age before their time. The third is poor food choices, which foster inflammation in the body and cause changes in gene function that age you. The fourth is physical inactivity\u2014when you don't exercise, your cells age faster, putting you more at risk for certain diseases such as cancer, and your arteries don't function as well as they should, leaving you fatigued. The fifth is smoking\u2014cigarettes contain carcinogenic substances which cause inflammation in your arteries and in your immune system. What can women do to reverse the metabolic slowdown that happens with age? That's actually a myth\u2014there is no metabolic slowdown that happens with age. Women gain weight because as they age, they often aren't as active. It is true that as you get older, you start losing muscle mass, partly due to lower hormone levels such as estrogen. But you can counter these effects through weight training two to three times a week. What's one of the easiest things you can do to prevent aging? I believe it's flossing your teeth. One study by Emory University showed that people who have gum disease have a mortality rate 23 to 46 percent higher than those who don't. A theory is that the same bacteria that cause gum disease also trigger an immune response that causes inflammation in the arteries. What's the secret of living to 100? Watching Survivor. Seriously. Researchers have found that one third of centenarians watch reality TV shows, one quarter watch MTV or music videos, and some even surf the Web and use an iPod. They're also into current events, lead healthy lifestyles\u2014exercise, eat right, avoid excessive alcohol and smoking\u2014and consider faith and spirituality to be a priority. What are the most common environmental toxins that can age you? The ones that age us the most are tobacco and car and truck fuel exhaust. Take the train as much as possible to avoid exhaust fumes. And if you get your clothes dry-cleaned, remove them from the plastic wrap, which traps in the chemicals used to clean them, and air them out. What medical tests should a woman under 40 request? Besides a monthly breast self-exam and an annual Pap smear and skin check, she should start having annual mammograms at age 40. But there are other tests that help detect aging, such as an annual blood-pressure check and cholesterol and thyroid tests every five years\u2014more than that if either one is abnormal. She should have a yearly dental exam to check for signs of gum disease. There are also some tests she can do at home: One is to measure her waist every year\u2014ideally, it should be under half her height in inches, so if she's five foot four, or 64 inches, her waist should measure fewer than 32 inches. Every three to six months, she should also check her heart rate about two minutes after she's stopped exercising: It should be back to within about 20 counts of her resting heart rate. If it's not, research indicates, you may be at higher risk of heart disease. "}
