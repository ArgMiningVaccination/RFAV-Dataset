Mitchell, PhD, RN, FAHA; on behalf of the American Heart Association Council on Cardiovascular Nursing and the Stroke Council Ischemic stroke represents 87% of all strokes.1As world- wide initiatives move forward with stroke care, healthcare providers and institutions will be called on to deliver the most current evidence-based care. The American Heart Associa- tion/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) charged apanel of healthcare professionals from several disciplineswith developing a practical, comprehensive overview of care for the patient with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). This article focuses on educating nursing and allied healthcare profes-sionals about the roles and responsibilities of those who carefor patients with AIS. Nurses play a pivotal role in all phases of care of the stroke patient. For the purposes of this article, the writing panel hasdefined 2 phases of stroke care: (1) The emergency or hyperacute care phase, 2,3which includes the prehospital setting and the emergency department (ED), and (2) the acute care phase, which includes critical care units, intermediate care units, stroke units, and general medical units. Stroke is a complex disease that requires the efforts and skills of all members of the multidisciplinary team. Nurses are often responsible for the coordination of care throughout the continuum.4-9Coordinated care of the AIS patient results in improved outcomes, decreased lengths of stay, and de- creased costs.10 In developing this comprehensive overview, the writing panel applied the rules of evidence and formulation of strength of evidence (recommendations) used by other AHAwriting groups11(Table 1). We also cross-reference other AHA guidelines as appropriate. Overview of Stroke It is important that nurses understand the burden of stroke as a public health issue in the United States. This will guidethem in developing appropriate skills to care for AIS patientsand to educate patients and families about secondary strokeprevention. Epidemiology of Stroke The AHA estimates that /H11015780 000 strokes occur each year; 600 000 of these are new strokes, and /H11015180 000 are recurrent strokes.1Eighty-seven percent are ischemic strokes, 10% are intracranial hemorrhages (ICH), and 3% are subarachnoidhemorrhages (SAH). In 2007, the overall mortality rate fromstroke was 273 000, which makes stroke the third-leadingcause of death in the United States. 1Between 1979 and 2005, the annual number of hospital discharges with stroke as thediagnosis was /H11015900 000. 1Direct and indirect costs associ- ated with stroke are estimated to be approximately $65.5billion. 1Direct costs are attributed to the initial hospitaliza- tion, skilled nursing care, physician and nursing care, medi-cations and durable medical equipment, home health care,and acute rehabilitation. Indirect costs include loss of prod-uctivity (loss of future earnings) due to morbidity and The American Heart Association makes every effort to avoid any actual or potential conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of an outside relationship or a personal, professional, or business interest of a member of the writing panel. Specifically, all members of the writing group are re quired to complete and submit a Disclosure Questionnaire showing all such relationships that might be perceived as real or potential conflicts of interest.

Demographics of Stroke Each year, women experience /H1101560 000 more strokes than men do.1American Indian/Alaskan Native persons have the highest prevalence of stroke (6.7%), followed by persons ofmultiple races (4.6%). Black men and women have twice theprevalence of stroke as whites (4.0% versus 2.3%). 1Blacks lead all races or ethnic groups for first-ever stroke. Theprevalence of stroke in Hispanic or Latino populations is 3.1%for men and 1.9% for women compared with 2.4% for non-Hispanic white men and 2.7% for non-Hispanic white women. 1 Epidemiologists note the increasing risk of stroke with advanc-ing age, comparable to the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Unlessindividuals change modifiable risk factors, the large agingAmerican population is faced with rising stroke morbidity and agreater than ever public healthcare burden. 9Etiology of Stroke (Stroke Subtypes) Strokes caused by blocked blood vessels to the brain, or ischemic strokes, lead to cerebral infarction, whereas hemor-rhagic strokes caused by ruptured vessels in and around thebrain lead to ICH and SAH. The AHA has publishedguidelines for the medical management of patients withischemic stroke 12,13and strokes caused by ICH14and SAH.15 Nursing and allied health management is not provided inthese guidelines and thus is outlined here. Ischemic strokes are commonly caused by atherosclerotic disease of extracranial or intracranial vessels that circulateblood to the brain. vertebrobasilar arteries),and/H1101525% ischemic strokes are due to penetrating artery disease (small-vessel disease) that causes lacunar or subcor-tical strokes. Another 20% are caused by cardiogenic embo-Table 1. Applying Classification of Recommendations and Levels of Evidence *Data available from clinical trials or registries about the usefulness/efficacy in different subpopulations, such as gender, age, history of diab etes, history of prior myocardial infarction, history of heart failure, and prior aspirin use. A recommendation with Level of Evidence B or C does not imply that the recommen dation is weak. Many important clinical questions addressed in the guidelines do not lend themselves to clinical trials. Even though randomized trials are not avail able, there may be a very clear clinical consensus that a particular test or therapy is useful or effective. In 2003, the ACC/AHA Task Force on Practice Guidelines developed a list of suggested phrases to use when writing recommendations. All guideline recommendations have been written in full sentences that express a complete thought, such that a recommendation, even if separated and presented apa rt from the rest of the document (including headings above sets of recommendations), would still convey the full intent of the recommendation. It is hoped tha t this will increase readers' comprehension of the guidelines and will allow queries at the individual recommendation level.2 Stroke August 2009 by on July 2, 2009 stroke.ahajournals.org Downloaded from lism, most frequently from atrial fibrillation.16Approximately 30% of ischemic strokes are termed cryptogenic, for which the exact cause of stroke remains unknown.16 Hemorrhagic stroke is commonly caused by either primary ICH or SAH. Overall, ICH accounts for /H1101510% of all strokes and SAH for /H110153%.1Common causes and risk factors for ICH are hypertension (the number 1 cause), bleeding disorders,African-American ethnicity, aging, vascular malformations, excessive use/abuse of alcohol, and liver dysfunction. 17-20 The primary cause of SAH is a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. Crossing the Continuum of Care Phase 1 of stroke care, the emergency or hyperacute phase, encompasses the first 3 to 24 hours after onset of stroke. Thisphase generally incorporates the prehospital (activation of emergency medical services [EMS]/9-1-1 and response) and ED care protocols. The focus is on identifying stroke symp-toms and infarct location, assessing the patient for risk ofacute and long-term complications, and determining treat- ment options. Phase 2 includes acute care, which encompasses the period from 24 to 72 hours after onset of stroke. In this phase, the focus is on clarifying the cause of stroke, preventing medicalcomplications, preparing the patient and family for discharge, and instituting long-term secondary prevention modalities. The Emergency or Hyperacute Phase of AIS Care Optimal management of the AIS patient in the emergency or hyperacute phase of AIS care requires an accurate andsystematic evaluation that is coordinated and timely. Once apotential stroke is suspected, EMS personnel and nurses mustdetermine the time at which the patient was last known to bewell (last known well time). This time is the single mostimportant determinant of treatment options during the hyper- acute phase. The Nurse's Role In the prehospital setting, the leading healthcare team mem- ber is the emergency medical technician (EMT) or paramedic.Nurses may work as EMTs and paramedics, radio providersof online medical control to EMS personnel from basestations, and educators who teach EMS personnel aboutstroke and the care of stroke patients. The key elements of prehospital care are stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation (the ABCs); identifica- tion of signs and symptoms of stroke; establishment orverification of the last known well time; provision of supple-mental oxygen to patients with hypoxemia; checking theblood glucose level; avoidance of the administration ofglucose-containing fluids (unless the patient is hypoglyce-mic); rapid initiation of transport (load and go); and deliveryof patients to receiving centers capable of rapidly caring foracute stroke. 21When recombinant tissue plasminogen activa- tor (rtPA) was approved as the first acute treatment for AIS, the paradigm of care of the stroke patient shifted, andemergency care of the stroke patient in the field emerged. 22 The role of time in determining treatment eligibility andpatient outcome has generated a body of literature andknowledge about appropriate care for AIS patients, 22-35,37-45 from which healthcare providers have developed measures to quickly and easily identify and assess stroke patients.46,47 Textbooks and training courses for EMTs and paramedicsdiscuss stroke pathophysiology and identify stroke as amedical emergency. Understanding and recognizing specific stroke symptoms can be challenging. 22-24,28,47-50 Evaluation of EMS practices has shown that stroke-specific knowl- edge has been deficient38but that both overall knowledge28 and identification of stroke symptoms by EMTs andparamedics can be improved with additional stroke- specific education. 19-25,28,31,47-50 In many community and academic institutions, education of EMS providers has become a function of the nurse educator, a role that has expanded to the community. Themost widely available stroke teaching tool for this purpose 21 is chapter 9 of the AHA stroke module.44,51 Educational videos and other tools are also available for the EMSaudience. 52 Before beginning an EMS stroke education program, the nurse educator should verify local policies and regulationsgoverning acceptable practice for paramedics and EMTs inthat region or state. For example, in some communities, EMSproviders are not permitted to perform some recommendedpractices for acute stroke care, such as determining finger-stick glucose levels and starting intravenous lines. In other communities, higher standards that require specific assess- ment skills have been developed for EMS to enable them torespond more aggressively to AIS. 10,27,47 As a part of their continuing education, EMS personnel must also be provided with accurate information about acute stroke care and treatment capabilities in their com-munity. 47EMS units should know which hospitals are equipped to provide specific emergency stroke care, suchas those certified by the Joint Commission or their statehealth agencies. 10,53-56 Continuing education of EMS personnel is challenging and requires frequent updates. The nurse educator should keep inmind that a typical EMS provider cares for 4 to 10 strokepatients in a given year. 44As a result, field experience may be limited, and reinforcement of knowledge and practice incaring for acute stroke patients will be necessary. One studyconcluded that the knowledge gained from stroke trainingdecreased by /H1101550% over 1 year 57; therefore, educational programs about stroke might be repeated from 1 to severaltimes per year. In some states with mandated stroke systemsof care, EMS updates in stroke education will be required. 21 The National Institutes of Health (NIH) proceedings Improv- ing the Chain of Recovery for Acute Stroke in Your Commu-nityis a useful resource for planning and organizing stroke educational programs. 47 Education Regarding Prehospital Assessment for Acute Stroke Although accurate identification of stroke symptoms is a critical success factor in early stroke treatment, the nurseeducator needs to include additional aspects of prehospitalstroke patient management. 28,58,59 Recognition of stroke symptoms is an important factor in successful delivery ofSummers et al Nursing Care of the Acute Ischemic Stroke Patient 3 by on July 2, 2009 stroke.ahajournals.org Downloaded from proven acute therapies. Prehospital assessment tools have been developed to help enhance recognition of stroke symp-toms and improve the ability to identify stroke patients in thefield (Table 2). The most common and well-investigated toolsare the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale and the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen. 22,30,32,60 Newer stroke identification tools include the Face Arm Speech Test61 (Table 3), which is similar to the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale, and the Melbourne Prehospital StrokeScale, 62-64 which is similar to the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen. Tools to rate stroke severity in the field havebeen developed, including a shortened version of the NIHStroke Scale (NIHSS) 65and the Los Angeles Motor Scale.34 If a specific tool has not been identified for use within acommunity, the nurse educator should review the commonsigns and symptoms of stroke such as those identified on theBrain Attack Coalition's World Wide Web site (http://www.stroke-site.org/index.html). These tools may also be used to teach a quick stroke screening evaluation to hospitalpersonnel, because in-hospital strokes also require promptrecognition and action. EMS personnel have long understood the implications of time to treatment for myocardial infarction and trauma, butthe concept of time dependency in AIS is relatively new. Thenurse educator must emphasize the importance of obtainingthe last known well time. Stroke education should emphasize that stroke requires high-priority status and that the load-and-go philosophy has now become a part of mainstream acute stroke care in thefield. 41rtPA is the only treatment for AIS approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and it ideally is administered within 3 hours of symptom onset.13,59,66,67 On-site stroke patient assessments should be performed expeditiously, andtransport should be initiated as soon as the patient's conditionis assessed as stable. 44,66,68,69 Although the symptoms listed in the formal prehospital stroke assessment tools are classic,other stroke symptoms should also be described to EMSpersonnel. Table 4 lists neurological symptoms associatedwith strokes that occur in the different cerebral territories.Recommendations Class I 1. To increase the number of stroke patients who receive timely treatment, educational programs for physicians, hospital personnel, and EMS personnel are recom-mended ( Class I, Level of Evidence B ). 2. Stroke education of EMS personnel should be provided on a regular basis, perhaps as often as twice per year, toensure proper recognition, field treatment, and deliveryof patients to appropriate facilities ( Class I, Level of Evidence C ).Table 2.

Because the field neurological examination will serve as a baseline for assessment of neurological improvement or worsening, theuse of a prehospital stroke scale is recommended. EMS personnel on the scene should ask the patient's family or bystanders when the patient was last known to be normal or without neurological deficits, ie, the last knownwell time. Documentation of this report of onset can behelpful in establishing an accurate time of stroke symptomonset. 44,46,47,69 Ideally, standardized definitions should be developed in EMS systems to define the specific onset date and time. The date and time should be defined as the time when the stroke symptoms that brought the patient to the hospital first occurred. A specific time can be identifiedwithin a reasonable amount of certainty within /H1100615 minutes. When possible, the information should be obtained directlyfrom the patient. If the patient is unable to give this informa- tion, EMS personnel should look to another reliable sourcefor this information. 70If the time of onset of stroke symptoms is not identifiable, a standard method of time parameters should be used, such as morning (6:00 AMto 11:59 AM), afternoon (noon to 5:59 PM), evening (6:00 PMto 11:59 PM), and overnight (midnight to 5:59 AM).70EMS providers must emphasize to families the importance of traveling to thehospital with the patient, particularly if symptom onset is within the time frame for rtPA administration and the patient's language or decision-making capability is compro-mised. When family members cannot accompany the patient,EMS personnel should document the family's contact infor-mation and provide it to the emergency physician. 13 The current guidelines recommend the use of continuous cardiac monitoring during transport of a suspected stroke patient to determine the presence of cardiac arrhythmias.13If there is no standing field protocol for management of cardiacconditions, EMS personnel should contact the base station or receiving institution if the electrocardiogram demonstrates possible acute myocardial ischemia or atrial fibrillation.Blood pressure should be monitored every 15 minutes, ormore often if severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure/H11022200 mm Hg) or relative hypotension (systolic blood pres- sure/H11021110 mm Hg) is observed during transport. Adminis- tration of antihypertensive drugs in the field is not recom- mended, because induced hypotension carries a possible risk of extending the area of cerebral infarct. 47,58,68,71 Supplemen- tal oxygen should be given to hypoxic patients; in ambu- lances without oximetry capabilities, oxygen can be admin- istered at low levels, eg, 2 to 3 L/min. If pulse oximetry is available and the patient's oxygen saturation is /H1102292%, addi- tional oxygen is not needed.13Transport with the head of the bed elevated /H1101530\u00b0 may help with oxygenation and may minimize the possibility of aspiration.44,71,72 To decrease the risk of aspiration, the patient should receive nothing by mouth (NPO). Hypoglycemia, a common stroke mimic, can be identified quickly by measuring blood glucose during transport. Finger- stick tests can be performed if the emergency vehicle isappropriately equipped and personnel are trained. Treatment of severe hypoglycemia should be instituted promptly byEMS personnel. Intravenous access can be established in thefield, and non-glucose-containing intravenous fluids can bestarted if the patient is hypotensive. Establishment of intra-venous access should not delay transport. 44,46,47,57,69,71 Finally, the nurse educator should emphasize the value of early notification of the receiving ED of the arrival of a potential acute stroke patient. Historic cardiac trials have shown that prearrival notification of the ED enhances rapid diagnostic workup, reducing time between symptom onsetand treatment. 23,25,73 Recommendations Class I 1. EMS personnel should be trained to administer a validated prehospital stroke assessment, such as the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale or the Los Angeles PrehospitalStroke Screen ( Class I, Level of Evidence B ). 2. EMS personnel should be trained to determine the last known well time using standardized definitions to collect the most accurate information ( Class I, Level of Evidence B ). 3. EMS personnel should use the neurological/stroke as- sessment approach to gather basic physiological infor- mation about the patient and communicate the patient'scondition to the receiving hospital ( Class I, Level of Evidence B ). From the Field to the ED: Stroke Patient Triage and Care Emergency personnel initiate basic triage and care modalities in the field. Once the stroke patient arrives in the ED, patienttriage is usually a function of nursing staff. The Emergency Nurses Association and the American College of Emergency Physicians recommend a 5-level Emergency Severity Indexas a preferred system for triage in a busy ED. 52This index puts all stroke patients in the level 2 or \"needs immediateassessment\" category, the same as for an unstable traumapatient or a critical care cardiac patient. 46,52,69 The emergency nurse must be able to recognize neurological symptoms thatsuggest stroke and rapidly assess the initial time of symptomonset or the last known well time. 44,46,57 The triage nurse should use specialized checklists, proto- cols, and other tools to identify stroke patients.10,44,47,57,74 Once stroke is confirmed, the nurse uses these procedures andprotocols that define who contacts the acute stroke team orappropriate neurological consultant. Emergency nurses un-derstand that time is critical and are trained in rapid assess-ment and treatment of stroke patients. Studies have shownthat the sooner thrombolytic therapy is started, the greater thebenefit. 23,44,46,75 It is critical that all emergency nurses and other emergency professional staff know that the NIH-National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(NINDS) benchmark treatment time for AIS with intravenousrtPA is within 60 minutes of arrival in the ED 46(Table 5). In some cases, this time will need to be shortened to successfullyinitiate thrombolytic therapy within 3 hours of stroke onset,although there is growing evidence of safety and effective-Summers et al Nursing Care of the Acute Ischemic Stroke Patient 5 by on July 2, 2009 stroke.ahajournals.org Downloaded from ness beyond the 3-hour window from stroke onset.76,77 The AHA AIS Writing Committee has issued a Science Advisory stating that some eligible patients may be treated between the3- and 4.5-hour window after stroke. The recommendationcomes with several caveats and follows the inclusion criteriadescribed in the ECASS III results. The exceptions includepersons /H1102280 years of age, those taking oral anticoagulants with an international normalized ratio of /H110211.7, persons with an NIHSS score /H1102225, and those with a history of stroke and diabetes. 77a Recommendations Class I 1. EDs should establish standard operating procedures and protocols to triage stroke patients expeditiously ( Class I, Level of Evidence B ). 2. Standard procedures and protocols should be estab- lished for benchmarking time to evaluate and treat eligible stroke patients with rtPA expeditiously ( Class I, Level of Evidence B ). 3. Target treatment with rtPA should be within 1 hour of the patient's arrival in the ED ( Class I, Level of Evidence A ). 4. Eligible patients can be treated between the 3- to 4.5-hour window when evaluated carefully for exclu-sions to treatment ( Class I, Level of Evidence B ). Emergency Nursing Interventions in the Emergency/Hyperacute Phase of Stroke The First 24 Hours Stroke symptoms typically begin suddenly (but can evolve over minutes to hours) and are referable to the affected regionof the brain. Ischemic stroke symptoms are generally dividedinto those that affect the anterior and posterior cerebralcirculation (Table 4). To properly triage patients for AIStherapies such as rtPA, emergency nurses should be familiarwith both typical and unusual stroke presentations. As in the prehospital phase, initial patient assessments made by the emergency nurse are based on the principle of assessing the ABCs, vital signs, and neurological assessment.The majority of AIS patients will present to the ED in ahemodynamically stable condition; however, ischemicstrokes involving the posterior circulation can require aggres-sive airway management, especially if the patient has an altered level of consciousness. 26,78 Circulatory collapse or cardiac arrest, although possible, is uncommon in isolated ischemic stroke.79The occurrence of either may indicate other medical conditions such as acute myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, or congestive heartfailure. Cardiac monitoring of all suspected stroke patients inthe ED helps identify these conditions. 69 Initial ED documentation of the stroke patient begins with the recording of all information included in the neurological/stroke assessment. Vital signs, including temperature, may bemeasured frequently as clinically indicated but not less thanevery 30 minutes while the patient is in the ED. Hyperthermia is associated with poor outcome in stroke patients 13,80-82 ; therefore, it is important to consider treating any fever /H1102299.6\u00b0F. During the 60-minute infusion of thrombolytic therapy, pulse and blood pressure should be checked at leastevery 15 minutes. Table 6 summarizes nursing care associ- ated with thrombolysis and nonthrombolysis treatment ofpatients with acute cerebral ischemia on the basis of theoriginal NIH-NINDS study protocol and AHA/ASAguidelines. 2,29,83-86 Brain Imaging The overriding objective of emergency evaluation of the stroke patient is to determine whether the stroke is anischemic infarction or ICH and to exclude a nonvascularlesion as the cause of symptoms. Additional objectives are tolocalize the lesion, determine its age and extent, and docu- ment its mechanism. Both computed tomography (CT) andmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are acceptable initialimaging modalities for acute evaluation. The most commonlyobtained study remains an immediate unenhanced (noncon-trast) head CT scan. 13The emergency nurse prepares the patient for CT or MRI by explaining the test and may help transport the patient to the scanner. The nurse should preno-tify the CT department that a patient with suspected acutestroke is in transport. This will allow technicians to reserve the scanner so that the patient can be imaged immediately onarrival. The CT scan should be completed in /H1134925 minutes in patients who are eligible for treatment with rtPA. The initialscan is one of the most important diagnostic tests in theemergency phase after stroke. Rapid acquisition and results ofimaging will define treatment. Oxygenation, Positioning, and Oral Intake Patients with AIS are at risk of hypoxemia and oxygen desaturation. Maximization of oxygenation of all acute strokepatients has been examined in 1 quasi-randomized trial anddid not show clear findings of benefit from supplementaloxygen. 87There is general agreement, however, that hypoxic patients will benefit from supplemental oxygen.13 Positioning of the head of the bed must be individualized for each patient. The traditional positioning at 25\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 isoften used for potentially increased intracranial pressure(ICP), at least until large lobar, ICH, space-occupying lesionsor other causes of increased ICP can be ruled out by imaging. 88Stroke patients with increased ICP and chronic respiratory conditions may need head elevation for maximumTable 5.

The patient's neck should be kept straight, airway patency maintained, and slumped sitting avoided to prevent hypoxia. 89 Patients are kept NPO, including no oral medications, until ability to swallow can be assessed. Emergency nurses may be trained to perform a bedside swallowing assessment to establish whether the patient can safely receive oral intake and swallow ED medications such as aspirin.13,27,89 If swal- lowing is impaired, medications can be administered rectally or by nasogastric tube. Laboratory Assessments An electrolyte imbalance can sometimes produce strokelikesymptoms. A comprehensive metabolic panel indicates fluidand electrolyte status. The blood and hemostatic system canbe assessed by a complete blood count with platelet and coagulation studies such as prothrombin time, internationalnormalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen. Urinalysis assesses renal function and coexistingurinary tract infection (UTI). Emergent laboratory specimensshould be labeled STAT to expedite processing, if the patientis in the time window to receive thrombolytics. Table 7 liststhe most commonly ordered stroke laboratory tests to mea-sure eligibility to receive rtPA. Intravenous Access Ideally, 2 to 3 intravenous sites should be established if the acute stroke patient will receive thrombolytic therapy. Onesite is used for administration of intravenous fluids, another for administration of thrombolytic therapy, and the third for administration of intravenous medications. 13Di- agnostic laboratory blood specimens should be drawn before intravenous fluids are started. Collection of speci- mens before the patient undergoes imaging allows simul- taneous processing of both laboratory and imaging dataand facilitates rapid turnaround. Intravenous Fluids Glucose can have detrimental effects in acute brain injury of all types. Therefore, intravenous solutions with glucose (suchas D 5W [dextrose 5% in water]) should be avoided in AIS patients in the ED.13,27 An infusion rate that maintains normovolemia (75 to 100 mL/h) can help facilitate normalcirculating blood volume. Stroke patients often present in a hypovolemic state, which may produce hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion. In these instances, intravenous fluidTable 6.

Patient Medical History It can be challenging and time-consuming to obtain a strokehistory in the emergency phase. As part of the stroke team,emergency nurses can play a key role in helping obtain apertinent clinical history from the AIS patient and familymembers (Table 8). Neurological Assessment The NIHSS (Table 9) is a valid, efficient, and reliablemeasure of the patient's status after a stroke and in assessingoutcome after treatment. Among stroke neurologists andneuroscience nurses, it is the most widely used stroke deficitscale. Developed by stroke neurologists from the University of Cincinnati, the University of Iowa, and the NIH-NINDS, 26 the NIHSS contains parameters for observing changes in the patient's neurological status and measuring stroke severity.To ensure reliability, formal training and certification in useof the scale are recommended (www.strokeassociation.org orwww.ninds.nih.gov). The NIHSS is a valid functional out- comes measure and should become the standard to measureneurological functional improvement over time, both in thehospital and during the poststroke period of follow-up. Ruling Out Stroke Mimics Various conditions that mimic stroke should be ruled out quickly when stroke is suspected. Postseizure patients maypresent with unilateral weakness (Todd's paralysis), and strokelike deterioration can occur in a patient with a brainneoplasm. Migrainous aura may be confused with a transientischemic attack or stroke. 44 Blood Pressure Evaluation and Management Blood pressure measurement is critical in the hyperacute phase of stroke. A history of hypertension is common in AISpatients. A transient rise in blood pressure can also be found in previously normotensive patients; these elevations are expected and may represent the body's compensatory re-sponse to the acute cerebrovascular occlusion, enhancingcollateral flow. 95-98 Unless blood pressure elevations are in the range to cause hypertensive encephalopathy, they are generally not treated, to facilitate adequate cerebral perfusion pressure. The AHA Stroke Council recommends that emer- gency administration of antihypertensive agents be withheldunless diastolic blood pressure is /H11022120 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure is /H11022220 mm Hg in AIS patients who are not treated with thrombolytics. 13 For patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis, key data about treatment of hypertension in the emergent phase of stroke come from the 2 NIH-NINDS rtPA trials.67In these patients, systolic blood pressure was maintained at/H11021185 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure at /H11021110 mm Hg. If 2 consecutive readings showed systolic blood pressure /H11022185 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure /H11022110 mm Hg, fast-acting intravenous agents were used cautiously to lowerblood pressure. 13 Normally, an intrinsic process in cerebral blood vessels maintains constant brain blood flow regardless of systemic blood pressure, a concept known as autoregulation. In stroke, however, autoregulation may be impaired, particularly in the penumbra, where the cerebral blood flow is determined bysystemic blood pressure. In such cases, it may be necessary toregulate systemic blood pressure. The attending physicianwill choose short-acting continuous infusion agents with a reliable dose-response relation and safety profile. 99When reduced blood pressure is desired, labetalol is preferred if the patient has tachycardia at baseline, whereas nicardipine, a pure peripheral vasodilator, is preferable if the patient has bradycardia, congestive heart failure, a history of bronchos-Table 8.

Neither of these agents appears to adversely affect ICP. Sodium nitro-prusside has theoretical drawbacks related to cerebral veno-dilation, with exacerbation of any elevations of ICP andimpairment of normal autoregulation. 100,101 The AHA guidelines recommend that blood pressure should not be treated in the hyperacute period unless 1 of thefollowing exists: Systolic blood pressure /H11022220 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure /H11022120 mm Hg after repeated mea- surements; cardiac ischemia, heart failure, or aortic dissection is present; thrombolytic therapy is planned; or ICH is iden-tified. 13Table 10 lists approaches to treatment of elevated blood pressure in AIS. If blood pressure does not decrease and cannot be main- tained below the target levels of 185/110 mm Hg, rtPA should not be administered. Blood pressure management during and after treatment with rtPA or other acute recanali-zation therapy includes monitoring every 15 minutes duringtreatment and then for another 2 hours, then every 30 minutesfor 6 hours, and then every hour for 16 hours. Administration of Thrombolytic Therapy The nurse is responsible for administration of rtPA to eligible patients. The rt-PA dose for AIS is less than the recom-mended dose for myocardial infarction or pulmonary embo-lism treatment. rtPA is packaged as a crystalline powder andreconstituted with sterile water. After reconstitution, the preparation is 100 mg total. The total dose for an individualpatient is calculated by multiplying the patient's weight perkilogram (up to 100 kg) by 0.9 mg. The total maximum dosefor a patient with AIS is 90 mg. (The remaining portion of thepreparation that will not be infused should be discarded toprevent accidental overdose.) To prevent accidental overdose,it is important to draw the waste dose from the bottle andverify the waste amount with another nurse before the rtPAbottle is connected to the intravenous pump tubing and administered to the patient. rtPA is administered in divided doses: 10% is given as a bolus over 1 minute, and the remaining 90% is administered as a continuous infusion overthe next 60 minutes. Before administering rtPA, the nurse should make sure that all intravenous lines are inserted. If needed, a Foley catheterand any other indwelling lines or tubes, including endotra-cheal tubes, should be inserted as well. There has been 1report of fatal hemorrhage due to traumatic intubation. 102 However, placement of lines and tubes should be rapid and should not delay administration of rtPA by more than a fewminutes. Intra-Arterial Thrombolysis The use of intra-arterial thrombolysis as an alternative tointravenous rtPA is becoming more widespread. Intra-arterialtherapy is based on the principle of delivering thrombolytictherapy at higher concentrations directly into the throm-bus. The intra-arterial approach gives AIS patients more treatment options and should be initiated by specially trainedinterventional radiologists. In selected cases, intra-arterialthrombolysis extends the window of intervention to 6 hoursafter the onset of ischemic stroke symptoms. 13The intra-ar-Table 9.

The nurse should educate patients and their families about this treatment and should also watch for treatment-related complications. In 1998, the PROlyse in Acute Cerebral Thromboembo- lism II (PROACT II) trial tested the effectiveness of the intra-arterial approach using prourokinase in patients withonset of stroke symptoms of /H110216 hours as a result of occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. 104The primary analysis, inten- tion to treat, was based on a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 at 3 months. The results were significant at P/H110050.04. Sixty-six percent of middle cerebral arteries were recanalizedin patients treated with recombinant prourokinase compared with 18% in the control group ( P/H110210.001). The ICH rate was 10% in the prourokinase group compared with 2% in thecontrol group. There was no difference in death rate. On thebasis of this single phase III trial, the Food and Drug Administration did not approve prourokinase for intra-arterialtreatment of stroke, and it has not been marketed. Otherthrombolytics, including rtPA and urokinase, have beenextrapolated as intra-arterial therapy within 6 hours of symp-tom onset in selected cases of AIS. The results of the cerebral angiogram and other radiolog- ical findings such as a hyperdense artery sign can help determine treatment options. Some authors have suggested that patients with a dense middle cerebral artery sign didbetter with intra-arterial thrombolysis than with intravenousthrombolysis, but there are no direct comparisons in clinicaltrials to prove this. 103,105,106 Combined therapy with intravenous thrombolysis and then intra-arterial thrombolysis is used occasionally. The Inter- ventional Management of Stroke study is evaluating thecombination of intravenous/intra-arterial administration oflow-dose intravenous (0.6 mg/kg) rtPA followed by 22 mg of intra-arterial rtPA therapy. Currently, phase III of thestudy is comparing conventional intravenous rtPA aloneTable 10.

Mechanical Devices The Merci Retriever (Concentric Medical, Mountain View,Calif) was the first retrieval device approved for clot retrac-tion in AIS patients who were not candidates for rtPA or whohad failed intravenous therapy. 108-110 The Penumbra System (Penumbra Inc, Alameda, Calif) was the second retrievaldevice approved to remove blood clots in patients withAIS. 111These devices have been used in combination with intravenous or intra-arterial therapy. Noser et al109have suggested that aggressive mechanical clot disruption mayhelp increase recanalization rates compared with intra-arterialthrombolysis. This information is not yet supported byclinical trials. Several other approaches to recanalization with device catheters are available. The EKOS catheter (EKOS Corp, Bothell, Wash) used in the Interventional Management ofStroke phase I and II trials delivered intra-arterial rtPA withconcurrent intra-arterial low-energy ultrasound. the thrombolytic ac-tivity of intravenous rtPA is being evaluated in phase IIclinical trials. 112These device catheters have been evaluated in safety and technical efficacy trials. Randomized, controlled clinical trials of both the Merci and EKOS devices must becompleted to evaluate their clinical efficacy. 107,113 Recommendations Class I 1. Emergency personnel should be highly trained in stroke care ( Class I, Level of Evidence B ). 2. Frequent neurological/stroke assessments should be done ( Class I, Level of Evidence C ); these should be done more frequently for patients receiving rtPA. 3. Supplemental oxygen should be given to patients with an oxygen saturation of /H1102192% and a decreased level of consciousness ( Class I, Level of Evidence C ). There is little evidence that supplemental oxygen should be provided routinely. 4. The stroke patient's head should be positioned in neutral alignment with the body, and the head of the bedshould be elevated 25\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 to help the patient handleoral secretions, especially if dysphagia is present ( Class I, Level of Evidence C ). 5. Stroke patients in the ED should be kept NPO (not given anything orally) until ability to swallow is as-sessed ( Class I, Level of Evidence B ). 6. Intravenous access should be obtained in at least 2 sites, with 1 site for administration of rtPA and 1 site fordelivery of intravenous fluids or other medications if thepatient is a candidate for rtPA ( Class I, Level of Evidence C ). 7. Only nondextrose, normotonic intravenous fluids such as normal saline should be used in the AIS patient(Class I, Level of Evidence C ). 8. Intravenous rtPA should be administered without delay and should not be excluded in an eligible patient ( Class I, Level of Evidence A ). 9. See Table 11 for additional medical recommendations.Phase 2: Acute Care During the acute care phase, nursing care should focus on continued stabilization of the stroke patient through frequentevaluation of neurological status, blood pressure manage-ment, and prevention of complications. Medical management focuses on establishing the cause or etiology of AIS, preven- tion of treatment-related complications, and evaluation ofsecondary prevention strategies. There is considerable evi- dence that dedicated stroke teams, units, and coordinated care improve clinical outcomes in the acute care phase. 5,7,57,114-121 Clinical Pathways and Stroke Order Sets Specific order sets (standing orders) that address issues such as control of blood glucose, parameters to treat fever, andconsultations with other multidisciplinary team members should be developed. The Brain Attack Coalition recom- mends succinct, organized stroke care in its recommendationsfor the development of primary stroke centers. 10 Specific Care in the Acute Phase: Immediate Medical and Nursing Management A key element of the management of patients with acute stroke is to prevent deterioration and medical complications,Table 11. Medical Recommendations Recommendation Class and Level of Evidence Class I: CT or MRI of the head should be performed emergently in patients whopresent to the ED within the 3-h window.Class I, Level of Evidence A In the ED setting, laboratory tests should be obtained and processed rapidly to facilitate rapid assessment of the strokepatient, especially one who is a candidatefor rtPA. At a minimum, the followingtests should blood chemistries, andcoagulation studies (PT, aPTT, and INR).Class I, Level of Evidence A The use of intra-arterial thrombolysis isreasonable in select patients with a largeMCA clot presenting withi n6ho f stroke onset or who have contraindications tointravenous thrombolysis.Class I, Level of Evidence B Interventional treatment should beprovided by a qualified interventionalist incenters that meet the guidelines forcomprehensive stroke centers.Class I, Level of Evidence C When intra-arterial rtPA is considered,intravenous rtPA should always be givenif the patient is eligible.Class I, Level of Evidence C Class IIa: The Merci Retriever and PenumbraSystem is a reasonable intervention forextraction of thrombi, but both requirefurther evaluation of clinical efficacy.Class IIa, Level of Evidence B Intra-arterial thrombolysis is reasonable contraindications to use ofintravenous such as recentsurgery.Class IIa, Level of Evidence B CBC indicates complete blood count; PT, prothrombin time; and MCA, middle cerebral artery.Summers et al Nursing Care of the Acute Ischemic Stroke Patient 11 by on July 2, 2009 stroke.ahajournals.org Downloaded from such as respiratory problems associated with smoking or pneumonia, hypertension, hyperglycemia, dehydration, mal-nourishment, fever, coronary artery disease, cerebral edema, infection, and thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] or pulmonary embolism). These all worsen overallpatient outcome. 13,82,122-131 To provide high-quality care, nurses must coordinate the activities of the multidisciplinary team. Clinical pathways or physician standing orders can guide the team in managing stroke patients and are useful for coordinating diagnostic tests and appropriate therapies and care issues. Clinical pathways improve coordination of acute stroke care and dischargeplanning, decrease hospital costs, decrease readmission rates,reduce length of hospital stay, and enhance usefulness of outcome measurement and quality improvement. 114,132,133 Examples of professional resources including clinical path- ways, guidelines, and standing orders can be found on theAHA Web site (http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier /H110053047992) and the Brain Attack Coalition Web site (http://www.stroke-site.org). Intensive Management Experts estimate up to 30% of all stroke patients willdeteriorate in the first 24 hours. 13,129 This statistic supports the need for intensive monitoring by nurses specificallytrained in acute stroke care. Patients who receivethrombolytic therapy should also be monitored closely for atleast 24 hours after treatment. Care may be provided in adesignated intensive care unit or a stroke unit with continuouscardiac telemetry. In either area, nurses are trained in the care of patients after thrombolysis, are aware of bleeding compli- cations, are trained in the use of appropriate neurologicalassessment tools, and are adept at recognizing the signs ofincreasing ICP often related to large stroke lesions. 86The nurse-patient ratio is 1:2 for the first 24 hours; then, if the patient's condition is stable, the ratio is 1:4 asappropriate. 53,134 Bleeding assessment after administration of rtPA is the responsibility of the clinical nurse, who monitors the patientfor major and minor bleeding complications in the first 24 to36 hours after administration of rtPA. 84,135 ICH is the major bleeding complication associated with thrombolytic thera-py. 83,135 In the NINDS trials, 6.4% of treated patients had symptomatic ICH, which is defined as \"any CT-documentedhemorrhage that was temporally related to deterioration in thepatient's clinical condition in the judgment of the clinicalinvestigator\" within 36 hours of treatment. 135Studies have shown that there is a natural rate of hemorrhagic transforma-tion in ischemic stroke, and some studies suggest thatpetechial hemorrhages are frequently found in almost allcerebral infarcts. 135-138 The use of thrombolytics increases the risk of serious hemorrhagic transformation. The nurse mustidentify which patients are at higher risk of ICH. One studyhas shown that only 3% of patients with an NIHSS score of/H1102110 who were treated with rtPA had symptomatic ICH compared with 17% of those with an NIHSS score /H1102220. 135 Other studies have shown that hemorrhagic transformationsare more frequent when there has been a deviation from thenational guidelines treatment protocol. 139-142 Age/H1102280 yearswas determined to be an independent factor in development of hemorrhage after administration of rtPA.75,143 Hemor- rhagic transformation should be suspected if there is a change in level of consciousness, elevation of blood pressure, dete- rioration in motor examination, onset of new headache, or nausea and vomiting. If hemorrhage is suspected, the rtPAinfusion should be discontinued immediately. 84Management of ICH includes immediate physician notification and attain- ment of rapid brain imaging and laboratory work, including prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level, complete blood count with platelets, and, if not already done, type andcross-match. The nursing staff must be prepared to administer6t o8Uo f cryoprecipitate containing factor VIII and 6 to 8 U of platelets. 83,84The physician will decide on further action in collaboration with other team members, such as theconsulting neurosurgeon. Facilities that treat patients withthrombolytics should have a hemorrhage algorithm (Table12) and clinical guidelines to expedite assessment and man-agement of a new ICH. Other major bleeding complicationsobserved after thrombolytic therapy are retroperitoneal, gen- itourinary, and gastrointestinal hemorrhages. Minor bleeding complications are common, such as oozing from gums andvenipuncture sites, as well as hematuria and hemoptysis. 84 Assessment of the patient's skin may identify hematomas or areas of ecchymosis or purpura. If the patient has antecubitalvenous access, automatic blood pressure cuffs should be usedwith caution to prevent formation of a hematoma in thepatient's arm. The cuff site should be checked frequently,rotated, and repositioned every 2 hours. If petechiae arenoticed under the automatic blood pressure cuff, use of the cuff should be discontinued. To prevent trauma during oral care, soft sponges should be used instead of toothbrushes inthe first 24 hours. Invasive procedures such as arterialpunctures or insertion of catheters or nasogastric tubes shouldalso be avoided in the first 24 hours after treatment. 84 Neurological Stroke Assessment, Including the NIHSS Intensive monitoring of stroke patients includes frequent monitoring of neurological assessment, including blood pres-sure, heart rate, and respirations. In patients treated withthrombolysis, blood pressure should be assessed at 15-minuteintervals for 2 hours, every 30 minutes for the next 6 hours,and then once per hour until 24 hours after initiation ofthrombolytic therapy. A complete bedside NIHSS assessment may be performed on admission to the intensive care unit, and an abbreviated version can be performed with morefrequent assessments (Table 9). 86The complete scale should be used if there is a decline in the abbreviated scale score.65,84 The NIHSS provides valuable prognostic information and has been correlated with infarct volume.13,86,144 Patients with an NIHSS score of /H1102110 have a much more favorable outcome at 1 year than patients with an NIHSS score of /H1102220.144The nurse can use the NIHSS to identify patients who are at higherrisk for ICH after thrombolytic treatment. In the NINDS rtPAtrial, patients with an NIHSS score of /H1102222 had a 17% risk of ICH, whereas those with an NIHSS score of /H1102110 had only a12 Stroke August 2009 by on July 2, 2009 stroke.ahajournals.org Downloaded from 3% risk of ICH.13The NIHSS may be useful for working with families on discharge planning needs.145,146 In 1 study of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients, a 24-hour NIHSS score of /H110215 increased by nearly 5-fold the likelihood of discharge to home rather than inpatient rehabilitation or askilled nursing facility. 145,146 Ongoing Blood Pressure Management Blood pressure is a critical vital sign in the AIS patient. It isnot uncommon to see variations in blood pressure after AIS. 96 Blood pressure is elevated in /H1101540% to 80% of all AIS patients,96especially in the first 24 to 48 hours after stroke, and will fall 10 to 14 days after the acute phase.147Elevated blood pressure may increase cerebral perfusion in the ische-mic zone, where autoregulation is lost and perfusion ispressure dependent. 148The current guidelines recommend maintaining blood pressure at /H11021180/105 mm Hg for 24 hours in patients who have received thrombolytic therapy.13It is recommended that antihypertensive treatment be initiated fornonthrombolytic candidates only if systolic blood pressure is/H11022220 mm Hg or diastolic pressure is /H11022110 mm Hg. 13 Blood pressure should be monitored and assessed contin- ually for causative factors of rises. Elevated blood pressuremay be due to a physiological response to hypoxia, increasing ICP, hemorrhagic transformation, full bladder, pain, nausea, aloud environment, or preexisting hypertension. 13,149,150 The ASA blood pressure guidelines may be included in standing physician orders to expedite treatment of elevated bloodpressure in the phase that immediately follows thrombolytictherapy. 13At present, the optimum blood pressure in the immediate poststroke period is unclear and controversial, andfurther scientific evidence is needed. 151,152 There is evidence, however, that rapid lowering of blood pressure may induceworsening of neurological symptoms by inducing loweredperfusion pressures to the area of ischemia. 149,153,154 Arterial hypotension is rare in the AIS patient but may be associated with volume depletion or decreased cardiac outputrelated to arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia. Patients withhypotension require evaluation with advanced neurologicalnursing assessment and telemetry monitoring. Treatment consists of volume replacement with normal saline andcorrection of arrhythmias. Temperature Management Fever appears to exacerbate the ischemic injury to neurons and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality,Table 12. Nursing Alert!

Immediate treatment of the source of the fever will reduce its dura- tion. 82,157 One approach to maintaining normothermia is to immediately begin acetaminophen at 99.6\u00b0F.158,159 Even more rapid induction of cooling can be achieved by additionally treating temperature elevation with indwelling catheter tem- perature control systems or surface cooling systems.158,159 Continuous Cardiac Monitoring Cardiac monitoring is recommended for all ischemic stroke patients.13,160,161 Studies suggest that insular lesions can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.13Arrhyth- mias such as ventricular ectopy, tachycardia, and heart blockshave been associated with AIS. 162Right hemispheric infarcts have been associated with a higher incidence of arrhythmias,possibly due to sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system dysfunction. 163Atrial fibrillation, often paroxysmal, is commonly first detected only after it has caused cardioem- bolic stroke. If cardiac output is compromised, arrhythmias may further aggravate an already compromised cerebral blood flow. If not completed as part of the initial ED workup,a 12-lead ECG can be completed on admission. Many strokepatients have underlying cardiac problems and are at risk foran acute myocardial infarction during the acute stages of stroke. Patients may also need a cardiac evaluation by acardiologist during the acute stages of stroke. If telemetry isunavailable, a Holter monitor can be used to check forarrhythmias. 13 Assessment of Oxygenation Monitoring of oxygen saturation will reduce the risk of neurological deterioration related to hypoxemia. Supplemen-tal oxygen at 2 to 4 L/min is recommended for an oxygen saturation of /H1102192%. 13,164 Many factors compromise adequate oxygenation, for example, decreased level of consciousness, aspiration, and atelectasis. Vigilant assessment of the pa- tient's lung sounds and ability to swallow will keep the nurse aware of pending threats to adequate oxygenation.13,135,165 If an oxygen saturation of 92% cannot be maintained, arterial blood gases and a chest radiograph are recommended. In the absence of hypoxemia, supplemental oxygen is not recommended.87 Angioedema Large prospective cohort studies have shown that orolingual angioedema occurs in a small proportion (1% to 2%) ofpatients with AIS or acute myocardial ischemia treated with rtPA. This was more commonly seen in patients with frontal cortex and insular ischemia, in patients who had receivedalteplase and were concurrently taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. 102In most cases, symp- toms were mild and transient. The pharmacological insert thataccompanies rtPA addresses this and recommends that pa- tients be monitored during infusion and for several hoursafterward for signs of allergic reaction that exhibits asorolingual angioedema (http://www.gene.com/gene/products/information/cardiovascular/activase/insert.jsp). Treatment intravenous corticosteroids, or epinephrine.It is important for emergency and intensive care unit nurses toevaluate patients closely for throat or mouth edema and lookfor any difficulty in breathing due to angioedema. Blood Glucose Monitoring: Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia in critically ill patients has long been associ- ated with complications. Infarct expansion, hemorrhagic con-version, and poor clinical outcomes have been reported in the AIS population. 124Even the benefit of recanalization after use of thrombolytics may be reduced.166-168 Increased blood glucose provides additional substrate for anaerobic metabo- lism, which promotes lactic acidosis and free radical produc- tion. Elevated serum glucose is common in the acute phase of stroke and may be related to uncontrolled or undetecteddiabetes mellitus or stress-induced hyperglycemia the time ofinsult. 167,169-174 In 1 study, elevated glucose was present in two thirds of AIS patients.175Treatment with insulin confers a protective effect in critically ill patients.164,165 The ASA 2007 \"Guidelines for the Early Management of Adults With Ischemic Stroke\" recommend the use of rapid-acting insulin for a blood glucose level /H11022140 mg/dL.13 Several studies have shown that elevated blood glucose is an independent factor in poor functional outcomes, increased infarct size, increased length of stay (7 versus 6 days), increased mortality at 30 days, and increased cost ($6611 versus $5262).176-178 Not only did patients have poorer out- comes associated with hyperglycemia, but in an analysis of the NINDS rtPA trial, it was found that the risk of hemorrhagic transformation increased by 75% per 100 mg/dL of blood glucose.167,177-180 Poorer outcomes were also seen in patients with a glucose level /H11022140 mg/dL after administration of rtPA. There is speculation that elevated glucose levels may prevent early reperfusion and eliminate the benefit of rtPA.166-168 Several nonrandomized studies have suggested improved outcome if there is an acute reversal of hyperglycemia.167,181-184 The Glucose Insulin in Stroke Trial (GIST), a multicenter, randomized trial, recruited 933 patients and evaluated the useof variable-dose glucose and potassium insulin (GKI) versus saline infusions in stroke patients with glucose levels of 6.0 to 17.0 mmol/L ( /H11015300 mg/dL and defined as mild to moderate hyperglycemia). 185The purpose of the GKI infusion was to maintain glucose at 4 to 7 mmol/L (euglycemic); there was no glucose intervention in the control group after stroke. Most patients were entered in the study within 24 hours after onset of stroke symptoms. The primary outcome was death at 90days. The study was stopped early owing to low recruitment.Based on the intention-to-treat data, there was no significantreduction in morbidity or mortality at 90 days in the inter- vention group (GKI versus control: odds ratio 1.14, 95%confidence interval 0.86 to 1.52, P/H110050.37). Plasma glucose14 Stroke August 2009 by on July 2, 2009 stroke.ahajournals.org Downloaded from concentrations and blood pressure were significantly reduced in the GKI group. The investigators' interpretation of thisstudy was that although the intervention group had lowerglucose and blood pressure levels, there was not a significantclinical benefit. The study was underpowered, and an alter- native result could not be excluded. 186More randomized clinical trials are needed to understand the optimal level of blood glucose and best treatment modalities to produce thebest clinical outcomes in stroke patients. The nurse should monitor the blood glucose level based on the patient's glucose level at admission. 176If blood glucose is /H11022140 mg/dL and the patient has received thrombolytic therapy, it may be prudent to monitor glucose every 1 to 2hours, because there is evidence that these patients are moreprone to ICH. Treatment for hyperglycemia may be insti- tuted, depending on individual hospital insulin or oral hypo-glycemic treatment protocols. In patients who have notreceived thrombolysis, glucose may be monitored every 6hours in the first 24 to 48 hours and continued if the patientis known to have diabetes. It is also important to evaluate theneed for diabetic education whether or not the patient is aknown or newly diagnosed diabetic. Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia can uncommonly cause focal neurological deficit and mimic stroke. If present, it should be correctedpromptly with administration of 1 ampule of 50% dextrose. Cerebral Edema After Stroke Cerebral edema is a common complication of large multilo-bar infarctions. It usually peaks 3 to 5 days after AIS and isnot a significant problem in the first 24 hours except inpatients with large cerebellar infarcts or in younger strokepatients. Young people usually do not have significant cerebral atrophy, thereby allowing no room for swelling. ICPincreases as a result of cerebral edema, and monitoring forincreased ICP should be part of the ongoing assessment ofAIS patients. When invasive ICP monitoring is not available,the nurse must rely on the less accurate clinical signs ofincreasing pressure, which can include change in level ofconsciousness, worsening neurological deficits, new pupil-lary changes, or changes in respiratory patterns. 13Changes in level of consciousness are an early sign of increasing ICP, whereas pupillary changes are a late sign. Hydrocephalusmay also develop as a result of obstruction of the cerebralspinal fluid pathways. Imaging studies will identify mass effect, which includes frontal horn compression, or shift ofthe septum pellucidum or the pineal gland. These signsdemonstrate that the patient is at risk of clinically wors-ening and increasing pressure that can lead to brainherniation. The treatment plan goals should be to (1)reduce ICP, (2) maintain cerebral perfusion pressure toprevent worsening cerebral ischemia, and (3) preventsecondary brain injury 13(Table 13). Hypotonic fluids containing excess free water should be avoided in patients who have or are at risk for cerebral edema.13The nurse must evaluate the patient for hypoxia,hypercarbia, or hypothermia that may lead to elevated ICP. The head of the bed should be elevated 20\u00b0 to 30\u00b0, the neckshould be in a neutral position to facilitate venous drainage,and the airway should be assessed for patency. As ICPincreases, the patient's blood pressure may rise to maintainadequate cerebral perfusion pressure. The use of an aggres-sive antihypertensive agent with venodilating effects, such asnitroprusside, should be avoided because it can cause cerebralvenodilation and can lead to a more elevated ICP. Forcerebellar infarcts and hemorrhages in which hydrocephalus and a generalized increase in ICP are an issue, an ICP catheteris usually not inserted. For large hemispheric infarcts and hemorrhages, herniation rather than generalized increasedICP is the main concern, and ICP monitoring is generally nothelpful. ICP treatment may include modest hyperventilationto decrease P CO2by 5 to 10 mm Hg to produce enough vasoconstriction to temporarily lower ICP.13However, hy- perventilation is only a temporary measure, and brain perfu- sion may be compromised as vasoconstriction occurs. Fre- quent neurological assessments must be done to look for potential changes in brain perfusion.13On the basis of studies conducted primarily among the head injury patient popula- tion, it has become clear that some nursing care activities increase ICP transiently in some patients; however, it is not possible to identify any given activity that is uniformlydetrimental to patients with increased ICP. Therefore, nursesneed to evaluate each patient's physiological response 187,188 Osmotic diuretics such as furosemide or mannitol can be used to treat cerebral edema. Intravenous mannitol (0.25 to 0.50 g/kg) administered over 20 minutes can be given every 6 hours. Serum and urine osmolality should be monitored if mannitol is used; however, a Cochrane systematic reviewfound no evidence that routine use of mannitol reducedcerebral edema or improved stroke outcome in AIS. 189Lasix 40 mg can be used as adjunctive therapy but should not be used long-term. Barbiturates can be used for severe cerebral edema. Continuous electroencephalographic monitoringTable 13. Nursing Alert: Recognizing Increased ICP Signs and symptoms of increasing ICP-a medical emergency Early signs: decreased level of consciousness, deterioration in motor function, headache, visual disturbances, changes in blood pressure orheart rate, changes in respiratory pattern Late signs: pupillary abnormalities, more persistent changes in vital signs, changes in respiratory pattern with changes in arterial blood gases Intervention: thorough neurological assessment, notify physician immediately, emergency brain imaging, maintain ABCs General measures to prevent elevation of ICP HOB up 30\u00b0 or as physician specifies; reverse Trendelenburg positionmay be used if blood pressure is stable. Head position may be one of thesingle most important nursing modalities for controlling increased ICP Good head and body alignment: prevents increased intrathoracic pressure and allows venous drainage. Pain management: provide good pain control on a consistent basisKeep patient normothermic HOB indicates head of bed.Summers et al Nursing Care of the Acute Ischemic Stroke Patient 15 by on July 2, 2009 stroke.ahajournals.org Downloaded from should be performed if barbiturates are administered. Hypo- thermia can also be used to treat elevated ICP.13Unfortu- nately, all of these modalities are short-lived and palliative atbest. The recommendations for reducing cerebral edema need further study with regard to AIS. Currently, there is no clinical evidence that the measures discussed reduce cerebraledema or improve outcome in patients with ischemic brainswelling. 13,189 If hydrocephalus is present, fluid drainage through an intraventricular catheter can rapidly reduce ICP. Surgical decompression (hemicraniectomy) is the most definitive and invasive treatment of massive cerebral edema. Large cerebel- lar infarctions and hemorrhages that cause direct cerebellarcompression of the brain stem are best treated with surgicaldecompression. 190-192 Surgical evacuation may be done in patients with large hemispheric infarcts, but survivors have severe residual neurological deficits.193-200 Subsequent to a 2002 Cochrane review that found some evidence for benefitfrom surgical decompression, 201larger nonrandomized pro- spective trials have shown a reduction in the mortality rate ofpatients who have hemicraniectomy of large lesions involv- ing the middle cerebral artery territory. 193-200,202 A recent pooled analysis of 3 randomized, controlled clinical trials (DEcompressive Craniectomy In MALignant middle cerebral artery infarcts [DECIMAL], DEcompressive Surgery for the Treatment of malignant INfarction of the middle cerebralarterY [DESTINY], infarction with Trial[HAMLET]) in patients with malignant middle cerebral infarct showed that decompressive surgery performed within48 hours of stroke onset reduced mortality and yielded morefavorable outcomes. 123,203 Seizures Seizures are a possible complication of large cortical strokes and can be potentially life-threatening if notcontrolled. They can occur at the time of AIS, during the first few days after the event, or several months later. No study has specifically tested the usefulness of anticonvul-sant medications in preventing or controlling seizures afterstroke. Drugs proven to be of value in preventing seizuresfrom other causes, however, are recommended for patients who have had more than 1 seizure after stroke. 204Routine prophylactic administration of anticonvulsant drugs to stroke survivors who have not had seizures should be avoided.13A study of 3552 SAH patients in 21 countries found that anticonvulsant drugs were commonly used but were associated with more in-hospital complications and poorer outcomes.205No similar studies were found regard- ing AIS. If an anticonvulsant drug is required, the nurse must educate the patient and family about the seizure condition, pharmacological management, the medication regimen fortreatment of seizures, and the side effects and precautions.The patient must be told to never adjust or take additionalmedications without consulting the physician. Patients may not have another seizure, but they and their families should beeducated that the risk is ongoing.Recommendations Class I 1. Stroke neurological assessments should be performed every 4 hours after the hyperacute phase of stroke, and then frequency should be based on the patient'sstability and other comorbid conditions ( Class I, Level of Evidence B ). 2. Temperatures /H1102299.6\u00b0F should be managed aggressively (Class I, Level of Evidence C ). 3. Continuous cardiac monitoring of the stroke patient should be provided for at least 24 to 48 hours after stroke to detect potential cardiac problems ( Class I, Level of Evidence B ). 4. Careful, frequent monitoring and assessment for wors- ening of neurological deficits or bleeding should beperformed for up to 24 hours after thrombolytic therapy (Class I, Level of Evidence B ). 5. Hyperglycemia should be treated in patients with a serum glucose concentration /H11022140 mg/dL ( Class I, Level of Evidence C ). 6. Management of arterial hypertension in the acute phase should be approached with caution because of the lackof data available to guide management ( Class I, Level of Evidence C ). 7. Oxygenation should be evaluated with an oxygen satu- ration monitor ( Class I, Level of Evidence C ). 8. To prevent aspiration pneumonia, the patient's lungs should be auscultated, and the patient should be evalu-ated for signs of respiratory compromise and dysphagia (Class I, Level of Evidence C ). Nurses should report seizure activity, and treatment should begin immedi- ately ( Class I, Level of Evidence B ). Prophylactic treatment of seizures should not be given. Class IIa 1. It is reasonable to use clinical pathways, protocols, or preprinted stroke order sets to organize care of thestroke patient ( Class IIa, Level of Evidence B ). Diagnostic Testing During the Acute Phase Overview of Neuroimaging in Stroke Diagnostic imaging techniques include CT, MRI, magnetic resonance angiography, CT angiography, conventional an- giography, and carotid and the cervical and cephalic arteries.13Imaging of extracranial and intracranial cerebral blood vessels may be essential for understanding the mechanism of AIS. The presence of a high-grade stenosis, occlusion, dissection, or vascular anom- aly indicates the events that led to the stroke. The nurse willneed to educate the patient and family regarding each test andwhat to expect. Computed Tomography Imaging in the hyperacute phase was discussed above. A repeat CT or MRI brain scan should be done 24 hours afterthe initial stroke event in patients treated with thrombolysis orin any situation in which the patient is clinically deterioratingto assess hemorrhagic transformation and infarct progression. The CT scan is still considered the gold standard in AIS16 Stroke August 2009 by on July 2, 2009 stroke.ahajournals.org Downloaded from treatment, although recent technology has led to more sophis- ticated multimodal approaches in stroke imaging and CT angiography provide a mapof cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow, and meantransit time. These studies identify the ischemic core andpneumbra regions that can guide the decision for furtherinterventional treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI demonstrates evidence of ischemic injury to the brain earlier than CT for all ischemic stroke subtypes. Magneticresonance Newer mul-timodal techniques (eg, diffusion-weighted imaging andperfusion-weighted imaging) have further increased the sen- sitivity of MRI. The advantage of diffusion-weighted imagingis early identification of the ischemic area within minutes of onset of acute stroke. Perfusion-weighted imagingindicates the hemodynamic status of cerebral blood flow.A diffusion-perfusion mismatch shows an ischemic pen-umbra change in perfusion without a diffusion abnormal-ity. This is an opportunity to identify irreversible versusreversible cerebral tissue. If there is no mismatch, the hopeof salvageable tissue is less. Treatment modalities and timeto treatment may change as more is learned about theischemic penumbra. 13,206-208 Ultrasonography Carotid duplex scanning is the standard ultrasound test initially used to screen for cervical internal carotid stenosis.Demonstration of stenosis /H1102260% is highly to 99%) stenosisand occlusion is not completely reliable. Cerebral Angiography Cerebral angiography is the best tool to accurately evaluate the surface characteristics of a stenosed artery and is consid-ered the \"gold standard\" for measuring the degree of stenosisof a cervical or cephalic artery. After the procedure, the nursewill perform frequent measurement of vital signs, neurolog-ical assessment, femoral and pedal pulse checks, and groin checks. The radiologist should be notified if a groin hema-toma or change in velocity of the pedal pulse develops.Postprocedure activity is restricted according to the closuredevice used and the patient's status. Transesophageal and Transthoracic Echocardiography All patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack should undergo a comprehensive assessment of cardiovascu- lar risk to identify those with the highest likelihood ofmorbidity and mortality due to unrecognized coronary heartdisease or the presence of a cardioembolic source ofstroke. 13,209,210 Transthoracic echocardiography is excellent for identifying ventricular sources, as a dyskinetic ventricular wall segment, whereas transesophageal echocar-diography excels or patent foramen ovale.Transthoracic echocardiography is the less invasive of the 2 procedures and is the most commonly ordered initial test to evaluate for a cardioembolic source of stroke. During atransesophageal echocardiogram, the nurse must monitor thepatient closely and position the patient to decrease risk ofaspiration if nausea or vomiting occurs. 210,211 Chest Radiograph A chest radiograph is no longer routinely recommended during the ED evaluation of stroke unless an underlying pulmonary or cardiac problem is suspected. Obtaining a chestradiograph may take valuable time that is needed to admin-ister rtPA within the 3-hour window. Therefore, a chestradiograph is not a high priority in the ED but is done during the acute phase of hospitalization. Recommendation Class I 1. All nurses should be familiar with the basic neuroim- aging testing for stroke patients so that they can educate and prepare patients and families ( Class I, Level of Evidence C ). General Supportive Care of Stroke: Remembering the Basics Medical and nursing management both focus on the prevention of subacute complications of stroke, includingmalnutrition, aspiration, pneumonia, UTI, bowel or blad-der dysfunction, DVT, pulmonary embolism, contractures,joint abnormalities, and skin breakdown. 130Depression is also common after stroke.212Even in specialized stroke units, up to 63% of patients experience 1 or more complicationsafter acute stroke. The most common complications during the first week in a Norwegian stroke unit were pain, fever, progress-ing stroke, and UTI; immobilization-related complications, such as pressure ulcers and clinical signs of DVT and pulmonaryembolism, had a very low incidence in this modern strokeunit. 213However, many stroke patients are not cared for in specialized units, so it behooves nurses to continue to be vigilant for the following areas of care related to prevention or rapiddetection of complications. 5,7,57,114-121,132,214-223 Infection Pneumonia and UTI are frequently seen in the acute phase after stroke. Fever or a change in level of consciousness should give the nurse a high index of suspicion for infection.Stroke patients frequently present to the hospital with a compromised chest radiograph or a UTI. Pneumonia is a serious complication occurring in the first 48 to 72 hours after AIS and accounts for approximately 15%to 25% of deaths associated with stroke. 13,224 Stroke- associated pneumonia increases length of stay, mortality, and hospital costs.224The most common cause of pneumonia is aspiration due to dysphagia.225Immobility and atelectasis can also lead to development of pneumonia. The patient's airwayand oxygenation must be monitored closely; some patientsmay require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventila-tion. Early mobility and good pulmonary care can help prevent pneumonia. 224Preventive measures in intubated pa-Summers et al Nursing Care of the Acute Ischemic Stroke Patient 17 by on July 2, 2009 stroke.ahajournals.org Downloaded from tients include ventilation in a semirecumbent position, posi- tioning of the airway, suctioning, early mobility, and short-ened use of intubation, if feasible. 226In a randomized trial, early prophylaxis with levofloxacin was beneficial inpreventing systemic infections. 227Nursing management includes prompt recognition and reporting of fever; thesource of the fever should be sought and treatment begun immediately. Early management of nausea and vomiting can help prevent aspiration pneumonia; use of antiemeticmedications is warranted in this situation. Suctioning ofthe airway should be done carefully if increased ICP ispresent. 228 UTIs are common, occurring in approximately 15% to 60% of stroke patients, and independently predict poor out- come.122,130,229-231 The use of an indwelling catheter and changes in sphincter control increase the risk of UTI. Indwell-ing catheters should be avoided if possible but are often required in the acute phase of stroke. The catheter should be removed as soon as the patient is medically and neurologi-cally stable. Intermittent catheterization may lessen the risk ofinfection. External catheters, incontinence pants, and inter- mittent catheterization are alternatives to an indwelling cath- eter. The patient should be assessed for UTI if there is achange in level of consciousness and no known reason forneurological deterioration. A urinalysis and urine cultureshould be obtained if UTI is suspected. 13,229,232,233 Bowel and Bladder Care Constipation is the most common bowel problem. The nurse should assess the patient's premorbid bowel elimination pattern, bowel sounds, and abdominal distention, if present.The patient should also be evaluated for hydration andimpaction. The nurse must request medications if needed ordevelop a bowel program, which can integrate the use of stoolsofteners, laxatives, and enemas to prevent constipation earlyafter stroke. The most common urinary complication is incontinence, which occurs 30% to 60% of the time in the early recoveryperiod. 234An infarct in the frontal lobe or the pons lead to incontinence. Voiding problems include neurogenic blad-der; hyperreflexia with urge andfrequency; and urinary retention with or without overflowincontinence. After the indwelling catheter is removed, inter-mittent catheterization may be necessary to retrain the blad-der. Intermittent catheterization should occur every 4 to 6hours to prevent filling of the bladder beyond 500 mL and tostimulate normal physiological filling and emptying. Inter-mittent catheterization is recommended if postvoid residualurine volume is /H11022100 mL. 235 Urinary incontinence can increase the incidence titis, skin breakdown, UTIs, and perineal thrush. Urinaryincontinence also interferes with rehabilitation and is themajor factor in patients being discharged to nursing homes. 236 Voiding strategies should be incorporated into the daily planof care. The nurse must initiate a bladder-training program todecrease the number of incontinent episodes. The patientshould be offered a commode, bedpan, or urinal every 2 hoursduring waking hours and every 4 hours at night. Neurologicaldeficits may complicate the task of going to the bathroom.High fluid intake during the day and decreased fluid intake in the evening should be encouraged. Mobility and the Musculoskeletal System Stroke patients may be initially kept on bed rest but should be mobilized when they are hemodynamically stable. Earlymobilization reduces risk of atelectasis, pneumonia, DVT,and pulmonary embolism. Complications from immobilityaccount for up to 51% of deaths in the first 30 days afterischemic stroke. 237,238 Immobility can also lead to contrac- tures, orthopedic complications, atrophy, and nerve pressure palsies. The nurse should monitor the first transfer from bedto an upright position, because some patients may haveneurological worsening during movement. Joints on theparalyzed side must be positioned higher than joints proximalto it. The nurse must assess for deformities that may be foundon the affected side (eg, shoulder adduction). Subluxation ofthe affected shoulder is common, and special care should betaken to avoid pulling on the affected arm and shoulder whenrepositioning or moving the patient. Nursing interventions,including range-of-motion and positioning techniques, canprevent joint Pulmonary Embolism and embolism occurs more commonly than is sus- pected clinically and accounts for a substantial number of deaths after AIS. Wijdicks240found a sudden death rate of 50% in patients with pulmonary embolism that occurredbetween 3 and 120 days after the initial stroke event. In thatstudy, prophylaxis for DVT was noted in only 4 of 30patients. Pulmonary embolism was associated with DVTdiagnosed clinically or at autopsy in 11 patients and in theparalyzed leg. More recently, Indredavik and colleagues 213 found pulmonary embolism in fewer than 2.5% of patientsduring the first week in a specialized stroke unit. DVT andpulmonary emboli were more likely to occur in the first 3months after stroke, with an incidence of 2.5% and 1.2%,respectively. Both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients are at risk for developing DVT, especially as a result of paralysis orimpaired mobility. Prevention of DVT is one of the coreperformance measures for primary stroke center certification,and initiation of prevention has become a quality indicator inseveral populations. 241,242 Safe ambulation should be started as soon after stroke as possible. Pneumatic compressiondevices and compression stockings can be used to preventpulmonary embolism. 243,244 Until recently, anticoagulants such as low-molecular- weight heparinoids and unfractionated heparin were also used.245,246 The results of the Prevention of VTE after Acute Ischemic stroke with LMWH enoxaparin (PREVAIL) Trialshowed that a 40-mg injection of enoxaparin once daily was more effective than 5000 IU of unfractionated heparin twice a day for prevention of DVT in AIS patients. 247Stroke patients taking anticoagulants should be assessed for bleeding daily. Falls Falls are a common cause of injury in stroke patients, with hip fractures the most prevalent injury.248Hip fractures in the first18 Stroke August 2009 by on July 2, 2009 stroke.ahajournals.org Downloaded from 7 days after stroke are associated with a poor prognosis and have been recognized as a consequence of hemiplegia sincethe 1950s. 249Most fractures occur on the paretic side.250 Patients with right hemispheric infarcts that cause neglect orinattention have the highest fall risk. Minimization of fall risk is a global responsibility. Nurses must implement fall-prevention programs and educate other staff and family members about risks and fall precautions.These may include identifying patients at risk, use of alarmsystems, use of special equipment (eg, enclosure beds), and placing call buttons and the patient's belongings near the patient to prevent the patient from reaching for something andrisking a fall. Voiding times should be scheduled to preventfalls that occur when a patient tries to go to the bathroom. Insome cases, it may be necessary to have a sitter stay with thepatient to ensure the patient's safety. 249 Skin Care Stroke patients are at risk for skin breakdown because of loss of sensation and impaired circulation, older age, decreased level of consciousness, and inability to move themselvesbecause of paralysis. 239Related complications such as incon- tinence can accelerate skin breakdown. Major pressure areas are the heels, sacrum, and lateral malleoli. Patients should be examined for skin breakdown when repositioned and after sitting. Special care should be taken when moving patients toavoid excessive friction or pressure. 239Patients should not be left in 1 position for /H110222 hours. The skin must be kept clean and dry, and special mattresses should be used where indi- cated. The Braden Scale is commonly used to predict the risk of the development of pressure ulcers (decubitus). Nursingpersonnel can use this predictive model to design the care ofstroke patients with immobility and those who are at risk for the development of skin breakdown. 251-253 Detection of Dysphagia and Prevention of Aspiration Aspiration is frequently a result of dysphagia. In 2001, Galvan254found that approximately half of all aspirations due to dysphagia are \"silent\" and go unrecognized until there is a pulmonary manifestation or complication. Order sets should include a swallow assessment before oral intake, performed by a nurse; evaluation by a speech language pathologist; andinstitution of NPO status with intravenous normal saline at 75to 100 mL/h until evaluation by the speech language pathol- ogist. Swallow assessment requires an evidence-based tool. 225 The Massey Bedside Swallowing Screen has been successfully evaluated for interrater reliability and predictive validity.255 Optimally, swallow assessment is performed soon after the patient's arrival in the ED. Until then, the patient shouldremain on NPO status, which means no ice chips, no oral medications, no water, and no exceptions. 256The nurse should assess swallowing by direct observation, looking for the presence of choking, coughing, a wet voice, a delay in initiating swallow, uncoordinated chewing or swallowing, extended time eating or drinking, pocketing of food, and lossof food from the mouth. When oral intake is authorized, thenurse should follow the speech language pathologist's rec- ommendations, 257which include improving the patient's ability to concentrate while eating with minimal distractions. These assessments and interventions may make the differencebetween improved recovery and increased morbidity or even mortality.256 Nutritional Compromise Fifty percent of patients with severe strokes were reported to be malnourished at 2 to 3 weeks after the stroke.258Malnu- trition was associated with higher complications and poorerfunctional outcomes. 259,260 To avoid nutritional compromise, nutritional intervention should occur no later than 3 to 4 daysafter diagnosis of dysphagia. 5The Ontario Heart and Stroke Association suggests that early gastrostomy should be con-sidered 5if it is anticipated that dysphagia will continue beyond 6 weeks; however, dysphagia resolves in at least 87%of stroke patients. 257 A nutritional assessment of a patient can be performed by taking a diet history, with simple assessments such as bodymass index or more complex anthropometric measures such as midarm circumference or triceps skin-fold thickness. In the stroke patient, it can be difficult to obtain a diet historybecause of communication problems, and anthropometricmeasures may not be accurate owing to paralysis of the arm. When compromise of the patient's nutritional health is suspected, serum albumin levels may be checked; this is oftencited as an index for long-term maintenance but may not bereflective of nutritional status. 261,262 Serum albumin falls in acute illness owing to increased catabolism. No specific tool has been developed or tested in acute stroke patients to evaluate nutritional assessments.263 A dietitian can provide a more accurate assessment of nutritional health and nutrient needs. Without adequate nu- trition, there is a risk of weight loss, impaired immune system, increased weakness, increased length of stay, and mortality. Nutritional assessment should be performed on thestroke unit at the time of admission and throughout thehospital stay. The simplest but most valuable thing the nurse can do to monitor nutrition is to monitor the patient's weight and weight change over time and monitor the patient's dietaryintake. 263-265 Stroke may compromise the patient's ability to self-feed, which can impact self-esteem. A pleasant environment that encompasses patience and encouragement fosters hope in the stroke patient. Use of seasonings, the serving of foods at appropriate temperatures, and augmentation of food presen-tation may enhance appeal and compensate for the patient'sloss of taste or smell. An interdisciplinary approach to treating dysphagia will result in early detection and early intervention to minimize the impact on the patient's life,family, and healthcare costs. Recommendations Medical complications after stroke are common. The basics of care become critical care in the stroke patient. An over-riding concept is patient and family education at all steps of the acute care process. Class I 1. Infections, such as pneumonia and UTI, should be identified and treated immediately with antibiotics (Class I, Level of Evidence B ).Summers et al Nursing Care of the Acute Ischemic Stroke Patient 19 by on July 2, 2009 stroke.ahajournals.org Downloaded from 2. Early bowel and bladder care should be instituted to prevent complications such as constipation and urinary retention or infection ( Class I, Level of Evidence A ). Use of indwelling catheters should be avoided if possi-ble because of the risk of UTI ( Class I, Level of Evidence A ). 3. Early implementation of anticoagulant therapy or phys- ical compression modalities should be considered for all stroke patients who cannot ambulate at 2 days and whoare at risk for DVT or pulmonary embolus ( Class I, Level of Evidence A ). Early mobility should always be attempted if safe for the patient ( Class I, Level of Evidence B ). 4. Fall precautions should be initiated, and the stroke patient should be told not to ambulate without assis-tance ( Class I, Level of Evidence B ). 5. Frequent turning should be instituted in bedridden patients to prevent skin breakdown ( Class I, Level of Evidence A ). Use of the Braden Scale in nursing practice can assist in the prediction of stroke patients at high risk of developing pressure ulcers ( Class I, Level of Evidence A ). Range-of-motion exercises should start in the early phase of acute stroke careonce risk has been assessed ( Class I, Level of Evidence C ). 6. A swallow screen should be performed in the first 24 hours after stroke, preferably by the speech languagepathologist ( Class I, Level of Evidence B ). Nurses should be familiar with bedside swallow assessment if a formal evaluation cannot be done within the specified period. Stroke patients should be kept NPO until thescreen has been performed ( Class I, Level of Evidence B). Further studies of dysphagia in the setting of acute stroke should be performed. 7. Patients who cannot swallow should have a nasogastric tube placed, or if severity warrants, a percutaneousendoscopic gastrostomy tube should be placed ( Class I, Level of Evidence B ). Assessment of proper hydration is included in this recommendation. Class IIa 1. If an indwelling catheter is required, excellent pericare and prevention of infection modalities should be insti-tuted to prevent complications ( Class IIa, Level of Evidence C ). 2. The stroke patient can be fed either by intravenous infusion or through nasogastric or percutaneous en-doscopic gastrostomy tubes Class IIa, Level of Evidence B ). Class IIb 1. Nurses may provide passive range-of-motion exercises between physical therapy visits to help patients main-tain joint mobility and prevent complications of immo-bility ( Class IIb, Level of Evidence C ). The Nurse's Role in Secondary Prevention of Stroke Nurses historically have played an important role in patient and family education, both at the bedside and in the outpatientsetting. Stroke education includes explaining stroke, discuss-ing risk factors (with emphasis placed on those risk factorsthat are modifiable 266), and describing secondary prevention measures, including compliance with prescribed medications. The AHA guidelines for secondary prevention of stroke arebeing revised. Pertinent recommendations from the 2006guidelines are provided in Table 14. 267Nurses play a signif- icant role in education and lifestyle modification strategies,and therefore, they must stay current with changing standardsand how they translate into practice. Suggestions for reducingblood pressure include adopting the DASH (Dietary Ap-proaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, engaging in regularaerobic activity, and moderating alcohol intake. 268-273 Nurses should be familiar with smoking cessation programs andmaterials and should include this information in the dischargeplan of care. 274Guidelines for smoking cessation for both the clinician and the consumer are available from the Office ofthe Surgeon General (www.surgeongeneral.gov/tobacco/default.htm) and the Agency for Health Care Policy andResearch. For the stroke patient with atrial fibrillation, the nurse should explain that use of warfarin (to maintain an interna-tional normalized ratio of 2 to 3) is recommended forprevention of stroke unless an absolute contraindication toanticoagulation exists. The nurse should also discuss thepotential side effect of bleeding, interactions between warfa-rin and other drugs or certain foods, and the importance ofcompliance. The patient should be informed that weeklytesting is required when warfarin is begun, then monthlytesting when the international normalized ratio is stable.Specific educational aids are found in Table 15. Nurses can educate stroke patients about secondary pre- vention modalities. Patient education is a standard perfor-mance measure in primary stroke center certification (seehttp://www.jointcommission.org/CertificationPrograms/PrimaryStrokeCenters/stroke_measure_set.htm or http://www. jointcommission.org/CertificationPrograms/PrimaryStrokeCenters/guide_table_contents.htm). Patients should be taught therationale for administration of an antiplatelet drug and its potential side effects. They should also be taught that anti-platelet therapy is lifelong, not short term. Discharge Planning The discharge destination of stroke patients requires compre- hensive planning.275The NINDS suggests that 30% of stroke survivors will recover almost completely or with minorimpairments. 67,276 Another 40% will require subacute care, and 10% will require care in a skilled nursing facility. Theremaining 15% will die soon after stroke onset. Of all survivors, /H1101514% will experience recurrent stroke within 1 year of the primary event. Eventually, 68% to 74% of stroke survivors will require the care of family members in thehome. 277Detailed planning for postacute stroke care will optimize outcomes and reduce risk and may control financial burden. The average length of hospital stay for a stroke patient in 2006 was 4.9 days, which may not be enough time to learn the true impact of a stroke.278Order sets that include stroke team referrals will lead to initiation of early rehabilitation inter- vention. Such referrals include physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, nutritional assessment, psychology,20 Stroke August 2009 by on July 2, 2009 stroke.ahajournals.org Downloaded from Table 14. Recommendations for Secondary Stroke Prevention267 Risk Factor RecommendationClass/Level of Evidence Recommendations for treatable vascular risk factors Hypertension Antihypertensive treatment is recommended for prevention of recurrent stroke and other vascular events in persons who have had an ischemic stroke and are beyond the hyperacute period.I/A Because this benefit extends to persons with and without a history of hypertension, this recommendation should be considered for all ischemic stroke and TIA patients.I/B An absolute target BP level and reduction are uncertain and should be individualized, but benefit has been associated with an average reduction of /H1102110/5 mm Hg, and normal BP levels have been defined as/H11021120/80 by JNC-7.I/B Several lifestyle modifications have been associated with BP reductions and should be included as part of a comprehensive approach antihypertensive therapy.I/C Optimal drug regimen remains uncertain; however, available data support the use of diuretics and the combination of diuretics and an ACEI. Choice of specific drugs and targets should be individualized on the basis of reviewed data and consideration, as well as specific patient characteristics (eg, extracranial cerebrovascular occlusive disease, renal impairment, cardiac disease, and DM).I/A Diabetes More rigorous control of blood pressure and lipids should be considered in patients with diabetes. I/B Although all major classes of antihypertensive medications are suitable for the control of BP, most patients will require /H110221 agent. ACEIs and ARBs are more effective in reducing the progression of renal disease and are recommended as first-choice medications for patients with DM.I/A Glucose control is recommended to near-normoglycemic levels among diabetics with ischemic stroke or TIA to reduce microvascular complications.I/A The goal for Hb A1c should be /H113497%. I/B Cholesterol Ischemic stroke or TIA patients with elevated cholesterol, comorbid CAD, or evidence of an atherosclerotic origin should be managed according to NCEP III guidelines, which include lifestyle modification, dietary guidelines, and medication recommendations.I/A Statin agents are recommended, and the target goal for cholesterol lowering for those with CHD or symptomatic atherosclerotic disease is an LDL-C of /H11021100 mg/dL and mg/dL with multiple risk factors.I/A Patients with ischemic stroke or TIA presumed to be due to an atherosclerotic origin but with no preexisting indications for statins (normal cholesterol levels, no comorbid CAD, or no evidence of atherosclerosis) are reasonable to consider for treatment with a statin agent to reduce the risk of vascular events.IIa/B Ischemic stroke or TIA patients with low HDL-C may be considered for treatment with niacin or gemfibrozil.IIb/B Recommendations formodifiable behavioral riskfactors Smoking All ischemic stroke or TIA patients who have smoked in the past year should be strongly encouraged not to smoke.I/C Avoid environmental smoke. I/C Counseling, nicotine products, and oral smoking cessation medications have been found to be effective for smokers.IIa/B Alcohol Patients with prior ischemic stroke or TIA who are heavy drinkers should eliminate or reduce their consumption of alcohol.I/A Light to moderate levels of /H113492 drinks per day for men and 1 drink per day for nonpregnant women may be considered.IIb/C Obesity Weight reduction may be considered for all overweight ischemic stroke or TIA patients to maintain the goal of a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m 2and a waist circumference of /H1102135 in for women and /H1102140 in for men. Clinicians should encourage weight management through an appropriate balance of caloric intake, physical activity, and behavioral counseling.IIb/C Physical activity For those with ischemic stroke or TIA who are capable of engaging in physical activity, at least 30 min of moderate-intensity physical exercise most days may be considered to reduce risk factors and comorbid conditions that increase the likelihood of recurrence of stroke.IIb/C (Continued )Summers et al Nursing Care of the Acute Ischemic Stroke Patient 21 by on July 2, 2009 stroke.ahajournals.org Downloaded from Table 14. Continued Risk Factor RecommendationClass/Level of Evidence Physical activity For those with disability after ischemic stroke, a supervised therapeutic exercise regimen is recommended.IIB/C Recommendations for interventional approaches topatients with stroke caused bylarge-artery atheroscleroticdisease Extracranial carotid disease For patients with recent TIA or ischemic stroke within the past 6 months and ipsilateral severe (70% to 99%) carotid artery stenosis, CEA is recommended by a surgeon with a perioperative morbidity and mortality of /H110216%.I/A For patients with recent TIA or ischemic stroke and ipsilateral moderate (50% to 69%) carotid stenosis, CEA is recommended, depending on patient-specific factors such as age, gender, comorbidities, and severity of initial symptoms.I/A When degree of stenosis is /H1102150%, there is no indication for CEA. III/A When CEA is indicated, surgery within 2 weeks rather than delayed surgery is suggested. I/B Among patients with symptomatic severe stenosis ( /H1102270%) in whom the stenosis is difficult to access surgically, medical conditions are present that greatly increase the risk for surgery, or when other specific circumstances exist such as radiation-induced stenosis or restenosis after CEA, CAS is not inferior to endarterectomy and may be considered.IIb/B CAS is reasonable when performed by operators with established periprocedural morbidity and mortality rates of 4% to 6%, similar to that observed in trials of CEA and CAS.IIa/B Among patients with symptomatic carotid occlusion, EC/IC bypass surgery is not recommended routinely.III/A treatment of patients with symptomatic extracranial vertebral stenosis may be considered when patients are having symptoms despite medical therapies (antithrombotics, statins, and other treatments for risk factors).IIb/C Intracranial arterial disease The usefulness of endovascular therapy (angioplasty and/or stent placement) is uncertain for patients with hemodynamically significant intracranial stenoses who have symptoms despite medical therapies (antithrombotics, statins, and other treatments for risk factors) and is considered investigationalIIb/C Recommendations for patientswith cardioembolic stroketypes Atrial fibrillation (AF) For patients with ischemic stroke or TIA with persistent or paroxysmal (intermittent) AF, anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin (target INR, 2.5; range, 2.0 -3.0) is recommended.I/A In patients unable to take oral anticoagulants, aspirin 325 mg/d is recommended. I/A Acute MI and LV thrombus For patients with an ischemic stroke caused by an acute MI in whom LV mural thrombus is identified by echocardiography or another form of cardiac imaging, oral anticoagulation is reasonable, aiming for an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 for at least 3 months and up to 1 y.IIa/B Aspirin should be used concurrently for the ischemic CAD patient during oral anticoagulant therapy in doses up to 162 mg/d, preferably in the enteric-coated form.I/A Cardiomyopathy For patients with ischemic stroke or TIA who have dilated cardiomyopathy, either warfarin (INR, 2.0 to 3.0) or antiplatelet therapy may be considered for prevention of recurrent events.IIb/C Valvular heart disease,Rheumatic mitral valvediseaseFor patients with ischemic stroke or TIA who have rheumatic mitral valve disease, whether or not AF is present, long-term warfarin therapy is reasonable, with a target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 -3.0).IIa/C Antiplatelet agents should not be routinely added to warfarin in the interest of avoiding additional bleeding risk.III/C For ischemic stroke or TIA patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease, whether or not AF is present, who have a recurrent embolism while receiving warfarin, adding aspirin (81 mg/d) may be indicated.IIa/C Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) For patients MVP who have ischemic stroke or TIAs, long-term antiplatelet therapy is reasonable. IIa/C MAC For patients with ischemic stroke or TIA and MAC not documented to be calcific, antiplatelet therapy may be considered.IIb/C Among patients with mitral regurgitation resulting from MAC without AF, antiplatelet or warfarin therapy may be considered.IIb/C (Continued )22 Stroke August 2009 by on July 2, 2009 stroke.ahajournals.org Downloaded from and social services. Once assessed by each discipline, the patient's discharge planning process may begin. Neurological findings identified during the acute phase and throughout recovery will direct medical management, reha- bilitation, and the nursing plan of care. Deficits includealtered level of consciousness, confusion, behavioral distur-bances, cognitive deficits in higher functions such as memoryand ability to learn, motor deficits, disturbance in balance andcoordination, somatosensory deficits, disorders of vision,unilateral neglect, speech and language deficits, swallowingdisorder (dysphagia), and affective disorder. The rehabilita-tion medicine team (physiatrist, and speech, physical, andoccupational therapists) will evaluate the patient during theacute hospitalization and develop a rehabilitation plan fordischarge that will address the neurological deficits andappropriate rehabilitation needs. In addition, the rehabilita-tion team will give recommendations on the next level of careplacement. The nurse caring for the patient must communicate the discharge plan to the patient and family and be the liaisonbetween the patient/family and rehabilitation team and dischargeplanners. Table 16 identifies key strategies or components thatwill help nurses to facilitate successful discharge planning andtransition to the next level of care. 266,279,280 The goal of discharge planning is to ensure a safe transition between the acute care facility, rehabilitation, outpatient settings, primary care physician, and community while main-taining a continuity of care that will optimize rehabilitationpotential and ensure proper secondary prevention as appro- priate. Discharge planners (eg, social workers, case manag-ers) will integrate the concerns and expectations of theinterdisciplinary team with those of the patient, family, andassociated support system(s). Meeting the discharge needs forless obvious deficits (eg, memory problems) may pose asgreat a challenge as addressing needs related to overt hemi-paresis or aphasia. Teaching patients, families, and support systems how to identify and deal with the nuances of stroke will facilitate community reintegration and optimize outcomes. A study from a Cochrane review 281found that recovering stroke patients placed on a structured carepathway demonstrated significant improvement in func- tional ability and quality of life. Another study found that improved patient outcomes were highly dependent on supportsystems, including family support and an organized systemsapproach to meeting the discharge needs of the patient andfamily. 282 What if the stroke victim is too disabled to participate in or benefit from rehabilitation? Hospital staff plays a crucial role in discharge decisions.283Continued care options are skilled nursing care to assess for futurerehabilitation potential, skilled nursing care alone, pallia- tive care, or hospice care. In a 2003 report on public health and aging, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted that among the Medi- care population, postacute care was one of the fastest- growing categories, and stroke had the highest number of post-acute care beneficiaries. 284Additional findings suggest that after adjustment for stroke severity, organized home health care for this population resulted in overall improved functional outcomes and increased cost-effectiveness com- pared with other discharge facility options.284Reported costs of nursing home care approached $15.2 billion compared with a home healthcare cost of $3.8 billion.285These 2 resources should alert discharge planners to the potential forand challenges of an increasing trend to home discharge. Although outcomes for home care of stroke survivors are positive, home care may be associated with negative health outcomes for caregivers. 277Therefore, appropriate referrals to community resources, physician follow-up, support groups, governmental agencies, free services, faith-based communi- ties, and research opportunities must be incorporated into discharge planning. However detailed it may be, dischargeplanning may not address all family questions or preparefamily members for future issues. It is, however, the backdrop against which healing continues. The Advanced Practice Nurse's Role in Acute Stroke Care The role of the nurse-practitioner or clinical nurse specialist is vital to the care of AIS patients throughout the continuum.Table 14. Continued Risk Factor RecommendationClass/Level of Evidence Aortic valve disease For patients with ischemic stroke or TIA and aortic valve disease who do not have AF, antiplatelet therapy may be considered.IIb/C Prosthetic heart valves For patients with ischemic stroke or TIA who have modern mechanical prosthetic heart valves, oral anticoagulants are recommended, with an INR target of 3.0 (range, 2.5-3.5).I/B For patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves who have an ischemic stroke or systemic embolism despite adequate therapy with oral anticoagulants, aspirin 75 to 100 mg/d, in addition to oral anticoagulants, and maintenance of the INR at a target of 3.0 (range, 2.5-3.5) is reasonable.IIa/B For patients with ischemic stroke or TIA who have bioprosthetic heart valves with no other source of thromboembolism, anticoagulation with warfarin (INR, 2.0-3.0) may be considered.IIb/C JNC-7 indicates Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood et al Nursing Care of the Acute Ischemic Stroke Patient 23 by on July 2, 2009 stroke.ahajournals.org Downloaded from These roles will be referred to as advanced practice nurses (APNs) for the purpose of the present report. The APN plays an essential role in planning and leading a team to develop clinical tools, organizing team members anddepartments to expedite activities in the care of the AIS patient, and monitoring outcomes and initiating quality initi-atives to improve care. The Brain Attack Coalition recom-mends that a primary stroke center have at least 1 APN toimplement and coordinate program activities. 53One study showed that financial outcomes were signifi- cantly improved when APNs functioned as outcome manag- ers and collaborated with the multidisciplinary team to care for AIS patients.286Patients had shorter lengths of stay, lower rates of UTI and skin breakdown, and less time until mobilization. The hospital had 2306 fewer patient-days and a total cost savings of $2 467 328. Stroke programs have shown that APNs have been key in improving recognition and management of AIS pa- tients.287-290 The use of APNs in the Calgary Stroke Program enhanced patient care and patient satisfaction with continuity of care throughout hospitalization. Im- provements in the care process were also noted: CT image time was reduced from 60 to 30 minutes, door-to-needletime in administration of rtPA decreased from 90 to 60minutes, and consultation was faster. The APN can integrate education, research, manage- ment, leadership, and consultation into the clinical role inmaking decisions about clinical management, in diagnosticreasoning, and in developing therapeutic interventions forthe care of AIS patients. APNs are assuming leadershiproles in developing programs such as dysphagia teams,Table 15.

Effective Nursing Strategies for Successful Discharge Planning266,279,280 Involve patient's family/caregiver in assessment of postdischarge needs and decision making and treatment planning. Family and team meeting to discuss patient progress, rehabilitation goals, discharge needs or discharge issues, explanation of next level of care, providing care and support associated with these deficits and discussways to cope with stress associated with these impairments (eg,cognitive loss, urinary incontinence). Encourage the patient's family/caregiver to participate in the rehabilitation sessions and to be trained to assist the patient with functional activities. Predischarge needs assessment of home before discharge performed by an occupational therapist to evaluate home environment and determinesafety, need for home modification(s), and equipment needs. Consider availability of support services and the desires of the patient's family/caregiver. Caregiver training (multidisciplinary education about communication strategies if the patient is aphasic, positioning and handling, transfers,shoulder care, how to promote independence, according to individualpatient's strengths and limitations). Postdischarge follow-up (ensure plans are made for medical care, secondary prevention, rehabilitation, social support, home care, andnursing if needed, caregiver support and education). Provide education for patient's family/caregivers on stroke pathology, stroke prevention, stroke signs and symptoms, actions to take, follow-upappointments/therapy, treatment plan, and community resources and howto access. Education should be provided in interactive and written formatand documented in the medical record to facilitate communication ofeducation completed to other healthcare providers. Liaison with community providers, linkage with appropriate resources. Regular review of individual patient and caregiver psychosocial and support needs. Provision of information on discharge plans and postdischarge management to primary care physicians and community services. If the patient is aphasic, the nurse and rehabilitation team should assist in establishing a communication pattern with the patient'sfamily/caregiver before discharge.24 Stroke August 2009 by on July 2, 2009 stroke.ahajournals.org Downloaded from incontinence teams, and anticoagulation clinics and are actively involved in discharge, palliative care, and second-ary prevention clinics. 291-299 The Nurse's Role in Stroke Education in the Community A landmark study evaluating the knowledge of patients presenting to the ED was first conducted in 1997 and repeatedin 1998 and 2003. 300The first study showed that 40% of patients admitted did not know the signs, symptoms, or riskfactors of stroke. A need for further public education to increase awareness of stroke warning signs was identified, and all healthcare professionals were encouraged to becomeinvolved in community education. 300In 1998, a population- based interview was conducted in the greater Cincinnati,Ohio, area to establish the public's knowledge of risk factorsand warning signs of acute stroke. 301Fifty-seven percent correctly named only 1 of the 5 warning signs of strokedefined by the NINDS, and 68% could identify only 1stroke risk factor. Only 57% of patients with hypertensionsaid that they were at risk for stroke. Sixty percent ofpatients /H1102175 years of age correctly identified 1 warning sign of stroke compared with only 47% of patients /H1102275 years of age. 301As a result of organized community education in the greater Cincinnati region, communityawareness of stroke warning signs significantly improvedover time, but knowledge of risk of stroke based onindividual risk factors did not improve. 302 Studies have shown that some groups have less knowledge about stroke, delay seeking medical attention, and do notphone 9-1-1. These groups include the elderly, women, thosewith lower levels of education, and racial/ethnic populationssuch as blacks and Latinos. Healthcare professionals musteducate the public about stroke warning signs and risk factorsand actions to take when symptoms occur. 303,304 The effect of stroke screening on knowledge and behav- ioral changes has been studied.305One screening used the National Stroke Association guidelines. Participants wereevaluated before and after screening and 3 months after theevent. Knowledge increased from 59% to 94% immediatelyafter the event but at 3 months was only 77%. Only 27% ofpatients attending the screening had implemented an inter-vention to decrease stroke risk. 305Similar studies showed that /H1101550% of those attending a stroke screening made at least 1 behavioral change to reduce stroke risk and that communityeducation improved the participant's knowledge of strokewarning signs and symptoms. 306-308 The National Stroke Association states that \"80% of strokes can be prevented\" (http://www.stroke.org/site/PageServer?pagename /H11005PREVENT). This should compel nurses to educate the public about primary and secondarystroke prevention, including stroke awareness and stroke riskfactors, and to call 9-1-1 if warning signs of stroke occur. Theacronym FAST (Face, Arm, Speech, Time) is being used as a way to educate the public. \"The Beauty Shop Project\" educated beauticians on the FAST acronym and asked themto educate their clients about acute stroke signs by empha-sizing the FAST acronym. After the project, 51% of partici-pants could identify at least 3 stroke warning signs comparedwith 41% at the beginning of the project. Ninety-three percent recognized the need to call 9-1-1 compared with 85% before the project began (http://www.webmd.com/stroke/ news/20070207/hip-hop-to-stroke-awareness). The Massachusetts Health Promotion Clearinghouse Catalog has a 3-minute video on stroke awareness titled Stroke Heroes Act FAST. Three scenarios educate viewers about recognizing and responding to the signs of stroke using the FAST model (http://www.maclearinghouse.com/CatalogHDSP.htm). In 2004, the National Stroke Association created \"Hip Hop Stroke,\" a stroke education program for school-aged children.The interactive program is presented for 1 hour a day for 3days. Hip-hop music and the character \"Brainiac\" teachchildren about lifestyle changes, warning signs of stroke, andthe importance of calling 9-1-1 (http://www.stroke.org/ site/PageNavigator/HipHopStroke). Nurses have many avenues through which to educate the public: Churches, schools, and community and professional organizations. The AHA/ASA and National Stroke Associa-tion have educational information on their Web sites, as wellas materials for stroke education (Table 15). Stroke education can be done through blood pressure, lipid, and glucosescreenings; health education forums; and smoking cessation,exercise, and nutritional programs. The Nurse's Role in Certification of Primary Stroke Centers Certification of stroke centers has gained national recognition since publication of the Brain Attack Coalition recommenda-tions in June 2000 10amid concern that stroke centers shouldTable 17. Specific Roles of Nursing in the Joint Commission Primary Stroke Center Certification Bring team together toward common goal. Organize team to accomplish stroke center certification.Educate in-house nursing personnel, medical personnel, and ancillary personnel on stroke-related issues and philosophy of the Joint Commissionstroke center certification. Understand the Joint Commission requirements and understand deficits hospital may have in achieving goal. Develop preprinted or standing order sets and critical pathways as required by the Joint Commission. Develop stroke care procedures for strategic in-hospital units that care for stroke patients. Appoint quality-assurance nurse to collect data on execution of performance measures. Understand whether hospital is capable of responding to recommendations of Brain Attack Coalition. Understand hospital's medical record coding to ensure it is appropriately capturing ICD-10 and DRGs for proper billing for optimum reimbursementpotential. Recognize that nursing personnel play an important role in the application process for Joint Commission certification in pulling together requireddocuments for the site visit. Ensure that hospital personnel are prepared for the Joint Commission reviewer. Monitor performance measures established by the Joint Commission. ICD indicates International Classification of Diseases; DRGs, Diagnosis- Related Groups.Summers et al Nursing Care of the Acute Ischemic Stroke Patient 25 by on July 2, 2009 stroke.ahajournals.org Downloaded from require certification by a rigorous examining body. The Joint Commission, with the support of the AHA and ASA, developeda certification program using the ideas proposed in the BrainAttack Coalition paper as the template for the model (http://www.jointcommission.org/CertificationPrograms/PrimaryS- trokeCenters/). In 2004, the certification program was rolled out.More than 200 hospitals were certified by the end of 2006. 5 Nurses will play an important role in obtaining and maintaining stroke center certification (Table 17), just as they do in the Joint Commission's general hospital accreditation.Nurses will ensure that hospital personnel are properlytrained and knowledgeable about all aspects of stroke care and will interact with the multidisciplinary team through-out the care continuum. Nurses ensure that a patient'sneeds are met by all the disciplines involved in care and inmany cases help integrate this care so that patients aredischarged having received optimum care through bestpractices. Nurses will work to ensure that all aspects of thiscomplicated disease are managed in a way that willproduce positive outcomes (Table 18). The AHA/ASA patient education toolkit is available to assist nurses and other healthcare professionals in providingpatient and family education about stroke. The toolkit can beordered online through the AHA/ASA Web site (www.strokeas-sociation.org) or by calling the AHA/ASA directly (1-888-4-STROKE). Information about Joint Commission primarystroke center certification can be found at the Joint CommissionWeb site (www.jointcommission. org/CertificationPrograms/PrimaryStrokeCenters/). The Nurse's Role in Quality Improvement Initiatives Nurses historically have been at the forefront of inpatient hospital quality improvement programs. This role will con-tinue to expand as nurses institute quality improvement programs for secondary prevention such as Get With the Guidelines Stroke, a patient management tool, or the Cover-dale registry, both of which are used to collect data forprimary stroke center certification. 309,310 Get With the Guidelines Stroke offers evidence-based, best-practice in- formation that can be compared with other hospitals usingthis quality improvement tool. Information derived fromthis data collection program can also assist in patient and family education. In summary, the present scientific statement describes nurs- ing's vital role in the first 2 phases of stroke, the emergency orhyperacute phase and the acute phase. Using strength of evi-dence, the recommendations on the organization and integrationof care are designed to improve outcomes, decrease lengths ofstay, decrease costs, and decrease event recurrence. 10Table 18.
