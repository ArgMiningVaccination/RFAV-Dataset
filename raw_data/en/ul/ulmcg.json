Hypnosis, [meditation](https://www.webmd.com/balance/meditation), and relaxation may help break the cycle. If you're thinking about trying these ways to work on your [pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/default.htm), you'll want to know what to expect and how well they work. Hypnosis (Hypnotherapy) If you're picturing a stage act led by a man with a swinging watch who gets volunteers to walk like a chicken or bark like a dog, forget that. Clinical hypnosis is a real [therapy](https://www.webmd.com/depression/ss/slideshow-therapy-myths-and-facts) in which you learn how to use the power of your mind to help make positive changes. And you're in control. During hypnosis, you'll focus on relaxation and letting go of distracting thoughts. You may become more open to specific suggestions and goals, such as lowering pain. After your session, your therapist will go over the things that you can do to help you reach those goals. Research shows that medical hypnosis can help with both sudden (acute) and long-term (chronic) pain from [cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/), [burns](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/wound-care-10/preventing-treating-burns), and [rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/rheumatoid-arthritis-basics). It may also ease the [anxiety](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/default.htm) some people feel before surgery. When researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York analyzed 18 studies, they found moderate to large pain-relieving effects from hypnosis, supporting its use for pain management. To find a licensed hypnotherapist, speak to your doctor or contact the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis. Meditation Meditation is like [brain training](https://www.webmd.com/news/breaking-news/brain-training/brain-training-promise). Anyone can do it -- anytime, anywhere. Studies suggest that making meditation a habit may help people manage their pain and self-esteem and lower their [anxiety](https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/rm-quiz-stress-anxiety), [depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/default.htm), and [stress](https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/stress-assessment/default.htm). The details vary, depending on what type of meditation you choose to do, but it comes down to spending a few minutes (or longer) focusing your attention on one thing -- such as your [breathing](https://www.webmd.com/lung/how-we-breathe) or a word or phrase that inspires or comforts you. As you meditate, other thoughts are bound to come up. That's OK. Just direct your attention back to the thing you chose to focus on. Meditation is safe to try in addition to (not instead of) treatments that your doctor recommends. Relaxation Therapies These include techniques that aim to ease [stress](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/video/rippe-understanding-stress-levels). In addition to meditation, the major types include: Progressive muscle relaxation. You slowly tense each muscle group, hold the tension briefly, and then let it go. You'll do this in a systematic way -- for instance, starting with the muscles in your toes and working your way up your body. It helps you become aware of -- and release -- areas where you're tense. If you have cardiovascular ( [heart](https://www.webmd.com/heart/picture-of-the-heart)) disease that's not under good control, you should skip progressive muscle relaxation. Tensing your abdominal muscles can build up pressure in the chest cavity, slow your pulse, and hamper the flow of [blood](https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood) returning to the [heart](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/rm-quiz-know-heart). Autogenic training. This technique uses visual imagery and body awareness to help you relax. The person imagines being in a peaceful place and then focuses on different physical sensations, such as heaviness of the limbs or a calm heartbeat. People may practice on their own, creating their own images, or be guided by a therapist. Breathing. It's something you do every second of every day -- but often, we forget that it's happening at all. You can practice tuning into your breathing as a form of meditation: in and out, in and out. You can also learn to do breathing exercises. For instance, you can breathe in slowly while you count to 4, hold your breath for 7 more counts, and then exhale for 8 counts. The best way to learn relaxation techniques is with the help of a trained practitioner. Usually, these techniques are taught in a group class and then practiced regularly at home. If you've had [psychosis](https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/guide/what-is-psychosis) or [epilepsy](https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/default.htm), you may want to speak with your doctor before trying meditation. There have been reports of some people having further acute episodes after deep and prolonged meditation. Hypnosis or deep relaxation can sometimes worsen psychological problems in people with [posttraumatic stress disorder](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/post-traumatic-stress-disorder) or who are vulnerable to false memories. You should check with your doctor first. Tai Chi and Qi Gong They're both mind-body practices that have been around for centuries. You use postures, gentle movements, breathing techniques, and mental focus. Studies have found that they can help lower [knee pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/knee-pain/default.htm) from [osteoarthritis](https://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/default.htm) and help people with [fibromyalgia](https://www.webmd.com/fibromyalgia/default.htm) and [back pain](https://www.webmd.com/back-pain/default.htm). The evidence is less strong that [tai chi](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/video/tai-chi-health-benefits) and qi gong can help with long-term [neck pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/neck-shoulder). Biofeedback This uses sensors attached to your body to help you practice relaxation. Specifically, [biofeedback](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/biofeedback-therapy-uses-benefits) teaches you how to control involuntary responses, like your heartbeat or your [blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/diastolic-and-systolic-blood-pressure-know-your-numbers). Studies suggest that biofeedback may ease [migraine](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/guide/migraines-headaches-migraines) and [tension headaches](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/tension-headaches). The evidence for other [types of pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/pain-types-and-classifications) is less clear. Acupuncture This ancient medical technique stimulates certain points in your body, usually with thin needles put into the [skin](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/picture-of-the-skin). [Acupuncture](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/ss/slideshow-acupuncture-overview) has shown to benefit some people with specific types of pain. They include neck, low back, and [knee pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/knee-pain/knee-pain-overview) from [osteoarthritis](https://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/ss/slideshow-osteoarthritis-overview). Acupuncture also may [prevent migraines](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/understanding-migraine-prevention) and cut down on how often you get tension headaches. "}
