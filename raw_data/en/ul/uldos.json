Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to estimate the adjusted vaccine effectiveness (aVE) of one, two, and three doses of inactivated vaccines in attenuating pneumonia, severe COVID-19, and the duration of viral shedding in Delta and Omicron cases using modified Poisson and linear regression as appropriate. Results: A total of 561 COVID-19 cases were included (59.2% Delta and 40.8% Omicron). In total, 56.4% (184) of Delta and 12.0% (27) of Omicron cases had COVID-19 pneumonia. In the two-dose vaccinated population, 1.4% of Delta and 89.1% of Omicron cases were vaccinated for more than 6 months. In Delta cases, the two-dose aVE was 52% (95% confidence interval, 39-63%) against pneumonia and 61% (15%, 82%) against severe disease. Two-dose vaccination reduced the duration of viral shedding in Delta cases, but not in booster-vaccinated Omicron cases. In Omicron cases, three-dose aVE was 68% (18%, 88%) effective against pneumonia, while two-dose vaccination was insufficient for Omicron. E-values were calculated, and the E-values confirmed the robustness of our findings. Conclusions: In Delta cases, two-dose vaccination within 6 months reduced pneumonia, disease severity, and the duration of viral shedding. Booster vaccination provided a high level of protection against pneumonia with Omicron and should be prioritized.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-10-19", "cleaned_text": "Effectiveness of Inactivated COVID-19 Vaccines against COVID-19 Caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron Variants: A Retrospective Cohort Study Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-10-01753), [2](#B2-vaccines-10-01753), [3](#B3-vaccines-10-01753)] and were listed for emergency use by WHO. By 6 September 2022, more than 3.4 billion doses have been administrated in China [ [4](#B4-vaccines-10-01753)], most of which were inactivated COVID-19 vaccines. [5](#B5-vaccines-10-01753)]. The CoronaVac vaccine has an efficacy ranging from 51% to 84% against symptomatic infection and 85-100% against hospitalization [ [6](#B6-vaccines-10-01753), [7](#B7-vaccines-10-01753), [8](#B8-vaccines-10-01753)]. Similar vaccine effectiveness (VE) against severe COVID-19 associated with the Delta variant was also reported [ [2](#B2-vaccines-10-01753), [5](#B5-vaccines-10-01753), [9](#B9-vaccines-10-01753), [10](#B10-vaccines-10-01753), [11](#B11-vaccines-10-01753)]. As [12](#B12-vaccines-10-01753)], the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant, which is highly transmissible with potential immune escape, raised concerns about vaccine effectiveness. Studies reported decreased neutralizing activity against Omicron compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 for inactivated [ two-dose CoronaVac against Omicron [ [11](#B11-vaccines-10-01753), [15](#B15-vaccines-10-01753)] has been reported. Another study in Hongkong suggested that the VE of three-dose CoronaVac against severe or fatal COVID-19 (Omicron, BA.2) was high [ [15](#B15-vaccines-10-01753)]. However, real-world evidence VE against the more transmissible Omicron (BA.2.38) variants remains scarce. 2. Methods 2.1. Study Design and Participants 2.2. Diagnostic Criteria and Definitions [16](#B16-vaccines-10-01753), [17](#B17-vaccines-10-01753)]. Confirmed cases were classified as mild, moderate, severe, and critical cases [ [16](#B16-vaccines-10-01753), [17](#B17-vaccines-10-01753)]. Severe COVID-19 cases were defined as cases with a respiratory rate 30/min, a resting oxygen saturation 93%, and an oxygenation index 300 mmHg, or pulmonary lesion progression greater than 50% within 24-48 h. Critical COVID-19 cases were cases that met any of the following criteria: respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, or organ failure requiring admission to the ICU. In further analysis, cases who progressed to severe and critical disease were combined as severe cases and the other were combined as non-severe cases. Pneumonia was diagnosed by clinical symptoms and chest CT imaging, such as ground-glass opacification with or without consolidative abnormalities 2.3. Vaccination Status 2.4. Information Collection 2.5. Statistical Analysis [18](#B18-vaccines-10-01753)] was used to evaluate the relative risk (RR) of vaccination on pneumonia and disease progression without and with adjusted for age, gender, and whether the case had comorbidities (i.e., chronic kidney disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, chronic liver disease, hyperlipidemia, immune-compromised status, chronic cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension). Modified Poisson regression with robust estimation of variance for binary non-replicated outcomes was used to estimate RR when the assumption of rare diseases was violated. The Poisson distribution's mean-variance relationship may not be appropriate for binary outcomes, so we used robust estimates of variance. The adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) of each outcome were calculated in reference to the unvaccinated group and the adjusted vaccine effectiveness(aVE) was then calculated as 100% \u00d7 (1 aRR). For the protective effects of vaccines, we used aRRs rather than odds ratios (ORs) to calculate aVE because ORs consistently underestimated RR and thus led to an overestimation of VE. 2.6. Sensitivity Analyses [19](#B19-vaccines-10-01753)] to evaluate the potential effects of unmeasured confounding. The E-value quantifies the required magnitude of an unmeasured confounder that could negate the observed association between exposure (for example, vaccination) and the outcomes (for example, pneumonia). All analyses were performed using R (v.3.3.2, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; [http://www.R-project.org](http://www.R-project.org), accessed on 1 January 2021) and the Free Statistics analysis platform (v.1.7). 3. Results 3.1. Study Population [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-01753-f001)). All included patients were vaccinated with BIBP or CoronaVac. No cases had been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. 3.2. Characteristics of Participants [Table 1](#vaccines-10-01753-t001). Of the 551 cases, 176 (54.0%) Delta cases and 137 (60.9%) Omicron cases were female. In total, 163 (29.6%) had comorbidities. The median age was 44.0 years. Among 326 Delta cases, 182 (55.8%) were fully vaccinated, 40 (12.3%) were partially vaccinated, and 104 (31.9%) were unvaccinated. As the process of immunization campaigns in China, by July 2022, most individuals were fully and booster-vaccinated. Therefore, in Omicron cases that occurred in July 2022, 139 (61.8%) were booster-vaccinated, 64 (28.4%) were fully vaccinated, and 22 (9.8%) were unvaccinated. Furthermore, 56.4% of Delta and 12% of Omicron cases progressed to pneumonia. Omicron cases had a shorter duration of viral shedding (11.0 days in Omicron vs. 16.5 days in Delta), and a lower proportion of fever (42.7% in Omicron vs. 70.2% in Delta). No cases progressed to severe COVID-19 in Omicron infection. 3.3. Antibodies and Viral Loads among Different Groups [Table 2](#vaccines-10-01753-t002), among Delta and Omicron cases, with increasing doses of the vaccines, the IgG titers within 48 h from admission increased (p < 0.001). In terms of the maximum IgG titers, the same trend was observed among Omicron cases. In Delta and Omicron cases, no significant differences between vaccination status, in terms of IgM antibody titers, Ct values within 48 h from admission, or the lowest Ct values, were found. [Table S1](#app1-vaccines-10-01753)describes serum inflammation indicators in Delta and Omicron cases. As vaccination doses increased, lymphocyte counts increased and IL-6 levels decreased in Delta cases. However, Omicron cases showed a decrease in lymphocyte counts and an increase in neutrophil counts and C-reactive protein. 3.4. Outcomes among Different Groups [Table 3](#vaccines-10-01753-t003)and [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-01753-f002)summarize the outcomes and intervals from the last shot to symptom onset. In fully vaccinated cases, the proportion of less than 6 months between vaccination and symptom onset was 98.4% in Delta and only 10.9% in Omicron cases. In Delta and Omicron cases, the proportion of pneumonia decreased as the dose of vaccines increased (86.5% in the unvaccinated group, 67.5% in the partially vaccinated group, and 36.8% in the fully vaccinated group; p < 0.001 for Delta) (31.8% in the unvaccinated group, 15.6% in the partially vaccinated (one-dose) group, and 7.2% in the fully vaccinated (two-dose) group; p = 0.005 for Omicron). In Delta cases, a similar trend was found in the proportion of severe COVID-19 (32.7% in unvaccinated, 12.5% in one-dose group, and 5.5% in the two-dose < 0.001), the highest temperature ( [Figure viral shedding ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-01753-f002)b) (20.1 \u00b1 6.0 days in the unvaccinated group, 17.9 \u00b1 6.8 days in the one-dose group, and 14.4 8.7 days in the two-dose group) ( [Table 2](#vaccines-10-01753-t002)). In the Omicron cases, no cases developed severe COVID-19, and no differences were found between different vaccinated groups in terms of the duration of viral shedding ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-01753-f002)c) or the highest temperature ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-01753-f002)d). 3.5. Vaccine Effectiveness [Table 4](#vaccines-10-01753-t004)shows the adjusted VE (aVE) against different outcomes. In Delta cases, the two-dose aVE was 52% (95% CI, 39-63%) against pneumonia and 61% (95% CI, 15-82%) against the severe disease after adjustment for age, whether they had comorbidities and gender. The duration of viral shedding was 4.68 days less (95% CI, 6.89 to 2.46 days) in the two-dose group compared with the unvaccinated group with Delta. On the other hand, partial vaccination was not statistically associated with these outcomes. In Omicron cases, three-dose aVE was 68% (95% CI, 18-88%) against pneumonia, booster vaccination was not associated with a reduced duration of viral shedding, and full vaccination was not associated with any outcomes. 3.6. Sensitivity Analysis [Tables S2 and S3](#app1-vaccines-10-01753), we performed a stratified analysis to explore the VE of vaccination against pneumonia in different subgroups. No statistically significant difference was seen in two-dose or three-dose aVE against pneumonia in different subgroups. There was a trend toward decreased VE among Omicron cases with comorbidities. [Table S4](#app1-vaccines-10-01753)). 4. Discussion [20](#B20-vaccines-10-01753), [21](#B21-vaccines-10-01753)]. Our study provided evidence for the protective effect of two-dose inactivated vaccines against Delta and booster vaccination against the Omicron variant. Similar VEs against severe COVID-19 caused by the Delta variant were reported in other studies [ [2](#B2-vaccines-10-01753), [5](#B5-vaccines-10-01753), [9](#B9-vaccines-10-01753), [10](#B10-vaccines-10-01753), [11](#B11-vaccines-10-01753)]. For example, two real-world aVEs of inactivated vaccines and 83% [ [11](#B11-vaccines-10-01753)] against severe COVID-19. Different from these studies, we found that full vaccination was independently associated with a reduced duration of viral shedding in Delta infection. The viral clearance may be promoted by vaccine-induced immune because fully vaccinated Delta cases had a greater IgG-48h level, which was supported by another study [ [23](#B23-vaccines-10-01753)]. However, in Omicron cases, three-dose VE was not statistically significant in reducing the duration of viral shedding, although the IgG-48h level and the maximum IgG level were higher than the unvaccinated individuals, reflecting the stronger immune escape and reduced VE in Omicron cases. The decreased VE against Omicron is also found in other vaccines, such as mRNA vaccines [ [24](#B24-vaccines-10-01753), [25](#B25-vaccines-10-01753)]. [20](#B20-vaccines-10-01753)]. The inconsistency may be primarily due to the waning immunity with time since 89.1% of two-dose-vaccinated Omicron cases were more than 6 months from second shot to infection. Booster immunization with inactivated vaccines provided a high level of protection against pneumonia (aVE = 68%) with Omicron (BA.2.38), which was consistent with a study in Hong Kong [ [15](#B15-vaccines-10-01753)]. These findings implied the importance of booster vaccination in persons >6 months after the second dose. Subgroup analyses indicated a trend toward decreased three-dose VE among Omicron cases with comorbidities. Since individuals with comorbidities were at higher risk of disease progression [ [26](#B26-vaccines-10-01753)], monitoring VE against Omicron is significant to inform future vaccination strategies in these high-risk persons. [27](#B27-vaccines-10-01753), [28](#B28-vaccines-10-01753), [29](#B29-vaccines-10-01753), [30](#B30-vaccines-10-01753)]. The effects may be due to the recall of an immune memory response, reduced viral replication, and the accelerated eradication of virus-infected cells [ [27](#B27-vaccines-10-01753), [31](#B31-vaccines-10-01753)]. An in vivo study has demonstrated that prototypic inactivated vaccines reduced viral load in upper respiratory tract swabs and pulmonary tissues, and improved lung pathology in vaccinated rhesus monkeys which were infected by the Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants [ [14](#B14-vaccines-10-01753)]. [15](#B15-vaccines-10-01753), [21](#B21-vaccines-10-01753)]. By contrast, Li et al. observed viral loads decreased 1.9-3.4-fold in children who were fully vaccinated [ [32](#B32-vaccines-10-01753)]. The notion of whether inactivated vaccines decreased viral loads needs to be further explored. [33](#B33-vaccines-10-01753), [34](#B34-vaccines-10-01753)], 89.1% of two-dose-vaccinated and 47.5% of three-dose-vaccinated Omicron cases were more than 6 months from the last shot to infection. The prolonged interval may underestimate the VE. Third, the sample size was relatively small, which was reflected by the wide CIs. Fourth, we did not evaluate three-dose VE in Delta infections because only four cases were booster-vaccinated in Delta infections. Fifth, it was difficult to compare two-dose VE in Delta and Omicron infections since the time interval between the last vaccination shot to infection was different in the two groups. 5.
