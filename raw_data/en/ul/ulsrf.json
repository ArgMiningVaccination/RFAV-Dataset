The White House is eager to distract attention away from the fact that double vaccinated, double-boosted President Biden has contracted COVID-19. America's public health institutions continue to ratchet up their war on doctors. In the latest example, the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) has launched a sudden and seemingly well-funded effort to cancel doctors like our own Pierre Kory. FLCCC is driven by an evidence-based approach. We don't just blindly Follow the Science\u2014we are guided by the scientific process. The alternate summit focused on some big questions: Why have patients been denied life-saving medical treatments? Why are we not researching the damage being caused by the injections? Why are medical professionals still being censored by media companies, Big Tech and their own institutions? The problem, as ever, is that the study was designed to fail. In a piece published by The Brownstone Institute, Dr. Pierre Kory highlights the study's flaws: Tens of thousands of people turned up in downtown Los Angeles on Sunday to hear from speakers and musicians at the Defeat the Mandates rally. Many people who could have saved themselves if they knew of the FLCCC's therapeutic protocols contracted the disease. They did not know how to protect themselves from getting COVID-19 in the first place... because of cancel vultures. By mentioning a Pfizer drug by name in his State of the Union Address, Biden showed the clear bias this government has for expensive, high-profit drugs while ignoring lower-cost treatments. Trials of generic medicines that are funded and influenced by profit-driven pharmaceutical companies will always fail. Over one year ago, there were ample peer-reviewed, randomized controlled trials that provided strong evidence on ivermectin's efficacy as a treatment for COVID in every disease phase. At worst, however, Remdesivir is harmful. A subsequent analysis of the agency's safety database found it likely caused kidney failure, and when independent trials (those not sponsored by a pharmaceutical company) are analyzed alone, there is a clear statistical trend to harm. WHO also warns that the drug may be associated with an increased reporting of liver problems.\" Sham peer review is an adverse action taken in bad faith by a hospital for purposes other than \"the furtherance of quality health care.\" We now have peer-reviewed, scientific proof that bears irrefutable, evidentiary witness to what the physicians of the FLCCC and others have known \u2014 and shared widely \u2014 since the start of the pandemic: Early combination treatment for COVID-19 decreases fatality rates. A renowned, highly accomplished Maine physician's mental health is being questioned because she went 'off-script' to save her patients' lives.

And I am calling out all those elected officials (left, center and right), public health appointees, Big Pharma, people who sit on the boards of Big Pharma, corporate enablers, and even charitable foundations that are party to these ongoing crimes against humanity.

Dr. Marik was meant to enjoy as a benefit of tenure, but it was gravely wounded this week by the Virginia hospital system for which he works. Covid has led to an unprecedented level of medical censorship. Long-standing norms have been erased by a cabal of political and corporate elites that now dictate how medicine may be practiced. Medical journals reject or retract peer-reviewed scientific manuscripts with conclusions that do not support prevailing health policies or pharmaceutical company interests. Remdesivir is (at best) useless against Covid-19. At worst, it is dangerous to patients who receive it. A \"One-Size-Fits-All\" Approach in the Treatment of COVID-19 is Fraught with Danger -- Dr. Keith Berkowitz: This particular lie that has caused hundreds of thousands to perish across the globe...is not over. It is The BIGGE$T Lie \u2014 perhaps ever. "}
