Older kids can swallow the beads, but younger children can also chew them. They have a pleasant strawberry(ish) taste without any fishy aftertaste. The bead part is a little chewy, but not still much more tolerable than regular cod liver oil. This book came into my life at the perfect time. [The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry: How to Stay Emotionally Healthy and Spiritually Alive in the Chaos of the Modern World by John Mark Comer](https://www.amazon.com/Ruthless-Elimination-Hurry-Emotionally-Spiritually-ebook/dp/B07NCJB86S?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=mamanatural-20&linkId=5939c63d0f4d2e4df662b20240ea74fb&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl). I laughed; I cried (more like blubbered) and was convicted. As a result of reading this book, I implemented some changes such as: - Significantly reducing my phone use. While an iPhone is very convenient, it is also very dehumanizing. If you go to the grocery store, post office or even look around at a stoplight, everyone is on their phone. We don't communicate with people like we used to. I've deleted many apps that distract and kept the essentials. I have time limits set on my iPhone daily. - Celebrating Sabbath each week. From sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday, I CHILL. No running errands. No cleaning house. I focus on things that support rest and worship. My whole family gets in on the fun with playing games, preparing yummy food and celebrating the accomplishments of the week. Sounds like such a simple and outdated practice but long-time Sabbath practicers say it's truly GAME CHANGING! - Simplifying life. My mantra is: I can't do it all. What can I eliminate or simplify in 2022? Purging \"stuff\" regularly. Stacking errands. Combining extracurriculars. Doing what we can as a family to keep our lives simple. - Driving the speed limit. Not 5 or 10 mph over. Not only is this the right thing to do, it helps to s-l-o-w me down. - Keeping God first. Intentionally carving out time with God each day. Not giving Him the leftovers but my heartfelt devotion. Comer's book is LOADED with practical tips and tricks you can implement for a life more satisfying, soulful and human.

Speaking of fascinating stories, do you know the story of the 12 homeopathic mineral cell salts? ? They were discovered by W.H. Schuessler (1821-1898), a German medical doctor and homeopath, by analyzing the ash of cremated human remains. ? In them, he found 12 mineral salts in significant quantities. Dr. Schuessler believed that deficiencies in these 12 minerals were the source of common health problems, and by using these minerals, you give the body what it needs to be well. I've used [Hyland's cell salts](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=hylands+cell+salts&linkCode=ll2&tag=mamanatural-20&linkId=c1af556420349098c8bbcc2435ef1b0e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) for various issues from skin issues (silica), adrenal fatigue (Nat Mur), and mucoceles (Calc Sulph) with great success. Here are the list of the 12 cell salts and how they can aid the human body. (Keep in mind that these are very gentle and non-toxic but always talk to your doctor before adding a new supplement to your regimen.) #1 Calc Fluor: Colds, hemorrhoids, varicose veins, morning fatigue and chapped skin ? #2 Calc Phos: Gum or tooth sensitivity, improves vitamin D absorption and great for improving moods ? #3 Calc Sulph: Great for skin issues from acne to eczema and boosts motivation and drive ? #4 Ferrum Phos: Fevers, minor swelling, and fights the over-inflammatory responses in the body ? #5 Kali Mur: Think \"white\" with this remedy for things like white-coated tongue, white pus, mucus and it can be used externally for burns ? #6 Kali Phos: Great for the nervous system!

Supports healthy hair and nails too. ? #8 Mag Phos: Natural \"pain reliever\" for things like muscle cramps and spasms, tooth pain (teething), and shooting pain ? #9 Nat Mur: Maintains proper water balance in body so good for swelling, dry eyes, dry skin and constipation. Can help with headaches and heartburn, too ? #10 Nat Phos: Indigestion, gas, hyperacidity. Think of this as a natural \"alka seltzer\".

We often pray together when dealing with hard situations. We also pray for our \"enemies\" in order to shift our perspective and practice compassion. I am showing my kids Paloma (7) and Griffin (10) how to tap to help them process difficult emotions. Because it instantly shifts our body from the \"fight in flight\" mode to a more calm and restful state, it can be SUPER helpful for little ones. I also love how it teaches kids to unconditionally love themselves, even in the midst of intense emotions.

This is hitting home for me, as I have an area on my molars that my dentist is watching before it turns into a cavity. This is super common after giving birth and nursing children since they are inherently mineral-depleting activities (but worth it ;). Here are some products I'm using to ramp up my oral health: [Stainless steel tongue gum](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=pur+gum&crid=WUYGR008LXQW&sprefix=PUR+gum,beauty,180&ref=nb_sb_ss_fb_1_7&linkCode=ll2&tag=mamanatural-20&linkId=ab44ddd243211fab313046c14b200b11&language=en_US) [ Countertop Professional Oral Irrigator For Teeth ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HFQQ0VU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=mamanatural-20&linkId=d8c1b14d66fb2bac92ef0c1d3d65ec76&language=en_US) [ Mary Ruth skin care probioitc ](https://www.amazon.com/PROBIOTIC-MaryRuths-Plant-Based-Certified-Psoriasis/dp/B073WL57DW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=mamanatural-20&linkId=a342a8aab467f2dc1bc5d4d27d2b0faf&language=en_US) Soothe that sanitized skin with probiotics ? When my 1 year old daughter Faith gets a little diaper rash or irritation, I use a bit of [Mary Ruth probiotics](https://www.amazon.com/PROBIOTIC-MaryRuths-Plant-Based-Certified-Psoriasis/dp/B073WL57DW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=mamanatural-20&linkId=a342a8aab467f2dc1bc5d4d27d2b0faf&language=en_US) topically and I find it heals faster than when I use coconut oil or other ointments. It's a great diapering hack, but people have seen great results with topical probiotics, and I think it would be a great addition to the daily routine for kids or adults who use a lot of hand sanitizer. Check it out if that sounds interesting.

They have ones specifically for \"bridging\" one year to the next, which are great. I want to challenge my kids though so decided to go for the grade book that corresponds to where they'll be in the fall. Griffin has been loving the \"I Survived\" book series and I'm looking into \"I'm Trapped in a Video Game\" books. I have him write 12 sentences about what he read (or any other topic) to practice is writing and spelling. I have seen a HUGE difference by this simple practice.

It teaches little ones how to plan and cook meals entirely on their own, and all the recipes use real food and are healthy too. ? A healthy green ? I'm excited about an old school food-based supplement... chlorella. This superfood algae has some incredible benefits! - It's a nutritional powerhouse. High in protein, vitamin B12, vitamin C, antioxidants, omega 3's, magnesium, zinc, copper, potassium, calcium, iron, folic acid and other B vitamins. ? - In animal studies, chlorella can weaken the heavy metal toxicity of the liver, brain and kidneys ? With all of the toxins were surrounded by these days, I love taking this supplement for added assurance. - It also helps to regulate blood sugar and blood pressure levels ? - It's high in fiber so helpful for daily ?

This is particularly important for children who tend to co-mingle more closely with others! It's important to wash for at least 20 seconds and then thoroughly dry with a towel (germs spread more easily with wet hands). I gave each of my kids a mini Bronner's soap for them to use at school before eating. They love having their own \"special soap\" to use.

(This isn't a sponsored post, I just want to share.) It's super clean, keeps me smelling fresh, and is literally made up of 3 core ingredients. It's a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way. Helping kids navigate their emotions is a worthy undertaking. We all need healthy ways to express our feelings! I have to say that I'm LOVING this [3 Minute Gratitude Journal for Kids.](https://www.amazon.com/Minute-Gratitude-Journal-Kids-Mindfulness/dp/194820956X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=mamanatural-20&linkId=77a5e5a052700b763d8d63a2c685a308&language=en_US) It empowers kids to share how they really feel and reflect on the good, and not so good, aspects of their day.

This choline rich food has been shown to: - Lower cholesterol - Improve heart health - Help digestion - Improve memory and cognitive function ? - And hydrate the skin (take that winter!) Of course, sunflower lecithin is also wonderful for breastfeeding mamas as it can boost breast milk supply and prevent reoccurring clogged ducts. Woot!

Close up all the windows and doors and set the heat as high as it will go. By creating a hot house, you force the VOCs to be released more rapidly. After 24 hours, open windows and doors to air the home out. Repeat this process until the smell is gone. You can also TEST.

Dr. Steve Gundry popularized the lectin-free diet in his best-selling book [The Plant Paradox](https://www.amazon.com/Plant-Paradox-Dangers-Healthy-Disease/dp/006242713X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=2OJUKSM1X54BF&keywords=plant+paradox+gundry+book&qid=1564586800&s=gateway&sprefix=plant+par,aps,174&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=mamanatural-20&linkId=f65bdf0d840fd3778836aa47419befa0&language=en_US). I was skeptical at first, but a few of my friends feel much better following his protocol. Lectins are a protein that plants create as a \"self-defense\" mechanism to ensure their survival. While lectins don't bother most people and can even reduce cancer risk, they can irritate the digestive track and trigger the immune system in an unhealthy way. The bummer is that lectins are found in the seeds and skin of many healthy plants. On his diet, foods like tomatoes, bell peppers, nuts & seeds and even berries are limited. Not to mention nearly all grains and legumes! ? So what's a mama to do? Well, if you're concerned about it, there are some time-tested methods that can help reduce your lectin load. - Soak your grains, legumes, nuts and seeds in a special medium to help breakdown lectins and anti-nutrients. ? - For grains, I mix about 1 tsp. of raw apple cider vinegar with water and soak the grains overnight (around 8-12 hours) - For legumes, I mix 1 tsp. of baking soda with water and soak for 8-12 hours - For nuts/seeds, I use about 1 tsp. of sea salt mixed with water and soak for 8-12 hours. (I have a video on how to do so [here](https://mamanatural.com/soaking-nuts/).) - Sprout your grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. This method enhances nutrient bioavailablity while reducing lectins and phytic acid. You can learn how to sprout quinoa [here](https://mamanatural.com/sprouted-quinoa-pizza-crust-recipe/). And store-bought brands like TruRoots, Go Raw, and Pure Living sell organic, sprouted products if you're short on time. ? - Eat your fermented veggies! Pair a few tablespoons of raw sauerkraut or kimchi to your meals to help boost your digestive fire and build up your immune system. ? - Use your Instant Pot. I cook all my legumes in my pressure cooker, which significantly reduces lectins. Cooking this way is also easy and reduces cooking time. Double win! ? - Peel and de-seed your fruits and veggies. For those who are uber sensitive, you can peel and de-seed foods like your tomatoes and cucumbers before eating to remove lectins.

While it's wonderful for altitude sickness, studies show that chlorophyll can: - Reduce body odor and bad breath - Help treat iron issues like anemia - Might slow the growth of some cancers, such as lung and colon - Support detoxification by helping the body excrete carcinogens - Aid in weight loss since it promotes feelings of satiety and stabilizes blood sugar levels - Boost alkaline levels in body - And finally, help ease constipation Yep, your mama was right when she said to \"eat your greens!\" Foods highest in chlorophyll include: - wheatgrass, - spinach, - alfalfa, - parsley, - arugula - and collard greens.

What is xylitol? It is classified as a sugar alcohol and is actually found in some foods like strawberries, mushrooms, and oats. The human body even produces small amounts of it. While excessive xylitol isn't recommended, a little mint after a meal can be beneficial for reducing acidity in the mouth that leads to plaque, cavities, and decay. (Xylitol stimulates saliva production and is alkaline.) Xylitol also \"tricks\" bad bacteria who think it's sugar and ends up starving the organisms to death. In studies, xylitol can: - Reduce cavity and plaque causing bacteria, including S. mutans and S. sobrinus, while not affecting good bacteria strains like S. sanguinis and S. mitis in saliva - Starve the ear infection bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae and can decrease the incidences of ear infections in young children by nearly 40%! - Lessen the adhesion of the yeast bacteria Candida albicans so may even help with thrush and yeast infections! Be sure to get real xylitol, as some is manufactured from GMO corn (the candies listed above are GMO-free.) Also, note that xylitol is extremely toxic to dogs.

We brush teeth, do story time, and give short foot rubs, whether we're at home or in a different place. - Use fans for comfort. ? Running a fan at night to keep the temperature cool and drone out strange (new) noises, help in the sleep department. - Blackout windows. If the windows have no curtains, use lightweight blankets and tacks to create a barrier for the morning light. We've even used tinfoil to \"blackout\" small windows or skylights. ? - Wear earplugs, nose plugs or eye masks ? Michael is a light sleeper, so he wears earplugs to go into a deeper state of rest.

My husband heard about this classic on a podcast, and he's really seen great results with the techniques. The book is very much in line with that \"let them feel their feelings\" approach. And the communication tips are pretty golden too. One quick example: When picking your kids up from school/camp/etc., instead of saying, \"Hey, how was your day?\" which usually elicits a \"Fine\" from the kid, try just looking back at them and saying, \"Hey, I'm really glad to see you.\" Leave it at that, and watch them open up.

In our fast-paced, overscheduled world, this book is calling to me. Author Katrina Kenison's reflects on the sacred in the very mundane (and sometimes hard!) moments of everyday life. She touches on such diverse topics as \"peace,\" \"simplicity,\" \"play,\" \"Sabbath,\" and \"discipline\" and gives mothers (and their children) permission to be instead of do. I can't wait to dive in! 2.) Leisure Reading ? [The Hiding Place](https://www.amazon.com/Hiding-Place-Corrie-Ten-Boom/dp/0800794052/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1498755568&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Hiding+Place&linkCode=ll1&tag=mamanatural-20&linkId=4a81d27c5e4752f27ab1aca7da1d7a1f). I flew through this captivating read about Corrie ten Boom, a Dutch watchmaker who became a heroine of the Nazi Resistance, a survivor of Hitler's concentration camps, and one of the most remarkable women of faith in the twentieth century. In World War II she and her family risked their lives to help Jews and underground workers escape from the Nazis, and for their work they were tested in the infamous Nazi death camps. Only Corrie among her family survived to tell the story of how faith ultimately triumphs over evil.

My husband heard about this book in [Bill Gates' annual summer reading list](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Summer-Books-2017) and loved it, especially because we live in an area of Florida sometimes referred to as the \"Redneck Rivera.\" It's the true story of a young man who grew up in Kentucky's Appalachia and Ohio's rustbelt, was dealt a difficult hand in life in terms of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma... and yet succeeds in spite of his chaotic family history. Deeply moving and relatable, no matter where you grew up. 3.)

While there is nothing wrong with those things, I also want her to know that she can be strong, an excellent leader, diplomatic, and wear all the colors of the rainbow. ? Part-time Princess is the story of a girl who becomes a princess at night but not just one who wears pretty gowns and goes to balls. She also gets to fight dragons and tame trolls. If you're looking for more empowering stories for princess-loving girls, this is an excellent list.

My son enjoys reading on his own and with us, but he's not exactly thrilled about it. And yet he's crazy about these books. The stories are super wacky and often hilarious. He's laughed at these books in a way I've never heard him laugh before. If you've got a reluctant reader, especially a boy, check it out. There are six books in this series, all multiples of 13, so the 13 Story Treehouse, 26 Story, 39 Story, etc. [ Griffin Magnatiles ](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=magna-tiles&rh=i:aps,k:magna-tiles&linkCode=ll2&tag=mamanatural-20&linkId=03ecd37267f0e0118cd17673a6154a0c) We had friends over for dinner last night, and they mentioned that they were getting rid a bunch of their daughter's toys. Why? There is some compelling [research](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/why-fewer-toys-will-actually-benefit-your-kids/) that suggests having fewer toys can benefit kids and help them: - Be more creative - Develop longer attention spans - Play better with others - Argue less On our recent trip to Chicago, we only brought [Magnatiles](https://mamanatural.com/3-things-thursday-products/) and books for the kids, and they played their hearts out and never asked for anything else. How many toys are enough? [This study](http://rense.com/general8/yots.htm) suggested that two dozen is enough for preschoolers, but the more books the better.

I'm serious. Making the move from conventional deodorant to a natural one was no easy feat. Boosting my magnesium stores seemed to help, but it took time for my body to make the switch. I'm thinking it would have gone much smoother if I did an [armpit detox](https://wellnessmama.com/25432/detox-your-armpits/). (Yes, this is a thing and it's supposed to help people make the transition from regular deodorant to natural ones.)

It's especially great for anyone who suffers from halitosis, aka bad breath! There are even [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16032940) in PubMed about the effectiveness of tongue scraping.

Making yummy treats ( [like these cute trees and gingermen](https://mamanatural.com/healthy-holiday-treat-recipes/)!), listening to favorite holiday albums, and spending time with family is so precious this time of year.
