These students receive federal, state and institutional financial aid to help them pay for their education. There are four basic types of aid. Grants: Federal, state and institutional grants do not require repayment. Loans: Must be repaid, generally beginning six months after a student graduates or leaves school. Loans require repayment with interest charges of approximately 8 percent (depending on the program) accruing during the repayment period. Work-Study : Students can be employed either on or off campus, with the primary focus being that students enhance their eld of study by working part-time in a career- related position. Scholarships and Tuition Waivers: Awards are based on nancial need, academic achievement and the quality of the personal essay that is submitted as part of the scholarship application process. What is Financial Need? For most aid programs, nancial need is dened as the difference between what it costs to attend school and what the student can afford to pay. The amount a student should be able to pay is determined by a standard, federally mandated need- analysis method. The method establishes whether a student is nancially independent (unmarried students under the age of 24 years may be considered dependent and in that case must provide parent information) or financially dependent on his or her parents and takes into account past earnings and benets, a percentage of net assets and all other sources of support. Financial AidThere is no income standard or other simple method of determining whether a student will qualify for need-based nancial aid. Any student who thinks he or she needs help should apply. If a student has additional medical, transportation, child-care, or other unusual expenses not covered by the living allowance, the student may, by submitting a revision request with documentation (physician's statement, child-care, or baby-sitter bills, etc.), ask Ofce of Student Financial Aid to consider the additional costs in his or her budget. Eligibility for Financial Aid To qualify for federal financial aid, a student must: Be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident or other eligible noncitizen Be admitted to the University in an approved program and meet minimum enrollment requirements (distance learning, correspondence and most nonmatriculated students are not eligible for nancial aid) Not be in default on a previous student loan or owe a repayment on a grant or loan for which the student was not eligible Be registered with the Selective Service (if required) Be making satisfactory academic progress (The denition of satisfactory progress differs with different kinds of aid. In general, undergraduate students are required to register for and complete 12 credits per quarter; graduate students, 10 credits per quarter. Check with the nancial aid staff for detailed information.) Provide financial information (including parents' information, where required) Be free of any federal or state drug- related convictionsEligible students are considered for funding based on three things: need, class level, and state residency status. Need determines priority for those programs within the class level. Students with the fewest resources are given rst priority for all aid funds. Application and Important Dates The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the basic application for most types of nancial aid. Students may complete and submit their FAFSA information directly to the federal processor online. Students must apply for a Personal Identication Number (PIN) in order to complete the online FAFSA. PINs can be obtained by registering through www. pin.ed.gov. T o access FAFSA on the Web, go to www.fafsa.ed.gov . Applications are also available from the Office of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs. Students should complete their FAFSA for the upcoming year (dened as Summer through Spring quarters) beginning in mid-December or early January. A student who wishes to apply for financial aid to support study during Summer Quarter must submit a separate application. Renewal Application Students who have led a FAFSA before must complete a Renewal Application before each academic year in order to continue to be eligible for aid. The Renewal Application can be completed online (again, a PIN is required). Priority Dates For priority consideration, the FAFSA, Renewal FAFSA or FAFSA on the Web must be dated as received by the federal application processor by Feb. 28 of each year. Students are encouraged to mail the FAFSA no sooner than Jan. 1 and no later than Feb. 15 before the upcoming academic year. Students who submit their FAFSAs after the priority date, fth-year students and part-time students may be eligible to borrow funds through the Federal Stafford Loan or the Federal PLUS/Federal Supplemental Loan programs. Undergraduates may qualify for a Federal Pell Grant.12 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2004-2005 CatalogBecause the priority date falls before the income tax deadline, students and parents can use estimated income gures if their tax information is not prepared. Tax and asset documents may be requested at a later date to verify information provided on the initial application. Students who apply for financial aid should remember to keep copies of nancial documents used in completing the FAFSA, should stay in touch with the nancial aid counselor and should notify the Ofce of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs of any change in address. Consortium Agreements UW Tacoma students will occasionally need to enroll at a community college to complete admission deficiencies. The credits at the community college may be counted toward the student's total quarter enrollment credits using a Financial Aid Consortium Agreement. Both UW Tacoma and the community college must approve Consortium Agreements. If approved, Consortium Agreements enable the student to receive nancial aid based on the total credits being taken at both institutions. Agreements must be submitted to the Ofce of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs no later than three weeks prior to the start of the quarter. Scholarships Consideration for need-based scholar- ships is given based on information received on the FAFSA (on-time applicants only). Scholarship lists are available through the Ofce of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs and at Web sites listed later in this section.

The amount charged for resident undergraduate tuition and fees is set by the state and is indexed to the cost of instruction. Tuition and fees for non- residents and graduate students are set by the University of Washington Board of Regents. Because inflation increases costs, tuition rates generally increase each year. Since University costs are supported by the state, the rates charged to students who are not residents of Washington state are higher than the rates for residents. Please refer to the Registration, Academic and University Policies sections for information regarding residency classification. Tuition charges are based on the student's classification (undergraduate or graduate) rather than on course level. Rates are subject to change without notice. Tuition rates for the 2004-2005 academic year had not been nalized at the time this catalog was printed. Please consult the quarterly Registration Guide or the UW T acoma W eb site for current tuition rates. Estimated Non-Tuition Expenses The following figures are prepared and updated each year by the Office of Student Financial Aid at UW Seattle. They reflect modest, but adequate, probable costs for students attending the University during a nine-month academic year (three quarters). They should be used only as a guide in determining the year's expenses. The expenses reflect a nontraditional budget as dened by the Ofce of Student Financial Aid. Graduate students, undergraduates who have children, and married undergraduates whose spouses are not students are considered \"nontraditional\" students. Registered same-sex domestic partners may request consideration for additional living costs and will need to provide information about their partner's financial resources when they make the request.For the 2004-2005 school year, other expenses for three quarters as a resident, nontraditional undergraduate student were estimated as follows: Books $ 900 Room and Board 10,125Personal Expenses 2,253Transportation 1,260 T otal $ 14,538 For the 2003-2004 school year, other expenses for three quarters as a resident, nontraditional graduate student were estimated as follows: Books $ 1,050 Room and Board 10,125Personal Expenses 2,253Transportation 1,260 T otal $ 14,688 Tuition and Fee Payment Students incur an obligation to pay tuition and fees in U.S. dollars when they register. Students receive e-mail notication once tuition charges are available on MyUW. Payment in full of tuition is due by Friday of the third week of the quarter. Nonpayment of tuition and fees by the due date results in a charge of $50 for balances of $50 to $250 and $120 for balances in excess of $250. Students with an overdue balance will not be allowed to register for the next quarter. Options for tuition payment Plan 1: Tuition in Full This plan is best for students receiving financial aid (such as loans, grants, scholarships and Chapter 31 V .A. benets) and those who are able to pay their tuition in full. Payment by check or money order may be made to the UWT Cashier or mailed directly to the UW Student Accounts Ofce, Campus Box 355870, Seattle, WA 98195. Credit card payments may be made online through MyUW. There is a convenience charge assessed when using this option. The amount in full is due by Friday of the third week of the quarter. Tuition may be paid out of the nancial aid award or by using emergency loans. Plan 2: Tuition Installment Plan This plan is best for students who are not receiving nancial aid and who would like to make payments over several pay periods. Students must enroll for this option each quarter with the UWT Cashier during the rst week of the quarter. One third of the tuition plus a $10 service charge is due by the rst Friday of the quarter. The remaining balance of tuition is due in two equal payments on the third and fth Fridays of the quarter. T o qualify for the installment plan all payments must be made on time. The second and third payments are subject to late fees as shown in the table on page 14. Payments must be made to the UWT Cashier. When the payment is not in conformance with the tuition and fee billing, specific instructions on how the payment is to be applied must accompany the payment. In the absence of instructions, the University makes a reasoned interpretation of the student's intent and accounts for the funds accordingly. The student number must be specied on all payments. Tuition Forfeiture When students drop or withdraw from courses after the rst week of the quarter and the drop results in lower tuition, the University reserves the right to collect one-half the tuition through the 30th calendar day of the quarter for the dropped course or courses and full tuition after the 30th calendar day of the quarter. In some circumstances students may petition the registrar to have the tuition forfeiture waived. Details are available in the Ofce of the UWT Registrar (see Request to Waive Tuition Forfeiture or Registration Fees). 14 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2004-2005 CatalogRequest to W aive Tuition Forfeiture or Registration Fees If a student feels that he or she has been charged a tuition forfeiture or registration fee in error or wishes to contest a forfeiture or fee, he or she may complete a Request to Waive Tuition Forfeiture or Registration Fees form. Failure to receive a tuition bill does not nullify a student's responsibility for payment by the tuition due date and is not an acceptable justication for a waiver. Please refer to the form for appropriate guidelines for granting these requests. Petitions must be received by the UWT Registrar no later than the last day of instruction. Tuition and Fee Refund When a fee payment is made by check, a waiting period is required before a refund can be authorized. An application for refund may be refused unless it is made during the quarter in which the fees apply. A student who withdraws for disciplinary reasons forfeits all rights to refund or cancellation of any portion of his or her fees. Other Fees Explanation of fees where necessary follows. All fees are subject to change without notice. Application Fees There is no reduction in fees for auditors.

The fee is a service charge, not a penalty, and is in addition to any change in tuition or forfeiture as a result of adds, drops or changes. There is no charge prior to or during the rst week of classes. Late Registration Fee A late registration service charge of $25 is assessed when a student registers for the rst time after the last scheduled day of Period II registration (the Sunday before the quarter begins) and through the 10th day of the quarter. If circumstances warrant, waiver of the service charge may be petitioned to the UWT Registrar using the Request to Waive Tuition Forfeiture or Registration Fees form. Re-registration Fee A student who must re-register as a result of a previous quarter's cancellation for nonpayment of tuition must pay a $75 fee. If circumstances warrant, a waiver or refund of the registration or the re-registration service charge may be sought by petition to the UWT Registrar using the Request to Waive Tuition Forfeiture or Registration Fees form. Special Course and Laboratory Fees Some courses have extraordinary expenses associated with them and, in such cases, the University may charge additional fees in amounts that approximate the added instructional or laboratory costs. T echnology Fee This fee is to recover, in whole or in part, the costs of providing and maintaining services to students that include, but are not limited to the following: access to the Internet and World Wide Web, e-mail, computer and multimedia workstations and laboratories, computer software and dial-up telephone services. Part-time students (those paying less than full-time tuition) are charged on a prorated basis. The fee is included on the quarterly tuition billing.Financial Obligations The comptroller is authorized to place an administrative hold on the records of any student who fails to pay amounts due to the University. Until this hold is cleared, the University does not release the student's record or any information based on the record, does not prepare transcripts or certied statements, and denies registration as well as graduation from the University. Tuition and fees (including parking and library nes) not paid by the end of the academic quarter are subject to an interest charge of 1 percent per month, or fraction thereof (12 percent APR), beginning the month following the end of the quarter. An administrative hold also may occur when a student has not complied with University rules, followed University procedures or satised student obligations. The hold may be placed on the student's record by the authorized University ofce responsible for enforcement of the rule, procedure or obligation involved. The student is not permitted to register for any subsequent quarter or to obtain a transcript of his or her record or a certied statement except on the written release of the ofce that placed the hold. Tuition Exemption Eligible University and State of Washington employees and members of the Washington National Guard may enroll for and receive a tuition exemption for up to six credits each quarter, provided they enroll on a space-available basis. Eligible students are allowed to enroll for more than six credits and will be charged tuition accordingly for the additional credits. All students participating in the tuition-exemption program will be assessed a quarterly $30 registration fee and must pay other applicable fees, including the technology fee. A participating student may not register for any course, including the credits beyond six that the student will be paying for, prior to the student's assigned space-available registration day or the exemption will be canceled. Matriculated students desiring a higher registration priority to facilitate course enrollment may choose to cancel their exemption for the quarter, register early and pay regular tuition rates. Space availability applies to degree programs as well as courses, and fully enrolled programs may not have space 15 Tuition and feesto accommodate students using the tuition exemption. Eligible students must hold one of the following statuses on the day the exemption form is approved, and must be in that status on the rst day of the quarter for which the exemption was granted. T o be eligible a student must be: A University of Washington employee: permanent classified or contract classified staff who are employed half-time or more with six months or more of continuous service prior to the rst day of the quarter and faculty/ professional staff employed half-time or more on the rst day of class. A non-University of Washington permanent classied or contract State of Washington employee employed half-time or more, A permanent classified or exempt paraprofessional employee of a technical college employed half-time or more, A non-academic employee or member of the faculty or instructional staff employed half-time or more at a state institution of higher education other than the University of Washington, or A member of the Washington Army National Guard or Washington Air National Guard. A note of caution: A UW employee pursuing a graduate program or graduate-level coursework claims the amount of the quarterly exemption as income on the federal income tax return unless his or her supervisor has certied that the program or coursework is job related. If it is determined that the course is not job related, the value of the exemption will be considered income and subject to withholding. Qualifying Courses Courses that involve intensive one-on- one interaction between faculty member and student (such as independent study, research and some eldwork courses) do not qualify under the denition of \"space available.\" Tuition-exempt students may be required to pay full tuition to enroll in these courses. See the quarterly Registration Guide for details. All 600- and 700-level courses are excluded from the tuition exemption program.Admission Status Individuals who wish to participate in the tuition exemption program must apply for admission to the University of Washington, Tacoma. Applicants are subject to the same priority application dates as other new students. Individuals wishing to apply as a matriculated student or as a graduate nonmatriculated student, to a UWT academic program, should contact the specic UWT program ofce for details regarding the application process and space availability in the program. New nonmatriculated students should submit an application for admission to the Ofce of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs. Because tuition exempt paperwork must be received no later than 10 working days prior to the start of the quarter, new applicants are encouraged to submit their paperwork regardless of their pending application status. Program participants who are former UWT students returning in the same classication or as nonmatriculated students should submit their application for admission to the Ofce of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs. Registration and fees The Ofce of the UWT Registrar accepts tuition exempt paperwork for the next quarter beginning the Monday after the 10th day of the current quarter. Paperwork must be submitted each quarter and must be received no later than 10 working days prior to the first day of the quarter in which attendance is planned. UWT strictly adheres to this deadline. Paperwork must be complete, including required signatures, or it will be returned. Paperwork that has been returned must be completed by the same deadline noted above. Actual registration for courses begins through MyUW on or after the appropriate eligibility dates as listed in the quarterly Registration Guide. Under the tuition exemption program, tuition-exempt students must pay the quarterly T echnology Fee. They will be billed this fee, and any other applicable fees, plus the $30 tuition exemption registration fee once they have registered for a course. UW faculty/staff ID cards may be used for library services. Participating state of Washington employees and members of the National Guard may obtain student ID cards for library services from the Ofce of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs. More information and the quarterly required tuition exemption form are available in the Ofce of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs.16 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2004-2005 CatalogRegistration Registration Eligibility Continuing University of Washington, Tacoma students who remain in good scholastic standing are guaranteed the opportunity to register each quarter at UWT as long as they maintain continuous enrollment (excluding Summer Quarter) or satisfy the guidelines of the quarter-off policy. Continuation must be in the same classification (undergraduate, postbaccalaureate or graduate) and at the same campus. After a student has earned a baccalaureate degree, he or she must apply for readmission as a postbaccalaureate, nonmatriculated or graduate student before being allowed to register. Newly admitted students and students readmitted to the same or a new classication (undergraduate, postbaccalaureate or graduate) or admitted to a different University campus are eligible to register during a specified time period. See \"Registration Periods\" on page 18. Exceptions to the guarantee of registration eligibility include students under disciplinary action, students with a nancial hold on their records and students failing to meet conditions of admission or not meeting program or University satisfactory-progress policies. Additionally, continuing students who withdraw during the rst week of two consecutive quarters (Summer Quarter not included) will not be eligible to register as continuing students for the third quarter and must reapply as former students returning to the University. If an undergraduate does not enroll for two or more quarters, he or she must le a Returning Student application for readmission with the Ofce of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs.Quarter-Off Policy Undergraduate students who have completed a quarter at the University of Washington, Tacoma, may take the following quarter off and remain eligible to register during Registration Period I for the subsequent quarter without reapplying as a returning student. Any quarter from which a student has completely withdrawn, or from which he or she is canceled, does not constitute a completed quarter. Summer Quarter enrollment is not required to maintain continuous registration eligibility. The quarter-off policy is not available for graduate students; please see Graduate Student On-Leave Status. Graduating Senior Priority Graduating seniors or postbaccalaureate students with a degree application on le in the Graduation Ofce may register on the rst day of Period I for their nal two quarters. Students who postpone their graduation may save their priority quarters by not registering before their regular senior or postbaccalaureate priority day. When students have used their Graduating Senior Priority for two quarters, their registration priority reverts to the regular senior or postbaccalaureate schedule. Students may not register for classes in any quarter beyond the quarter for which they have applied to graduate (except Summer Quarter). Registering at Other UW Campuses Undergraduate students may register for courses on a space-available basis at other University of Washington campuses if they have matriculated junior standing or higher and have at least 25 UW-earned credits on their transcripts. Students enrolled at UWT may register for courses offered by the Seattle or Bothell campus during Registration Period III. Freshmen, sophomores and nonmatriculated students are ineligible for cross-campus enrollment. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that these courses will count toward his or her baccalaureate degree. Undergraduates are limited to earning 35 credits through cross-campus enrollment after admission to a campus, and graduate students are limited to 12. Undergraduate students must complete a minimum of 45 credits at their home campus. Dropping a Course Students dropping a course during the rst two weeks of a quarter shall have no entry on their permanent academic transcript except notice of withdrawal from the University if all courses are dropped, in which case a complete withdrawal date is recorded on the transcript. A course drop made during the third through the seventh week of the quarter will be recorded on an undergraduate student's transcript with a \"W\" grade and a number designating the week of the quarter in which the course was dropped. Students may drop only one course each academic year (Autumn through Summer quarters) from the third through the seventh week of the quarter. To drop a course officially, a student must complete the transaction electronically using MyUW or submit a drop card in the UWT Ofce of the Registrar. A student who drops a course unofcially (only through the instructor or adviser, for example) is given a grade of 0.0. Students receiving or applying for nancial aid should check with the nancial aid counselor before dropping a class because it may affect nancial aid eligibility. Students should be aware that dropping a course may affect their student account. Please see the \"Tuition and Fees\" section of this catalog. During Summer Quarter, the timeline for dropping a course is abbreviated due to the shortened session. Please consult the Summer Quarter Registration Guide for specic dates.17Hardship Withdrawal Policy Students may petition the UWT Registrar in writing for a Hardship Withdrawal if they are unable to complete a course due to physical or mental debilitation or unusual or extenuating circumstances beyond their control that may have arisen and prevented them from dropping the course by the seventh week. Petitions must be led promptly after the occurrence of the event that gave rise to the need for dropping, preferably prior to the end of the quarter. Only in rare circumstances will petitions be accepted after the close of the quarter in which the withdrawal is being petitioned. Students who have completed the requirements for the course are generally not eligible for a hardship withdrawal. The Petition for Hardship Withdrawal should be completed by the student and submitted to the UWT Registrar in the Ofce of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs. Supporting documentation as detailed on the petition form must accompany the petition. The UWT Registrar reserves the right to verify the authenticity and details of the documentation. Complete Withdrawal from the University for a Registered Quarter (dropping all courses for the quarter) It is the student's responsibility to withdraw from all courses if he or she is unable to attend. Students may withdraw using the electronic registration systems through the unrestricted drop period. Beginning with the third week of the quarter, official withdrawals must be submitted to the UWT Registrar and must include the signature of the program adviser. An ofcial withdrawal is effective the date of the last drop made electronically, the date it is received in the Office of the UWT Registrar, or if submitted by mail, the date of the postmark. Tuition owed will be based on the date the complete withdrawal is received. Withdrawals are NOT accepted after the last day of instruction for the quarter. The tuition forfeiture schedule for complete withdrawal from the University is as follows: Students who withdraw on or before the seventh calendar day of the quarter do not pay tuition. Students who withdraw after the seventh calendar day through the 30th calendar day continue to owe one half of their tuition. Students who withdraw after the 30th calendar day continue to owe full tuition. The following principles apply to complete withdrawal from the University: Courses dropped as part of a complete withdrawal from the University during the rst two weeks of a quarter are not recorded on the student's UW transcript; however, the date of the complete withdrawal is recorded. A recipient of veterans benets should immediately notify the veterans benefits coordinator of withdrawal. A student with a scholarship or loan awarded through the University should notify the nancial aid counselor of withdrawal. Withdrawal for Military Service Students who are conscripted into the U.S. armed forces or called to active military duty may withdraw through the end of the seventh week of instruction and receive a full refund but no academic credit. If a student withdraws after that date, the student may receive either a full refund or academic credit and no refund. Please consult with the Ofce of the UWT Registrar for complete details. Registration Guide Each quarter, the UWT Office of the Registrar publishes an online Registration Guide that contains the schedule of classes, academic calendar, final examination schedule, registration period dates, deadlines (including graduation application deadlines), information about tuition and fees, and registration and withdrawal procedures. It is the responsibility of the student to know and understand these procedures and deadlines. This information is also accessible using the World Wide Web at www.tacoma.washington. edu/oessa . Registering for Classes Students register for classes on the Web using MyUW. Before registering make sure to: Rev iew the instructions in the Registration Guide and note the Registration Periods. Talk with the program adviser before selecting courses. Academic advising is highly recommended. Obtain entry codes from the appropriate program ofce for any courses requiring entry codes.

Any student seeking clarification regarding residency classication should contact the Ofce of the UWT Registrar. Military Personnel Active-duty military personnel stationed in the state of Washington, their spouses and dependent children are eligible for resident tuition. Please request a military exemption form from the Ofce of the UWT Registrar. Access Program for Older Adults UWT allows Washington residents 60 years of age or older to audit certain courses on a space-available basis. Registration for Access students occurs on the rst Wednesday of the quarter. Students who attend the University under the Access Program are limited to two courses per quarter. There is a nominal registration fee, but Access students do not pay tuition. As auditors, students do not receive credit, participate in discussions, complete laboratory work or take examinations.Auditing a Course Students who intend to audit a course must first register for the class through MyUW and then go in person to the Ofce of the UWT Registrar to elect the audit grade option. The deadline to change to audit status is listed in the quarterly Registration Guide. A $20 fee may be imposed depending on the timing of the transaction. Permission to audit is granted by the course instructor and is generally allowed only for lecture classes. Auditors may not participate in discussion or laboratory work. Summer Quarter Students should note that due to the shortened session, deadlines for fee payment and registration transactions may vary from those of the regular academic year. A complete list of Summer Quarter courses and the quarterly deadlines can be found in the Summer Quarter Registration Guide.19 Academic and University PoliciesAcademic and University Policies Academic Policies UWT uses a numerical grading system. Instructors may report grades from 4.0 to 0.7 in 0.1 increments and the grade 0.0. The number 0.0 is assigned for failing work or unofcial withdrawal. Grades in the range 0.6 to 0.1 may not be assigned. Grades reported in this range are converted by the registrar to 0.0. Numerical grades may be considered equivalent to letter grades as shown in the chart at right. The following letter grades may also be used: CR: Credit awarded in a course offered on a credit/no-credit basis only or in courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750 and 800. The minimum performance level required for a CR grade is determined, and the grade is awarded directly by the instructor. CR is not computed in GPA calculations. NC: Credit not awarded in a course offered on a credit/no-credit basis only or in courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750 and 800. The grade is awarded directly by the instructor and is not included in GPA calculations. S: Satisfactory grade for courses taken on a satisfactory/not-satisfactory basis. An S grade is automatically converted from a numerical grade of 2.0 or above for undergraduate classes and 2.7 or above for graduate classes. The grade S may not be assigned directly by the instructor, but is a grade conversion by the Ofce of the UWT Registrar. Undergraduate students may elect this option only for free electives and cannot be used to satisfy a University, college or department course requirement. With the approval of their program adviser, graduate students may elect to be graded S/NS in any numerically-graded course for which they are eligible. No more than 25 credits of S/NS grades may be applied to an undergraduate degree. S is not computed in GPA calculations. There is no limit on the number of S credits that can be applied to a graduate degree. Undergraduate Graduate Letter Grade Point Letter Grade Point Grade Equivalent Grade Equivalent A 3.9 - 4.0 A 3.9 - 4.0 A- 3.5 - 3.8 A- 3.5 - 3.8 B+ 3.2 - 3.4 B+ 3.1 - 3.4 B 2.9 - 3.1 B 2.9 - 3.0 B- 2.5 - 2.8 B- 2.5 - 2.8 A minimum of 2.7 is C+ 2.2 - 2.4 required in each course C 1.9 - 2.1 that is counted toward C- 1.5 - 1.8 a graduate degree.

No credit earned. NS: Not Satisfactory grade for courses taken on a satisfactory/not-satisfactory basis. A grade less than 2.0 for undergraduate classes and 2.7 for graduate classes is converted to NS. NS is not included in GPA calculations. No credit is awarded for courses in which an NS grade is received. I: Incomplete. An Incomplete is given only when the student has been in attendance and has done satisfactory work until within two weeks of the end of the quarter and has furnished proof satisfactory to the instructor that the work cannot be completed because of illness or other circumstances beyond the student's control. To obtain credit for the course, an undergraduate student must convert an Incomplete into a passing grade no later than the last day of the next quarter. The student should never re-register for the course as a means of removing the Incomplete. For undergraduate students, an Incomplete grade not made up by the end of the next quarter is converted to a grade of 0.0 by the Ofce of the UWT Registrar unless the instructor has indicated when assigning the Incomplete grade, that a grade other than 0.0 should be recorded if the incomplete work is not completed. The I (Incomplete) is not removed from the permanent record and appears on the transcript with the completed grade. An instructor may approve an extension of the Incomplete removal deadline by contacting the UWT Registrar no later than the last day of the quarter following the quarter in which the Incomplete grade was assigned. Extensions, which may be granted for up to three additional quarters, must be received before the Incomplete has been converted into a failing grade. In no case can an Incomplete received by an undergraduate be converted to a passing grade after the lapse of one year. W: Official withdrawal or drop from a course from the third through the seventh week of the quarter for undergraduates. A number designating the week of the quarter is recorded with the W when a course is dropped. It is not computed in GPA calculations. HW: Grade assigned when a student is allowed a hardship withdrawal from a course after the 14th calendar day of the quarter (see Hardship Withdrawal Policy on page 17). It is not computed in GPA calculations. LETTER GRADE EQUIVALENTS20 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2004-2005 CatalogN: Indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress and a nal grade will be given at the end of the quarter the work is completed. Used only for hyphenated courses (courses not completed in one quarter) and courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750 or 800. Grade-Point Average (GPA) The cumulative GPA includes credits granted for courses taken in residence at all campuses of the University of Washington and those with a DL (Distance Learning) suffix taken through UW Educational Outreach (UWEO). The UW transcript also reflects grades for other UWEO courses that are not residence credit and grades for credit by examination. These latter grades do not affect the student's UW cumulative GPA. Computation of GPA The grade-point average for graduation is computed by dividing the total cumulative grade points by the total credits attempted for courses taken in residence at the University. Grade points are calculated by multiplying the number of credits by the numeric value of the grade for each course. The sum of the grade points is then divided by the total credits attempted. Courses elected on an S/ NS basis are counted as follows: Satisfactory grades are printed on the permanent record as an S and do not count in the quarterly or cumulative grade-point average, but they do count as credits earned toward graduation. Not-satisfactory grades (NS) do not count in the quarterly and cumulative grade-point averages and do not count as credits earned toward graduation. Example 1: Grade Course Credits Grade PointsTIAS 498 3 x 0.0 = 0.0 TSMIN 300 5 x 2.9 = 14.5TCSIUS 445 5 x 3.2 = 16.0 30.5 T otal credits earned toward graduation: 10 T otal graded credits attempted: 13 Grade-point average = 30.5 \u00f7 13 = 2.35 The total graded credits attempted, not the credits earned toward graduation, are used in computing the GPA. Example 2: Grade Course Credits Grade Points TBUS 300 5 x 2.3 = 11.5 TBUS 310 5 x 2.9 = 14.5TBUS 320 5 x I = 0.0 26.0 T otal credits earned toward graduation: 10 T otal graded credits attempted: 15 Grade-point average = 26.0 \u00f7 10 = 2.60The student attempted 15 credits, but only 10 are graded; the I is not computed in the grade-point average. If the work in TBUS 320 is not made up by the end of the quarter, the I will convert to a numeric grade of 0.0 and the grade-point average will be recomputed. When the grade of 0.0 is received, it is computed in the grade-point average, but no credit is awarded toward graduation. Repeating Courses With the approval of the academic program offering the course, a student may repeat a course once. Both the original grade and the second grade will be computed in the grade-point average, but credit will be allowed only once. V eterans receiving benets must receive approval from the veterans coordinator in the Office of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs before a course is repeated. Class Attendance The University of Washington, Tacoma reserves the right to drop students who have not attended class during the rst week of the quarter to make space for other students waiting to enroll. However, students should not assume that they will automatically be dropped from a course if they do not attend. It is the student's responsibility to drop the course through MyUW. Students who are registered for a course section but do not attend will be assigned a failing grade by the instructor. Students may not attend a course in which they have not been ofcially registered after the rst two weeks of the quarter. An instructor may allow a student to attend his or her class only if the student's name appears on the ofcial class list from the Office of the UWT Registrar. Other faculty members may attend informally with the approval of the instructor. Grading Procedures Change of Grade Except in case of error, an instructor may not change a grade that he or she has submitted to the registrar. A student who nds administrative omissions or errors in a grade report must make application for a review not later than the last day of the student's next quarter in residence. Grades used to meet graduation requirements cannot be changed after the degree has been granted. Students are not automatically notied of grade changes posted after the rst of the quarter.Grade Appeal Procedure A student who believes he or she has been improperly graded rst discusses the matter with the instructor before the end of the following academic quarter. If the student is not satised with the instructor's explanation, the student may submit a written appeal to the director of the student's academic program with a copy of the appeal also to the instructor. This must be done no later than 10 class days after his or her discussion with the instructor. The director consults with the instructor to ensure that the evaluation of the student's performance has not been arbitrary or capricious. Should the director believe the instructor's conduct to be arbitrary or capricious and the instructor decline to revise the grade, the director, with the approval of the voting members of his or her faculty, shall appoint an appropriate member, or members, of the faculty of that program to evaluate the performance of the student and assign a grade. The UWT Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and the University of Washington Provost should be informed of this action. Once a student submits a written appeal, this document and all subsequent actions on this appeal are recorded in written form for deposit in a program le. Grade Reports The University of Washington does not mail grade reports. Students access their grades online using MyUW. Transcripts Ofcial transcripts are available from the Ofce of the UWT Registrar. Transcripts may be ordered using a request form or by written request from the student. The request must include name; Social Security number or student identication number; current phone number; date of birth; address to which the transcript should be sent and student signature. Additional helpful information includes dates of attendance and former name. Because requests require the signature of the student, e-mail requests will not be accepted. Payment of $4 per transcript is required at the time of the request by check or money order. The Transcript Request form is available online at www.tacoma. washington. edu/oessa/transcripts.html . Allow three to ve working days for processing. Same-day requests are available for an additional $15 fee. Transcripts may be picked up in the Ofce of the UWT Registrar with picture identication or mailed to a third party, per student request. Each transcript will include all coursework taken at the University of Washington, with indication of the campus where the credits were earned. Students can print out an unofficial transcript online at myuw.washington.edu .21 Academic and University PoliciesScholarship Academic Standards Students are expected to meet the traditional standards of honesty and truthfulness in all aspects of their academic work at UW Tacoma. In particular, all work submitted to an instructor in fulllment of course assignments, including papers and projects, written and oral examinations, and oral presentations and reports, must be free of plagiarism. Plagiarism is using the creations, ideas or words of someone else without formally acknowledging the author or source through appropriate use of quotation marks, references and the like. Student work in which plagiarism occurs will not be accepted as satisfactory by the instructor and may lead to disciplinary action against the student submitting it. Any student who is uncertain whether his or her use of the work of others constitutes plagiarism should consult the course instructor for guidance before formally submitting the work involved. Satisfactory Progress The University's satisfactory progress policy requires that students complete their undergraduate degree within 30 credits beyond the minimum required for the degree. Because most degrees require 180 total transfer and UW credits, students generally must complete their programs by the time they earn 210 credits. Undergraduates who have completed over 210 credits will be notied by the end of the third week of the quarter that a hold is being placed on their registration due to lack of satisfactory progress. Students are encouraged to meet with their program adviser to prepare a graduation plan to avoid this situation. Low Scholarship Academic Warning An undergraduate student whose grade- point average falls below 2.00 in his or her rst quarter at the University receives an academic warning. If a cumulative grade-point average of at least 2.00 for courses earned in residence at the University is not achieved by the end of the next quarter, he or she is placed on academic probation. Academic Probation and Dismissal for Low Scholarship An undergraduate student is placed on academic probation at the end of any quarter (except for the rst quarter at the University, when an academic warning is issued) in which his or her cumulative grade-point average falls below 2.00. Once on probation, the student must attain at least a 2.50 for each succeeding quarter's work until the cumulative grade-point average is raised to a 2.00 or the student is dropped for low scholarship.Reinstatement An undergraduate student who has been dropped under low-scholarship rules will be readmitted to the University only at the discretion of the UWT Admissions, Academic Standards and Graduation Committee and only after having sat out one quarter. A student readmitted after being dropped under these rules reenters the University on academic probation and may be required to re-apply to their academic program. The student's GPA is the same as when dropped from the University, and the student may not use grades from other colleges or universities to raise his or her UW grade-point average. A readmitted student is dropped if he or she fails to attain either a 2.50 grade-point average for the following quarter's work or a cumulative UW grade-point average of 2.00 at the end of that quarter. The student is removed from probation at the end of the quarter in which a cumulative grade-point average of 2.00 or better is reached. The Petition for Reinstatement form is available from the Ofce of the UWT Registrar. Senior in Final Quarter A senior who has completed the required number of credits for graduation, but whose work in what would normally be his or her nal quarter places him or her on probation does not receive a degree until removed from probation. Dean's List Quarterly Dean's List The quarterly high-scholarship list includes the names of matriculated undergraduate students who have attained a quarterly grade-point average of 3.50 in the nal grades for at least 12 graded credits. Appropriate high-scholarship entries are made on the student's permanent academic record. Annual Dean's List The yearly award for high scholarship is recorded on the academic transcript of undergraduate students enrolled for three quarters of the academic year (summer through spring) and who earned a quarterly GPA of 3.50 in 12 or more numerically graded credits each quarter. It is also recorded for students enrolled for four quarters who met the standard just mentioned and also earned a quarterly GPA of 3.5 or better in the fourth quarter if enrolled for 10 or more credits. Annual Dean's List Certicate Annual Dean's List Certificates are awarded to students in the senior class who have high scholastic records for their junior year. The Honors Committee on the University of Washington, Seattle campus determines the grade-point average required for the awarding of certicates. Students receive a certicate and a letter of congratulations from the UWT Chancellor.Baccalaureate Honors Baccalaureate honors ( summa cum laude, magna cum laude, cum laude) are awarded only to recipients of a rst baccalaureate degree. These honors are earned by those students who have completed no fewer than 90 residence credits at this institution. At least 60 of the 90 credits must have been acquired on a graded basis. The University's Honors Committee determines annually the grade-point requirement for each baccalaureate honor. In recent years, approximately 10 percent of the students have been awarded baccalaureate honors. Credits earned by extension courses are not counted toward honors eligibility. August graduates who participated in the preceding June commencement should contact their program adviser regarding recognition of honors at the June ceremony. Faculty Honors At the University of Washington, Tacoma, faculty honors are awarded to those students receiving a baccalaureate degree whose GPA is in the upper 10 percent of their program and who have earned between 43 and 89 graded credits at the UW. Chancellor's Medal The Chancellor's Medal, which is conferred at commencement, recognizes the graduating senior who has the most distinguished academic record. Only students who have earned at least 90 credits (43 credits for Nursing students) in residence at the University of Washington, Tacoma may be considered. Student Rights and Responsibilities It is the responsibility of the student to become familiar with all academic and administrative regulations and procedures relating to his or her course of study at UWT. Student Conduct Code The University Board of Regents has adopted a Student Conduct Code, which applies to both academic and nonacademic conduct for students while in attendance at UWT.

Admission Categories UWT offers seven admission categories, outlined below. The Ofce of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs can assist applicants who are uncertain about the proper admission category. Matriculated students New students at UW Tacoma seeking their rst undergraduate degree are normally admitted to a specic academic program as matriculated students. Postbaccalaureate students Postbaccalaureate is a matriculated status at the University of Washington, Tacoma. Postbaccalaureate students are those who have completed one or more bachelor's degrees and are either enrolled in the T eacher Certication program or working toward another bachelor's degree. The application of their previous coursework toward graduation requirements will be determined by program faculty and advisers.Nonmatriculated students Although a student enrolled at the University of Washington, Tacoma in a nonmatriculated status cannot earn a degree, a grade is earned and full credit is awarded and recorded on a UW transcript. The credits earned as a nonmatriculated student usually transfer to other institutions. If a student is later accepted into a matriculated status at the Tacoma campus, courses earned as a nonmatriculated student may be applied to undergraduate degree requirements, with some restrictions. Students admitted as nonmatriculated may be limited in the number of credits they will be allowed to accrue in this status. The number may vary by program. Students considering switching to matriculated (degree-seeking) status are encouraged to do so as soon as possible, as 45 of the last 60 credits of a baccalaureate degree must be earned as a matriculated student in residence at the Tacoma campus. Students who wish to change their status from nonmatriculated to matriculated must apply to do so by the priority application date of the program they wish to enter.

The following are required by all programs: Foreign language All applicants must complete two high school years, or 10 credits at the college level, of a single foreign language. The study must be devoted to a single foreign language and must be in sequence, with no repetition of any prior term of study. Any natural language other than English that has been formally studied may be used to satisfy this requirement, including languages no longer spoken, such as Latin and ancient Greek. American Sign Language (AMESLAN, the language of the deaf community in America) will also meet this requirement. However, other forms of deaf signing and computer \"languages\" are not acceptable. The foreign language requirement will be considered satised for applicants who had instruction through seventh grade in a language other than English. Mathematics All applicants must complete three years of high school math through intermediate (second-year) algebra or a course in intermediate algebra in college. Prociency may be satised through other coursework; check with the academic program for a list. Quantitative/Symbolic Reasoning (QSR) course All applicants must complete one Quantitative/Symbolic Reasoning (QSR) course. Coursework to fulll this requirement can be completed through enrollment at a community college, at a four-year institution or through UW Distance Learning. In some circumstances, coursework may be completed at UWT. Some students enroll concurrently at UWT and a community college to accomplish this. Depending upon individual circumstances, students may be able to complete a portion of these requirements at UW T acoma. Courses offered at UWT that will satisfy this requirement are indicated in the course description listings for each program. Writing All applicants must complete at least ve credits of English composition to meet the minimum admission requirement. English composition courses are not offered at the Tacoma campus. Coursework will need to be completed through enrollment at a community college, a four-year institution or UW Distance Learning. Students should consider completing the required 5-10 additional credits of writing-intensive coursework prior to entering UWT. In some cases, completion of an advanced writing course at UWT may be used to fulll the English composition requirement. Courses offered at UWT that will satisfy this requirement are indicated in the course description listings for each program. Undergraduate Transfer Credit To students pursuing a rst bachelor's degree, UWT awards transfer credit according to the guidelines listed below. It reserves the right to accept or reject credits earned at other institutions of higher education. In general, it is University policy to accept credits earned at institutions fully accredited by the regional accrediting association provided that such credits have been earned through university-level courses (see exceptions below) appropriate to the student's degree program. For courses taken at a Washington state community college, UWT follows the list of transferable courses published in the UW Equivalency Guide for Washington Community and T echnical Colleges. Notable Restrictions on Transfer Credit Lower-division college credit The University of Washington will accept in transfer toward a bachelor's degree no more than 90 lower-division credits. After a student has been admitted to a university major, additional lower-division transfer credit may be allowed when: (a) the additional transfer credit will advance the student to degree completion, and (b) the student's school or college approves a petition led by the students to allow more than 90 lower-division transfer credits. UW Extension distance learning If permitted by the specific academic program, up to 90 credits earned in correspondence courses offered by the Distance Learning division of UW Extension may be applied toward a UW degree. However, 45 of the student's nal 60 credits must be taken in residence at UWT to meet the Final-Y ear Residence Requirement.Extension credit from other schools No more than 45 credits earned as extension credit from other schools may be applied toward a UW degree. Military credit, discussed below, is included in the 45 extension credit limit. Guidance/Personal development A maximum of 3 credits is awarded for courses in this area as part of the 15 credits allowed for vocational/technical courses. Limitation on ROTC credits Credits earned in first- and second- year military training courses may not be counted in the 180 credits that are required for graduation. Some third- and fourth-year courses may count, depending on the student's degree program. Military credit Credits earned in Armed Forces Training Schools (AFTS) and through USAFI and DANTES may not exceed 30 and are included in the 45 extension credit limit. Official transcripts or DD-214 or DD-295 forms must be submitted, and credit will not be awarded until after the student has enrolled. Scores received in such coursework are not included in the transfer GPA. Out-of-sequence courses Credit is not awarded for prerequisite courses completed after a more advanced-level course has been completed. For example, students will not be awarded credit for Spanish 102 if it was taken after Spanish 103. Physical education No more than 3 quarter credits will be allowed for physical education activity courses. Vocational-technical courses A maximum of 15 transfer credits will be awarded for a wide range of college-level courses that are vocational-technical, rather than academic, in content (i.e., bookkeeping, electronics, physical therapy technician). These credits may apply only to the elective component of a baccalaureate degree and only with program approval. Alternative credit The University of Washington, Tacoma does not award general credit for work or life experience.

Any such credit awarded by other institutions, or through independent testing, will not be transferred to the University.Applicability of Transfer Credit to Degree Requirements The Ofce of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs has the authority to make decisions approving transfer credit to the University and application of transfer credits to fulll University requirements. The individual academic program ofces have the authority to determine application of transfer credits to fulll major requirements. By the first quarter of enrollment, a student should meet with a program adviser to plan a program of study. The program adviser will determine how the transfer credits may be used in meeting degree requirements. Quarter vs. Semester Credits Colleges and universities that operate on a semester system award semester credit. The University of Washington, Tacoma awards quarter credit.

See www.tacoma.washington.edu/tech/courses/bs_courses.html for details.Computing210 credits3 Must include 5 credits each of Object-Oriented Programming I & II (Java preferred).41The curriculum has been built on the following principles: Computer software professionals must be capable of effectively employing the appropriate computing language to best meet the needs of a specic application. They must be prepared to learn and proficiently use new languages and tools as they become available, as well as to maintain and re-engineer existing applications. The eld of computer software continues to evolve rapidly. This can be expected to continue through the career spans of today's students. Students must, therefore, possess the foundations, tools and lifelong learning skills to keep current in the eld. Mathematical maturity and an understanding of the underlying theories of computing, computers, information and communication provide this foundation. Important software applications tend to be large and complex. It takes teams to produce them. Software should be error- free, robust, efficient and modifiable. The quality of its user interfaces and the interfaces to other applications is critical to its effectiveness. The adherence to accepted standards and procedures for software development is essential to the development process. Software development involves a community of participants. Effective management of the participants and the processes is critical to its success and ultimate value. All participants need to understand the expected principles and norms used in making the process effective and efcient. Practitioners of software design need to be able to join colleagues and competitors immediately in exploiting the latest concepts and technologies. Preparation for professional-level contributions in the eld must include an introduction to and relevant experience with those emerging concepts and technologies. Software professionals must have excellent communication skills. Software development and maintenance requires that all participants\u2014from conceptualizers to specication writers, designers, modelers, coders, testers, manual writers, and customer supporters\u2014be precise and clear in communicating ideas, concepts, designs and processes for a software project to succeed. Software professionals must take responsibility for their work. They must practice the highest standards of ethics and must design their software to meet the most stringent social norms and societal expectations. The working lives of users, the value of the products and the future of the industry itself depend on practitioners being proactive in exercising their best judgment and effort.

The focus of the curriculum is the comparative study of peoples, groups, societies, cultures and environments within the United States and selected regions of the world. To provide an interdisciplinary and comparative basis for the study of different groups, societies and cultures, the Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences curriculum is organized around three general dimensions: Culture and Ideas (Fine Arts and Humanities), Society and the Individual (Social Sciences) and The Natural World (Natural Sciences). The goals of the Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences curriculum are to help students: Develop prociency in skills such as writing and critical thinking that are needed for productive careers and gain mastery of a broad curriculum in the humanities, social sciences and environmental science Achieve knowledge of the theories, concepts and methods of cross-cultural analysis Understand the complexity of relations between groups, societies, cultures and natural environments, the history of these relations and the forces of social change Gain a knowledge and appreciation of cultures other than their own while exploring the expression of cultural identity, thought and beliefs through literature and the other arts Build experience in the analysis of environmental issues and their scientic basisInterdisciplinary Arts and Sciences Bachelor of Arts Bachelor of Science (Environmental Science) Phone: (253) 692-4450 Fax: www.tacoma. washington.edu/iasInterdisciplinary Arts and Sciences is an evolving, culturally relevant course of study grounded in a respect for diversity and responsive to the needs and desires of the communities around us.

The philosophy of the undergraduate curriculum is rooted in values of excellence, diversity, community, social justice, integrity and creativity. Preparation for the various roles in practice requires knowledge of the arts and sciences, together with content and processes foundational to the discipline. We are a community of learners and scholars\u2014a community created in collaboration with students. The members of the faculty believe that their teaching styles need to take into account the diverse nature of how students learn. Ultimately, nursing education requires a commitment to community service, scholarly inquiry, interdisciplinarity and life-long learning.Program Overview Students in the B.S.N. program are registered nurses who have completed the initial phase of their education through an associate degree or diploma nursing program. As most students in the UWT Nursing program are employed in health- care settings, courses are scheduled to enable students to continue employment while enrolled in the program of study. A B.S.N. from UWT enhances the graduate's ability to contribute to his or her community's institutions and to the health of citizens of Washington state, particularly during this period of rapid change in health care. The B.S.N. curriculum focuses on critical thinking, responses to health and human functioning, nursing intervention and person-environment interaction within a context of cultural diversity. An interdisciplinary emphasis encourages an understanding of a broad range of ideas, knowledge and methods of study. Phone: (253) 692-4470 Fax: (253) site: www.tacoma. washington.edu/nursingThe Nursing program focuses on the discovery and dissemination of knowledge that promotes health. The curriculum emphasizes and fosters the integration of teaching, inquiry and service within a community of learners. Partnerships with the community assist the program in providing learning environments in which learners build upon their skills and knowledge to strengthen their understanding of local, national and global health issues.

We want to ensure that our graduates have a positive impact on student learning. This program is intended to prepare teachers for urban school teaching. UWT has established partnerships with school districts in the South Puget Sound region. Cooperating teachers and university faculty members work together to provide interns with a program that ensures integration of course content with hands-on experience. Site placements in partnership schools begin in late summer and continue through the remainder of the program. The curriculum features an introduction to teaching in all areas of the elementary and middle-school curriculum, preparation for non-curricular aspects of the teacher's role, reflection on contemporary issues in education and frequent supervision. As teaching interns, students will become a part of instructional teams and will experience the daily life of schools and students for the entire public school year. Within this collaborative model of school-university cooperation, interns will gradually take on increasingly responsible roles in classrooms. Their experience will culminate with a quarter of full-time teaching in the spring. Admission Requirements Bachelor's degree from a regionally- accredited university or college. Applicants who are in the nal quarter or semester of their undergraduate work may apply for provisional admission, but must hold a bachelor's degree before beginning the Teacher Certication Program.

Check with an IAS adviser to learn which concentrations are most compatible with this minor. Public history engages with the past and its presentation to the public by training historians to be active participants in society. This interdisciplinary eld draws on traditional historical scholarship while incorporating knowledge and methods from a variety of other disciplines including art history, anthropology, historic preservation, and library science. Public historians learn how to convey history to a wide range of audiences using new and innovative methods. Most importantly, public historians strive to teach the public about the value of history and the need to learn about the past to better understand the present and shape the future. Over the past two decades an explosion in the number of museums, historical societies and historic sites has led to increased demand for public historians. These historians work as consultants, archivists, historic preservationists, curators, educators, oral historians, media and public relations professionals and public policy analysts. Students interested in history or education would benet from this minor by having the opportunity to apply their historical knowledge to the public sphere. This minor develops skills in historical research and methods, complementing IAS concentrations (e.g., Arts, Media, and Culture; American Studies). An internship component allows students to gain hands-on experience working for a local or regional organization in the eld of public history. The South Puget Sound region has numerous opportunities for internships, including a number of institutions just steps away from the UWT campus. *These courses are also part of the Minor in Nonprofit Management.

Admitted students will be required to submit a second official transcript from their baccalaureate institution after admission. Additional materials, such as goal statements and letters of reference, may be required by individual programs. Please see the individual program sections in this catalog for details. Priority for admission of applicants into a graduate degree program is based upon the applicant's apparent ability, as determined by the University, to complete the program expeditiously with a high level of achievement and also upon the applicant's promise for success in his or her subsequent career. In addition, according to Graduate School admission policy: No practice may discriminate against an individual because of race, color, national origin, disability, sex, age, religious preference, creed, sexual orientation, marital status, or background, or status as disabled veteran or Vietnam-era veteran and Sustained efforts must be made to recruit qualified students who are members of groups that have been subject to discrimination or are underrepresented in certain disciplines.How to Apply for Graduate Admission Application materials may be obtained from the ofce of the academic program at UWT in which the student wishes to pursue graduate studies or from the Ofce of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs. For detailed information about admission to graduate studies at UWT, contact the specic program ofce at UWT. Priority Dates for Graduate Applications The priority dates for application to the graduate programs are listed in the table on the next page. Please note that this is the date that application materials must actually reach the appropriate ofces, not the postmark date. Applying to the UW Graduate School Applicants must apply both to the UW Graduate School and to their program of choice at UWT. The Graduate School now requires applicants to apply online at: (note that the URL begins with \"http s://\") https://www.grad.washington.edu/ application An application fee of $45 must be paid by credit or debit card or electronic check with the online application. Applicants who are unable to apply online should contact their program of choice to discuss other application options. A printout or copy of the applicant's UW Graduate School application must be included with application materials sent to their UW Tacoma program of choice.106 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2004-2005 CatalogApplying to a UW T acoma graduate program In addition to submitting an application to the UW Graduate School, applicants must complete a separate application and submit additional materials directly to the UWT program to which they wish to apply. Application procedures and requirements differ by program. Please contact the specic program for details. Early submission of applications is encouraged. Some programs require additional documentation (letters of recommendation, for example). See the appropriate section of this catalog and check with the program ofce for current information. All records submitted as part of an admission application become a part of the ofcial le and the property of the University and cannot be returned or duplicated. These procedures and deadlines apply to new students, visiting students and former students of the University of Washington who have not attended since receiving their baccalaureate degrees. A former student must apply as a new student for admission to the Graduate School. Contact the program of choice for specic procedures. Notication of admission status When all required documents have been received, an evaluation is made and the applicant is notied of his or her admission status. An offer of admission is generally valid only for the quarter indicated. Applicants who wish to be considered for a different quarter must le a new application and fee. In some situations, the program ofce may be willing to update a student's application to a new quarter. Check with the program of choice for details. Admission credentials of applicants who do not register for the quarter to which they have been admitted are normally retained for a period of one year from the quarter of application. At the end of this period, credentials on le are discarded unless the applicant has notied the Ofce of Graduate Admissions and the program of a continued interest in attending the University. Graduate credits taken as an undergraduate University of Washington students who are within six credits of completing their undergraduate work and who have met the requirements for admission to the Graduate School may register the quarter immediately preceding admission to the Graduate School for up to six credits in 500-level courses in addition to the last six credits they require of undergraduate work. For example, a student admitted for Autumn Quarter may take graduate credits during the preceding Spring Quarter. This registration and these arrangements must be approved by the graduate program that the student will enter. However, students so enrolling are not reclassied as graduate students until the baccalaureate degree has been granted and after their official admission. At that point, it is necessary to petition to permit the six credits to apply toward the master's degree. Only under these circumstances may graduate work taken as an undergraduate be applied toward an advanced degree. Further registration for graduate work is contingent upon completion of the requirements for the bachelor's degree. Graduate Nonmatriculated Students Graduate nonmatriculated (GNM) is a classication for post-baccalaureate students who are not seeking a graduate degree at the time of registration. While a student does not need GNM status to register for a graduate- level class, a student must have it in order to apply the credits to a graduate degree at Autumn Winter Spring Summer 2004 2005 2005 2005 Business (M.B.A.) Apr. 15 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Computing and Software Systems (M.S.)

PRIORITY APPLICATION DATES FOR GRADUATE PROGRAMSthe University of Washington should the student later be admitted as a matriculated graduate student. GNM status is granted by the individual graduate program. A minimum GPA of 3.0 in the last 90 quarter (60 semester) graded credits is required for consideration. A student who is later admitted to the Graduate School may apply a maximum of 12 applicable GNM credits (or any combination of GNM and up to six approved transfer credits, totaling 12 credits) toward a master's degree. Admission into the GNM status does not confer priority for or guarantee of later admission into the Graduate School to pursue a degree. Applicants for GNM status must contact the academic program directly for application information. Not all programs choose to offer GNM status. Programs will advise students regarding the status and provide instructions, application forms and program requirements to appropriate candidates. Failure to register for any quarter except Summer Quarter will result in loss of GNM status. Once GNM status has been lost, the application process must be repeated in order to be readmitted as a GNM student. The transcripts and other student records from the prior records can be forwarded to supplement the new application, and the new application fee may be waived. GNM students pay fees and tuition at the regular graduate-student rate based on residency of the student including the Student Services and Activity Fee and the Technology Fee. GNM students are not eligible for financial aid because most nancial aid is governed by federal regulations that require students to be enrolled in degree programs. Students will be assigned a UW student number and receive a student identication card that entitles them to all privileges and access to facilities that are extended to matriculated students. Visiting Graduate Students A student who wishes to enroll in a graduate program at the University of Washington, Tacoma and who intends thereafter to return to another graduate school in which he or she is working toward an advanced degree may be admitted as a visiting graduate student. This admission is contingent on available space and facilities. Such a student must have been ofcially admitted to another recognized graduate school and be in good standing and currently pursuing a graduate degree. Admission to the University of Washington, Tacoma, as a visiting graduate student does not guarantee admission to any particular course of study. A visiting graduate student is permitted to register only in those courses for which he or she is judged to be eligible by a faculty adviser or the instructor of the course and if space is available to accommodate registration. 107Further details regarding application and other relevant policies may be obtained from the appropriate program ofce at UWT or on the Web at www.grad.washington.edu . Transfer Credit A student working toward a master's degree may petition the Dean of the Graduate School for permission to transfer to the University of Washington the equivalent of a maximum of six quarter credits of graduate level coursework taken at another recognized academic institution. These credits may not have been used to satisfy requirements for another degree. The petition must include a written recommendation from the graduate program coordinator and an official transcript indicating completion of the coursework. Transfer credits are not entered on the UW transcript. University of Washington students who are within six credits of completing their undergraduate degree and who have met the requirements for admission to the Graduate School may register the quarter immediately preceding admission to Graduate School for up to six credits in 500-level courses in addition to the last six credits they require of undergraduate work. The graduate program that has admitted the student must approve registration for the courses. The student, after admission to the Graduate School, must le a petition with the Dean of the Graduate School to transfer the six credits. The student must also provide a letter from the Ofce of Graduation and Academic Records stating that these credits have not been applied toward the undergraduate degree. Contact the specic program for details. Graduate Student Policies The following section contains detailed information concerning policies and procedures relating to graduate students and graduate studies. Students should verify all information with the program adviser of the individual academic program or appropriate staff. For more information on the UW Graduate School and graduate student policies, please visit the Graduate School Web site at www.grad.washington.edu. Graduate Courses Graduate courses are intended for, and ordinarily restricted to, either students enrolled in the Graduate School or graduate nonmatriculated students and are given numbers from 500 to 800. Some courses at the 300 and 400 levels are open to both graduates and upper-division under-graduates. Such courses, when acceptable to the supervisory committee and the specic academic program, may be part of the graduate program. The Graduate School accepts credit in approved 300-level courses for the minor or supporting fields only. Courses at the 300 level are not included in the calculation of grade-point average (GPA) and will not apply toward the minimum Graduate School requirement of 18 graded credits for the master's degree. Approved 400-level courses are accepted as part of the major as well as minor or supporting elds. Courses numbered 490 and titled Special T opics and Special Projects normally are not applicable to a graduate degree program if addressed primarily to introductory content and undergraduate students. Undergraduate research (499) is not accepted as part of the graduate program. Graduate School Memorandum No. 36 offers additional information on graduate courses. With the exception of summer, students are limited to a maximum 10 credits per quarter of any combination of courses numbered 600, 700 or 800. Graduate Student On-Leave Status Graduate students who do not maintain continuous enrollment (Summer Quarter excepted) must le a petition for on-leave status with their program office. To be eligible for on-leave status, the student must have registered for, and completed, at least one quarter and be in good academic standing. An on-leave student is permitted to use the University Library but is not eligible for other University privileges. On-leave status forms are available from the program ofce. A $35 fee is charged for each petition led. Students who are registered for any portion of a quarter may not go on leave for that quarter unless they ofcially withdraw at the UWT Ofce of Enrollment Service and Student Affairs prior to the rst day of the quarter. On-leave status can be granted for up to four quarters. On-leave graduate students returning to the University on or before the termination of their authorized periods of leave need only register using MyUW for the quarter they want to return. Re-admission A student previously registered in the Graduate School who has failed to maintain graduate student status but who wishes later to resume graduate studies must apply online to be re-admitted. If the student has attended any other institution during the period when not registered at the University of Washington, ofcial transcripts in duplicate of the student's work must be submitted. An application for re-admission carries no preference and is treated in the same manner as an application for initial admission, including the requirement of payment of the application fee. Graduate and Postbaccalaureate Admission and GraduationStudents are required to meet the program requirements in place at the time they are re-admitted. The Graduate School normally allows six years to complete requirements for a master's degree. Periods spent on leave or out of status are included. Graduation Requirements for the Master's Degree It is the responsibility of each graduate degree candidate to meet the following Graduate School minimum requirements (plus any additional requirements that may be specied by the program in which the master's degree is being earned; see item 7): 1. Under a thesis program, a minimum of 36 quarter credits (27 course credits and a minimum of nine credits of thesis) must be presented. Under a non-thesis program, a minimum of 36 quarter credits of coursework is required. 2. At least 18 of the minimum 36 quarter credits for the master's degree must be for work numbered 500 and above. (In a thesis program, nine of the 18 must be course credits and nine may be for Master's Thesis [700].) 3. Numerical grades must be received in at least 18 quarter credits of coursework taken at the University of Washington, Tacoma. The Graduate School accepts numerical grades in approved 400-level courses accepted as part of the major and in all 500- level courses. The student must earn a minimum grade of 2.7 in each class in order for it to be counted. A minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 is required for a graduate degree at the University. 4. The residence requirement for the master's degree is one year (three full- time quarters). Students registered for fewer than 10 credits per quarter may add part-time quarters together to achieve the equivalent of one full-time quarter (10 or more credits) to be applied toward fullling residence requirements. However, excess credits beyond 10 may not be subtracted from one quarter and added to another. Once a student is admitted to a graduate degree program, a full quarter of residence is granted for any quarter in which at least 10 credits in approved courses, research, thesis, or internship are satisfactorily completed.108 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2004-2005 Catalog5. In a thesis degree program, a thesis, approved by the supervisory committee, must be submitted to the Graduate School. A student must register for a minimum of nine credits of thesis (700). With the exception of summer, students are limited to a maximum of nine credits per quarter of thesis (700). 6. A nal master's examination, either oral or written, as determined by the student's supervisory committee, must be passed if it is a program requirement. 7. Any additional requirements imposed by the graduate program adviser in the student's major department or by the student's supervisory committee must be satised. A master's degree student usually takes some work outside the major department. The graduate program coordinator in the major department or the student's supervisory committee determines the requirements for the minor or supporting courses. 8. The graduate student must apply for the master's degree within the rst two weeks of the quarter in which he or she expects the degree to be conferred. See Graduate Degree Application Process below. 9. The graduate student must maintain registration as a full- or part-time student at the University for the quarter in which the degree is conferred. A student who does not complete all degree requirements by the last day of the quarter must be registered for the following quarter. 10. All work for the master's degree must be completed within six years. This includes quarters spent on leave or out of status and applicable work transferred from other institutions. 11. A student must satisfy the requirements for the degree that are in force at the time the degree is to be awarded.Graduate Degree Application Process When a student is within one quarter of completing the degree requirements, the student must apply for the master's degree on the Web. Students will be required to have a UW NetID before completing the master's degree application. The degree application is found at: www.grad.washington.edu/stsv/ mastapp.htm. Students who cannot complete the master's request online or need to make changes should contact Graduate School Student Services at studentservices@ grad. washington.edu. Students must complete the entire request, including the Exit Questionnaire. Students will not be able to return to the Request page to make changes or complete information at a later time. Status updates on the degree request will be sent via e-mail; therefore, an e-mail address is required before completing the application. The request period commences Monday, the third week of each quarter and closes the Friday of the second week of the subsequent quarter (the quarter a student intends to graduate). For example, if the student will complete graduation requirements in Winter Quarter, the earliest a request can be submitted is the third week of Autumn Quarter and the latest is the Friday of the second week of Winter Quarter. If the student does not receive his or her degree in the requested quarter, the student must complete another degree request for the quarter in which she or he expects to complete requirements. Students must determine that they will have met the minimum Graduate School requirements by the end of the quarter in which they plan to graduate. Please consult a graduate program adviser regarding additional program requirements. A student must be registered as a graduate student and complete a minimum of two credits during the quarter in which degree requirements are met and the degree is conferred.Commencement Formal commencement exercises are conducted at the close of Spring Quarter. In April of each year, commencement information is sent to each student entitled to participate (i.e., those who graduated the previous August, December or March and those who anticipate graduating in the June or August of the current year). Diploma distribution Diplomas are produced approximately 12 weeks after the end of the quarter in which they are earned and are mailed to the student.109 OVERVIEW Master of Business AdministrationThe Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) degree is designed for working professionals who want to enhance their abilities to respond to, manage and lead change. The 72-credit program emphasizes the organization as a system and builds an understanding of how each organizational component affects and interacts with others. The primary goal of the M.B.A. program is to provide current and future managers with the knowledge necessary to succeed in an increasingly dynamic and complex 21st-century environment. By design, the program integrates leadership, technological, analytical, interpersonal and communication skills. Students will learn to: Analyze organizations as complex systems; Diagnose organizational problems and design solutions; Implement change effectively; Support people and build teams; Scan the global business environment and identify important trends; Make strategic decisions under conditions of risk and uncertainty; Choose technologies that support productivity; Allocate organizational resources strategically; Consider the social, political, ethical and environmental consequences of management decisions. The program's emphasis on change prepares students to predict organizational changes and to design, implement and evaluate change processes. Students complete a two-quarter culminating project in which they analyze changes that will affect an organization and design a strategic plan to manage the impact of those changes.

Program Design The 72 quarter-credit, non-thesis M.B.A. degree has three components: 32 credits of core courses 16 credits of change courses 24 credits of elective courses tailored to meet individual needs Beyond the core and change focus, students are required to complete 24 elective credits. The choice of electives will depend on students' career and educational goals. Students can create a profile of elective courses that allows them to gain additional knowledge of information technology, nance, leadership or marketing. Elective courses also can be taken outside of Business from other UWT graduate programs. Enrollment and Classes As a part-time program, the UWT M.B.A. allows students to continue in their careers while they develop new managerial knowledge and skills. The program is designed to be completed in three academic years (nine quarters of study). In the average quarter, an M.B.A. student will enroll in two courses (8 credits) of study. Classes meet primarily on Saturdays or weekday evenings and incorporate Internet components. Online assignments and discussion offer flexibility while keeping students connected to the faculty and their classmates. Courses integrate current conceptual and practical knowledge while building analytical and interpersonal skills. As a result, the curriculum is immediately relevant to practicing managers.Elective Credits A minimum of 12 graded elective credits must be completed in Tacoma M.B.A. elective courses numbered 500 and above. The remaining 12 elective credits can be completed via Tacoma M.B.A. elective courses, credits from other UW graduate degree programs, transfer credits, or some combination of these as discussed in the policies below. No more than eight credits of TBUS 569, Analytical Research, may be applied toward the M.B.A. degree. Transfer Credits from Other Institutions An admitted M.B.A. student may petition to transfer up to the equivalent of 12 quarter credits of graduate business coursework from an accredited institution toward the elective portion of the degree. Graduate credits that have been applied toward a completed degree cannot be transferred. Applicants may petition by sending a letter to the Graduate Program Adviser. The petition should identify the courses requested for transfer credit and, for each course, clearly articulate how the course content contributes to the objectives of the UWT M.B.A. curriculum. Petition requests will not be evaluated until an ofcial transcript is received by the School of Business. Written petitions for transfer credits completed prior to admission to the M.B.A. program must be submitted during the rst quarter of enrollment in the M.B.A. program (Autumn quarter). Enrolled UWT M.B.A. students who take courses at another institution with the intent of transferring the credits should rst seek approval from the Graduate Program Coordinator. If approved, these students should submit a written petition to transfer credits within one academic quarter of completing the course at another institution (e.g. petitions to transfer summer credits must be received by the end of Autumn Quarter). Coursework that duplicates the content of required courses in the M.B.A. curriculum will not be accepted for transfer elective credit. Petitions are reviewed by the Graduate Committee and a letter is mailed to the address of record indicating how many credits, if any, will transfer. Students who transfer graduate credits from another university may be restricted in the elective courses they may take to complete their elective. Details of such restrictions will be included in the reply letter to the petitioning student. All decisions of the Graduate Committee with respect to transfer credits are nal.UW Credits Earned Outside the Tacoma M.B.A. A portion of M.B.A. elective credits may be earned at the University of Washington in other degree programs.

Those with master's degrees in computer science earn 25 to 30 percent higher starting salaries than those with bachelor's degrees, according to a report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The master's program serves a diverse population of students, from those with signicant experience and degrees in the eld, to those with non-computing-related undergraduate degrees. By broadening the base of students eligible for the program, the Institute hopes to encourage greater numbers of undergraduate students to continue their education at the graduate level and to attract increasing numbers of nontraditional students who have related work and life experience and a strong interest in the eld.Curriculum The master of science in Computing and Software Systems provides a broad overview of the technologies and theories supporting computing and software systems with a focus on distributed and networked computing. The master's program requires more intensive work in the theoretical concepts of computer science than does the bachelor's program in CSS. In addition, it requires that a student demonstrate the ability to synthesize and apply those concepts outside the classroom. These goals are achieved in three stages: Foundational courses to emphasize theoretical (conceptual) as well as practical (embodied) knowledge. Theory courses that refine critical thinking skills and breadth of knowledge. Thesis, significant capstone design project or internship to strengthen confidence, leadership ability and communication skills.

Stein Professor, Education; Special Education/Learning Disabilities; Ph.D., University of Washington, of Interdisciplinary StudiesWhat are Interdisciplinary Studies? The concept of interdisciplinary studies is founded on a recognition that the experience of phenomena\u2014such as the public problems of poverty, violence, social justice or environmental degradation\u2014do not come in neatly bounded, disciplinary or professional packages. While disciplinary divisions of labor are convenient and necessary to the efficient pursuit of in- depth knowledge, the application of that knowledge in the sphere of public action requires its broader re-integration with the rich, multidisciplinary dimensions and complexities of actual, live situations. The structure of the Master of Arts program is highly flexible, building on the wealth of interdisciplinary expertise among members of the faculty. A required series of four core courses and a capstone course addresses issues of models, problem formation, evidence, and values. The core courses examine the basic foundations of knowing and acting, making them relevant to diverse areas of specic inquiry. Through electives and a thesis (or master's project), students are encouraged to apply the lessons of the core courses to their own chosen areas of interdisciplinary interest. A broad range of student interests can be accommodated due to the interdisciplinary nature of the program. The program integrates the sociology of knowledge, philosophy, social and political theory, history, cultural studies, anthropology and systems theory to shed light on domains of public action. Examples of possible areas of interest, broadly dened, might include the environment, education, ethnicity, gender, families, arts policy and administration, children and the media, human rights, labor, immigration, trade, development, urban studies, the role of state and local government, nonprofit organizations, or international non- governmental organizations. Students will learn: How alternative paradigms or models condition our knowledge of the world and how our choice of potential responses connects to how we perceive things to be organized. How to gain insight into the impact of culture and history on the way certain phenomena come to be dened in the public arena as problems, and how they are variously imagined to be caused or solved in relation to diverse professional and disciplinary claims of ownership over them. How evidence can be justified, generated, evaluated and used with varying degrees of validity within diverse frames of application. Phone: (253) 692-4450 Fax: www.tacoma. washington.edu/iasBuilding on the success of the under - graduate program, Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences offers a Master of Arts degree. The graduate courses offer opportunities to pursue questions of interest across a wide range of elds, spanning the humanities, social sciences and environmental sciences, with special emphasis on the relation of knowledge to public action.Director: William Richardson Associate Director: Cynthia DuncanFaculty Coordinator: Samuel ParkerAdministrator: Julie BufngtonGraduate Program Adviser: Linda Kachinsky How to gain insight into the ways in which values are implicitly or explicitly present in every arena socially deemed to be problematic, and how it may be possible to facilitate communication, negotiations, or trade-offs among and across diverse value frames. What is Public Action? Public action entails a series of determinations that are reached as a result of the following considerations: What is the nature of the problem to be addressed? What mode of analysis is to be employed? What will count as evidence? What values are considered relevant or irrelevant? What options are included or excluded? What outcomes of the action are anticipated or unanticipated?MASTER OF ARTS Interdisciplinary Studies126 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2004-2005 CatalogBy exploring these questions the master's program becomes a sustained investigation of factors that critically shape actions, procedures and outcomes. The factors to be investigated include: Conceptual models, or paradigms Social, professional and institutional cultures Various types of data used to support alternative perspectives and decisions How various value frameworks shape perspectives, decisions and actions These factors provide a foundation for knowledge and action in the public sphere. The core course of study in this program may therefore apply to virtually any profession or endeavor in our shared public life, whether one works in a large organization or a one-person shop, whether one seeks knowledge for utilitarian ends or to achieve a richer understanding of the world in which everyone must live and act. Program Design The Master of Arts program emphasizes foundations of public action and is a 55- credit master's degree. The curriculum includes: Four core courses .............. 24 credits Capstone course ................ 6 credits Electives ............................ 15 credits Final project or thesis ....... 10 credits Core Courses The four core courses are closely integrated, constituting a single, extended investigation of how issues and problems are evaluated in the process of taking action. The courses examine analytical tools and how social and organizational cultures influence the work required in moving toward taking action. Models and Critical Inquiry Evidence and Action Culture and Public Problems Values and Action Capstone Course Students enroll in the capstone course after the completion of the core course series. The capstone provides a forum for re-integrating the separate themes of the four core courses and considering how they can be applied to the students' areas of interest. Area of Emphasis Students will work with a faculty adviser to develop a focus within the student's chosen area of interest. The required 15 credits of electives are to be chosen carefully in consultation with the academic adviser, as stepping stones toward the substance of the thesis or project. In addition to elective courses developed specically for the Master of Arts degree, students can select from a wide range of courses offered at UWT, including some of those offered in other UWT graduate programs. Undergraduate courses appropriate to the student's thesis topic can be taken as graduate courses by enrolling in them as TIBCG 590, Independent Study courses. This option requires completion of all the undergraduate requirements, as well as additional work to be negotiated with the instructor that will raise the course demands to graduate level. Thesis or Project The nal product of the graduate program must be a thesis or a scholarly project that demonstrates a level of competence equivalent to a thesis. In consultation with faculty, students negotiate specific thesis questions and plans focused on their own chosen goals and areas of interest. It is the student's responsibility to recruit a thesis chair and at least one other reader to constitute a thesis committee. The chair may be the academic adviser or may be someone else whose area of expertise most overlaps with the focus of the thesis or project. Enrollment and Curriculum Sequencing Admission is competitive and is based on space availability in the core courses. Core courses are offered in the evenings, alternating between Monday/Wednesday and Tuesday/Thursday.

The core courses for all options include research, health systems, health policy, and diversity and social issues related to health. Two quarters of fieldwork provide students with an opportunity to participate in advanced practice roles in the setting of their choice. All students engage in scholarly inquiry, completing a project or thesis. In addition, students take four courses in their curriculum option, and may choose from courses in the other curriculum options including courses at the UW Seattle campus or in education, health, business, social work or arts and sciences to fulll the requirement of six credits of related coursework. The program is designed for both part- time and full-time students. The length of time required to complete the program varies from ve quarters on a full-time basis to seven or eight quarters on a part-time basis. While it is possible to enroll during any quarter, beginning in the Autumn Quarter is best for course sequencing. Communities, Populations and Health Communities, Populations and Health aims to improve the health of populations such as patients with a common diagnosis or chronic illness, children in schools, adults, a neighborhood, or the community. Students in this curriculum option span the traditional boundaries of health care settings such as hospitals, clinics, governmental agencies, schools, and community organizations by working in partnerships. Students build on their clinical expertise with a population or community of interest and gain competencies in the design, implementation and evaluation of interventions and programs based on assessed community or population needs and capacities. The curriculum prepares graduates to collaborate with health care and other professionals and members of the community to address the health needs of a diverse society through health promotion and protection, community organization and change.
