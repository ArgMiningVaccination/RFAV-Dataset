A U.S. District Court judge has approved a settlement between StemGenex and 1,063 patients who were plaintiffs in a [class-action lawsuit](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21403439/stemgenex-cmplt.pdf) against the La Jolla, California, stem cell clinic. The plaintiffs alleged: - They were misled by the clinic's claims that its treatment was effective against numerous medical conditions, including the autoimmune disease lupus, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. - The clinic's claim of \"100% consumer satisfaction\" was misleading even though a small disclosure statement revealed that the figure was based on patient exit interviews conducted before the results of their treatment could be known. - None of the plaintiffs \"received any significant benefit\" from the treatment. The treatment involved removing fat from the clients by liposuction, purportedly treating it to concentrate stem cells from the tissue, and then injecting the cells back into the patients. StemGenex's insurance carrier will pay $1.15 million of the settlement money and an insurance carrier for Andre Lallande, an osteopath who served as the firm's chief medical officer, will pay $2.5 million. Although StemGenex charged $14,900 per treatment, each patient in the class will receive only $1,936 from the settlement fund, with most of the rest going to legal fees and expenses. In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [warned StemGenex](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/stemgenex-biologic-laboratories-llc-557907-10312018) that it was, in effect, marketing an illegal drug.

Clinical Nutrition ESPEN, Jan 12, 2022] The review concluded: Micronutrient supplementations, including vitamins C, D, and zinc, did not reduce mortality in patients with COVID-19. While vitamin C did not reduce intubation rate or length of hospital stay, vitamin D supplementation may be associated with a lower intubation rate and shorter length of hospital stay. However, further research is needed to better understand the clinical significance of these individual micronutrient supplements in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The FTC has charged that during a recent radio show broadcast, Nepute said he got sued by the government, then said: \"Here here here's a big old up your nose with a rubber hose, federal government. Have a listen to this. Brand-new study confirms that Vitamin D significantly, significantly reduces the risk of dying from COVID-19.\" The FTC wants a judge to order him to take down any radio show recordings containing his false claims and pay $500 for every day that they remain up.

St. Louis Post Dispatch, March 7, 2022] Naturopathy regulator ordered to reconsider complaint about vitamin IVs given to a mentally ill man. The Health Professions Review Board (HPRB) in British Columbia has [ordered](https://cdn.centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2022/03/14123341/hprb_order_2021.pdf) the College of Naturopathic Physicians of British Columbia to reconsider a complaint it dismissed against a naturopath who gave intravenous vitamin infusions to a mentally ill man. The treatments were administered while the patient was out on day passes during a period of involuntary commitment. The patient died from a pulmonary embolism caused by a blood clot in 2019, five months after his last infusion. The HPRB said that it was unreasonable to conclude that the treatment was safe or that the naturopath had acted appropriately. Among other things, the HPRB noted that the college's inquiry committee didn't speak to the patient's psychiatrist, who had called the naturopath and asked her to stop the infusions. A CBS News report noted that such infusions have no proven value, yet British Columbia naturopaths widely advertise them for curing hangovers, boosting the immune system, and improving energy, sleep, and circulation. The infusions generally cost between $100 and $300 each. [Lindsay B.

The Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, have sued Brooklyn-based B4B Earth Tea LLC, B4B Corp., and their owner and operator, Andrew Martin (\"Busta\") Sinclair. The suit seeks to: (a) permanently block deceptive ads that claim Earth Tea is clinically proven to treat, cure, and prevent COVID-19; and (b) impose civil penalties on the defendants under the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act. The [joint agency complaint](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/us_v._b4b_earth_tea_complaint_22cv1159.pdf) was filed in the U.S. District Court for Eastern District of New York. The complaint charged that since at least April 2020, Sinclair and his companies misrepresented, on their websites and in social media, that Earth Tea prevents or treats COVID-19. The unsupported claims included: - \"Earth Tea works!! The all natural instant immune booster clinical trials proves its [sic] effective against COVID19.\" - \"Our Clinical Trial was successful. So successful we are offering a Money Back Guarantee against COVID-19 if 2 bottles do not get you negative you will get your money back.\" - \"Vaccines trial shows preventing hospitalization is 85%-96% while so far Earth Tea Extra Strength is 100% we have helped people who are vaccinated.\" - \"No one who was positive and used Earth Tea went to the hospital.\" - Earth Tea is clinically proven to cure COVID-19 in 48 hours. In at least one tweet, the defendants claimed the cure would take only 24 hours. The complaint also noted that the \"clinical trial\" cited by the defendants had only 15 participants, had no control group, was not published in a recognized journal, and did not rise to the level of \"competent and reliable scientific evidence.\" The tea sold for $60 per 16-ounce bottle.

FTC press release, March 3, 2022] Another vaccine opponent dies of COVID-19. Bruce West (1947-2021), a chiropractor who published Health Alert newsletter, died of COVID-19 in October. His newsletter was filled with sensational claims that nutritional products made by Standard Process Laboratories are effective against a wide range of diseases. He also sold the products and advertised himself as \"Dr. Bruce West\" without mentioning that he was a chiropractor. In private correspondence, he referred to himself as a \"clinical biochemist\" and said he \"subspecialized\" in biochemistry and received a \"Ph.D.\" with his D.C. degree when he graduated from the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic. Several websites that reported his death said he was not vaccinated against COVID-19. In June 2021, the California Attorney General filed a civil suit charging West and Health Alert Immune Systems, Inc. with marketing dietary supplements with illegal claims that they are effective in preventing or curing many serious diseases. The suit will proceed against his estate and Health Alert. [Quackwatch has a detailed article](https://quackwatch.org/11ind/lee/) that describes the marketing and regulatory history of Standard Process. Unsubstantiated collagen supplementation claims spotlighted. Collagen, a component of skin, hair, nails, joints, bones, tendons, and cartilage, is marketed by major retailers as a dietary supplement product for health and beauty. Noting that there are over 8.5 million posts with the hashtag \"collagen\" on Instagram alone and Google searches for collagen supplements have increased rapidly since 2015, researchers: (a) watched and analyzed the first 100 YouTube videos resulting from a search of \"collagen,\" (b) analyzed the top 50 Instagram photographs with the hashtag \"collagen,\" (c) reviewed the scientific literature regarding skin, nail, and hair effects of collagen, and (d) reviewed websites of popular collagen brands for claims related to skin, nail, and hair. [Rustad AM. [Myths and media in oral collagen supplementation for the skin, nails, and hair: A review](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jocd.14567). Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, 21:438-443, 2022] Their findings included: - Over 75% of YouTube videos and Instagram posts recommended collagen supplementation with most claiming it's beneficial for skin. - Financial bias was common (two-thirds of the YouTube videos and most Instagram posts) and associated with recommending collagen supplementation and claiming benefits. - Most YouTube videos and almost all Instagram posts were uploaded by people without healthcare or medical expertise. - A variety of collagen supplementation benefits appear on marketers' websites. - Systematic reviews have noted evidence from small randomized controlled trials of skin benefits from taking some forms of collagen. - No reports of clinical trials on the effect of collagen supplementation on hair have been published. - One study lacking a control group found nail growth after collagen supplementation. - Dermatologic claims in the media go beyond what the literature supports. - The main downside of collagen supplementation is that daily use can be costly. The researchers concluded: Collagen supplementation is a promising area of research, yet dermatologic claims in the media surpass any evidence currently proven in the literature. More research, especially larger trials with standardized dosage and formulation, is needed to establish stronger knowledge of the effects and physiologic mechanism of collagen supplementation. Dermatology providers should be aware of the excessive proclamations of collagen's effects being made by companies and in social media, as patients are likely to ask about or try collagen supplementation. There is a considerable opportunity for dermatologists to increase their presence on social media to help educate the public properly about skin health and supplements such as collagen to combat misinformation and exaggerated promises.

These devices, which are fancy galvanometers, merely measure skin resistance to the passage of electrical current. However, many are claimed to determine the cause of any disease by detecting the \"energy imbalance\" causing the problem. Some are also claimed to detect whether someone is allergic or sensitive to foods, deficient in vitamins, or has defective teeth. Some operators claim to tell whether a disease, such as cancer or AIDS, is not present.

Thousands of practitioners use \"electrodiagnostic\" devices to help select their recommended treatment. These devices, which are fancy galvanometers, merely measure skin resistance to the passage of electrical current. However, many are claimed to determine the cause of any disease by detecting the \"energy imbalance\" causing the problem. Some are also claimed to detect whether someone is allergic or sensitive to foods, deficient in vitamins, or has defective teeth. Some operators claim to tell whether a disease, such as cancer or AIDS, is not present. The diagnostic procedure is most commonly referred to as Electroacupuncture according to Voll (EAV) or electrodermal screening (EDS). This article summarizes the EAV-related regulatory actions that have come to my attention. Galvanic skin resistance has no proven or logical relationship to the diagnosis or treatment of any disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration classifies \"devices that use resistance measurements to diagnose and treat various diseases\" as Class III devices, which require FDA approval prior to marketing. No such device can be legally marketed in the United States for diagnostic or treatment purposes. A few companies have obtained 510(k) clearance (not approval) by telling the FDA that their devices will be used for biofeedback or to measure skin resistance, but this does not entitle them to market the devices for other purposes. EAV devices are not biofeedback devices. Biofeedback is a relaxation technique that uses an electronic device that continuously signals pulse rate, muscle tension, or other body function by tone or visual signal. In biofeedback, the signal originates and is influenced by the patient. In EAV, the signal is influenced by how hard the operator presses the probe against the patient's skin. (Pressure makes the electric current flow more easily between the device and the skin.) The FDA has banned importation of EAV devices into the United States and warned or prosecuted a few marketers. Foreign and state regulatory agencies have also taken a few actions. However, no systematic effort has been made to drive them from the marketplace. As a result, these bogus devices are being used by many chiropractors, acupuncturists, dentists, \"holistic\" physicians, veterinarians, self-styled \"nutritionists,\" and various unlicensed individuals. The most common use is for prescribing homeopathic products. They are also used to determine \"allergies,\" detect \"nutrient deficiencies,\" and locate alleged problems in teeth that contain amalgam fillings. FDA Actions - In 1985, the FDA notified a distributor that Vegatest devices could not be marketed as a medical devices without FDA approval (which they do not have) [1]. - In 1986, the FDA notified Consolidated Research and Technologies, doing business as Esion Corporation, of serious violations in its marketing of the Accupath 1000 and Vi-Tel 618. In 1987, it noted that sale of the Accupath 1000 had been discontinued, but the Vi-Tel 618 was still being improperly marketed as was the company's [Interro](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/electro.html)device. In 1988, the FDA inspected the company again and found that the violations had not been corrected [2]. - In 2000, the FDA ordered Phazx Systems to stop making illegal claims for its BodyScan 2010 and VLD-100 devices [3]. - In 2001, the FDA warned Vega Grieshaber KG and an American distributor (BioEclectic Research, of Santa Rosa, California) that the Vega devices and several others were unapproved medical devices that could not be legally marketed in the United States [4,5] - In 2011, the FDA ordered Galloway Technologies to stop representing that its Asyra software interface allowed practitoners to evaluate their patient's parameters of health using information gathered through the device's hardware system [6]. - In 2015, the FDA ordered ONDAMED, Inc., to stop making claims that Ondamed devices are useful in treating diseases. The warning letter also noted that it is improper to market the Ondamed system as a biofeedback device: The Ondamed System does not fall within the classification regulation for a biofeedback device under 21 CFR 882.5050. As defined by 21 CFR 882.5050, \"[a] biofeedback device is an instrument that provides a visual or auditory signal corresponding to the status of one or more of a patient's physiological parameters (e.g., brain alpha wave activity, muscle activity, skin temperature, etc.) so that the patient can control voluntarily these physiological parameters.\" The Ondamed System lacks the monitoring functionality that is essential for biofeedback devices; it does not have any design features or capabilities that allow the device to measure, record, or monitor a patient's physiological parameters so that the patient can control voluntarily these physiological parameters [7]. - In 2015, the FDA ordered ZYTO Technologies of Lindon, Utah, to stop claiming that its ZYTO devices are useful for diagnosis or for measuring the body's \"preferences\" for nutritional products [8]. In 2016, presumably as a result of FDA pressure, ZYTO announced \"a voluntary recall of the ZYTO Tower and ZYTO Select and Elite software due to claims exceeding the 510(k) clearance.\" [9.10] State Attorney General Civil Actions - In 1991, the Illinois auditor general concluded that the state's Department of Children and Family Services was improperly paying for services by Ina J. Organ, an unlicensed \"natural health counselor\" who prescribed herbal and homeopathic products for hyperactive children. Organ's \"credential\" was obtained at a one-day session at the School of Natural Health in Utah, which trained distributors of products marketed by Nature's Sunshine, Inc., a multilevel marketing company. Organ's\" diagnostic\" methods included use of iridology, an Interro device, and a questionnaire that supposedly enabled her to spot Candida (yeast) infections. In 1993, Organ signed a consent judgment ordering her to pay a $1,000 penalty, offer restitution to former clients, and refrain from (a) using an Interro device), (b) providing iridology, (c) making false representations that herbal or homeopathic products strengthen the immune system, (d) using a \"Candida Albicans Questionnaire\" or related materials, (e) using any other questionnaire purported to help diagnose or treat any human ailment, and (f) representing that hyperactivity is caused by food allergies or can be cured or mitigated by homeopathic or herbal products. She was also ordered to refrain from diagnosing or treating any human ailment without a valid license to do so [11]. - In 2002, the Oregon Attorney General settled a lawsuit against Monte Kline, Shirley Hancuff, and Pacific Health Center (PHC), under which the defendants agreed not to misrepresent that EDT can diagnose food allergies, \"weak organs,\" certain viruses, lead levels in children, and various other health problems. The stipulated judgment also called for the defendants to pay $15,000 for costs and to offer refunds available to individuals whom they had tested during the previous three years [12]. State authorities in Washington subsequently charged Kline and PHC with (a) violating the state's consumer protection act by misrepresenting the significance of his credentials and the diagnostic capabilities of EDT and (b) practicing medicine, naturopathy, and acupuncture without a license. The courts ultimately ruled that Kline had violated the licensing laws but not the Consumer Protection Act. Kline announced that he would close his Washington clinic because the \"unlicensed practice\" ruling barred him from doing EDT, but he still operates two centers in Oregon and one in Idaho [13]. - In 2006, the Washington Department of Health ordered Joyce M. Tasker of Coleville, Washington, to stop practicing medicine and veterinary medicine without a license. A motion for summary judgment stated that Tasker, who was not a licensed health-care provider, had been using EDT to diagnose a wide variety of problems in humans and animals. (In a deposition, Tasker stated that she had begun with an Orion device and later \"upgraded\" to an Asyra device.) Tasker appealed to her local trial court and then to the Court of Appeals, both of which upheld the Health Department's decision [14]. Criminal Prosecutions [During 1990, FDA agents twice raided the Century Clinic, of Reno, Nevada (now called the Century Wellness Center) and seized Dermatron devices and the medical records of 71 patients [15]. The case was settled in 1993 with a consent agreement under which the clinic and its director, Katrina C. Tang, were prohibited from using EAV devices without either FDA approval or under an approved application for an investigational device exemption that would permit legitimate experimental use. The agreement also provided for a $200,000 penalty for violation of the consent decree. After the agreement was signed, Biosource, which was not a party to it, obtained an Investigational Device Exemption by falsely claiming that its Listen System devices would be used experimentally to see whether they could detect diabetes. According to court documents filed by the U.S. Justice Department, Tang and the clinic then used two of these devices to diagnose other serious diseases and did not collect the data necessary for the Biosource study. In 1998, a magistrate judge recommended that a $400,000 fine be imposed on Tang and the clinic [16]. A petition to overturn this ruling was denied by two federal courts and the U.S. Supreme Court [17]. In December 2002, Tang signed a stipulated agreement with the Nevada Board of Homeopathic Examiners indicating that she would retire and would not accept new nonemergency patients. The stipulation noted that between December 27, 2001, and February 4, 2002, 18 complaints had been made against her that had not been investigated by the board [18].] - In 1994, Floyd E. Weston, who had been marketing EAV devices and unapproved homeopathic drugs, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count for introducing unapproved medical devices into interstate commerce. The plea agreement required him to agree to a permanent injunction barring him from selling the device or homeopathic remedies. He was sentenced to a year of probation and ordered to pay a $2,500 fine and complete 40 hours of community service. The injunction barred him from directly or indirectly (a) engaging in the sale, lease or distribution of any Prophyle, Biopath, Dermatron, or similar device or any other unapproved medical device, (b) engaging in the sale, advertising, or distribution of any drug not listed in the US Pharmacopeia, the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia or the National Formulary [19]. - In 2000, Rebecca Y. Rogers was arrested on complaints alleging unauthorized practice of medicine involving three clients. Testimony in the case indicated that Rogers, who purported to be a naturopath, used an EAV device to falsely diagnose a woman with breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and a brain aneurysm and falsely diagnose tapeworm in the woman's son (who was sitting on her lap but not connected to the device). She also told another woman who had been medically diagnosed with multiple sclerosis that her problem was bacterial and that she also a gall stone, inflamed appendix, inflamed small intestine, and inflamed large intestine. A lower court ruled that the legal definition of \"practice of medicine\" was overly broad, but in 2001 the Michigan Court of Appeals reinstated the case [20]. I don't know what happened after that. - In 2003, an Australian naturopath who used a MORA device for diagnosis was convicted of manslaughter in connection with the death of an 18-day-old infant whom he had claimed to have cured of a heart defect [21]. - In 2006, John E. Curran, of Exeter, Rhode Island, was sentenced to 12\u00bd years in prison for fraud and money laundering. He was also ordered to pay $1.4 million in restitution to 338 former clients he had victimized. Documents in the case indicate that pretended to be a medical doctor but had no valid health credentials. His \"diagnostic\" tools included \"Biomeridian stress assessment.\" [22,23] - In 2009, Enrique Vela (a/k/a Enrique Vela-Lopez) and his wife, Ute Marquez, were charged with practicing medicine without a license. The couple operated the Alternative Therapy Center out of their home in Winter Haven, Florida. The charges were based on an undercover investigation by two agents of the Polk County Sheriff's Department who were tested with an Asyra device. One was told she had hookworm larvae, bilharziasis, intestinal fluke and enzyme deficiencies in her small intestine, and bacteria and anthrax in her body. The other was diagnosed with problems of the skin, sinus, and reproductive organs [24]. He settled the charges by entering a pre-trial intervention program. Professional Board Actions - In 1986, the California Board of Dental Examiners suspended the license of Ralph A. Landerman, D.D.S. after concluding that he had mistreated two patients. The accusation stated that he used a Dermatron to diagnose \"energy\" problems with many of their teeth that he purported to treat with homeopathic injections followed by extraction of the teeth. The board concluded that removal of the teeth\u201411 from one patient and 3 from the other\u2014was unnecessary, caused the patients to become \"dental cripples,\" and constituted \"gross ignorance and/or inefficiency . . . incompetence and/or gross negligence.\" [25] The case was settled with a stipulated order under which Landerman's dental license was suspended for five months and he was placed on five years' probation during which he was required to (a) take remedial education courses, (b) arrange for monitoring when he resumed practice, and (c) refrain from further ues of the Dermatron device [26]. - In 1990, the New Zealand Medical Journal described how a homeopathic physician had used a Vega device to diagnose allergies in three infants. In each case, the device was applied to the mother with the child on the mother's lap or roaming about the examining room. The doctor also diagnosed \"miasms,\" which, if not removed, would prove fatal later in life.

Speckhart, M.D., of improperly managing the case of 13 patients, most of whom had cancer. The complaint alleged that in 9 of these cases, Speckhart used an EAV device to make improper diagnoses and select homeopathic remedies and other inappropriate substances to treat them [29]. In 1993, the case was settled with a consent order in which Speckhard admitted no wrongdoing but the board concluded that he had improperly diagnosed and/or treated 10 of them, including 6 who had received EAV testing [30]. The board placed Speckhart on indefinite probation with a provision that he could use an EAV device only as a clinical investigator and not for diagnosing or treating of medical condtitions. His probation was terminated in 1998. - In 1993, Lawrence Caprio, a naturopath licensed in Cionnecticut, signed a consent order under which he was prohibited from using an Interro device in his naturopathic practice and was required to hire another naturopath to monitor his practice [31]. - In 1994, the Oregon Medical Board revoked the license of John E. Gambee, M.D., after noting that his use of unscientific practices\u2014including EAV and ozone therapy\u2014justified revocation of his license [32]. (He was permitted to resume practice in 1994 but got into trouble repeatedly and had his license revoked in 2011.) - In 1995, acupuncturist Dennis Roy Tucker was reprimanded for using unlicensed devices and for failing to get informed consent for using a Dermatron device. - In 1995, Leo J. Bolles, M.D., was disciplined by the Washington Stete Medical Quality Assurance Commission for a variety of improper practices, including the use of an Interro device to diagnose allergies [33]. - In 1995, after reviewing her care of 36 patients, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (Canada) concluded that Carolyn Dean, M.D. was unfit to practice and revoked her registration certificate. The questionable practices that concerned the regulators included Vega and Interro testing [34]. [In 1996, the New Jersey Attorney General obtained a consent agreement in which William Holder, M.D., was ordered to (a) properly code insurance claim forms; (b) obtain informed consent when using unconventional methods; (c) stop using an \"Acuscope,\" device; (d) stop selling dietary supplements, homeopathic remedies, and herbal products; and (e) pay $5,319.92 to cover the cost of the state medical board's investigation of him [35].] - In 1996, a hearing officer concluded that Dr. Richard Plagenhoef had provided substandard care to a patient and recommended that his license be suspended until he can demonstrate to the licensing board that he can practice medicine with skill and safety. The hearing officer's report said that Plagenhoef had (a) diagnosed chemical toxicity based on no medical tests or physical examination, (b) used a worthless device (an Interro) to confirm that \"diagnosis,\" and (c) improperly treated the patient with \"detox drops.\" The board adopted the hearing officer's recommendations. The Florida Department of Health's Web site states that Plagenhoef's license was revoked in 1997 but does not indicate why [36]. - In 1998, the Missouri licensing board charged a chiropractor (Gary Edwards) with falsely telling a patient his HIV (AIDS virus) infection had been cured, leading to infection of the man's wife and daughter with the virus. According to reports in the Kansas City Star, the patient, who had hemophilia, consulted Edwards after learning that he was infected with the virus. According to the board's complaint, Edwards said that he could treat the disease with help from an Interro device and prescribed various supplements and herbs. Six months later, he allegedly said that the virus had been eradicated, and the patient and his wife decided to have a child. The child was born in 1992. The patient died a few months later of complications triggered by AIDS, and tests subsequently showed that both mother and daughter were infected [37]. In February 2000, a Missouri judge agreed that the chiropractic board could discipline Edwards for \"fraud deception and misrepresentation.\" [38] In May, the board suspended him for two years followed by five years of probation [39]. In April 2002, the Missouri Court of Appeals ruled that the Board's fact-finding body erred by not allowing Edwards to have access to certain evidence [40]. The board subsequently withdrew its complaint. [Edwards sued the board members and an investigator for malicious prosecution](http://www.courts.mo.gov/courts/pubopinions.nsf/ccd96539c3fb13ce8625661f004bc7da/cd6eb5efc191612f8625724c0061d1a6?OpenDocument)[41], but the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed the decison and permitted the case to continue to trial and the jury awarded $6.2 million to Edwards [42]. - In 1998, the Discipline Committee of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (Canada) found Jozef Krop, a Canadian physician, guilty of professional misconduct in that he failed to maintain the standard of practice in the care of six patients whose cases the committee had reviewed. The misconduct included use of a Vegatest device to \"screen\" and/or to determine how to treat the patients. Krop appealed the decision, but the divisional court ruled against him and his petition to appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was denied in 2003 [43]. - In 1998, the Nevada Medical Board entered into a stipulation for settlement with Donald Soli, M.D., under which he was reprimanded, placed on probation for five years, and barred from using a Dermatron or any similar machine [44]. - In 1998, an Australian dentist received a 6-month suspension for performing jaw surgery based on readings of a Dermatron device [45]. - In 1999, the California reprimanded Paul Lynn, M.D,, for failing to follow California's regulations for properly informing a patient that an Interro device was \"investigational.\" [46] - In 2001, the Connecticut Department of Health placed Mark Breiner, D.D.S. on probation for five years, during which he was required to disclose that there was \"insufficient scientific evidence to support the use of\" electrodermal testing. However, the Department's action, which primarily concerned his inappropriate removal of amalgam fillings and root-canal-treated teeth, did not require Breiner to stop doing EAV testing [47]. - In 2002, the Florida Board of Chiropractic Medicine accused James B. Adair, D.C., of providing excessive treatment toi two patients who has been in automobile accidents. The treatment included evaluation with a Computronix AcuPro II, an EAV device that the board regarded as an acupuncture device. In 2003, the board concluded that (a) Adair had \"exercised influence over the patients for financial gain in that he used excessive visits and excessive fees not warranted condition of the patients and (2) that it was illegal for him to use the device unless he had a license to practice acupuncture. The board ordered Adair to pay a $1,000 fine plus administrative costs of $6,242 and placed him on probation, during which he was required to have his practice monitored. practice monitored. In 2005, after seeing that Adiair had not obtained the services of a monitor, the board reboked hism license [48]. - In 2003, Anthony G. Roeder, D.D.S., of Paoli, Pennsylvania, permanently surrendered his dental license to settle charges of unprofessional conduct. The settlement agreement indicates that the dental board was concerned with his substandard treatment of two women [49]. One case concerned a woman who suffered severe pain after he unnecessarily removed amalgam fillings in 11 other teeth. At his direction, the woman also underwent EDS. In the other case, he injected homeopathic \"remedies\" into the patient's gums. - In 2003, the Maryland State Board of Physician Quality Assurance revoked the license of Barbara A. Solomon, M.D. for refusing to cooperate with an investigation of her use of a Computron device. In 1998, after a patient complained, the board warned her about failure to adequately disclose the risks involved and said that in six months it would review her practice. When the board subsequently asked to see patient records, Solomon stalled and ultimately filed suit to block the board's request [50]. The court upheld the board's actions [51]. - In 2004, the Washington Department of Health Medical Quality Assurance Commission concluded that Geoffrey S. Ames, M.D., who practices in Richland, Washington, had committed unprofessional conduct by using a LISTEN device to (incorrectly) diagnose a patient as having an \"egg allergy.\" The Commission issued a 5-year license suspension that would be stayed provided that Ames (a) stopped using the device, (b) undergoes quarterly practice reviews, and (c) pays a $5,000 fine [52]. In 2007, the Washington Court of Appeals agreed that use of the device had created an \"unreasonable risk of harm.\" [53] In 2009, the Washington Supreme Court agreed, stating that Ames had \"led patients to believe that LISTEN could diagnose and treat allergies, when in fact it could do neither.\" [54] - In 2005, the Connecticut Department of Health accepted a consent agreement under which Warren M. Levin, M.D., waived his right to a hearing about allegations that, if proven, would have been grounds for disciplinary action. The agreement included routine electrodermal screening in a list of eight diagnostic and treatment methods that were \"outside the standard of care.\" The investigator's report alleged that Levin had engaged in various illegitimate medical practices, falsely told patients he was doing research, and had staff members perform procedures for which they were not properly credentialed and licensed. Levin relocated to Arizona at about that time and let his Connecticut license lapse in August 2004. However, the Department took steps to ensure that if he reapplied for licensure in Connecticut, it could deny the application unless he could demonstrate that his practice would be legal, safe, and effective [55]. - In 2005, the Wisconsin Dentistry Examining Board revoked the license of Richard Vander Heyden, D.D.S., of Green Bay, Wisconsin, for unprofessional conduct related to the use of two EAV devices (Dermatron and Interro). The heart of the Board's decision was that Vander Heyden's diagnostic use of EAV devices and prescription of homeopathic products for non-dental conditions were beyond the legitimate scope of dental practice. In one case the board investigated, Vander Heyden used his Dermatron at various whooping cough; and gallbladder and colon inflammation, most of which he then treated with homeopathic products. Although he claimed to have used the devices for research purposes, he refused to provide the board with any experimental thesis, protocol, data, or patient records [56]. - In 2005, Dorothy Merritt, M.D., who operates chelation clinics in Texas, signed a consent agreement with the Texas Board of Medical Examiners under which she was assessed $3,000 and ordered to retract a misleading promotional statement that the BioMeridian device was \"the medical tool of the millennium.\" [57] - In 2007, the policy committee of the Ohio Dental Board concluded that it was not within the scope of dental practice to use a Biomeridian device to evaluate whether people are deficient in certain vitamins and minerals and to formulate a custom nutritional supplement [58]. - In 2010, the Connecticut Board of Health charged Jarir Nakouzi, M.D. with deviating from the standard of care in caring for a late-stage cancer patient [59]. The treatment centered around the use of a bioresonance device for diagnosis and treatment. Newsweek has published a vivid account of what happened [60]. The case was settled in 2011 with a consent order under which Nakouzi agreed to (a) pay $5,000, (b) stop using devices that measure skin resistance for diagnostic or treatment purposes, (c) stop making unsubstantiated claims that refrain from recommending, prescribing, or administering any alleged cancer treatment that lacks FDA approval or scientific support, and (d) serve probation for two years, during which at least 20 of his patient charts should be subject to random review by a supervisor acceptable to the Connecticut Department of Health [61]. - In 2011, the Florida Board of Massage Therapy revoked the license of Enrique-Vela-Lopez, LMT (mentioned above) for practicing beyond the scope of massage therapy by using an Asyra device. He was also fined $1,500 and assessed $3,900 for costs [62]. - In 2015, in response to a complaint from me, the Texas Medical Board concluded that the Web site of Pieter J. De Wet, M.D. contained improper statements about the ZYTO device, \"laser energetic detoxification\" with an Asyra device, and ozone therapy. When notified of a possible violation, De Wet removed the statements at issue plus others that his attorney advised might concern the board in the future. He then signed an agreed order under which he was reprimanded, fined $3,000, and required to take continuing education courses in risk management and ethics [63]. - In 2015, chiropractors Richard F. Bronson [64], Michael Bean [65], and Eric J. Olsen [66] each signed a consent agreement with the Arizona State Board of Chiropractic Examiners under which they were placed on probation for six months, and ordered to pay a $250 civil penalty and to \"cease and desist the use of ZYTO bioscan technology.\" The agreements stated that Zyto bio-scan technogy was \"inappropriate as a diagnstic tool because it lacked scientific validity and is not accepted within the chiropractic community.\" - In 2016, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation suspended the chiropractic license of Michel Y. Roy, D.C., who had advertised on his web site that he used the Vega Test to measure \"electromagnetic fluctuations\" in a patient's body to \"intestinal flora imbalance.\" The disciplinary order noted that the device was neither a diagnostic nor a screening tool and lacked FDA approval [67]. - Three chiropractic boards have considered whether EAV devices are \"within the scope of chiropractic.\" The [Oregon Board](http://regs.cqstatetrack.com/info/get_text?action_id=523935&text_id=134435&type=full_text)has said no, but the [Arkansas Board](http://www.state.ar.us/asbce/archives_/minutes_/2015/2015 04-09 Board Meeting Minutes Final.pdf)has said that the ZYTO can be used as a \"nutritional analysis tool.\" The [Wisconsin Board](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/chir/4.pdf)has prohibited the 1000, Vi-Tel, \"substantially similar counterparts of any othese devices. FTC Action In 2020, the Federal Trade Commission ordered Jennifer Trejo to stop advertising on social media that patients could prevent or treat COVID-019 by purchasing Zyto hand cradles and supplements from her Abundant Life Wellness Center (ALWC). The letter noted that on March 13, ALWC's Facebook page had stated: We have good news at Abundant Life Wellness Center. Zyto, our biofeedback software system, has made the option available for us to scan individuals for a customized homeopathic dilution for the Coronavirus. We can then imprint the homeopathic dilution into an antiviral remedy for you to take daily. This means that if you are exposed to the virus and you are taking your customized homeopathic dilution, you could present with less or no symptoms than if you were not taking it. While this virus is non-life threatening to most people, you will generally feel like you have the flu for several days to 2 weeks [68]. ALCW removed this statement, but its website continues to claim that the ZYTO has other valuable uses. That is absolutely false, but the FTC doesn't seem to care. Foreign Regulatory Agency Actions - In 1999, the British Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) reviewed a pamphlet which alleged that a Bio Resonance Therapy device could help people suffering from headaches, overweight, tiredness, bloating, irritable bowel syndrome, skin rashes, arthritis, and premenstrual tension.

The alleged force, said to support life, is known as ki in Japan, as chi or qi in China, and as prana in India. Reiki practitioners claim to facilitate healing by strengthening or \"balancing\" it [1]. In a traditional reiki session, the client lies down or sits fully clothed.

Reiki is one of several nonsensical methods commonly referred to as \"energy healing.\" These methods are based on the idea that the body is surrounded or permeated by an energy field that is not measurable by ordinary scientific instrumentation. The alleged force, said to support life, is known as ki in Japan, as chi or qi in China, and as prana in India. Reiki practitioners claim to facilitate healing by strengthening or \"balancing\" it [1]. In a traditional reiki session, the client lies down or sits fully clothed. The practitioner's hands are placed lightly on or just above the client's body, palms down, using a series of 12-15 positions. Each position is held for about 2 to 5 minutes, or until the practitioner feels that the flow of energy\u2014said to be experienced as sensations such as heat or tingling in the hands\u2014has slowed or stopped. Typically, the practitioner delivers at least four sessions of 30 to 90 minutes each. The techniques include \"centering,\" \"clearing,\" \"beaming,\" \"extracting harmful energies,\" \"infusing,\" and \"smoothing and raking the aura,\" all of which are claimed to influence the imaginary \"energy\" that Reiki advocates postulate. Reiki can also be self-administered or administered to others at distant locations. Some practitioners say that \"spirit guides\" help them produce the proper flow of energy. Background History The word \"reiki\" is derived from two Japanese words: rei (universal) and ki (life energy). Current reiki practice can be traced to the spiritual teachings of Mikao Usui in Japan during the early 20th century. Usui's teachings included meditative techniques and healing practices. One of his students, Chujiro Hayashi, further developed the healing practices, placing less emphasis on the meditative techniques. An American named Hawayo Takata learned reiki from Hayashi in Japan and introduced it to Western cultures in the late 1930s [1]. During a 2007t national survey, about 0.5% of participants said that they had used an \"energy healing\" therapy during the previous year [2]. In 2009, the Web site of the International Centre for Reiki Training (Kent, England) stated: Reiki is both powerful and gentle. In its long history of use it has aided in healing virtually every known illness and injury including serious problems like: multiple sclerosis, heart disease, and cancer as well as skin problems, cuts, bruises, broken bones, headache, colds, flu, sore throat, sunburn, fatigue, insomnia, impotence, poor memory, lack of confidence, etc. It is always beneficial and works to improve the effectiveness of all other types of therapy. A treatment feels like a wonderful glowing radiance and has many benefits for both client and practitioner, including altered states of consciousness and spiritual experiences. . . . Reiki will improve the results of all medical treatment, acting to reduce negative side effects, shorten healing time, reduce or eliminate pain, reduce stress, and help create optimism [3]. Training No special background or credentials are needed to receive reiki training. To become a practitioner, one must receive an \"initiation\" or \"attunement\" from a Reiki Master. This ceremony makes one \"attuned\" to the \"universal life energy\" and enables one to serve as a conduit for it. There are said to be three different levels of attunement (some teach that there are four). At the higher levels, one can allegedly channel reiki energy and effect healings at a distance, without physical contact. Training for the lower levels typically takes 1 or 2 days and begins with an attunement. Training to become a Master is said to take years. The techniques taught can vary greatly among reiki schools and teachers. Many practitioners are massage therapists. However, no licensing or professional standards exist for the practice of reiki itself. Whether reiki can be considered the unlicensed practice of medicine varies from state to state. Research The most comprehensive review of reiki research was done by Edzard Ernst, M.D., Ph.D. and his colleagues at the University of Exeter. After surveying studies published through January 2008, they concluded that most were poorly designed and \"the evidence is insufficient to suggest that reiki is an effective treatment for any condition.\" [4] In 2009, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops concluded that \"reiki therapy finds no support either in the findings of natural science or in Christian belief\" and urged Catholic health-care facilities and clergy not to promote or support it. It further stated: Reiki lacks scientific credibility. It has not been accepted by the scientific and medical communities as an effective therapy. Reputable scientific studies attesting to the efficacy of Reiki are lacking, as is a plausible scientific explanation as to how it could possibly be efficacious. The explanation of the efficacy of Reiki depends entirely on a particular view of the world as permeated by this \"universal life energy\" (Reiki) that is subject to manipulation by human thought and will. Reiki practitioners claim that their training allows one to channel the \"universal life energy\" that is present in all things. This \"universal life energy,\" however, is unknown to natural science. As the presence of such energy has not been observed by means of natural science, the justification for these therapies necessarily must come from something other than science [5]. The \"energy transmission\" claims for therapeutic touch are similar to those for reiki. In the mid-1990s, at ages 9 and 10, Emily Rosa demonstrated that 21 therapeutic touch (TT) practitioners could not detect her alleged \"energy field.\" During the tests, the practitioners rested their arms on a flat surface, about a foot apart. Emily then hovered her hand, palm down, a few inches above one of the subject's palms. A cardboard screen prevented the subjects from seeing which of their hands was selected. The practitioners correctly located Emily's hand only 122 (44%) out of 280 trials, which is no better than would be expected by guessing [6]. After the Journal of the American Medical Association published the results, TT leaders called the study a \"parlor game,\" but they refused to suggest an alternative experimental design or to undergo similar tests themselves [7]. It might be interesting to investigate whether reiki practitioners can actually sense or transmit \"energy,\" whether reiki \"attunements\" actually enhance anything, and whether feelings of warmth are accompanied by any measurable change of skin temperature. In 2013, Researchers at Scripps Institute (San Diego) reported using a Magnes 2500 WH SQUID device to measure the electromagnetic fields from the hands and heart of three reiki masters when they were (a) not practicing reiki, (b) purportedly transmitting reiki to a distant person, and (c) purportedly transmitting to a person in the room. Similar measurements were made on four reiki-naive volunteers before and after they received a reiki training/attunement enabling them to self-administer reiki. No high-intensity radiation attributable to reiki was found [9]. British Regulatory Action The British Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has objected to reiki claims at least five times: - In 2001, the ASA concluded that the International Reiki and Healing Centre had made unsubstantiated claims about \"healing\" serious diseases and that a \"Doctor of Philosophy in Alternative Medicine\" certificate from an Indian school did not entitle the proprietor (Allan Sweeney) to refer to himself as \"Dr. Sweeney.\" [10] - In 2011, the ASA objected to unsubstantiated claims on Sweeney's Web site that reiki was an effective therapy for cancer, ADHD, back pain, migraine, depression, anger, low energy, sleeplessness, ADD, sadness, bereavement, tinnitus and sciatica [11]. - In 2011, the ASA objected to unsubstantiated claims by \"reiki master\" Christina Moore of East Sussex, England, that reiki could treat grief, insomnia, tinnitus, lack of confidence, back pain, constipation, Candida, skin disorders, anxiety, stress, tension, worry and phobias [12]. - In 2012, the ASA objected to claims by Jackie Howchin that rieki could treat a \"wide range of problems, including stress, depression, bereavement, back pain, fibromyalgia, Myasthenia Gravis, sports injuries, broken bones, sciatica and nerve damage.\" [13] - In 2012, the ASA objected to claims by A Better Being that reiki could treat irritable bowel syndrome, hay fever, indigestion, repetitive strain injury, headaches, asthma, eczema, poor circulation, rheumatism and sinusitis [14]. Reiki Vitamins William Lee Rand, who practices in Southfield, Michigan, has developed Reiki Vitamins, a 60-ingredient product that he says will \"strengthen the immune systems & the subtle energy field.\" Rand is also president of the International Center for Reiki Training, the Center for Reiki Research, and the Reiki Membership Association and edits and publishes the Reiki News Magazine. In a fascinating article, Lee describes how developed his formula: I work with a spiritual counselor who channels the Brothers and Sisters of the Light, who said they could work with the vitamin formula I had created, especially with the herbs. They said they knew which plants would grow the herbs in my formula and contacted the nature spirits that work with those plants. The nature spirits would enhance the plants, especially for my formula, to have the spiritual vibrations necessary to strengthen the Reiki energy of those who take the vitamins! When we received this information, I felt a very wonderful loving feeling from the nature spirits who are grateful to be part of this process. I know this sounds fantastic, but this came through my spiritual counselor, who confirms it! So, this vitamin formula brings together the best of both the spiritual and material worlds to create a synergy of harmonious interaction that allows the spiritual energy of Reiki to flow more easily through you to benefit you and your clients [15].. The Bottom Line Reiki has no substantiated health value and lacks a scientifically plausible rationale. Science-based healthcare settings should not tolerate its use, and scarce government research dollars should not be used to study it further [8]. References - Miles P, True G.

How can quacks and vitamin pushers be recognized? Here are 30 signs that should arouse suspicion. 1. When Talking about Nutrients, They Tell Only Part of the Story. Quacks tell you all the wonderful things that vitamins and minerals do in your body and/or all the horrible things that can happen if you don't get enough. Many claim that their products or programs offer \"optimal nutritional support.\" But they conveniently neglect to tell you that a balanced diet provides the nutrients most people need and that government guidelines makes balancing your diet simple. 2. They Claim That Most Americans Are Poorly Nourished. This is an appeal to fear that is not only untrue, but ignores the fact that the main forms of bad nourishment in the United States are obesity in the population at large (particularly the poor) and undernourishment among the poverty-stricken. Poor people can ill afford to waste money on unnecessary vitamin pills. Their food money should be spent on nourishing food. It is falsely alleged that Americans are so addicted to \"junk\" foods that an adequate diet is exceptional rather than usual. While it is true that some snack foods are mainly \"naked calories\" (sugars and/or fats without other nutrients), it is not necessary for every morsel of food we eat to be loaded with nutrients. In fact, no normal person following the [Dietary Guidelines for Americans](https://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2005/document/default.htm) is in any danger of vitamin deficiency. 3. They Recommend \"Nutrition Insurance\" for Everyone. Most vitamin pushers suggest that everyone is in danger of deficiency and should therefore take supplements as \"insurance.\" Some suggest that it is difficult to get what you need from food, while others claim that it is impossible. Their pitch resembles that of the door-to-door huckster who states that your perfectly good furnace is in danger of blowing up unless you replace it with his product. Vitamin pushers will never tell you who doesn't need their products. Their \"be wary of deficiency\" claims may not be limited to essential nutrients. It can also include nonessential chemicals that nobody needs to worry about because the body makes its own supply. 4. They Say That Most Diseases Are Due to Faulty Diet and Can Be Treated with \"Nutritional\" Methods. This simply isn't so. Consult your doctor or any recognized textbook of medicine. They will tell you that although diet is a factor in some diseases (most notably coronary heart disease), most diseases have little or nothing to do with diet. Common symptoms like malaise (feeling poorly), fatigue, lack of pep, aches (including headaches) or pains, insomnia, and similar complaints are usually the body's reaction to emotional stress. The persistence of such symptoms is a signal to see a doctor to be evaluated for possible physical illness. It is not a reason to take vitamin pills. 5. They Allege That Modern Processing Methods and Storage Remove all Nutritive Value from Our Food. It is true that food processing can change the nutrient content of foods. But the changes are not so drastic as the quack, who wants you to buy supplements, would like you to believe. While some processing methods destroy some nutrients, others add them. A balanced variety of foods will provide all the nourishment you need. Quacks distort and oversimplify. When they say that milling removes B-vitamins, they don't bother to tell you that enrichment puts them back. When they tell you that cooking destroys vitamins, they omit the fact that only a few vitamins are sensitive to heat. Nor do they tell you that these vitamins are easily obtained by consuming a portion of fresh uncooked fruit, vegetable, or fresh or frozen fruit juice each day. Any claims that minerals are destroyed by processing or cooking are pure lies. Heat does not destroy minerals. 6. They Claim That Diet Is a Major Factor in Behavior. Food quacks relate diet not only to disease but to behavior. Some claim that adverse reactions to additives and/or common foods cause hyperactivity in children and even criminal behavior in adolescents and adults. These claims are based on a combination of delusions, anecdotal evidence, and poorly designed research. 7. They Claim That Fluoridation Is Dangerous. Curiously, quacks are not always interested in real deficiencies. Fluoride is necessary to build decay-resistant teeth and strong bones. The best way to obtain adequate amounts of this important nutrient is to augment community water supplies so their fluoride concentration is about one part fluoride for every million parts of water. But [quacks usually oppose water fluoridation](../../03HealthPromotion/fluoride.html), and some advocate water filters that remove fluoride. It seems that when they cannot profit from something, they may try to make money by opposing it. 8. They Claim That Soil Depletion and the Use of Pesticides and \"Chemical\" Fertilizers Result in Food That Is Less Safe and Less Nourishing. These claims are used to promote the sale of so-called \"organically grown\" foods. If an essential nutrient is missing from the soil, a plant simply doesn't grow. Chemical fertilizers counteract the effects of soil depletion. Quacks also lie when they claim that plants grown with natural fertilizers (such as manure) are nutritionally superior to those grown with synthetic fertilizers. Before they can use them, plants convert natural fertilizers into the same chemicals that synthetic fertilizers supply. The vitamin content of a food is determined by its genetic makeup. Fertilizers can influence the levels of certain minerals in plants, but this is not a significant factor in the American diet. The pesticide residue of our food supply is extremely small and poses no health threat to the consumer. Foods \"certified\" as \"organic\" are not safer or more nutritious than other foods. In fact, except for their high price, they are not significantly different. 9. They Claim You Are in Danger of Being \"Poisoned\" by Ordinary Food Additives and Preservatives. This is another scare tactic designed to undermine your confidence in food scientists and government protection agencies as well as our food supply itself. Quacks want you to think they are out to protect you. They hope that if you trust them, you will buy their \"natural\" food products. The fact is that the tiny amounts of additives used in food pose no threat to human health. Some actually protect our health by preventing spoilage, rancidity, and mold growth. 10. They Charge That the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) Have Been Set Too Low. The RDAs have been published by the National Research Council approximately every five years since 1943. They are defined as \"the levels of intake of essential nutrients that, on the basis of scientific knowledge, are judged by the Food and Nutrition Board to be adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of practically all healthy persons.\" Neither the RDAs nor the Daily Values listed on food labels are \"minimums\" or \"requirements.\" They are deliberately set higher than most people need. The reason quacks charge that the RDAs are too low is obvious: if you believe you need more than can be obtained from food, you are more likely to buy supplements. 11. They Claim That under Everyday Stress, and in Certain Diseases, Your Need for Nutrients Is Increased. Many vitamin manufacturers have advertised that \"stress robs the body of vitamins.\" One company has asserted that, \"if you smoke, diet, or happen to be sick, you may be robbing your body of vitamins.\" Another has warned that \"stress can deplete your body of water-soluble vitamins . . . and daily replacement is necessary.\" Other products are touted to fill the \"special needs of athletes.\" While it is true that the need for vitamins may rise slightly under physical stress and in certain diseases, this type of advertising is fraudulent. The average American\u2014stressed or not\u2014is not in danger of vitamin deficiency. The increased needs to which the ads refer are not higher than the amounts obtainable by proper eating. Someone who is really in danger of deficiency due to an illness would be very sick and would need medical care, probably in a hospital. But these promotions are aimed at average Americans who certainly don't need vitamin supplements to survive the common cold, a round of golf, or a jog around the neighborhood! Athletes get more than enough vitamins when they eat the food needed to meet their caloric requirements. Many vitamin pushers suggest that smokers need vitamin C supplements. Although it is true that smokers in North America have somewhat lower blood levels of this vitamin, these levels are still far above deficiency levels. In America, cigarette smoking is the leading cause of death preventable by self-discipline. Rather than seeking false comfort by taking vitamin C, smokers who are concerned about their health should stop smoking. Suggestions that \"stress vitamins\" are helpful against emotional stress are also fraudulent. 12. They Recommend \"Supplements\" and \"Health Foods\" for Everyone. Food quacks belittle normal foods and ridicule the food-group systems of good nutrition. They may not tell you they earn their living from such pronouncements\u2014via public appearance fees, product endorsements, sale of publications, or financial interests in vitamin companies, health-food stores, or organic farms. The very term \"health food\" is a deceptive slogan. Judgments about individual foods should take into account how they contribute to an individual's overall diet. All food is health food in moderation; any food is junk food in excess. Did you ever stop to think that your corner grocery, fruit market, meat market, and supermarket are also health-food stores? They are\u2014and they generally charge less than stores that use the slogan. By the way, have you ever wondered why people who eat lots of \"health foods\" still feel they must load themselves up with vitamin supplements? Or why so many \"health food\" shoppers complain about ill health? 13. They Claim That \"Natural\" Vitamins are Better than \"Synthetic\" Ones. This claim is a flat lie. Each vitamin is a chain of atoms strung together as a molecule. With minor exception, molecules made in the \"factories\" of nature are identical to those made in the factories of chemical companies. Does it make sense to pay extra for vitamins extracted from foods when you can get all you need from the foods themselves? 14. They Suggest That a Questionnaire Can Be Used to Indicate Whether You Need Dietary Supplements. No questionnaire can do this. A few entrepreneurs have devised lengthy computer-scored questionnaires with questions about symptoms that could be present if a vitamin deficiency exists. But such symptoms occur much more frequently in conditions unrelated to nutrition. Even when a deficiency actually exists, the tests don't provide enough information to discover the cause so that suitable treatment can be recommended. That requires a physical examination and appropriate laboratory tests. Many responsible nutritionists use a computer to help evaluate their clients' diet. But this is done to make dietary recommendations, such as reducing fat content or increasing fiber content. Supplements are seldom necessary unless the person is unable (or unwilling) to consume an adequate diet. Be wary, too, of questionnaires purported to determine whether supplements are needed to correct \"nutrient deficiencies\" or \"dietary inadequacies\" or to design \"customized\" supplements. These questionnaires are scored so that everyone who takes the test is advised to take supplements. Responsible dietary analyses compare the individual's average daily food consumption with the recommended numbers of servings from each food group. The safest and best way to get nutrients is generally from food, not pills. So even if a diet is deficient, the most prudent action is usually diet modification rather than supplementation with pills. 15. They Say It Is Easy to Lose Weight. Diet quacks would like you to believe that special pills or food combinations can cause \"effortless\" weight loss. But the only way to lose weight is to burn off more calories than you eat. This requires self-discipline: eating less, exercising more, or preferably doing both. There are about 3,500 calories in a pound of body weight. To lose one pound a week (a safe amount that is not just water), you must eat about 500 fewer calories per day than you burn up. The most sensible diet for losing weight is one that is nutritionally balanced in carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Most fad diets \"work\" by producing temporary weight loss\u2014as a result of calorie restriction. But they are invariably too monotonous and are often too dangerous for long-term use. Unless a dieter develops and maintains better eating and exercise habits, weight lost on a diet will soon return. The term \"cellulite\" is sometimes used to describe the dimpled fat found on the hips and thighs of many women. Although no medical evidence supports the claim, cellulite is represented as a special type of fat that is resistant to diet and exercise. Sure-fire [cellulite remedies](https://quackwatch.org/related/cellulite/) include creams (to \"dissolve\" it), brushes, rollers, \"loofah\" sponges, body wraps, and vitamin-mineral supplements with or without herbs. The cost of various treatment plans runs from a few dollars for a bottle of vitamins to many hundreds of dollars at a salon that offers heat treatments, massage, enzyme injections, and/or treatment with various gadgets. The simple truth about \"cellulite\" is that it is ordinary fat that can be lost only as part of an overall reducing program. 16. They Claim to Have a Better Overall Approach to Health Care Many quacks refer to their practices as \"alternative,\" \"complementary,\" \"integrative\" \"functional,\" \"holistic,\" \"biological,\" and/or \"advanced.\" These marketing terms falsely suggest that they offer more than the science-based medical community. 17. They Claim to Treat the \"Root Cause\" of Your Health Problems Many quacks promise to locate and treat the underlying cause(s) of whatever health problems you have. In addition to nutrient deficiencies, the current favorite include hidden allergies, chemical sensitivity, heavy metal toxicity, yeast infections, molds, (\"candida\"), Lyme disease, hormonal imbalances, energy blockages, and misaligned spinal bones (the chiropractic favorite). The \"root cause\" tactic serves several purposes. First, it implies that standard health care will fail because it is a superficial approach. Second, it enable quacks to profit from selling one alleged treatment after another to virtually everyone who believes them. 18. They Promise Quick, Dramatic, Miraculous Results. Often the promises are subtle or couched in \"weasel words\" that create an illusion of a promise, so promoters can deny making them when the \"feds\" close in. False promises of cure are the quacks' most immoral practice. They don't seem to care how many people they break financially or in spirit\u2014by elation over their expected good fortune followed by deep depression when the \"treatment\" fails. Nor do quacks keep count\u2014while they fill their bank accounts\u2014of how many people they lure away from effective medical care into disability or death. Quacks will tell you that \"megavitamins\" (huge doses of vitamins) can prevent or cure many different ailments, particularly emotional ones. But they won't tell you that the \"evidence\" supporting such claims is unreliable because it is based on inadequate investigations, anecdotes, or testimonials. Nor do quacks inform you that megadoses may be harmful. Megavitamin therapy (also called [orthomolecular therapy](https://quackwatch.org/related/ortho/)) is nutritional roulette; and only the house makes the profit. 19. They Routinely Sell Vitamins and Other \"Dietary Supplements\" as Part of Their Practice. Although vitamins are useful as therapeutic agents for certain health problems, the number of such conditions is small. Practitioners who sell supplements in their offices invariably recommend them inappropriately. In addition, such products tend to be substantially more expensive than similar ones in drugstores\u2014or even health-food stores. You should also disregard any publication or Web site whose editor or publisher sells dietary supplements. 20. They Use Disclaimers Couched in Pseudomedical Jargon. Instead of promising to cure your disease, some quacks will promise to \"detoxify,\" \"purify,\" \"revitalize,\" or \"energize\" your body; \"balance\" its bring it in with nature; \"stimulate\" or \"strengthen\" your immune system; \"support\" in your body; \"unlock your body's healing ability\"; or stimulate your body's power to heal itself. Of course, they never identify or make valid before-and-after measurements of any of these processes. These disclaimers serve two purposes. First, since it is impossible to measure the processes quacks allege, it may be difficult to prove them wrong. Moreover, if a quack is not a physician, the use of nonmedical terminology may help to avoid prosecution for practicing medicine without a license\u2014although it shouldn't. Many marketers of dietary supplements and herbal products use similar language to describe the purposes of their products. The \"boost-your-immune-system\" claim is especially noteworthy when applied to allergies and to autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis. In these conditions, immune mechaisms go awry and attack the body's own cells. If the supposed treatment could actually enhance immue function, it would make these conditions worse! Some approaches to [\"detoxification\"](gastro.html) are based on notions that, as a result of intestinal stasis, intestinal contents putrefy, and toxins are formed and absorbed, which causes chronic poisoning of the body. This \"autointoxication\" theory was popular around the turn of the century but was abandoned by the scientific community during the 1930s. No such \"toxins\" have ever been found, and careful observations have shown that individuals in good health can vary greatly in bowel habits. Quacks may also suggest that fecal material collects on the lining of the intestine and causes trouble unless removed by laxatives, colonic irrigation, special diets, and/or various herbs or food supplements that \"cleanse\" the body. The falsity of this notion is obvious to doctors who perform intestinal surgery or peer within the large intestine with a diagnostic instrument. Fecal material does not adhere to the intestinal lining. Colonic irrigation is done by inserting a tube into the rectum and pumping up to 20 gallons of water in and out. This type of enema is not only therapeutically worthless but can cause fatal electrolyte imbalance. Cases of death due to intestinal perforation and infection (from contaminated equipment) have also been reported. 21. They Claim to Use or Mobilize Healing Forces That Are Not Recognized by Science Many quacks claim they can cure diseases by mobilizing healing forces with a device. They typically claim that all cells vibrate with specific \"frequencies\" that their device can counter with healing frequencies. Some even claim that this process can be done through telephone lines or via the Internet. Since the forces they claim to mobilize cannot be detected by scientific instruments, it is safe to assume they do not exist. 22. They Use Anecdotes and Testimonials to Support Their Claims. We all tend to believe what others tell us about personal experiences. But separating cause and effect from coincidence can be difficult. If people tell you that product X has cured their cancer, arthritis, or whatever, be skeptical. They may not actually have had the condition. If they did, their recovery most likely would have occurred without the help of product X. Most single episodes of disease end with just the passage of time, and most chronic ailments have symptom-free periods. Establishing medical truths requires careful and repeated investigation\u2014with well-designed experiments, not reports of coincidences misperceived as cause-and-effect. That's why [ testimonial evidence](https://quackwatch.org/related/scivsalt/) is forbidden in scientific articles, is usually inadmissible in court, and is not used to evaluate whether or not drugs should be legally marketable. (Imagine what would happen if the FDA decided that clinical trials were too expensive and therefore drug approval would be based on testimonial letters or interviews with a few patients.) Anecdotes (reports of individual experiences) occasionally provide suggestions about what might be worth studying. As an anonymous commenter to a blog said recently: \"Anecdotes are how you start research\u2014not how you finish it.\" Never underestimate the extent to which people can be fooled by a worthless remedy. During the early 1940s, many thousands of people became convinced that \"glyoxylide\" could cure cancer. Yet analysis showed that it was simply distilled water! [1]. Many years before that, when arsenic was used as a \"tonic,\" countless numbers of people swore by it even as it slowly poisoned them. Symptoms that are psychosomatic (bodily reactions to tension) are often relieved by anything taken with a suggestion that it will work. Tiredness and other minor aches and pains may respond to any enthusiastically recommended nostrum. For these problems, even physicians may prescribe a placebo. A placebo is a substance that has no pharmacological effect on the condition for which it is used, but is given to satisfy a patient who supposes it to be a medicine. Vitamins (such as B12 shots) are commonly used in this way. Placebos act by suggestion. Unfortunately, some doctors swallow the advertising hype or become confused by their own observations and \"believe in vitamins\" beyond those supplied by a good diet. Those who share such false beliefs do so because they confuse coincidence or placebo action with cause and effect. Homeopathic believers make the same error. Remember, too, that anecdotes and testimonials may be complete fabrications\u2014stories simply made up for marketing purposes\u2014and that the people to whom they are attributed may not even exist,\u00e5 23. They Claim That Sugar Is a Deadly Poison. Many vitamin pushers would have us believe that refined (white) sugar is \"the killer on the breakfast table\" and is the underlying cause of everything from heart disease to hypoglycemia. This is a gross exaggeration. [Excess sugar can contribute to the development or worsening of heart disease and several other health problems and should be avoided](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/added-sugars). However, that when sugar is used in moderation as part of a sensible balanced diet, it is a safe source of calories and eating pleasure. Sugar is alao factor in the tooth decay process, but what counts is not merely the amount of sugar in the diet but how long any digestible carbohydrate remains in contact with the teeth. This, in turn, depends on such factors as the stickiness of the food, the type of bacteria on the teeth, and the extent of oral hygiene practiced by the individual. 24. They Display Credentials Not Recognized by Responsible Scientists or Educators. The backbone of educational integrity in America is a system of [accreditation](http://www.ed.gov/offices/OPE/Students/file01.html) by agencies recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education or the Council on Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), which is a nongovernmental coordinating agency. \"Degrees\" from nonaccredited schools are rarely worth the paper they are printed on. In the health field, no nonaccredited school can qualify people to give trustworthy advice. Also note that some nonaccredited schools set up their own non-recognized accrediting bodies. Unfortunately, possession of an accredited degree does not guarantee reliability. Some schools that teach unscientific methods (chiropractic, naturopathy, acupuncture, and even quack nutritional methods) have achieved accreditation. Worse yet, a small percentage of individuals trained in reputable institutions (such as medical or dental schools or accredited universities) have strayed from scientific thought. Since quacks operate outside of the scientific community, they also tend to form their own \"professional\" organizations. In some cases, the only membership requirement is payment of a fee. We and others we know have secured fancy \"professional member\" certificates for household pets by merely submitting the pet's name, address, and a check for $50 [2]. Don't assume that all groups with scientific-sounding names are respectable. Find out whether their views are scientifically based. Also note that groups that promiote nonstandard treatment often set up a certifying board so that their members can claim to be board-certified. Some quacks are promoted with superlatives like \"the world's foremost nutritionist\" or \"America's leading nutrition expert.\" There is no law against this tactic, just as there is none against calling oneself the \"World's Foremost Lover.\" However, the scientific community recognizes no such titles. The designation \"Nobel Prize Nominee\" is also bogus and can be assumed to mean that someone has either nominated himself or had a close associate do so. Some entrepreneurs claim to have degrees and/or affiliations to schools, hospitals, and/or professional groups that actually don't exist. The modern champion of this approach appears to be the late [Gregory E. Caplinger](https://quackwatch.org/related/cancer/immustim/), who claimed to have acquired a medical degree, specialty training, board certification, and scores of professional affiliations\u2014all from bogus or nonexistent sources. A few organizations even issue \"licenses\" that lack government recogition. The most noteworthy of these is the [Pastoral Medical Association (PMA](http://www.credentialwatch.org/reports/pma/overview.shtml)), which \"licenses\" practitioners and registers prospective patients as \"members\" who wish to receive care from these providers. Encouraged by PMSA, hundreds of practitioners are using the credentials \"PSc.D.,\" \"D.PSc.,\" and/or \"Doctor of Pastoral Medicine\" to promote their services [3]. Even legitimate credentials can be used to mislead. The American Medical Association's \"Physician's Recognition Award\" requires participation in 150 hours of continuing education over a three-year period and payment of a small fee. Most practicing physicians meet this educational standard because it is necessary to study to keep up-to-date. Accredited hospitals require this amount of continuing education to maintain staff privileges, and some states require it for license renewal. However, most physicians who do this don't bother to get the AMA certificate. Since the award reflects no special accomplishment or expertise, using it for promotional purposes is not appropriate behavior. 25. They Offer to Determine Your Body's Nutritional State with an Invalid Test or a Questionnaire. Various health-food industry members and unscientific practitioners utilize tests that they claim can determine your body's nutritional state and\u2014of course\u2014what products you should buy from them. One favorite method is [hair analysis](https://quackwatch.org/related/hair-2/). For $35 to $75 plus a lock of your hair, you can get an elaborate computer printout of vitamins and minerals you supposedly need. Hair analysis has limited value (mainly in forensic medicine) in the diagnosis of heavy metal poisoning, but it is worthless as a screening device to detect nutritional problems [4]. If a hair analysis laboratory recommends supplements, you can be sure that its computers are programmed to recommend them to everyone. Other tests used to hawk supplements include amino acid analysis of urine, muscle-testing ( [applied kinesiology](https://quackwatch.org/related/tests/ak/)), [iridology](https://quackwatch.org/related/iridology/), [live-cell analysis](https://quackwatch.org/related/tests/livecell/) analysis, vital hematology, and biocytonics), [some genetic testing](https://quackwatch.org/related/tests/genomics/), blood typing, \"nutrient-deficiency\" and/or lifestyle questionnaires, and [\"electrodiagnostic\" gadgets](electro.html). 26. They Diagnose Their Favorite Diseases in Virtually Everyone Who Consults. At least 25 diagnostic labels classifiable as fads have been in vogue during the past fifty years [5]. Some unscientific practitioners apply one or more of these diagnoses to almost every patient they see. The common ones include adrenal fatigue, candidiasis hypersensitivity, hypothyroidism, \"leaky even \"magnetic deficiency.\" [5] Some refer to actual disease (which the patients do not have), whereas others are not recognized by the scientific community. In many cases, nonstandard tests are used to \"diagnose\" them and recommend \"dietary supplements,\" \"detoxification,\" and/or various procedures to treat them. A small percentage of physicians and large percentages of chiropractors, naturopaths, acupuncturists, and bogus \"nutritionists\" are involved in this process. Others may also profit by selling educational materials promoting these alleged conditions and supplement concoctions claimed to help them. 27. They Claim They Are Being Persecuted by Orthodox Medicine and That Their Work Is Being Suppressed Because It's Controversial. The \"conspiracy charge\" is an attempt to gain sympathy by portraying the quack as an \"underdog.\" Quacks typically claim that the American Medical Association is against them because their cures would cut into the incomes that doctors make by keeping people sick. Don't fall for such nonsense! Reputable physicians are plenty busy. Moreover, many doctors engaged in prepaid health plans, group practice, full-time teaching, and government service receive the same salary whether or not their patients are sick\u2014so keeping their patients healthy reduces their workload, not their income. Quacks also claim there is a \"controversy\" about facts between themselves and \"the bureaucrats,\" organized medicine, or \"the establishment.\" They clamor for medical examination of their claims, but ignore any evidence that refutes them. The gambit \"Do you believe in vitamins?\" is another tactic used to increase confusion. Everyone knows that vitamins are needed by the human body. The real question is \"Do you need additional vitamins beyond those in a well-balanced diet?\" [For most people, the answer is no](../../03HealthPromotion/supplements.html). Nutrition is a science, not a religion. It is based upon matters of fact, not questions of belief. Any physician who found a vitamin or other preparation that could cure sterility, heart disease, arthritis, cancer, or the like, could make an enormous fortune. Patients would flock to such a doctor (as they now do to those who falsely claim to cure such problems), and colleagues would shower the doctor with awards\u2014including the extremely lucrative Nobel Prize! And don't forget, doctors get sick, too. Do you believe they would conspire to suppress cures for diseases that also afflict them and their loved ones? When polio was conquered, iron lungs became virtually obsolete, but nobody resisted this advancement because it would force hospitals to change. And neither will scientists mourn the eventual defeat of cancer. 28. They Claim to Have Scoured the World to Find What Works Some promoters tell stories about how, when they or a loved one got sick, they traveled throughout the world and found a cure. Such stories imply that \"unknown\" or \"secret\" cures exist if you only look hard enough for them. Think about it. If anyone knew of such a cure, why wouldn't they want to share them and the fame, fortune, and good feelings that wiould come from sharing them? 29. They Warn You Not to Trust Your Doctor. Quacks, who want you to trust them, suggest that most doctors are \"butchers\" and \"poisoners.\" They exaggerate the shortcomings of our healthcare delivery system, but completely disregard their own\u2014and those of other quacks. For the same reason, quacks also claim that doctors are nutrition illiterates. This, too, is untrue. The principles of nutrition are those of human biochemistry and physiology, courses required in every medical school. Some medical schools don't teach a separate required course labeled \"Nutrition\" because the subject is included in other courses at the points where it is most relevant. For example, nutrition in growth and development is taught in pediatrics, nutrition in wound healing is taught in surgery, and nutrition in pregnancy is covered in obstetrics. In addition, many medical schools do offer separate instruction in nutrition. A physician's training, of course, does not end on the day of graduation from medical school or completion of specialty training. The medical profession advocates lifelong education, and some states require it for license renewal. Physicians can further their knowledge of nutrition by reading medical journals and textbooks, discussing cases with colleagues, and attending continuing education courses. Most doctors know what nutrients can and cannot do and can tell the difference between a real nutritional discovery and a piece of quack nonsense. Those who are unable to answer questions about dietetics (meal planning) can refer patients to someone who can\u2014usually a registered dietitian. Like all human beings, doctors sometimes make mistakes. However, quacks deliver mistreatment most of the time. 30. They Encourage Patients to Crusade for Their Treatment Methods. A century ago, before scientific methodology was generally accepted, valid new ideas were hard to evaluate and were sometimes rejected by a majority of the medical community, only to be upheld later. But today, treatments demonstrated as effective are welcomed by scientific practitioners and do not need a group to crusade for them. Quacks seek political endorsement because they can't prove that their methods work. Instead, they may seek to legalize their treatment and force insurance companies to pay for it. One of the surest signs that a treatment doesn't work is a political campaign to protect the practitioners who are using it.

Quackwatch has posted a [detailed article](https://quackwatch.org/cases/board/med/disciplinary-actions-against-kenneth-stoller-m-d/) about Kenneth P. Stoller, M.D., whose license was revoked last year by the Medical Board of California for issuing approximately 500 baseless vaccine-exemption letters. After losing appeals to the Sacramento County Superior Court and the Sacramento appellate court, he has petitioned the California Supreme Court for review. The [Superior Court judge's ruling](https://cdn.centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2022/02/25155751/judgment_denying_petition.pdf) provides an exceptionally clear description of what Stoller did wrong and indicates how thoroughly the medical board prepared its case. The New Mexico Medical Board is also reviewing Stoller's licensing status. [Hide Full Content](#thirty-two-thousand-four-hundred-sixty-two) [Disciplinary Actions against Kenneth Stoller, M.D.](https://quackwatch.org/cases/board/med/disciplinary-actions-against-kenneth-stoller-m-d/) Kenneth Paul Stoller, M.D. has promoted the false notion that vaccines cause autism.

In 2021, the Medical Board of California revoked his license for writing baseless medical exemptions from school vaccine requirements. The [revocation order](https://cdn.centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2021/02/22170721/revocation_2021.pdf) concerned ten children who had not qualified for [medical exemptions under the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/should-not-vacc.html) or [American Academy of Pediatrics (ASAP)](https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/immunizations/Pages/Immunization-Schedule.aspx) guidelines. Documents in the case indicate: - Stoller testified that he did not believe that the ACIP and AAP guidelines offered reliable guidance. - Stoller was not the treating physician for any of them\u2014the parents brought them in expressly to buy medical exemptions. - Stoller did not ask for any child's medical records or consult any child's treating physician. - Even if a medical condition made a child more sensitive to a particular vaccine, that would not justify the wholesale exemptions that Stoller routinely wrote. - The cost of the exemptions ranged from $400 to $600 per child. - Stoller estimated that he had issued about 500 such exemptions between 2016 and 2019, using a similar protocol for each request [1]. Stoller told the board that he had relied on genetic tests to determine whether children should be exempted from required vaccinations. But the board concluded that the use of such tests could not predict vaccine responses and lacked scientific support. The administrative law judge who presided over four days of hearings concluded that (a) Stoller had not taken a good faith examination of the children before issuing his exemption letters, (b) Stoller had taken advantage of parents who were anxious and medically ignorant, and (c) Stoller's conduct had demonstrated a \"contempt for medical science\" that warranted revocation of his license. Stoller received his medical degree from the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine in 1982 and completed his residency training at the University of California in 1986. He practiced pediatrics in Southern California between 1986 and 1998, then moved to New Mexico where he opened a hyperbaric oxygen center and practiced until 2015. He was board-certified in pediatrics from 1989 through 2011, but he told the California Medical Board that he did not seek recertification because his type of practice made board certification less valuable to him. In 2014, the New Mexico Medical Board investigated whether Stoller should be disciplined for administering hyperbaric oxygen to an autistic child. In 2015, after a hearing officer concluded that the question of whether this was unnecessary was \"a muddled mess,\" Stoller and the board entered into a consent agreement under which Stoller received a nondisciplinary advisory letter and agreed to pay $3,496.76 for costs of the proceeding [2]. Documents from the California Medical Board indicate that Stoller resumed practicing in California in 2015 as part of a group in San Francisco group that included several chiropractors and naturopaths. In part because of the negative publicity related to his vaccine exemptions, he opened a private practice in Santa Rosa, California. [Physicians for Informed Consent](https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/physicians-for-informed-consent-vaers-loving-anti-vaccine-group/) lists Stoller among its advisors and founding members. His biographical sketch describes how he became interested in vaccination this way: I spent years trying to find out how I became temporarily paralyzed at the age of four while attending the birthday party of a neighbor who was turning five. Eventually I compared notes with an elderly man who had developed polio in his youth, and then asked my mother if I had been vaccinated with the polio vaccine (circa 1960) around the time of the neighbor's birthday party. As it turned out, I had been vaccinated two weeks before the paralysis I experienced. Thus, having been vaccine-injured myself, it altered the way I evaluated the efficacy and safety of vaccines.\" [3] Stoller is appealing his license suspension. So far, the Sacramento Superior Court [4] and the Sacramento appellate court have ruled against him. He has asked the California Supreme Court to review his case. In 2021, the New Mexico board notified Stoller that it was investigating his California revocation and offered him the opportunity of a hearing [5]. I believe that his California actions were serious enough that his New Mexico license will also be revoked.
