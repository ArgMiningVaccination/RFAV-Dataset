[DNLM: 2. Plants, Medicinal.] QK99.A1 D83 2002615 .321--dc21 2002017548 Introduction By the time this second edition is published, the rst edition of the Handbook of Medicinal Herbs will have been out more than 15 years. The second edition is designed to present most of the old information plus new information on the more important of those original 365 herbs. I submittedthe rst edition under the original unpublished title, Herbs of Dubious Salubrity. I intentionally left out many of the completely safe culinary herbs, spices, and food plants that are clearly medicinal.I also intentionally omitted some strictly dangerous herbs, such as foxglove, that were too unhealthyfor use in unskilled hands. I did include several obscure hallucinogenic plants of dubious salubrity.I did, or should have, dropped some of these because they have little medicinal importance. Somepoorly documented species, such as Mimosa hostilis and Phoradendron leucarpum , for example, were retained with fragmentary entries, so as to at least mention species from the rst edition thatmight better have been dropped. Now I think I have the most important herbs well covered here. In edition two, which I will refer to frequently as my Herbal Desk Reference (HDR), I have tried to concisely corral the dataon some 1000 herbs in as little space as possible, striving to make a reliable, referenced resourceto parallel the PDR for Herbal Medicines . I use the three-letter abbreviation, HDR, to indicate the second edition of my Handbook of Medicinal Herbs , because I compare and contrast it to other important sources, which are also represented by three-letter abbreviations. (See the referenceabbreviation appendix.) With this edition, I have tried to cover most of the widely mentioned medicinal plants, whether they are extremely salubrious or extremely toxic. Without counting them, I estimate we includemore than 1000 of the most important herbs, including the more important herbs from the youngNative American and the European traditions (including most of those approved by CommissionE (KOM), and almost all of those included in the PDR for Herbal Medicine (PHR for the rst edition, and PH2 for the second edition). Unlike Commission E and the Herbal PDR, which seemto stress European and American traditions, I include proportionately more herbs from the older African, Ayurvedic, and Chinese traditions as well, not wanting to slight any major medicinal plant from any major tradition. Let me explain the new format for the second edition. First, a common name appears, usually but not always in English, followed by a recently accepted scientic name, with the authority forthe scientic name. Then follows a safety score, X, +, ++, or +++. An X means I don't recommendtaking it at all, or realize that it is so dangerous that it should not be taken without expert guidance.But for litigious reasons, I give some potent medicinal herbs the X (amateurs beware!). A singleplus (+) indicates that I do not consider that the herb is, overall, as safe as coffee. I score twopluses (++) for those herbs I think of, overall, as being as safe as coffee. I score three pluses (+++)for those herbs I believe to be safer than coffee. In the rst edition, I related the plus sign to a cupof coffee, guring that 1, 2, or 3 cups per day of an herbal tea from the herb would be as safe as1, 2, or 3 cups per day of coffee. I often drink more than 3 cups of coffee a day, especially whileI worked on this project! Clearly, this is an oversimplication. Too often, some parts of a plant aremore helpful or more toxic than other parts of the same species, and different ethnic groups orcultures may use parts differently. The safety scoring is a continuation of the same scoring systemI used in the rst edition. Some scores have been upgraded a bit, some have been downgraded. Often, there are some comments on synonymy and other nomenclature difculties that arose in completing this opus. I inject these following the nomenclature line. Here you may nd someproven and/or suspected synonyms, or notes of related species that may be included in this species concept, especially by nontaxonomically trained authors. I have often used, as nal arbiter of scientic names and sometimes common names, the nomenclature database at the USDA (www.ars-grin.gov; curator, Dr. John. H. Wiersema: sbmljw@ars-grin.gov). Unfortunately, the new American Herbal Products Association (AHP) book on nomenclature arrived too late for our consideration. Attempts to standardize common names, although admirable,are often aggravating to special interests. It was with some misgiving that I arranged this bookalphabetically by common names, when the rst edition was by scientic name. It generated bigheadaches for all of us who think more along the lines of scientic names. Would it be undermulberry or black mulberry, chamomile or German chamomile? Some plants have dozens ofcommon names. Several have suffered almost as many scientic names, such as, for example,feverfew. Hopefully, you will nd it easy to use. In the Activities and Indications sections, parenthetical numbers are followed by three-letter abbreviations (abbreviation of source) or an alphanumeric X-1111111 to identify PubMed citations.A parenthetical efcacy score of (1) means that a chemical in the plant or in an extract of the planthas shown the activity or proven out experimentally (animal, not clinical) for the indication. Thiscould be in vitro animal or assay experiments. A hint: not real human proof! Nothing clinical yet! I give it a score of (2) if the aqueous extract, ethanolic extract, or decoction or tea derived fromthe plant has been shown to have the activity, or to support the indication in clinical trials.Commission E (KOM) and Tramil Commission (TRA) approvals were automatically given a scoreof (2) also, because they represented consensus opinions of distinguished panels. The rare scoreof (3) for efcacy means that clinical trials exist to show that the plant itself (not just an extractor phytochemical derivative) has the indications or activities. The solitary score of (f) in many ofthe citations means it is unsupported folk medicine, or I have not seen the science to back it up.The three-letter abbreviations are useful short citations of the references consulted in arriving atthese numbers. I have by no means cited every source. However, unlike KOM and hopefully betterthan PHR, we indicate at least one source for every indication and activity we report. Thus, we have a score for Safety and a score for Efcacy, the latter backed up by the three- letter abbreviations or citations, often PubMed citations. In addition to our three letter abbreviationsfor the frequently consulted texts, we occasionally cite articles cited from the PubMed databasewith their unique abstract number, preceded by the letter X. For example, I received a paper showingthat ginger contained several COX-2 inhibitors. I looked in the PubMed database to nd the uniqueabstract citation number, PMID: 11437391, which I shortened for database purpose to X11437391.So, all alpha-numeric (X-numerical) combinations will refer you to the source in the PubMeddatabase. Whenever I update one of my Herb-a-Day columns, I automatically search PubMed for>species name AND 2000 <, which automatically gives me the post 1999 abstracts. In 2001, Isearch for >species AND 2001<. Then I order hard copies of those articles that look promising fordatabase purposes. Often, many more than 10 sources were involved in my decision-making. In many instances, I limited citations to three, typically the ones that were most important at arriving at my scores.Not wanting to blow my own horn, my own books were rst to be deleted from the list when itexceeded three. In preparing this edition I realized that for patent litigation, the earlier citationswere most valuable, so at the last minute I added several older references, such as DEP, FEL, HHB,and MAD. For example, even I was surprised when I read about Remifemin in HHB (1973, p. 12),three decades ago, since Remifemin seems so new here in America. But in my mind it is justanother native American remedy, coming back home to us, slightly upgraded, after having beenbetter studied in Europe than it has been in America (other examples include evening primrose,passionflower, and saw palmetto). DEP and FEL citations are more than 100 years old, and mightbe useful in challenging frivolous patents. One very important abbreviation, WAM, might as well be viewed as MOM, meaning pediatric. This comes from the excellent book, Kids, Herbs, Health , by Dr. Linda White, MD, and Sunny Mavor. So, if you are looking for an herb that has been suggested by a pediatrician, scroll down to WAM. Ditto for PIP, Hans Schilcher's Phytotherapy in Paediatrics . This is an evolving system that changes as new science validates the folklore, often resulting in an upgrading of the indication or activity. Occasionally, bad news about the plant will result inmy lowering its safety rating, from +++ to ++, or ++ to +, or + to X. This does not constitute myrecommendation of an herb. It merely indicates how I think the herb compares with others, basedon the literature surveyed. As a botanist, I cannot legally, and do not, prescribe. But I nd mechanicalsearches of the Handbook of Medicinal Herbs to be an extremely fast way to nd the better herbs for a given indication. We have used the same abbreviations that are used in my database at the USDA (http://www.ars- grin.gov/duke). I much prefer the abbreviations used there because they do not get you into asmuch trouble when you e-mail a query to the taxpaying public. For example, the preferred abbre-viation of microgram, at least with some publishers (including CRC), but not me, is \u00b5 g. Too often, if I put that abbreviation (or use an italicized u ) in an e-mail, the u or \u00b5 disappears and the reader receives g instead of u g or \u00b5 g, giving an often dangerously high reading, a million times too high. Ditto for u l or \u00b5 l (microliter) as opposed to ml (milliliter). And with uM and m M , micromole and millimole, respectively. In a sense, my scored second edition is a loner's approach to a Commission E, but I am the sole member of the ctitious commission, Commission U.S. for us, here in the good old USA. Note thatunlike the ratings in, for example, APA, my ratings assess the efcacy of each activity and indication. I'll keep revising the scoring for an online version as new information, positive or negative, comes in on the safety or efcacy of the herb, or chemicals it contains. So, like the allopaths, healthannouncers, and reporters, I reserve the right to change my mind as I oscillate from side to sideof the pendulum on my long, tedious, treacherous, and tumultuous trip, veering like a coiledcaduceus, deviously toward the truth. Users will nd it easy to search and nd which herbs score highest for efcacy and safety. The three-letter abbreviations will lead them to some, but by no means all, of the sources I consultedincluding the one(s) or some of them that led me to the numerical scores for efcacy. The scoresare my own. Only rarely did all the cited and consulted sources agree; but one of the indicatedsources provided the evidence that led me to arrive at the assigned score. By no means shouldthese scores be attributed to anyone except me. THE APA RATINGS A warning: my highest ratings are my best ratings. With the American Pharmaceutical Association(APA) and the American Herbal Products Association (AHP), the converse is true: the higher thenumber, the lower the rating. APA's best, (1), is veried by large clinical, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, human trials. That too would have gotten approval, we assume, in Commis-sion E. That would get a (2) in my HDR, if the study were of an extract of the plant, but a (3) forexample if the study were of the natural whole herb, such as garlic or onion. The APA (1) and theHDR (3) scores are rare indeed. Their number (1) means \"Years of use and extensive, high-qualitystudies indicate that this substance is very effective and safe when used in recommended amountsfor the indication(s) noted in the 'Will It Work For You?' section.\" Unfortunately, they often mentionunapproved, unstudied folklore in this section, even clearly noting that it was unapproved. With APA,(2) is a large, clinical human trial, but not necessarily double blind and placebo controlled. That wouldalso get a (2) in my HDR, if the study were of an extract of the plant, but a (3) if the study were ofthe whole herb, rather than the extract. And the third one is hard for me to believe, but here is thequote, \"large, placebo-controlled animal experiment.\" That would get a (1) in my HDR. The APA (4)is for in vitro studies, which I suppose includes studies, e.g., of isolated phytochemicals. Those score (1) in HDR. The APA (5) is for decades or centuries of well-known folk use, but no supporting studies.That would get an (f) for folkloric in the HDR. APA (6) is a large collection of case histories, which would also get an (f) in HDR. At the bottom of the APA ladder is the personal anecdote, which of course, also gets an (f), even though it has not yet evolved into folklore. THE AHPA CLASSIFICATION A few specic comments regarding the American Herbal Products Association (AHP). Although Ilike the way they handled some perplexing little details, such as idiosyncratic allergies, trivialquantities of toxic substances, etc., I'm a little alarmed by their 'Class 1' denition. Why alarmed?Because I feel that all drugs, whether they be synthetic, phytochemical, nutritional, or herbal, \"canbe safely consumed when used appropriately.\" Class 1: Can be safely consumed if used appropriately.Class 2: Herbs with the following use restrictions apply; unless otherwise directed by an expert qualied in the use of the substance: (2a) External use only(2b) Not for use in pregnancy(2c) Not for use while nursing(2d) Other restrictions as noted Class 3: Herbs with signicant data suggesting labeling: \"To be used only under the super- vision of an expert qualied in the appropriate use of this substance.\" Labeling mustinclude proper use information: dosage, contraindications, potential adverse effects anddrug interactions, and other information pertinent to the safe use of the substance. Class 4: Herbs with data insufcient for classication. Why don't I like that 'Class 1' denition? My interpretation of 'Class 1' denition is that all herbs are 'Class 1' and can be safely used if used appropriately (appropriate is safe). Similarly,I think we could say appropriately for many, if not most, herbs what AHPA says of labelinginformation that should be required for aloe, \"Do not use this product if you have abdominalpain or diarrhea. Consult a health care provider prior to use if you are pregnant or nursing.Discontinue use in the event of diarrhea or watery stools. Do not exceed recommended dose.Not for long term use.\" (AHP, 1997) A subset of American phytomedicine advocates argue that we should emulate the German Commission E's Standard of Excellence. Which one? Two versions came out in 1998, purportingto be authentic English presentations of the Commission E conclusions. There were some differ-ences; e.g., Blumenthal's very careful book (identied as KOM in this book) states that hyssop isunapproved by Commission E, while Gruenwald, in the second edition of the PDR for Herbal Medicine , says hyssop is approved for colds, fevers, and gallbladder and liver complaints. In the title line, where I evaluate safety, I scored hyssop with three pluses (+++), meaning that I think itis safer than coffee as an herbal medicine. As to efcacy, I had decided to let Commission E endorsement rank 2 in my Activities and Indications columns. This example of divergence between the published \"Commission E\" interpretations of hyssop (and there are more than ten English interpretations of Commission E now) is just oneof many that I encountered as I traversed most of these interpretations. It really raises a seriousquestion again that I raised for myself back in the early 1980s as I was working on my Medicinal Plants of China . Clearly, I was capable of working only with the English translations of Chinese books on medicinal plants, embellished by three trips to China. I assumed that by the time Ihad compiled most of the information from ve different books, there would be little newinformation as I traversed the sixth. But diminishing returns had not yet set in. There are a fewmajor discrepancies in recent translations of romance language, scientic German, as withCommission E. How many more can we expect in translations of ancient Chinese, Hindu, and Sanscrit writings that are thousands of years old? Small wonder we often encounter differences of opinion. One can only be thankful that these books have survived because they document millennia of empirical wisdom. The best of the herbal medicines have survived and the worst have beenmarginalized. That took thousands of years. You can almost say the same of pharmaceuticals:some have survived, while some of the worst have been marginalized or withdrawn. But noneof the pharmaceuticals have survived more than 200 years with us. But the ~140 herbsmentioned in the Bible have been with us 2000 years. A recent study showed that humanshave been active in the Biblical area for at least 1,700,000 years. So, the genes of some humanshave experienced many of the phytochemicals from Biblical plants for nearly 2 million years.More new synthetics hit the market each year, to your peril, but few new herbs surface in agiven year. Mankind does not want bad medicine. Man empirically selects the good and rejectsthe bad. I feel strongly that many of the herbs treated in this book are as good as the competingsynthetic pharmaceuticals, and almost always cost less, in dollars and in side effects. Untilthe better of these herbs have been clinically compared with the pharmaceuticals, neither yourphysician nor mine, nor you nor I, knows for sure which is best. Meanwhile, pharmaceuticalswill kill more than 100,000 Americans a year, as per JAMA , a propharmaceutical journal, while herbs will kill fewer than 100, as per the conservative Washington Post in an antiherb article (Gugliotta, March 19, 2000). On May 1, 2002, the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) suggested that adverse drug reactions may be the leading cause of death in the United States. FORMAT SYNONYM: In some cases I list one or more taxonomic synonyms often following the USDA Nomenclature database, curated by John Wiersema http://www.ars-grin.gov/npgs/tax/taxgenform.html. ACTIVITIES: Most of the published biological activities that crossed my desk are listed alphabetically, with each activity followed by the \"f\" or numerical score for efcacy, followed bythe citation for the source. INDICATIONS: Most published indications that crossed my desk are listed alphabetically, with each indication followed by the \"f\" or numerical score for efcacy, followed by thecitation for the source. It was with some trepidation that I converted more specic terms suchas arthritis to arthrosis, and bronchitis to bronchosis, but I think that was a more economical(space-wise) way of presenting the data. Classically, the sufx \"itis\" means inflammation, and\"osis\" means ailment of. Thus, arthritis is inflammation of the joint, and arthrosis is broader,meaning an ailment in the joint. Where some author just said \"for joint problems,\" that became\"arthrosis,\" but where they were more specic and said inflammation of the joint, it meansthe more specic \"arthritis.\" Toward the end we aggregated both under \"arthrosis.\" Manypeople will dislike that I converted all the more specic -itis entries to -osis, rather thansomewhat redundantly include both. DOSAGE: I have attempted in this edition to give the range of published dosage ranges I have encountered. With good editorial prodding, I have gone back to my sources to see if they speciedwhich plant part. In some cases my sources were not specic as to plant part. And sometimes onesource specied one part, another source identied another part. A few dosages were taken rightoff the bottles of herbs. If there are dangerous published dosages given under dangerous herbs, Ihave indicated with an \"X\" that it should not be taken except with a skilled practitioner on hand.None of the dosages originate with me (except for an occasional \"food farmacy\" comment,indicating that the herb is eaten as food); they are from the literature, as indicated by the usual setof abbreviations. Several do, however, represent dosages said to have been approved by CommissionE, especially those cited with the abbreviations KOM, PHR, and PH2. I suppose by appearing in an American Pharmaceutical Book, there is an indirect assumption that APA approves those APA data, but I am not sure they would give such approval. CONTRAINDICATIONS, INTERACTIONS, AND SIDE EFFECTS: The scores of AHP, PHR, and PH2 are cited followed by some of the reported perils of the herbs, indicated by theusual three-letter or abstract citations giving the source of the warning regarding the \"peril.\" EXTRACTS: More than 20 years ago, I started a phytochemical database that gives many of the published activities of the bioactive phytochemicals. I regret at that time I had no systematicapproach to scoring the activities of the extracts of the plants. That is what we usually take,rather than isolated phytochemicals. So, occasionally, too late, I have included some reports onactivities (and ED50's and LD50's where available) on various extracts of the plants. We haveat the last minute deleted the repetition of the extensive data found in my updated FNF phy-tochemical database, early versions of which were published in some of my previously publishedCRC books. Duke, J.A. Handbook of Phytochemical Constituents in GRAS Herbs and other Economic Plants. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1992. Duke, J.A. Handbook of Biologically Active Phytochemicals and Their Activities. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1992. Beckstrom-Sternberg, S. and Duke, J.A. Handbook Phytochem- and Biological Activities . CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1996. Where I found no signicant information for any one format section, the headings were deleted, therefore, many entries will have only e.g., Activities and Indications. Readers who wish to know more about the individual phytochemicals occurring in a given herb can nd many useful queries answerable on my USDA database: www.ars-grin.gov/duke. In one particularly useful query for a person trying to rationalize the utility of an herb, one can secure a list of all the phytochemicals reported from the plant, with or without the list of all theirreported activities, even calling out a primary or secondary reference for each data bit. Printouts ofsuch queries on the better-studied plants are often dozens of pages long, and impractical to publishin this edition. It becomes increasingly clear that there are hundreds of biologically active compounds,often additive or synergistic, in all our plants, foods, spices, herbs; medicinal and poisonous plantsalike. The genes directing the thousands of chemicals in our own body have coevolved with all ormany of the phytochemicals in most of the edible plants that our ancestors chose to eat and themedicinal plants with which they treated themselves. My genes have probably known thousands ofphytochemicals now extant in the Rift Valley (where anthropologists speculate that humans evolvedsome 6 million years ago), and still extant in my American herbs. I feel that homeostatic mechanismshave evolved for these long-known phytochemicals, enabling the body to grab a needed chemical inwhich the body is temporarily decient and, conversely, excluding perhaps as \"expensive\" urine, thosephytochemicals in which the body is not decient. Yes, I even agree with \"supplement-bashers,\" whocharge that excess vitamins are often excreted, unused, in the \"expensive\" urine. I am inclined todisagree if the basher suggests that most of us are not decient in one vitamin or another. I think themajority of, if not all, Americans are decient in one or more vitamins that occur in dietary plantsources. Only within the last decade did we nally realize that choline was essential. I think moresuch knowledge will surface in the decades ahead. And we will learn that such common and usefulphytochemicals as oleanolic acid, procyanidins, quercetin, resveratrol, and sitosterol are often neededby the body and, like vitamins, kept within bounds by homeostatic mechanisms. When you offer yourbody an herbal menu of hundreds of useful synergistic phytochemicals, your body may select thoseit needs most, rejecting the ones least needed or not needed at all. When you offer the body an isolatedphytochemical or synthetic pharmaceutical \"silver bullet,\" you are excluding all those hundreds ofother useful phytochemicals in the edible and medicinal herbs. Your body knows better than yourpharmacist or physician or phytotherapist or shaman, which chemicals it needs. And your evolutionary diet will often provide chemicals in which you may be temporarily decient. Your evolutionary diet included a wide variety of plant materials that are no longer generally consumed. And your body, ifnot your brain, will recognize a positive benet therefrom. The safer herbs will prevail, in spite ofmounting published efforts to make them seem more dangerous than the pharmaceuticals. Herbs, onaverage, are much cheaper and safer than pharmaceuticals, and often as efcacious. ILLUSTRATIONS: Mrs. Peggy Duke, my most vociferous critic, has generously rounded up nearly 250 black-and-white illustrations and several color plates bearing her copyright. This is asubstantial improvement over the rst edition. Peggy's black-and-white illustrations are locatedwith the herb under discussion. Thanks to the benevolence of Natures Herbs, A Twinlab Division,we are able to include ~150 color plates of most of the popularly marketed herbs in the U.S. Wegive special thanks to Grace Lyn Rich and Steve Welling for making this possible. I hope the second edition of the Handbook of Medicinal Herbs will help patients and physicians alike to use the safer herbs even more safely and wisely, and help steer them to the safer herbalalternatives and away from some of the more dangerous pharmaceutical alternatives. James A. Duke Acknowledgments Although this second edition is clearly the work of many people, I use I in the introduction, and acknowledgment and often in the text. There is no shorter, less ambiguous word in the world than the word \"I.\" I could have said \"the author\" or \"the authors\" instead of \"I\" or \"we\" and reallyintroduced ambiguities, but my coauthors don't share all my views, so the buck stops here. Iacknowledge with deep gratitude and with apologies, my coauthors: Mary Jo Bogenschutz-Godwin,who has worked with me more than a decade, rewriting from my terrible sows-ear drafts to producethe proverbial silk purse; Judi duCellier, who has worked with me 25 years and survived theevolution of my creeping dyslexia; Peggy-Ann Kessler Duke, friend for nearly 50 years and wifefor more than 40; botanical illustrator par excellence, whose more than 300 illustrations are worthmore than my 300,000 words; and to CRC Press publisher, Barbara Norwitz, who for more than5 years has seen me slip and slide in and out of proposed contracts to do this second edition. Tothese praiseworthy women accrue all the compliments for this massive volume. The errors are mine. All science books are built on what has gone before, hopefully seizing the best and discarding the worst. It's not plagiarism if one cites one's sources. I am deeply indebted to all those scienticwriters with and before me, who have written about phytochemicals and phytopharmacy; and toour ancestors before them, who sampled the plants around them, and learned which were edible,medicinal, and poisonous, and who lived to talk about it. Also let me acknowledge you, my readers, for struggling with this, my most ponderous, yet I hope most useful, book. If you like it and nd any errors, let me know. I hope to keepit updated on my computer at home. Then maybe Barbara and CRC Press, maybe even you,will be ready for a third edition. New scientic data are pouring in, hopefully proving meright, that herbal phytochemicals are cheaper and safer, on average, and often as efcacious,as competitive pharmaceuticals. James A. Duke The Author James A. \"Jim\" Duke, Ph.D., is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of North Carolina, where he received his Ph.D. in Botany. He then moved on to postdoctoral activities at Washington University and the Missouri Botanical Gardens in St. Louis, Missouri, where he assumed professorand curator duties, respectively. He retired from the United States Department of Agriculture(USDA) in 1995 after a 35-year career there and elsewhere as an economic botanist. After retiring,he was appointed Senior Scientic Consultant to Nature's Herbs (A Twin Labs subsidiary), and to an online company, ALLHERB.COM. He currently teaches a master's degree course in botanicalhealing at the Tai Sophia Institute in Columbia, Maryland. Dr. Duke spends time exploring the ecology and culture of the Amazonian Rain Forest and sits on the board of directors and advisory councils of numerous organizations involved in plantmedicine and the rainforest. He is updating several of his published books and rening his onlinedatabase, http://www.ars-grin.gov/duke/, still maintained at the USDA. He is also expanding hisprivate educational Green Farmacy Garden at his residence in Fulton, Maryland. Abbreviations Full reference citations are listed in the References section. Many of our primary reference citations follow the consistent system (abbreviation, volume, page) format developed in my CRC Handbook of Biological Activities. These are more meaningful to us, the compilers, than the PMID abstract number (e.g., EB, or JE, or PR followed by a number then a colon then another number, alwaysmeans Economic Botany, Journal of Ethnopharmacology, or Journal of Phytotherapy Research, respectively, followed by the volume number:page number). The major references in this edition are indicated by concise and consistent three-letter abbre- viations. The short explanation in the alphabetical sequence for the often-used three-letter abbre-viations for our major references appear in the Reference Abbreviations section. Many primarysources are often cited via the PMID index, which is indicated by an X, followed directly by thePubMed serial number.

Commission E and other sources report interaction of anthranoid laxatives (AEH). Anthranoid-containing laxatives can be habit-forming. Some genotoxic, that abusers of anthranoid laxatives have three times higher rate of coloncarcinoma. One woman developed clubbing of her digits and hypertropic osteoarthropathy Handbook of Medicinal Herbs 9 Aafter taking at least three tablets daily for 3 years for weight loss. She also experienced several months of secondary amenorrhea. Of senna leaf, Blumenthal et al. lists abdominal pain ofunknown origin, acute intestinal inflammation (e.g., Crohn's disease and colitis ulcerosa), andappendicitis as contraindications. Because of the anthraquinones, nonstandardized preparationsshould be avoided during pregnancy and lactation (CAN). \"Anthraquinones may be secretedinto breast milk\" (CAN). Should not be used in lactation, pregnancy, or with children under12 years old (KOM). Occasional cramp-like discomfort of the GI tract may require dosagereduction (KOM). Side effects with chronic abuse: disturbance of electrolyte balance, espe-cially hypokalemia (may be exacerbated simultaneous administration corticoadrenalsteroids, licorice root, or thiazide diuretics), leading to cardiopathy, of cardiac glycosides, or diuretics (KOM). Pig-mentation of the intestinal mucosae (pseudomelanosis coli) is harmless and usually reverseson discontinuation of the drug. Laxative like this should not be used more than 1-2 weekswithout medical advice (KOM). CAN report anthraquinones are purgative and irritate GI tract.Also contraindicated in hemorrhoids and nephropathy (CAN), intestinal obstruction, abdominalpain of unknown causes, any enterosis (appendicitis, colitis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowelsyndrome) hemorrhoids, nephropathy, menstruation (AHP). Do not use more than 8-10 days(AHP). Do not use this in case of abdominal pain or diarrhea. Consult a health care providerprior to use in pregnancy or nursing. Discontinue use if diarrhea or watery stools occur. Notfor long term use (AHP). \"Some herbal laxative preparations, such as cascara and senna forexample, can cause an increase in the potency of digoxin\" (D'epiro, 1997). Pedersen (1998)cautions against taking the fresh leaf (we have done that in Peru with modest laxative results).\"Senna causes gripping unless taken in combination with carminative herbs such as ginger,cloves, or various mint species.\" Although GRAS, senna can be more habit-forming thancascara (PED). Lininger et al. (1998) pronounce it \"safe for children over the age of six\" (halfthe adult dose) (SKY). I'd be more cautious. Extracts (Alexandrian Senna) \u2014 Possibly representing a negative case for my synergy proposition, \"The toxicity of total extracts is greater than that of the individual sennosides. It has been proposed that the laxative and toxic components of senna could be separated\" (CAN).Elsewhere, I have read that the sennosides are synergetic as far as their laxative action isconcerned. But then anomalously, CAN report that sennosides A and B are reported to be mostpotent with respect to laxative action, but the least toxic compared to other anthraquinonefractions.

Systemic disturbances, raised serum urate levels are symp-toms that have been associated with alfalfa use in humans. Seeds should not be ingested duringpregnancy or lactation (CAN). May cause stomach upset and diarrhea. Believed by someherbalists to be helpful in delaying absorption of cholesterol and dissolving plaque deposits onarterial walls (TMA). Consumption of alfalfa tablets contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes was linked to a fatal case of listerosis. One case of allergic reaction (from contamination withgrass pollen) in alfalfa tablets has been reported (SF2). Flatulence, abdominal discomfort, loosestools, diarrhea, and loss of appetite may result from ingesting large amounts of alfalfa seeds(120 g/day). Extracts (Alfalfa) \u2014 Purines in seeds may raise serum urate levels (AEH). Porphyrins may photosensitize (PNC). Saponins decrease plasma cholesterol without changing HDL cholesterol, decrease intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increase excretion of neutral steroids and bile acids,and prevent atherosclerosis. Saponins hemolytic, may interfere with utilization. Rootsaponins, selectively antiyeast and fungicide, also hypocholesterolemic, in monkeys (CAN). \"Sapo-nin contents act on the cardiovascular, nervous and digestive systems\" Alfalfa (COX). Forty g heat-treated alfalfa seed, 3 \u00d7/day/8 weeks, helped normalize serum cholesterol concentrations in Type 2 hyperlipoproteinanemia.

The gel is used folklorically, and the dried inner leaf juice pharmaceutically as a laxative. There is much confusion resulting from different interpretations by botanists, chemists, collectors,herbalists, pharmaceuticists, physicians, and taxonomists. I don't know the herbalist or taxon-omist who can identify aloe to species by its latex or leaves alone. Here, I have tried to sortout what I think was intended by the authors, mostly also compilers like myself, interpretingthe studies of others. Potter's New Cyclopedia tried to straighten things out by calling the gel \"aloe vera\" and the purgative powder \"aloes.\" Fleming (1998) aggregates it all inextricably,dried and fresh leaf juice, whole leaves, and the gel (PHR, PH2). It's even botched in the Bible,according to Biblical scholars. Aloe in the Old Testament is said to be Aquilaria, while that of the New Testament is said to be our Aloe vera.

Anthraquinones may be purgative and GI tract irritant (CAN). Commission E reports contraindications, adverse effects, and interac-tions of anthranoid laxatives (AEH). Because of its laxative and reputed abortifacient actions,its use in pregnancy and lactation is to be avoided. However, they suggest that topical, but notoral, application may be okay in pregnancy and lactation (CAN). The latex can be a drastic laxative. Contraindicated for pregnant women and children (LRNP). Do not use internally in pregnancy (WAM). Do not use with undiagnosed abdominal pain (WAM). Do not use internallyfor more than 10 days (WAM). Epidemiological studies in Germany reveal that abusers ofanthranoid laxatives have three times higher rate of colon carcinoma (AEH:115). May causeallergic dermatosis.

But no, PH2 went (not to mention the German, Preiselbeere).DEM goes with lingonberry and mountain cranberry. Even two of the alternatives offered byPH2 were not listed by USDA (e.g., alpine cranberry and whortleberry). Thank and Side Effects (Alpine Cranberry) \u2014 Contraindicated in pregnancy, nursing, and in children under 12 years of age. Since the urinary antisepsis depends on an alkaline environment, acidifying herbs should be avoided (PH2). At 5 g/kg orl cat, theleaves cause the same intoxication as a toxic dose of hydroquinone (HH2). Liver damage couldoccur with long-term use or overdose, due to possible hepatotoxicity of the hydroquinonesreleased. Hydroquinone intoxication, apparently roughly dose dependent, may occur with manyEricaceae, proportionate to their hydroquinone content. Without comparative analysis, we mayeven add the warning to other blueberries, cranberries, and bearberries. Handbook of Medicinal Herbs 19 AExtracts (Alpine Cranberry) \u2014 Should we be pleased or disenchanted that three flavonoids in this species increases cyclooxygenase activity? Anthocyanins and polyphenols in berries of several Ribes, Rubus, and Vaccinium species have in vitro antiradical activity on chemically generated superoxide radicals. The extracts also inhibit xanthine oxidase. All crude extracts were highly activetoward chemically generated superoxide radicals. Ribes nigrum extracts exhibited most activity, being the richest in both anthocyanins and polyphenols. But Ribes rubrum extracts seem RAGWORT ( Senecio nemorensis L.)

Contraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Apricot) \u2014 Class 3 (AHP). Also known as bitter almond. One of the products apricot seed components break down into in the human body is highly toxic prussic acid. Fifty to 60 kernels of apricot seed can kill adults; 7-10 canbe fatal in children. My CRC handbook says that a \"double kernel is said to be enough to killa man\" (CRC). I think that is overkill. Headache and nausea occurred in some patients beingtreated for chronic bronchosis with a paste of apricot seed and sugar. Possible adverse interactionwhen taken with Astragalus , skullcap, or contact dermatosis. Cyanogenetic glycosides in the seed can cause cyanide poisoning (CAN). Becauseof cyanide toxicity, apricots use in pregnancy and lactation is to be avoided. Avoid in pregnancy;ingestion of cyanogenic substances may be teratogenic. Oral doses of 50 mg HCN (+~ 30 gkernels = 50-60 kernels with ca 2000 HCN). More than 20 deaths have been reportedfrom laetrile and apricot kernel ingestion (CAN). Symptoms of acute intoxication includeconvulsions, dizziness, drowsiness, dyspnea, headache, hypotension, nausea, paralysis, coma,and then death. Death may occur from 1 to 15 minutes after ingestion. Antidotes for cyanidepoisoning include aminophenol, cobalt edetate, hydroxocobalamin, nitrite, and thiosulphate.Symptoms of chronic intoxication HCN, drugs such as laetrile)include goiter, hypertonia, increased blood thiocyanate, lesions ofthe optic nerve, mental retardation, and thyroid cancer. Demyelinating lesions and other neu-romyopathies may occur secondary to chronic cyanide exposure, including long-term laetriletherapy. Agranulocytosis has also been attributed to long-term laetrile therapy. Laetrile, spelledwith capital L, signies a synthetic patented in 1961 but never sold in the U.S. Spelled with asmall l, laetrile is, for lay purposes, synonymous with amygdalin. After making this distinction,APA spells it with small l, except of course, at the beginning of a sentence, when they say,\"Laetrile consists of 6 percent cyanide (prussic or hydrocyanic acid), a highly poisonoussubstance that can kill by depriving the brain of oxygen.\" Then they unleash a hyperbolic error,I presume, \"the laetrile content of apricot pits varies from as much as 8 percent in some apricotvarieties to twenty times that amount in wild varieties.\" Krebs marketed laetrile with a small las vitamin B-17 (AHA). Clinical (Apricot) \u2014 A retrospective analysis of laetrile in patients with cancer showed slight activity. A subsequent clinical trial concluded that laetrile was ineffective in cancer treatment. Claims for laetrile were based on three different theories: (1) Claimed that cancerous cells contained copious beta-glucosidases, which release HCN from laetrile via hydrolysis. Normal36 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs Acells were reportedly unaffected because they contained low concentrations of beta-glucosidases and high concentrations of rhodanese, which converts HCN to the less toxic thiocyanate. Later,however, it was shown that both cancerous and normal cells contain only trace amounts of beta-glucosidases, and similar amounts of rhodanese. Also, it was thought that amygdalin was notabsorbed intact from the gastrointestinal tract (CAN); (2) Proposed that after ingestion, amygdalinwas hydrolyzed to mandelonitrile, transported intact to the liver and converted to a beta-glucu-ronide complex, which was then carried to the cancerous cells, hydrolyzed by beta-glucuronidasesto release mandelonitrile, and then HCN. This was believed an untenable theory; (3) Calledlaetrile vitamin B-17, and with that, cancer is a result of B-17-deciency. It postulated thatchronic administration of laetrile would prevent cancer. No evidence was adduced to substantiatethis hypothesis. Furthermore, it was even claimed that patients taking laetrile reduced their lifeexpectancy, both through of lack of proper medical care and chronic cyanide poisoning. In orderto reduce potential risks to the general public, amygdalin was made a prescription-only medicinein (GMH). Contraindications, Interactions, Effects (Araroba) \u2014 Not in KOM.

Oral administration appeared to cause nausea, emesis, diarrhea,renal irritation, and nephrosis in unanesthetized dogs. Canadians do not allow berberine contain-ing bark, even in alcoholic beverages. Commission E reports no risks are known for the fruit,but other parts contain the alkaloid berberine (AEH). One source says high doses are dangerous,but Commission E says that berberine at 500 mg (equiv. to >8 g root bark with 6.1% alkaloid)is well tolerated (KOM). But high dosages (of berberine) may generate serious dyspnea andspasms, ending in lethal primary paralysis of the respiratory system (25 mg/kg in cats and dogs).Such doses may also cause hemorrhagic nephrosis (KOM). Death from berberine has beenreported (MAB). I suspect the herbal PDR erred in saying of the root bark, \"Dosages over 4 mgwill bring about light stupor, nosebleeds, vomiting, diarrhea, and kidney irritation.\" It also said,\"No health hazards or side effects are known in conjunction with the proper administration ofdesignated therapeutic dosages\" (PH2), and gave 2 g as root bark dosage (Gruenwald, 2000).Though no toxicity problems have been observed so far, avoid preparations during pregnancydue to uterotonic activity (PNC).

Onegram of the cytotoxic hydroquinone, equivalent to 6-20 g plant material, totally extracted (Ipresume) has caused collapse, convulsions, cyanosis, delirium, nausea, shortness of breath, tinnitus,and vomiting. Five grams has proved fatal. Because of high tannin content, prolonged use of uva-ursi may cause chronic liver impairment. Since large doses are reportedly oxytocic, and in viewof hydroquinone's toxicity, \"the use of uva-ursi during pregnancy and lactation is best avoided,\"but in the last paragraph on page 259, the hydroquinone concentrations \"provided by ingestion oftherapeutic doses of uva-ursi are not thought to represent a risk to human health\" (CAN). Extracts (Bearberry) \u2014 Aqueous and methanol extracts molluscicidal at 50 ppm. Antiseptic (bactericidal) activity of arbutin, at least on urinary-tract bacteria, depends on beta-glucosidase activity of the microbe, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Streptococcus being highest, Bacillus, Mycobacterium, Shigella, and Staphylococcus apparently intermediate, with Escherichia being lowest. Arbutin is absorbed from the GI tract virtually unchanged. During renal excretion, it ishydrolyzed to the active principle, hydroquinone, astringent actionon the urinary mucous membranes. The crude extract is reportedly more effective than isolatedarbutin, due to other chemicals that may also yield hydroquinone. Gallic acid in the crude extractmay prevent beta-glucosidase cleavage of arbutin in the GI tract before absorption, therebydelivering more hydroquinone in renal excretion (CAN).

I got a challenging letter from German partieswith an economic interest in cohosh, asking where I got the cautionary remarks from in my 1985CRC book. They must really be irritated by what follows: Commission E reports occasional gastriccomplaints. Not to be used for more than 6 months (AEH). With prolonged use, may irritate theuterus, cause dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headaches, joint pains, andlowered heart rate. Can contribute to abnormal blood clotting and liver problems. Can encouragebreast tumors. Should not be used by anyone with any type of heart disease or by anyone advisednot to take oral contraceptives. \"Women taking estrogen therapy should consult a physician beforeusing black cohosh\" (SKY). Can cause premature labor. Because of insufcient data, use duringpregnancy and lactation is not advised. Should be used only under medical supervision (TMA,1996). High doses may cause diaphoresis, dizziness, nausea, reduced pulse rate, visual disturbances,and vomiting (CAN). Because of uterine estrogen receptor binding in vitro , its use in pregnancy and lactation is to be avoided. What they say about black cohosh should be templated and said forevery herb, \"It has been recommended that black cohosh should only be used in therapeutic doses,and that high doses are potentially dangerous\" (CAN). \"Canadian regulations do not allow blackcohosh as a non-medicinal ingredient for oral use products\" (Michols, 1995). Pedersen is not muchkinder, \"Such constituents as tannins, gallic acid, and pseudotannins, including isoferulic acid, andthe salicylates, are irritants to the skin, lungs, and kidneys. The drastic action of the irritant principlesin black cohosh are not lethal, but overdoses are characterized by nausea and headache\" (PED).Schulz et al. (1998) are nicer to this herb, sold in Germany and America, than the Anglos quotedabove. In ve studies using doses equivalent to 40 mg/day crude herb, there are no case reports oftoxic effects from the herb, and there appears to be no specic toxicity associated with any of itsknown constituents. Two of the ve showed mild side effects (dizziness, GI distress, headache, andweight gain). No other contraindications are known. The duration of use should not exceed 3 months (SHT). Cohosh extract augmented the activity of tamoxiphen (MAB). Finally, let me quote Gruen- wald, editor-in-chief of the Herbal PDR, and coincidentally, also editor of the ABC Commission88 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs BE translation, because the two versions differ. \"No health hazards or side effects are known in conjunction with the proper administration of designated therapeutic dosages. An intake of veryhigh dosages of the drug (5 g) or an extract (12 g) leads to vomiting, headache, dizziness, limbpain, and lowered blood pressure.\" He's sanitizing or whitewashing if not ignoring the mild sideeffects reported in two of the ve German studies cited above. He refers to the gastric side effectsas adverse effects as distinct from side effects. I detect a whitewash of the cohosh, perhaps welldeserved and scientically accurate. Stay tuned.

More than 10 g cajuput oil mayinduce life-threatening intoxication, due to cineole, with circulatory and respiratory disorders,hypotension, and possible collapse (PH2). Topical and vaginal irritation have been reported fromsimilar oils from other species of Melaleuca, but the topical use of the oil has not generally been associated with toxicity. Still, the topical use cannot be recommended at this time (LRNP, January1991). As with most EOs, this one may induce dermatosis in sensitive individuals.

Many writers do not distinguish between black, brown (Indian), and white mustard ( Brassica nigra, Brassica juncea, and Sinapis alba, respectively), but the spice and medicine trade seems to favor the white. And the canola and rapeseed varieties have been hopelessly manipulated,even in the GMO eld. Few if any taxonomists and agronomists can distinguish all Brassica varieties and species, and probably fewer chemists, herbalists, pharmacists, and physicians canbe sure of the variety or species. My entries can be no more reliable than their sources. Seemsas though the plant group might better be treated generically than specically or varietally.Canola is here dened as Brassica napus but Gruenwald et al. (2000) do not index canola, calling Brassica napus merely the Oilseed Rape. Would that it were that simple. The USDA nomenclature database lists canola as three different taxa, B. napus var. rapa subsp. oleifera. I suspect that the chemical and biological activities are more or less interchangeable.

Commission E reports contraindications: damaged skin, hyper- sensitivity; adverse effects: irritant properties, rarely allergic reactions. Not to be used for morethan 2 days, with 14-day lapse before reapplying (this is not often followed in this country) (AEH).The Herbal PDR suggests the same. Not for children under 2 years (WAM). CAN reports capsai-cinoids to be irritant, \"The toxicity of the capsaicinoids has reportedly not been ascribed to anyone specic action but may be due to their causing respiratory failure, bradycardia, and hypoten-sion.\" Chronic administration of capsicum extract (0.5 \u00b5g capsaicin/kg body weight; that would be 50 \u00b5g (micrograms) for this 100-kilo rat) to hamsters has been reported toxic (CAN). The oral LD50 in rats is 190 mg/kg (CAN). The oral LD50 97-294 in mice is such that led TAD to calculatethat for me, a 220-lb (100 kg) rat, I'd need to ingest some 135 to 415 ounces of hot pepper. Noway (TAD). Capsicum may interfere with blood pressure medicines and MAOIs (CAN).

Interesting.Spicy, but good. Sure beats taking my less-spicy herb (or synthetics for those more unfortunatethan I). Digestive properties of capsaicin may be attributed to an enhancement of digestive enzymeactivities or to indirect effects on vascular endothelia, smooth muscles, and mast cells, resulting inincrease of vascular permeability and of mucosal blood flow. Antigens have been associated withanaphylaxis and rhinoconjunctivitis (PH2). Hot spices can promote antigen transfer through epi-thelia and thereby augment sensitization or allergic reactions. Unfortunately, it may also speed uphepatic metabolism of many drugs, effectively rendering them weaker. Many of my correspondentsnd the capsaicin cure worse than their aching ailment. Fleming et al. (1998) have some heavyduty toxicity info: toxic dosages, possibly leading to life-threatening hypothermia by affecting thethermoreceptors. Excessive consumption may cause gastroenterosis, hepatic or renal damage(CAN), or ulcers (SKY). Prolonged consumption of high doses can cause chronic gastrosis, kidneyand liver damage, and neurotoxicity (PHR). Prolonged exposure may deaden the sensitivity to anypain (PED). \"Prolonged exposure to mucosa will make the mucosa insensitive to industrial pollu-tion\" (PED).

COFFEE ( Coffea CDosages (Coffee) \u2014 9 g crude coffee charcoal/day; the single dose averaging 3 g (KOM) (I suspect that thoroughly carbonized charcoal is pretty well devoid of methyl xanthines); 8 g powdered coffee/720 ml water (TRA); 100-200 mg caffeine or 1.5 cups coffee for bronchodilation (TRA);250-500 mg caffeine = 3 cups coffee for achlorhydria (TRA). Contraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Coffee) \u2014 Commission E reports interactions (but talking more about carbonized coffee charcoal than instant or real coffee): absorption of other drugs (and minerals and vitamins) taken simultaneously might be reduced (AEH). Coffee has beenimplicated in loss of calcium and magnesium in bones, which bodes ominous for osteoporosiscandidates. It can also inhibit or interfere with iron absorption and help elevate cholesterol (JLR1(8):4.1995). Toxicologically harmless (up to 5 cups or 500 mg caffeine) for healthy adults habituated tocoffee (but hypertensive in neophytes taking 250 g coffee (1.25 cups), increasing systolic bloodpressure some 10 mm Hg). Gruenwald et al. cautions are not exactly the same echos I am used to.They advise caution for those with disposition to convulsions and certain psychic disorders (such aspanic anxiety), nephrosis, sensitive cardiovascular system, and thyroid hyperfunction. Side effectsattributed in part to chlorogenic acid may include diarrhea, hyperacidity, inappetence, and stomachirritation. Chronic consumption of >1500 mg/day diarrhea, dizziness, headache, inappe-tence, irritability, palpitations, restlessness, sleeplessness, and vomiting. Higher doses lead to arrhyth-mic spasms of different muscle groups, arrhythmic tachycardia, and opisthotonos. But not to worry!Fatal poisonings \"are not conceivable.\" They do reiterate the reported death of a child after ingesting5300 mg caffeine. Ironically, that coffee charcoal that Commission E promotes for mussy mucosamight be the best antidote, along with sorbitol, for overdoses of caffeine. Nursing mothers may passcaffeine-induced insomnia to the nursing baby. Pregnant women should avoid caffeine, never exceed-ing 300 mg caffeine spread out over the day (PHR). LD50 caffeine = 5-10 g orl human (TRA). Extracts (Coffee) \u2014 Not exactly an extract, the carbonized charcoal is described as absorbent and astringent, like most charcoals. I hope that physicians will understand what is said in the Herbal PDR, speaking of caffeine and not the charcoal, \"it also increases the psychomotor stamina\" (PHR).Chlorogenic acid, like caffeine can double gastric secretion (PHR).

Commission E reports contraindications: gastric effects: trouble sleeping, hyper- nervousness; CNS stimulant, GI irritant. Contraindicated in high blood pressure,and gastric and duodenal ulcers. Not recommended for excessive or prolonged use (they seem tosay this about most caffeine-containing plants) (AHP). CAN cautions that xanthine-containingbeverages may cause anxiety, insomnia, palpitations, tremors, and withdrawal headaches. Becauseof the caffeine, consumption should be restricted in pregnancy and lactation, and in patients withhypertension and cardiac problems. \"As with all xanthine containing beverages, excessive con-sumption by lactating mothers should be avoided\" (CAN). Cola-containing beverages are said to\"provide active doses of caffeine\" (CAN). Caffeine has many reported activities, many perhapsshared synergistically with theophylline (1:1) (KEB).Contraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Coleus) \u2014 Not covered (AHP; KOM; PHR). I think of this as a food farmaceutical containing a powerful drug with many activities. But as Albert Leung so often and skillfully reminds us, the plant does not necessarily share the activitiesof its best known chemical constituent (present in tubers at levels ca. 0.45%). Contraindicated inhypotension. calcitoninin inhibiting osteoclastic activity. Acts synergistically with hawthorn, which probably inhibitsphosphodiesterase, which breaks down cAMP. Combining coleus and hawthorn should raise cAMPlevels by stimulating production and inhibiting decomposition of cAMP. Responses to forskolinare reduced in muscle cells of failing hearts, but since forskolin also raises cAMP, it renders thecoleus possibly useful even here. COLOCYNTH, BITTER APPLE, WILD doses no longer defensible Contraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Colocynth) \u2014 The purgative action is so drastic as to have caused fatalities. One woman who took 120 g to induce abortion died in 50 hours.

Leaf is permitted for oral use.Contraindications in pregnancy and lactation. CAN cautions that the PAs are genotoxic,carcinogenic, and hepatotoxic. Because of the PAs, coltsfoot use in pregnancy and lactationis to be avoided (CAN). Dosage maximum 10 g PA/day (herbal tea) or maximum 1 g PA/day(extracts, expressed sap) for maximum 4-6 weeks/year (AEH). Commission E advises not totake more than 4 to 6 weeks of the year at 4.5 to 6 g/day. This is the only herb (1.5-6 gleaf/day) except related Petasites with toxic PAs still tolerated by Commission E. Still, CANcautions that coltsfoot is phototoxic in guinea pig skin. In guinea pig sensitization experiments,it showed weak allergenic capacity, possibly due to the sesquiterpene lactones present in theplant. PAs are toxic to humans, with liver damage with cirrhosis and ascites, or seneciosis, orveno-occlusive disease (VOD) reported in almost all cases of severe or fatal intoxications,from intakes of 0.5 mg/kg to 3.3 mg/kg (AEH1). Effective July 1996, the AHP Board ofTrustees recommends that all products with botanical ingredient(s) that contain toxic PAs,including Borago ofcinalis, display the following cautionary statement on the label, \"For external use only. Do not apply to broken or abraded skin. Do not use when nursing\" (AHP).Canadians do not allow in food (Blackburn, 1993). Bisset says there is no danger of acutepoisoning when used as prescribed (Bisset, 1994). Hepatotoxicity of coltsfoot may be due tosenkirkine (~150 ppm), highlighting the dangers of chronic exposure to even low doses ofPAs. Rats fed more than 4% coltsfoot in their diet develop hepatic tumors. Newborn rats aremore susceptible than weanlings to hepatotoxicity of senkirkine despite lacking the hepaticmicrosomal enzymes required to produce the toxic pyrrholic metabolites. Fatal hepatic veno-occlusive disease was documented in a newborn infant whose mother chronically consumedherb teas during pregnancy (coltsfoot and senecio specied). The mother exhibited no signsof hepatic damage again suggesting increased sensitivity of the fetal liver to PA toxicity.Animal studies document placental transfer and secretion into breast milk of unsaturated PAs(CAN).

According to studies reported in the Lawrence Review of Natural Products, rats fed comfrey roots or leaves for 600 days developed hepatocellular adenomas, with signs of liver toxicity developing within 180days. Urinary bladder tumors developed also, even in those on the lowest levels of comfrey.The incidence of liver tumors was higher with dietary roots than with dietary comfrey leaves.Alkaloids of Russian comfrey caused chronic liver damage and pancreatic islet cell tumorsafter 2 years administration in animal models ( LRNP , October 1990).

CAN cautions that pulegone in the volatile oil can be irritant, hepatotoxic, and nephrotoxic.Symptoms following EO ingestion include abdominal pain, agitation, diarrhea, high blood pressure,lethargy, nausea, pyrexia, and generalized urticaria. Abortifacient doses are hepatotoxic and neph-rotoxic. Because of pulegone's abortifacient activity, its use in pregnancy and lactation is to beavoided. \"Both the internal and external use of pennyroyal oil has been contraindicated\" (CAN). 284 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs EDeath reported following ingestion of 15 ml (ca. 1/2 oz) EO, after 2-week consumption of alcoholic extract (with pulegone metabolites in the liver) (AHP). Playing it safe, I like to remind everyone that pregnant women are advised against taking (any medicine) this herb or others because theherbs reportedly have some abortifacient properties. Further, pulegone, the active compound, isreportedly absorbed through the skin and may be carcinogenic (I think the warning is overratedbut would prefer to err on the side of caution). But many of our generally recommended as safemints also contain pulegone. Delaneyites (a group of adherents of the Delaney Cause, that anythingcontaining a carcinogen is a carcinogen) might outlaw peppermint, one of our best medicinal herbs.The Lawrence Review certainly puts pulegone at doubt. Pulegone is oxidized by hepatic cytochromeP-450 to the hepatotoxic compound, menthofuran. Pulegone or a metabolite is also responsible forneurotoxicity and destruction of bronchiolar epithelial cells. It extensively depletes glutathione inthe liver. Hepatic toxicity from overdoses has been prevented with acetylcysteine administeredpromptly. Rats at 80 to 160 mg/kg/day develop encephalopathies. Not to be toyed with. Pennyroyaloil is toxic and potentially fatal if ingested.

Contraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Evening Primrose) \u2014 Class 1 (AHP). The literature looks reasonably clean. I've heard from two separate personal cases of women takingit satisfactorily for PMS, that it caused migraine-like headaches which they did not experiencebefore taking EPO. Anecdotal but credible. As one source of tryptophan, which may convert tocerebral serotonin, it can alter brain levels of serotonin, which is involved in some migrainecases. Colic, headache, and nausea may occur in a small percentage of subjects. CAN reportspatients with schizophrenia on phenothiazines may experience mild dyspepsia and/or increasedrisk of epilepsy. They rather give it a green light for breastfeeding mothers, since both linoleicacid and gamma-linolenic acid are normally in breast milk (CAN). The conservative Miller andMurray (1998) book says, \"No adverse effects of EPO have been reported. Chronic toxicity andcarcinogenicity studies of EPO in rats, mice, and dogs revealed no important adverse effects ortumor differences\" (MAM). The second edition of the Herbal PDR warns that EPO may possiblylower the seizure threshold in patients being treated with drugs that lower the seizure thresholdin schizophrenia. One of the better sources of gamma-linolenic acid, often known as GLA (andto some British as gamolenic acid), and tryptophan (FNF). Two large clinical trials with EPOmatch clinical relief from cyclical breast pain with bromocriptine and danazol (side effects inca. 33%) but with virtually no EPO side effects.

Allergic reactions of contact dermatosis and severeasthmatic attacks (from inhalation of garlic powder). Topical application of garlic or garlic oilmay cause local irritating effects. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur following ingestionof fresh garlic bulbs, extracts, or oil (AEH1). Fresh garlic is reportedly dangerous to children(AHP). Use sparingly with children under 2 years; may irritate mouth or stomach if used tooliberally (WAM). Then there is Miller and Murray's extremely cautious, but not critical review(MAM). Though possibly \"useful for mild hypertension ... routine use is not recommended.\"After informing us that no drug-drug interactions have been reported for garlic, they provide along list of potential drug-drug interactions. Hasty readers, especially MDs, will take this asproven drug-garlic interactions, \"Avoid concomitant use ... with NSAIDS, with garlic.\" (MAM) Watch also with by inhibition (e.g., propranolol, diazepam) (MAM). MAMtabulates allergic epidural hematoma, and vomiting as sideeffects of garlic (MAM). MAM even tries to attribute a case of spinal hematoma to garlic (inan 87-year-old man ingesting 2 g daily \"to prevent heart disease\"). Perhaps they are too eagerto accentuate the negative, attributing the problem \"to garlic's ability to inhibit normal plateletfunction.\" Still accentuating the negative MAM talk about rats given massive doses (50 mg/daygarlic powder) developing degenerative changes in 45 days and severe testicular lesions after70 days (MAM). The credibility of their uncritical data is questionable; for example, on page144, they talk about 0.75 mg garlic EO divided in three doses a day causing anorexia, nausea,severe vomiting, diarrhea, marked weight loss, metrorrhagia, and menorrhagia, yet on page 145they casually discuss a dosage more than three orders of magnitude higher for 20 days, loweringplatelet aggregation from 30.37% to 21.21% (MAM). At 3 \u00d7 300 mg/day coated garlic powder tablet, GI discomfort was the most frequent side effect; also bloating, dizziness, headache,hypotensive circulatory reactions, outbreaks of sweating; daily doses of 900-1200 mg wereassociated with garlic odor.

Contraindicated in childhood fevers and gallstones(WAM). Patients with gallstones should consult a practitioner before taking ginger (AHP). TheLawrence Review says overdoses may depression ( LRNP , Novem- ber 1991). Large doses (6 g or more) possibly gastroirritant, causing a signicant increase in exfoliationof gastric surface epithelial cells in human volunteers (MAB). Due to ginger's strong antiaggregantactivity, experts recommend it not be used by people with blood clotting disorders. Many chemother-apy patients experience periods when their blood platelet counts drop dramatically. Doctors will warnpatients to avoid aspirin when their platelet counts are low. They feel that patients should also avoidginger when their platelet count drops, while continuing use of ginger for patients with normal plateletcounts. Less conservatively, Commission E reports rhizome should not be used for vomiting inpregnancy (AEH). Lininger et al. (1998) adds heartburn as a rare side effect. \"A doctor should beinformed if ginger is used before surgery to counteract possible postanesthesia nausea\" (SKY). Extracts (Ginger) \u2014 Fresh ginger juice reduces serum glucose levels in experimental animals (PED). Both fresh and dry rhizome suppress gastric contractions and reduce vomiting (PNC). Gingerols and shogaols are analgesic, antipyretic, proteolytic enzymes stimulatedigestion, helping combat the effects of overeating, improper chewing, or excessive motion. Theyincrease gastric motility and neutralize acids and toxins in the digestive tract (PED). Gingeroland 6-gingerol inhibit gastric ulceration in rats. I suspect there's synergy at work in the antiulcerphytochemicals in ginger. 6-Gingesulfonic acid is less pungent but more potent against ulcersthan 6-gingerol or 6-shogaol (MAB). Oral spray dried ginger or combinations gingerand licorice extracts (1000 mg/kg), signicantly prevented gastric mucosal damage induced byethanol in rats. Pretreatment with these inhibited the reduction in the deep corpus mucin contentcaused by ethanol (MAB). As a powerful thromboxane-synthetase inhibitor and prostacyclinagonist, ginger has potential as an antidepressant, in alcohol withdrawal and the complicationsof liver damage, and in treating a side effect of alcoholism, impotence, in preventing aging penilevascular changes. LD50 ginger oil = >5000 mg/kg orl rat (MAB), LDlo ginger extract = >2300mg/kg orl mouse, equivalent to 75,000 mg/kg ginger (MAB). Ginger extract equal to aspirin inantiedemic activity; 940 mg powdered ginger is more effective than 100 mg dimenhydrinate forkinetosis (motion sickness); ginger is equal to metoclopramide for postoperative nausea andvomiting (WHO). 8 Gingerol more potently inhibited the response to serotonin than the controldrug, cocaine (MAB). Gingerols are more potent at inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis thanindomethacin (MAB). Ginger extract inhibited swelling as actively as aspirin (MAB).

Though regarded by many as a poisonous plant, ginkgo, selling at $500 million a year in Europe,has not accumulated much data in the alarmists' journals. According to LRNP (February 1994) and SHT, mild adverse effects include allergic dermatosis (0.09%), anxiety (0.07%), diarrhea (0.14%),GI upset (0.14%), and nausea (0.34%). Schulz discounts the MAOIwarnings saying there are \"no known interactions with other drugs.\" In my CRC Handbook of Nuts, I don't discuss the leaves (extracts of which are sold as medicine). Fruits are allergenic (anddisgustingly malodorous) and too many of the edible seeds can cause serious problems, even death.The seed toxin 4-O-methylpyridoxine is reportedly responsible for the gin-nan food poisoning,with convulsions, loss of consciousness, even lethality in 27% of Japanese cases, especially infants.Ginkgolic acid may act like urushiol of poison ivy fame. Bilobin and topoison ivy's allergen ( LRNP , February 1988). German herb companies may be forced to document that their ginkgo products contain no more than 5 ppm ginkgolic acid. CAN cautions against gastric upset and headache (CAN). All that and Lininger et al. (1998) counter, \"essentially devoid of any side effects. Mild headaches lasting for a day or two have been reported ... There are no knowncontraindications to the use of GBE by pregnant and lactating women\" (SKY). Contraindicated forany person on coumadin or heparin; should not be taken by people with a clotting disorder, suchas hemophilia or von Willdebrand's Disease (O'Brien, gpg (MAB). the extract are disturbances ofcerebral function, peripheral vascular insufciency, and neurosensory problems (FNF). active, at 40 mg 3 \u00d7/day were antiasthmatic in the early and late phases of airway hyperactivity.

At 25-100 mg/kg/day/2 wk orl rat, the extracts strongly attenuatedsodium salicylate-induced tinnitus (FT69:195). Interpretations of Commission E approvals vary,Blumenthal et al. (1998) suggest 120-160 mg native dry extract in 2-3 doses for \"improvementof pain-free walking distance in peripheral arterial occlusive disease in Stage II of Fontaine(intermittent claudication) in a regimen of physical therapeutic measures, in particular walkingexercise\" and \"vertigo and tinnitus (ringing in the ear) of vascular and involutional origin,\" andthey suggest 120-240 mg native dry extract in doses for dementia syndromes with the followingsymptoms \"memory decits, disturbances in concentration, depressive emotional condition, dizzi-ness, tinnitus, headache and dementia syndromes, including primary degenerative dementia, vas-cular dementia.\" Gruenwald et al. (1998) stress the leaves only for intermittent claudication,symptomatic relief of organic brain dysfunction, tinnitus, and vertigo of vascular origin. Ginkgohas musculotropic action similar to papaverine (WHO). Patients with idiopathic hearing loss lessthan 11 days old were treated with ginkgo and a vasodilator naftidrofuryl. 40% were improved onboth drugs, but the synthetic had signicantly more side effects.

I still feel that much of the literature on ginseng andsoy comes from selective publications of sponsored research, making them look undeservedly betterthan carrot and black beans, for example.)

Contraindicated for high blood pressure (AHP). The ginseng monograph published in 1991 says \"none known\" regarding contraindications, drug interactions, or side effects (KOM). Contraindicated in acuteinfections, asthma, and high blood pressure (KEB). High doses may aggravate or cause decreasedsexual function, dysmenorrhea, euphoria, headaches, high blood pressure, insomnia, irritability,morning diarrhea, palpitations, skin eruptions, and tremors (KEB). The worst and most erroneousstudies of ginseng were reported in JAMA, which accepted no corrections from the herbal industry, trying to get the reports straight. \"Most commonly reported side effects of ginsengare nervousness and excitation, which usually diminish\" ( LRNP , September 1990). Foster (1996) reports GI distress, overstimulation, breast tenderness, dysmenorrhea. Though estrogenic sideeffects are reported in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women, \"clinical studies havedemonstrated that a standardized ginseng extract does not cause a change in male and femalehormonal status\" (WHO). Avoid if hypertensive or pregnant. Possible insomnia, mastalgia,vaginal bleeding, and insomnia. Contraindicated for patients with hyperkinesis, hysteria, mania,schizophrenia, or those who are nervous or tense. Not to be taken with stimulants, includingcoffee, antipsychotic drugs, or during treatment with hormones. Use cautiously in cardiopathy,diabetes, high blood pressure, hypotension, and with all steroid therapy. In Russia, it is evensuggested that healthy people under age 40 should not take ginseng, but that middle-aged people can take small doses on a regular basis (CAN). Because of hormonal activity, its use in pregnancy and lactation is to be avoided (CAN). Caution with insulin, warfarin, phenylzine, and loopHandbook of Medicinal Herbs 335 Gdiuretics (PH2). \"Three newborns were intoxicated after an intake of 0.3-0.6 g ginseng decoc- tion; one died\" (Oriental studies translated by AHP.). Blumenthal suggests it may potentiateMAOIs (MAB). Use should be restricted to 3 months (SHT). \"It has been found to increasecounts of total lymphocytes, T-Helper cells, and T4 and T8 subsets, and to improve NKCactivity.\" Positive as all this sounds, O'Brien cautions that headaches may result from chronicuse. Do not take with digitalis (O'Brien, 1998). Extracts (Ginseng) \u2014 Ginsenosides stimulate insulin release and increase insulin receptors to exert a hypoglycemic response\" (PH2). Root LD50 devotes more pages (pp.145-149) tothe pharmacological effects of ginseng than the other herbs they treat more cursorily, \"many of thepharmacological actions documented for ginseng directly oppose one another (hardly my usualsynergy (JAD)) and this has been attributed to the actions of the individual ginsenosides. Forexample, actions. These opposingactions are thought to explain the 'adaptogenic' reputation of ginseng, that is the ability to increasethe overall resistance of the body to stress and to balance bodily functions.\" PH2 states it evenmore narrowly, \"A single ginsenoside may initiate multiple or opposing actions in the same tissue\"(PH2). My speculation is even stronger. The homeostatic human body is able to selectively sequesterneeded compounds from the homeostatic plant and, to an extent, exclude the unneeded compounds.Thus the hypotensive human who coevolved with ginseng might selectively use the needed hyper-tensive ginsenoside, while the hypertensive human might adaptogenically sequester the hypotensiveginsenoside. Something for whatever ails you. Remember, this herb, like all herbs contains all thecompounds essential for plant life, and many of those essential for human life. Carrots are consid-erably cheaper.

One woman who consumed theequivalent of 65 g tea leaves/day for 5 years exhibited liver dysfunction. Ascites and splenom-egaly resolved after tea was discontinued (SHT). Pedersen, who does not cover conventionaltea, says that peppermint leaf contains much astringent tannin, which can damage the liverand intestine with prolonged use (Pedersen, 1998). Since the more widely used tea ( Camellia sinensis ) often contains twice as much tannin as peppermint, this recommendation should be doubly pertinent under tea, or maybe we should call these tannins by the more attractive names\"OPCs, polyphenols, and pycnogenols\" and declare them useful antioxidant good guys insteadof hepatotoxic bad guys (JAD). Regarding caffeine, \"Pregnant women should under no cir-cumstances exceed a dosage of 300 mg/day (5 cups of tea spread out over the course of aday). Infants whose nursing mothers consume beverage containing caffeine could suffer fromsleep disorders\" (APA). Extracts (Green or Black Tea) \u2014 Both the polphenols (OPCs, tannins) and xanthines (caffeine) have their good and bad sides. As a major source of the major COX-2 Inhibitor ([+]-catechin), this might be viewed by enthusiasts as another herbal miracle aspirin (COX). See FNF. Muroiand Kubo (1993) demonstrated synergies for antibacterial activity in compounds from tea ( Camel- lia sinensis ), \"... green tea extract is effective in the prevention of dental caries because of the antibacterial activity of flavor compounds together with the antiplaque activity of polyphenols....Synergism was found in the combination of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (delta-cadinene andbeta-caryophyllene) with 256-fold ... combination of 25 \u00b5g/mL delta-cadinene and 400 \u00b5g/mL indole reduced the number of viable (bacterial) cells at any stage of growth.\" Translation: The mixture (\"herbal shotgun\")of three bactericidal compounds that might help prevent plaque was more than 100 times morepotent than the isolated individual compounds (\"magic bullet\").

Animals grazing the plant are often intoxicated; symptoms include accelerated weak pulse, conjunctival hemor-rhage, difculty in breathing, dilation of the caecum, dizziness, elevated temperature, gastroen-terosis, and megalosplenia. Grazing horses have suffered fatalities, as have mice fed only on thisplant 3-4 days (PH2). CAN cautions that the pulegone in the volatile oil is an irritant to the GItract and kidneys. Because of the irritant oil, its use in nephrosis, pregnancy, and lactation is tobe avoided. Contraindicated, reportedly, in epilepsy, lactation, nephrosis, and pregnancy. In viewof the lack of toxicity data and the reported cytotoxic activity of ursolic acid, excessive use ofground ivy should be avoided (CAN). But, all plants contain cytotoxic compounds and many, ifnot most, contain ursolic acid (JAD). Pulegone is an irritant, hepatotoxic, and abortifacientprinciple. In view of the lack of toxicity data and the possible irritant and abortifacient actionof the volatile oil, the use of ground ivy during pregnancy and lactation should be avoided (PHR). Extracts (Ground Ivy) \u2014 Documented pharmacological activities support some of the herbal uses. Ethanol extracts are antiinflammatory and antiedemic; 2-alpha and 2-beta-hydroxyursolic acids protect mice from ulcers. Ursolic acid also demonstrates cytotoxic activity against lymphocyticleukemia, human lung carcinoma, and marginal activity against human colon and mammary tumors.356 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs GAstringent and antiinflammatory activity is attributed (CAN) to its rosmarinic activity (which deserves a whole lot more praise than those two minor activities).

Extracts (Guarana) \u2014 Caffeine's effects (and hence those of guaranine) are well known and include CNS stimulation, increasing metabolic rate, and mild diuresis (SKY). Guarana and caffeine apparently counteract scopolamine, improving rats' ability to remember.

Which one? Two came out in 1998, purporting to be authentic English presentations of the Commission E conclusions. Blumen-thal's very careful book (KOM in my HDR) approves only \"hawthorn leaf with flower\" (deninghawthorn as dried flowering twig tips of C. laevigata or C. monogyna , or other members of the genus) and only for \"decreasing cardiac output as described in functional Stage II of NYHA.\" Theother, edited by Joerg Gruenwald, also an editor of Blumenthal's Book, in his Herbal PDR (PHR)approves Crataegus species (not specifying either C. laevigata or C. monogyna ), \"white thorn flowers, leaves, fruit, and various mixtures of plant parts\" for the same indication. My interpretation;these two and a few other species of the huge and taxonomically difcult Crataegus genus which contains some 200-300 species. But then we had sequelae to these rst two volumes. In 2000,Blumenthal et al. (BGB) say that \"hawthorn refers to the fruit, leaf, and/or flower of the genusCrataegus (usually C. laevigata syn. C. oxyacantha ) and C. monogyna .\" That can be interpreted at least two ways, but I take it to mean both species. I refer those interested in the German gyrationsinvolved to the BGB. Conversely, Gruenwald in his Edition 2 (PH2) narrows his denition,mentioning only English hawthorn, which the Herbal PDR Edition 2 equate to Crataegus laevigata , with no discussion of the distinction between the species. I frankly doubt that the writers of theseGermanic gyrations can tell the difference between species of hawthorn, especially after they havebeen reduced to powders or tinctures. I doubt that Gruenwald, nor anyone else, can prove that theseresearches were done on C. laevigata . In citing my CRC Handbook (Duke, 1985), Gruenwald cites an entry that was referred to C. oxyacantha . But I too, in 1985, was no surer of Crataegus taxonomy than I am today, hence, they are combined. both Blumenthal et al.and Gruenwald et al. (1998) of Commission E are simple, and almost identical for a change, fordecreasing cardiac output as described in functional Stage II of NYHA. Nothing more, nothing less.

No known contraindications ... during pregnancy or lactation\" (SKY).\"Hazards and/or side effects not known for proper therapeutic dosages\" (PH2). Not for childrenunder 12 years old (PH2). CAN cautions that because of uterine activity, in vivo and in vitro , its use in pregnancy and lactation is to be avoided. Not for use during rst trimester of pregnancy(PH2). LRNP (January 1994), admitting that low doses are usually devoid of adverse effects, says that high doses may induce hypotension (that can be good in hypertension) and sedation (whichcan be good in insomnia). Side effects reported include fatigue, nausea, rash, and sweating (CAN).The tyramine content might suggest avoidance of MAOIs. High dose may be arrhythmogenic,hypotensive, sedative, tremorigenic, and vertigogenic drugs!

Extracts (Hawthorn) \u2014 Hawthorn extracts increase coronary flow, and reduce blood pressure and peripheral resistance. Hypotensive action attributed to vasodilation. Extracts, via OPCs, have beta- blocking activities, the more OPC, the more beta-blocking. Extracts administered to rabbits exhibitprophylactic antiarrhythmic activities. Flower extracts induce mild CNS-depressant activities; e.g.,increased antiperoxidant (CAN).The hawthorn's cardiotropic effect is caused by increased membrane permeability for calcium aswell as the inhibition of phosphodiesterase with an increase in intracellular cAMP concentrations.This leads to increased coronary and myocardial circulatory perfusion and reduced peripheralvascular resistance (PHR). Lininger et al. say that it \"may\" improve coronary artery blood flowand contractions of the heart muscle. It \"may\" inhibit ACE, and reduce production of angiotensinII (SKY). Japanese clinical trials of 80 patients given fruits and leaves show clinical improvementin cardiac function, dyspnea, and edema (PNC). German clinical studies of 60 patients with stableangina receiving 60 mg hawthorn 3 \u00d7/day showed increased coronary perfusion and economized myocardial oxygen consumption (CAN). Isolated constituents (mainly flavonoids) have LD50's of50-2600 mg/kg ivn, 6000 mg/kg orl in animals (CAN). Oral toxicity of hawthorn 6000 mg/kgorally (MAB).

Antibacterial activity has been documented for hops, humulone, and lupulone against Gram positive bacteria. The bitter acids exhibit antifungal activity against Candida, Fusarium, Hops and motility-depressant properties are attributed to 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol. Isovaleric acid may contribute to the sedativity. Hops report-edly contain several sedative, analgesic, anesthetic, and anodyne compounds as well. Piperidine,quercitrin, and ursolic acid may depress the CNS. Hops improve human sleep performance incombination with valerian and the hops are apparently effective in baths (I'd suggest in combi-nation with dilute lavender and lemonbalm). With uva ursi and alpha-tocopherol acetate, hopsgave excellent results for 772 of 915 patients with irritable bladder and urinary incontinence.Combined with the Biblical chicory and peppermint, hops documentably relieves pain in chroniccholecystosis (calculous and noncalculous).384 , but E. brevicornum, E. koreanum, E. sagittatum and up to 12 other species used interchangeably as yinyanghuo (AHP).

Strangely, APA gives theinternal usage their highest rating (1) and external usage less (3) (APA). Aesculin has caused contactdermatosis. The no-toxic-effect dose is ca. 8 times the recommended therapeutic dose. The resultsof animal studies are corroborated by decades of use in patients with no reports of harmful effectsdue to overdosing. Tests for chronic toxicity (34 weeks in rats and dogs) showed no cumulativetoxic effects or any evidence of embryotoxic or teratogenic effects. Isolated cases of GI distress,itch, and nausea are reported (SHT). Commission E reports rare GI disturbances (AEH). No con-traindications or drug-drug interactions reported (PIP). Isolated cases of renal and hepatic toxicityas well as anaphylactic reactions have been reported following intravenous administration, but theseappear to be exceptional (VET Herbs of Choice ). Fleming (Herbal PDR, 1998) cautions that the intake of too many horse chestnut seed (in one case, a child with 5 seed) can cause diarrhea, disordersof consciousness and vision, enlargement of the pupils, flushing of the face, severe thirst, andvomiting. In case of poisoning, Fleming recommends evacuation of the stomach and intestine (gastriclavage, sodium sulphate) and administration of activated charcoal. Then symptom management(PHR). Blumenthal et al. (1998) caution that other prescribed noninvasive treatments; e.g., legcompresses, support stockings, or cold water applications, must be observed under all circumstances(KOM). CAN cautions that aescin is nephrotoxic. Side effects include GI disturbance, impaired liverfunction, mild nausea, shock, spasm, urticaria, and vomiting. Should be avoided by patients onblood-thinning therapy, with hepatic or renal impairment, or lactating or pregnant. Large doses ofsaponins can be fatally hemolytic in animals. LD50s range for aescin from 134 to 720 orally inmice, rats, and guinea pigs. On ipr administration, the total saponin fraction (LD50 = 46.5 mg/kgipr mouse) was less toxic compared to isolated aescin (LD50 = 9.5 mg/kg ipr mouse) (CAN). LD50of seed extract 990 mg/kg orl mouse, 2150 orl rat, 1530 orl rbt, 130 orl dog. Extracts (Horse Chestnut) \u2014 The whole extract was more antiinflammatory than just aescin. In addition, an extract excluding aescin also exhibited antiinflammatory activity suggesting antiin- flammatory agents other than aescin (CAN). Aescin (the 13% mixture of saponins) may affect theinitial phase of inflammation by reducing the number and/or diameter of capillary pores effectivelysealing the capillaries (CAN). It antagonizes effects of bradykinin but is not a direct bradykininantagonist (PNC). Barringtogenol-C-21 and hippocaesculin have in vitro antitumor activity (PNC). Clinical treatment of 15 varicose patients with 900 mg/day STX for 12 days reduced activity ofenzymes that breakdown proteoglycans (CAN).

Extracts (Hyssop) \u2014 Hyssop oil is powerfully neurotoxic, there have been several cases of epileptiform seizures. Hyssop is a convulsant because of its pinocamphone (40%) and iso-pinocam- phone (30%) content; this toxicity often refers to injections. At levels of 2.5 mg/kg, injections intodogs produced almost immediate epileptiform seizures. With rats it took more than 130 mg/kg.Intraperitoneal pinocamphone was a convulsant and lethal to rats at levels higher than 0.05 ml/kg.\"Even dermal administration of hyssop oil should be avoided in those vulnerable to seizures\"(Tisserand, 1995). Some EOs may be hazardous to people with epilepsy, especially those EOs thatare rich in scientistsconsider general to be highly stimulant to the CNS, and hence are contraindicated forpeople with epilepsy (Tisserand, 1995). According to the Lawrence Review on Natural Products (September 1996), hyssop, an ingredient in cold and cough preparations, appears to exert itsdemulcent and expectorant effects via its EO. However, injections of the oil may be convulsantand neurotoxic at 130 mg/kg, and a probably due to isopinocamphoneand pinocamphone. Pinocamphone may be present at quantities as high as 13,000 ppm, isopinocam-phone at 6500 ppm. Intraperitoneal injections from 4 ml/kg to 200 ml/kg produce a generalizedcrisis in rats leading from CNS convulsions to death. Anti-HIV and antiviral activities need to beconrmed ( LRNP , September 1996). Oral administration of the oil can also be dangerous. Three cases of clonic spasms have been reported, two adults each taking 10-30 drops each pure EO, anda 6-year-old child taking 2-3 drops a day over several days (KOM). Remember, I council in allcases against pure EO. Diosmin and ursolic acid are antiinflammatory, the latter a COX-2 inhibitor.As the best source of diosmin, it could well be a very useful herbal tea for varicose veins. On adry weight basis, it can attain 6% diosmin. Dry hyssop of that strength would only take 10 gramsto provide the 600 mg diosmin considered antiinflammatory and capillary-protective.

Much of the confusion may hark back to EFS who rather\"lump\" I. aurea, I. balsamina, I. biflora , and I. nolitangere .

Tisserand (1995),432 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs Jafter reviewing the literature, claims to debunk the many authors (including Duke, 1985), cautioning about abortifacient activity of juniper oil. He speculates that they are clouded by the sabine juniper,which apparently does have abortifacient activities. He found few references indicating abortifacientactivity for juniper oil, and the references suggested that ethanolic and acetone extracts of juniperberries have antifertility activity in rats. \"It seems inconceivable that the juniper oil could beresponsible for the reproductive toxicity noted above.

Isoflavonoids are antiseptic against bacteria, Candida, Mycobacterium, and Staphylococcus Epstein-Barr, herpes, Newcastle, vaccinia, and vesicular stomatosis virus with no activity toward polio (CAN). Isoliquiritigenin inhibits aldose reduc-tase, the rst enzyme in the polyol pathway wherein glucose is reduced to sorbitol. It inhibitssorbitol accumulation in human red blood cells in vitro , and in red blood cells, the sciatic nerve, and the lens of diabetic rats. Many diabetic complications (cataracts, nephropathy,peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy) are associated with the polyol pathway and have shownimprovement with aldose reductase inhibitors (CAN). Glycyrrhizin reduces morbidity andmortality of mice infected with lethal doses of flu virus (TAD). Glycyrrhizin inhibits inflam-mation and prostaglandin synthesis. Glycyrrhizin blocks estrogen effects binding to estrogenreceptors, hence the antiestrogenic activities reported; estrogenic activity has also been attrib-uted to the isoflavones, but these too may bind to estrogen receptors (CAN; JAD). Maybe thisis one of those amphoteric herbs. \"Liquorice exhibits an alternative action on estrogen metab-olism, causing inhibition if oestrogen concentrations are high and potentiation when concen-trations are low\" (CAN). I've heard the same things about clover phytoestrogenic isoflavones,some of which are shared with licorice.

Large doses may cause diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. More than 10 g myrtle oil can threaten life due to high cineolecontent (myrtle contains 135-2250 ppm cineole according to my calculations, meaning 10 gmyrtle would contain a maximum 22.5 mg cineole). Several herbs may attain higher levels ofcineole: bay, beebalm, pepper, biblical spearmint, star anise,sweet annie, thyme, and turmeric. So, by reduction, assuming no synergies or antagonisms oradditivities, a ridiculous assumption, one would assume that any goods (and evils) accruing tothe cineole in myrtle, should apply even more so to those listed above, which theoretically atleast, may attain higher levels of cineole, some, e.g., cardamom, attaining levels more than 20-fold higher. Symptoms of this alleged cineole intoxication may include circulatory disorders,collapse, lowered blood pressure, and respiratory failure.

(1998) separate two species of psyllium, one of which Blumenthal et al . call blonde, P . ovata, and the other black, P . psyllium (P . afra ). I doubt that many botanists can tell all the plantain species apart, even in the eld with flowers, fruits, and leaves present. I maintain that unvouchered studieson these closely related species are almost meaningless and the medical literature built on amountain of toothpicks. I have read that our local weed, the plantain, Plantago major , was at one time substituted, successfully for psyllium, but I doubt if the vouchers are there to back up thatstory either.

Major symptoms of toxicity include ataxia, depression, and diarrhea,followed by death within 4 hours to 7 days.

Safrole reportedly induces both cytochrome P-488 and P-450 activity,and both induces and inhibits hepatic microsomal enzymes, with activity falling after the onset ofhepatic toxicity. Putting the risks into perspective, CAN notes that levels of 0.66 mg/kg may provehazardous to humans, and a cup of tea may provide nearly ve times that much. I prefer myperspective based on Bruce Ames's Herp Index, in which one learns that sassafras tea for its safrole is 1/13th as carcinogenic as beer for its ethanol.652 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs SSASSY BARK, and Side Effects (Sassy Bark) \u2014 \"Highly toxic; in humans leading to a primary slowing of the heart followed by acceleration, dyspnea with labored respiration, and death due to respiratory arrest.

Hemolyticsaponins are toxic when injected iv, but have low toxicity when given orally since they don't crossGI mucosa (CAN). Free saponins in GI tract may react with mucosa, causing an increased perme-ability of small intestine to intraluminal solutes and inhibiting active nutrient absorption.

They \"concludethat the infusion of Illicium verum incorrectly administered, or in high doses, produces a neuro- logical toxic picture,\" which must be considered in diagnosis. They advise against its use in infants(USDA abstract). One group has really analyzed star anise, in reporting three new toxins, that'sthree strikes against star anise. Possibly they were analyzing Illicium anisatum , namesake of the toxin anisatin.

Indications (Star As so often in plants that I describe as too dangerous to take, many of the folk indications come fromhomeopathy (especially those labeled (f; HHB; PH2) below), which stresses poisonous plants inextremely high doses. Unfortunately, the naive don't always understand the homeopathic dosages. Ihope the nonbotanists who wrote Commission E and the Herbal PDR have gured out the larkspursbetter than I have. Otherwise, they know not of which larkspur they speak. There are more than adozen Consolidas and Delphiniums , many called the pediculicide stave- sacre, D. staphisagria L. After wasting a day with the nomenclatorial nuances, I feel I should treat three species or lump them all into one, larkspur ( Consolida regalis Gray (formerly and nally the stavesacre, Delphinium staphasiagria L., which is not covered by the USDA.

Contraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Stevia) \u2014 Class 1 (AHP). No health hazards known with proper use as a sweetener (PH2). AMA (Alternative Medicine Alert) suggests that one byproduct of stevia metabolism may be mutagenic (APA); steviol, a metabolite of stevioside\"has been found to be highly mutagenic in several in vitro studies\" (AMA 3:13). Insufcient human data exist regarding safety in pregnancy and lactation. Hence, \"pregnant and lactatingpatients should avoid stevia\" (AMA 3:13). Limited data suggest it may be a contraceptive (APA).Stevioside is \"about one hundred times sweeter than sucrose at a 10% concentration\" (APA).Liquid leaf extracts signicantly decrease plasma glucose levels after overnight fasting in 16healthy adults (APA).

Contraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (St. John's-Wort) \u2014 Class 2d. May potentiate MAOIs (AHP). Active ingredients may be photoactive, especially in fair-skinned people. Reicherttakes it even more seriously: Although hypericum is not as strong as synthetic MAOIs, patientsshould still avoid the things usually avoided: high tyramine foods (smoked or pickled), alcoholicbeverages, amphetamines, cold and hay fever remedies, narcotics, tryptophan, and tyrosine (I nolonger believe this caveat is desirable). Do not take during pregnancy or intense sun exposure(Reichert, 1994; WAM). Commission E reports adverse effect of photosensitivity. Other sourcesreport flowering top permitted for external use only; not to be used before exposure to sunlight(AEH). Foster (1996) is moderate, suggesting that St. John's-Wort should not be mixed withsynthetic antidepressants. Because it may inhibit MAO, taking it with SSRIs, such as Prozac, couldcause serious health damage. Although side effects have not been reported in clinical studies, rangeanimals eating the plant and then standing in bright sunlight have experienced sunburn or blindnessfrom photosensitization. This treatment option should be discussed with your health care provider(Foster, 1996). The Herbal PDR state that photodermatosis in animals usually kicks in after highdoses, such as 3000 mg per kg body weight (PHR). CAN cautions that hypericin is phototoxic.\"Mice given 0.2-0.5 mg of the herb were found to develop severe photodynamic effects. Delayedhypersensitivity or photodermatosis has been documented for St. John's-wort, following the inges-tion of a herbal tea made from the leaves\" (CAN). ESCOP recommends a limited daily intake of1 mg total hypericin ( QRNM, 1997:292). Because of slight uterine activity in vitro , its use in pregnancy and lactation is to be avoided (CAN). No contraindications or drug-drug interactionsreported (PIP). A recent Internet message cautions about the potential for serotonin syndrome.Symptoms include chills, confusion, fever, myoclonus, hyperactive reflexes, myoclonus, speechdifculties, and sweating. Cannot be mixed with an SSRI. That is likely to produce serotoninsyndrome\u2014severe headache, tachycardia, and diaphoresis\u2014which resembles neuroleptic malignantsyndrome (O'Brien, 1998). Recently found to detoxify all the same drugs that grapefruit potentiates.It induces cytochrome P3A4 450, which speeds up metabolism of several drugs. Nierenberg et al.,1999 kindly remind us that, like synthetic antidepressants, this herbal antidepressant may rarelyinduce hypomania in manic patients. Poorly designed Loma Linda studies (Ondrizek) suggest thathypericum may interfere with fertility. But this was based on soaking \"skinned human sperm\" for24 hours in hypericum tea as I recall. Extracts (St. John's-Wort) \u2014 A StX (600 mg wit, 0.24-0.32% hypericin 3 \u00d7/day) produced erythema in light-sensitive patients (AHP). Leaf extracts enhance mouse immune system against Bordetella pertussis and Staphylococcus aureus . Novoimanine is most effective against S. aureus , with water soluble imanine being more effective than imamine or sulphanilamide. Herb extracts are reportedly more active against Escherichia, Shigella , and Staphylococcus than decoctions. Catechin and flavonoid fractions inhibit the flu virus 83-100% (CAN).Amentoflavone is antiinflammatory and antiulcerogenic (CAN). Total flavonoid fraction isanalgesic in mice (CAN). Small amounts of hypericin are tonic and tranquilizing in humans(CAN). Extracts inhibit catechol-o-methyl-transferase at 100 \u00b5M, modulate interleukin-6, block corticotropin-releasing hormone, reduce the availability of serotonin receptors (IC50 = 6.2\u00b5g/ml) and the associated inhibition of resorption of serotonin into the cell, and block MAO- A and B in vitro and ex vivo , and hypericin raises levels of melatonin, all factors that may contribute to antidepressant activity. No statistical evidence was shown in the antiinflammatoryactivity of the extract and hydrocortisone ( QRNM, 1997:292). With rats the IC50 was only of Medicinal Herbs 701 S\u00b5g/ml for inhibiting synaptosomal serotonin uptake (consistent with doses of 900 mg extract in humans). LD50 = >5000 mg/kg. Phototoxic reactions occur in some patients with AIDS given ivn injections of 30-40 mg hypericin. \"Not suitable for use as daily sedatives of sleepaids. Preparations are no more effective than synthetic antidepressants,\" but they are extremelywell tolerated by the patients. In observational studies or >3000 cases, there is ca. a 3% incidenceof minor side effects, cf 10-25% with modern nontricyclic antidepressants (SHT).

Overdose can cause colic, nausea, andpain, irritating the mucus lining of the GI tract, sometimes dizziness and strangury (APA). STORAX ( Liquidambar orientalis Mill.) ++ Many responsible authors (e.g., HHB & LAF), when covering species of Liquidambar , e.g., aggregate American Storax and Oriental Storax. Distinguishing liquidambar and storax resins seemsrather difcult too. Hence, I believe that reporting separately would be rather articial. Few peoplealive can guarantee the taxonomic source of the resin itself. And I suspect there are few, if any,chemical analyses based on vouchered specimens, and many more based on aggregates of miscel-laneous resins. Activities resin (FEL).

Once a well-known published author offered me a generous consulting fee to go through the Spanish and Portuguese literature and summarize the folk literature andinformation on suma for him. I had written on the plant long ago for the Flora of Panama , where Pfafa also occurs. He came from one of the four main entry disciplines to ethnobotany and herbal medicine and medical botany, (1) anthropology, (2) botany, (3) chemistry, and (4)pharmacy/pharmacology but I'll not divulge. I gave him 4 days worth of work and found nothing.He reneged because my report was negative. Today, that scientist continues to publish, oftencopying without citing other ethnobotanical writers' data. And he is, what I call, one of thepaid hypsters who will write a positive opinion page on a worthless herb, for a fee. Then anHandbook of Medicinal Herbs 705 Sunscrupulous pusher will sell that product based on Doctor Hypster's glittering report, often handed out as (pseudo) scientic literature based on Dr. Hypster's world renown. Both hypsterand huckster make money while damaging the images of honest herbs and herbalists. Andsometimes they threaten those who would expose the lack of credibility of some of those studies.More recently, I see that an edible plant book describes suma as \"Brazilian ginseng\" a promo-tional misnomer. \"The roots have reportedly been used as a ginseng-like tonic by the Xingutribe of Matto Grosso, Brazil for at least three BENZOIN ( Styrax paralleloneurum Perkins) ++ with Boswellia, Commiphora, Picea, and Pinus ) even with leaves, fruits, and flowers in hand.

None of us got malaria.Subsequently, that's what I have taken as preventive in Amazonian Peru, where even my shamancaught malaria. Whole herb is more active than artemisinin; gelatin capsules of herb is 3.5times more effective than artemisinin for clearing parasitemia in mice. Capsules are betterthan chloroquine for fever and malarial symptoms empir- ical wisdom, Klayman questions how the ancient Chinese could have recognized the antima-larial activity when it takes such a large batch of plants to produce a small amount of qinghaosu(the substance artemisinin).

Synonyms: M. gale var. tomentosa DC., M. tomentosa (C. DC.) Asch. & Graebn. Taxonomists sometimes have trouble distinguishing M. cerifera L., M. gale L., and M. pensylvanica Mirb., so I suspect the herbalists and collectors may mix them on occasion.

It may therefore help protect liver tissue from hepatotoxins (maybe even the alcohol in sweet-gale-beverages). Simpsonet al. (1996) report antiviral activity for extracts. Influenza A virus and a bacteriophage of Pseudomo- nas procyanea were suppressed by direct contact with the extract, probably due to tannins.

Toxic symptoms reported for thymol include cardiac arrest, cheilitis coma,convulsions, dizziness, gastralgia, glossosis, headache, hyperemia, inflammation, nausea, respi-ratory arrest, and vomiting. Thyme oil should not be taken straight, and not applied straighttopically. There are no known problems with the use of thyme during pregnancy and lactation,provided the doses do not greatly exceed the amounts used in foods (AHP; CAN). Like any EO,that of thyme, like that of rosemary, can be toxic in large quantities, causing irritations to the732 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs Tintestines, kidneys, skin, and stomach. Michael Castleman raises a cautionary flag I don't remember seeing elsewhere, \"Children under age two should not be given medicinal preparationsof thyme, and people with thyroid problems should seek their health-care provider's advice beforetaking medicinal doses\" (Castleman, 1996). Of course, some people say children under 2 shouldnot be given any medicine.

Contraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Tonka Bean) \u2014 Class 3 (AHP). Not covered (CAN; KOM). None at proper dosage (PH2). 150 g tonka beans, cf ~4 g coumarin, might induce headache, nausea, stupor, and vomiting (PH2). Rats and dogs fed coumarin develop liver damage,retarded growth, and testicular atrophy. In large doses, fluid extracts of tonka beans are reportedlycardioparalytic (APA). The reddish sawdust once caused a workman's hair, when wetted, to turn brightgreen (CRC). Coumarin can cause severe liver damage \"which is why the FDA banned the use of thebeans as a flavoring agent\" (APA). Narcotic, the fluid extract can paralyze the heart if infused in largedoses. Respectable scientists question that coumarin, in reasonable doses, can harm humans with normalliver function. Coumarin may possibly cause bleeding incidents, but not like coumadin. Not beingexactly exact, APA leads us to a half-coumadinized conclusion: \"You may recognize the name coumarinin relation to the common anticoagulant warfarin, sold as Coumadin\" (APA). My understanding is thatcoumadin is dicumarol, much more serious than coumarin itself. Coumarin (1,2-benzopyrone)has long-established efcacy in slow-onset, long-term of lymphedema in humans, as con-rmed in recent double-blind trials against elephantiasis and postmastectomy swelling of the arm.

Contraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Turmeric) \u2014 Class Emmenagogue (AHP; AEH). While moderate doses, turmeric is said to inhibit cancers, lym-phomas and ulcers, overdoses of curcuminoids may possibly be cytotoxic and ulcerogenic, andmay lead to diminution of red and white corpuscles. Still, Commission E approves 1.5-3 g/day,not nearly enough to provide 1200 mg curcumin. Commission E also reports contraindications:biliary obstruction; adverse effects: GI irritation from continued use; consult physicians beforeusing if a patient has gallstones (BIS; KOM). At 10% of diet, turmeric caused some loss of hairin rats (MAB). Care should be taken in women who wish to conceive or patients complaining ofalopecia (MAB). Rather frightening what one reads in UPW (2000): Laboratory animals treatedwith it are reported to have been rendered entirely infertile. Women who are pregnant, or children(not yet widely in children) with gallbladder or liver disease or ulcers, should avoid turmeric(WAM). Limit internal use to 10 days (WAM). Extracts (Turmeric) \u2014 Fond as I am of synergy and food farmacy, I like the following comments: Curcumin and genistein can inhibit estrogen-positive human breast cells induced by estradiol or pesticides individually or mixed. Curcumin and genistein were synergistic, totally inhibiting induc-tion in vitro . Curcuminoids inhibit cancer at initiation, promotion and progression in vitro and in vivo (MAB). Viva curried bean soup, like I am having for lunch. Reportedly as effective as hydrocortisone acetate or indomethacin in experimental inflammation (WHO). Both natural anti-inflammatory curcumin (1200 mg/day) and unnatural phenylbutazone (30 mg/day) improved jointswelling, morning stiffness, and walking time in people with rheumatoid arthritis, both better thanplacebo (WHO). Bruneton notes that the antiinflammatory ED50 of curcumin orally in rats is 48mg/kg ( = 4.8 g in me) and is apparently devoid of side effects (BRU), while the ipr ED50 is only2.1 mg/kg, suggesting that the ipr route is 20 times more effective. But I am not into injectingherbs. Enjoy your curried beans, counting on those synergies. Duke suggests curcumin needs tobe compared with Celebrex antiinflammatory activity, the latter at 0.1 ml/kg, which translates to 10 ml for me, a rather dangerous dose. At a dose of 1.5 g/day/30 days, turmeric reduced urinary excretion of mutagensHandbook of Medicinal Herbs 743 Tin an uncontrolled trial of 16 chronic smokers. In six nonsmoking controls there was no change in urinary secretion. no extract (~20 mg cur-cumin/day) for 45 days dramatically decreased blood lipid peroxide levels in 18 male subjects(MAB). Curcumin is poorly absorbed (some 15-35% max in rats) orally but if administered withpiperine (from black and long pepper), absorption is improved more than 150% in rats. But inhuman volunteers, 20 mg piperine increases bioavailability of curcumin 20-fold (MAB). One were more potent than phenylbutazone in acute andchronic arthritic models, while another found it only 1/10th as effective as ibuprofen. While ulcero- genic in large doses, curcumin is only about one-third as ulcerogenic as the phenylbutazone. Inlow doses, curcumin had antiulcer gastrin and bicar-bonate, helping maintain the gastric pH in dogs and humans (TRA).

Contraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Valerian) \u2014 Class 1 (AHP). None reported (PIP). None known (KOM). But Gruenwald (PHR) mentions rare GI complaints, and even rarer contact allergies. He adds that long-term administration may occasionally cause cardiac disor-ders, headache, mydriasis, restless states, and sleeplessness, the latter two the main indications,now side effects of prolonged use. Full-body valerian baths should be monitored in cases ofdermatosis, major skin injuries, cardiac insufciency, or hypertonia (PHR). No contraindica-tions, adverse effects, or interactions except for the effect of the tincture on driving ability(AEH). Ironically, \"There is some concern about continual use, which may cause minor sideeffects, including headaches, excitability, and insomnia\" (Morazzoni & Bombardelli, 1995).AHP minimizes published concern about toxicity of valepotriates, due to poor absorption andquick degradation into less toxic metabolites. If we accept this, we have to minimize medicinalpotential of the valepotriates as well. CAN says, \"There have been no reported side effects tovalerian. The oil is unlikely to present any hazard in aromatherapy\" (CAN). After all those kindwords CAN says, \"The safety of valerian during pregnancy and lactation has not been establishedand should, therefore, be avoided.\" CNS depressant activity may potentiate pharmaceuticalsedatives (CAN).

APA notes that, to my confusionand consternation, the FDA \"banned horehound\" from OTC remedies in 1989, nding no convincingsupport for efcacy. Their German counterparts approved the herb a year later for colds, coughs, anddyspepsia with its accompanying gas and anorexia (APA). The plant juice from white horehound isan irritant and may cause dermatosis (CAN). Because it is reputed to be abortifacient, and reputedto affect the menstrual cycle, its use in pregnancy and lactation is to be avoided (CAN). Lack oftoxicity data and suggested cardioactive properties suggest it should not be taken in excessive doses.Larger doses are laxative (CAN). Contraindicated in cardiopathy, hypertension, and pregnancy(WAM). Large doses are possibly arrhythmigenic or laxative (AHP; WAM). Extracts (White Horehound) and vasodilator.

The data, like the species, are terribly confused: Abies alba Mill. , A. pectinata, ), and P . mariana (Mill.) Britton et al., according to KOM and PHR, neither of whom could probably tell you on the spot which species they were talking about. Their editorial assistants might notknow, if questioned, whether Picea is an angiosperm or a gymnosperm. Some botanists, and fewer salespersons, chemist, pharmacists, and physicians can tell these species of spruces and rs, or theneedles, or the EOs apart. So, buyer beware.

Salicylates and tannins (AHP). For oral use of bark Commission E reports contraindications, adverse effects, and interactions: on theoretical grounds, similar to those of the salicylates (AEH) (all plants contain salicy-lates). In view of the lack of toxicological data, excessive use, especially during lactation and pregnancy,should be avoided. Individuals with aspirin hypersensitivity, asthma, diabetes, gastrosis, gout, hemophilia,hepatosis, hypothrombinemia, nephrosis, and peptic ulcers should be cautious with salicylates. Alcohol,barbiturates, and oral sedatives may potentiate salicylate toxicity. Beware of salicylate interaction withoral phenytoin, pronebecid, spironolactone, and can cause macular in and vom-iting (CAN). Excessive use of the tannin-rich bark may cause diarrhea and nausea (SKY). Still, \"willowis much safer than aspirin\" (SKY). Not for use during viral infections, because of [remote theoretical,JAD] possibility of Reye's Syndrome (WAM).

Koch, and Brassica alba (synonym of Sinapis alba L. subsp. alba), respectively) but the spice and medicine trade seems to favor the white. And the canola and rapeseed varieties have been hopelessly manipulated, even in the GMO eld. Few, if any, taxonomists and agron-omists can distinguish all Brassica varieties and species, and probably fewer chemists, herbalists, phar- macists, and physicians can be sure of the variety or species.

Contraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Wintergreen) \u2014 Class 1. Salicylates and tannins (AHP). AHP gives wintergreen its top score for efcacy (APA). \"Not allowed as a non- medicinal ingredient in oral products in Canada\" (Michols, 1995). As little as 4 ml wintergreenoil can be lethal to an infant. In the U.S., liquid preparations containing more than 5 ml methylsalicylate must be in child-resistant packaging. Mothers are advised that salicylates do enterbreast milk. Some people, especially asthmatics, may be supersensitive to salicylates. Cautionis always indicated when ingesting any new substance, natural or synthetic (AEH). Wintergreenoil, classied as \"very toxic,\" contains methyl salicylate as the chief constituent. Poisoning fromwintergreen oil can cause acid-base imbalance, altered glucose metabolism, and central nervoussystem toxicity. Between 5 ml and 30 ml of wintergreen oil is considered the lethal dose for a70 kg human. CNS symptoms of mild chronic salicylate toxicity include headache, dizziness,tinnitus, difculty in hearing, dimness of vision, mental confusion, lassitude, and drowsiness.More severe symptoms include seizures and coma. Fever is usually prominent. Severe acutesalicylism includes disorientation, irritability, hallucinations, lethargy, stupor, coma, and seizures.GI irritation may produce nausea and vomiting, hyperventilation, increased GI losses leading tomild dehydration, which is enhanced by decreased intake of fluid. Hypokalemia may result fromincreased GI and renal losses and systemic alkalosis (AEH1). The prodrug, salicin, which doesnot irritate the stomach, is metabolized to saligenin in the GI tract and salicylic acid afterabsorption. \"Products containing willow should preferably be standardized on their salicincontent...\" (CAN).

In rare cases, witch hazel tannins may cause liver damage (BIS). In view of thetannin content, excessive use, especially during lactation and pregnancy, should be avoided.\"There are no known problems with the use of witch hazel during pregnancy...\" (CAN). Nocontraindications, drug-drug interactions, or side effects are known (SHT). \"May cause minorskin irritation in some people when applied topically\" (SKY). Witch hazel water is not intendedfor internal use. Teas can be brewed from leaves and twigs, but their safety is not dened ( LRNP , September 1990).

Side effects due to thujone overdose include braindamage, convulsions, even death; insomnia, intestinal cramps, nausea, renal damage (rare), rest-lessness, seizures, stomach cramps, tremors, urine retention, vertigo, and vomiting (BIS; SKY).CAN cautions that thujone in the various volatile oils can cause severe gastrosis and convulsions.Documented fatalities have been mainly associated with ingestion of some such oils (but fatalitiesare reported with infusions and powders). Such oils should not be used internally or externally.Because of abortifacient and uterine activity caused by the thujone in such oils, their use inpregnancy and lactation is to be avoided (CAN). Extracts (Wormwood) \u2014 Aqueous extracts contain little thujone (BIS). All phytochemicals have their good and bad sides, safe and toxic doses; thujone is pretty negative.
