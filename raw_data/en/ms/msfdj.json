The Deities are bathed with scented floral waters, exfoliated with aromatic herbs and spices and are then lubricated with milk, yogurt and honey. The Deities are then rinsed with waters from the sacred Ganges, and perfumed with exotic aromas. The session will involves opening invocations, mantras and songs. Arati, a spiritual prayers and offerings of the ingredients to be used in the service. This strengthens their potency while charging the ingredients with specific energy for a variety of needs. We then continue with meditations and visualizations through selected journeys for grounding, peace, and inspiration. Next is our elemental focus: A shamanic journey evoking the Great Maha Bhutas (Elements): Ether, Air, Fire, Water, Earth. We then dwell into the unknown through Jyotish Astrology readings and shamanic divination to strengthen the direction of your physical, emotional and spiritual energies. We also dwell into seeking traditional guidance from the Goddess Oracle: A Daughters of the Moon tarot deck is consulted with Goddess pendulums and mertis . This is fertile ground for Gaia support and insight. It could be Saraswati, goddess of art, music, knowledge and beauty who reveals the secrets of creativity, rejuvenation and self-care secrets. A more fiery goddess would be Kali, who promotes cleansing, detoxification and internal revolution through love and care. The preparation of herbs, aromatic oils, foods, elements, gemstones, and crystals, including music and the treatment room. As needed we'll explore New Decision Therapy: A basic clearing is performed to enhance physical cellular detoxification. Once the emotion is released, Abhyanga (Ayurvedic massage) is administered. Mother Earth Science Therapy: for detoxification, restoration and rejuvenation is then applied. Lastly we complete shirodhara: The final stage of the water element therapy. During the session Spectrum balancing (Gemstones and crystal balancing): This is applied directly over the 7 gateways of consciousness (chakras) in a variety of patterns. Spectrum balancing brings in the earth element for grounding, stability and centering.
