They are not the subject of an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1]. New animal drugs that are not the subject of an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing are unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 351(a)(5)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of an adulterated drug is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(a)].
