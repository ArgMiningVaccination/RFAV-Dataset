There has not been much discussion around this question on whether it's safe to receive Kambo (a frog remedy from the Amazon) after receiving the Covid vaccinations. After some searching online, I didn't gain much insight; only a few comments in a Reddit thread and a handful of websites sprinkled the web. From the rainforest to the lab, both of these medicines are very powerful. There's a reason why after having the first Pfizer jab, one is required to wait 40 days before receiving the second injection. The body needs time to integrate the vaccine slowly and safely, and with respect. The term \"respect\" used in this context means that we give our bodies time and space to get to know the vaccine, allow it to arrive in the body and do its thing. Kambo is considered one of the most powerful medicines from the Amazon and is has been used as a vaccine within South American tribes. It is collected from the secretions from Phyllomedusa bicolor, also known as the Giant Green Monkey Tree Frog. It has been used to treat many physical alignments, mental and emotional issues, cleanse and restore the body back to balance, and prepare the body and mind for other medicine journeys, like with Ayahuasca. It is non-pyschoactive remedy and is legal around the world, including South Africa. After receiving some small burns on the skin, the medicine is placed on the open skin and absorbed into the lymphatic system. The effects last for about 20 minutes and range from swelling, purging, sweating, diarrhea, and crying, to states of bliss, clarity, fortitude, openness and alignment. It's not easy medicine but comes with great benefits. Traditionally, if you are working with Kambo for the first time, it is suggested to have three sessions over the span of six to eight weeks. Like the Covid vaccine, getting to know and integrating the frog medicine into you system should be done slowly, respectfully, and safely overseen with a trained facilitator. I was having a conversation recently with a medicine man about when to work with Kambo after receiving the Pfizer jabs. Due to the strength and potency of both vaccines (one from the lab and one from the jungle), it is advised to first complete the two Covid vaccines, and then wait for about two months before sitting with Kambo. This gives space to both medicines to do their work, and for the body to assimilate the information. Logically this makes sense. When we receive any vaccine, we give time between each of them before taking the next one. And Kambo is no different. From an Animist perspective, everything is alive and has the opportunity to have a say. Choosing to look at both medicines from this lens, I would want each party to feel welcomed in my body, to find its way and its voice, and that I cultivate the time and space within myself to be present with them both. Note there are contraindications for Kambo if you have certain medical conditions, if you have participated in other cleanses, are on specific medications, or have journeyed with other plant medicines like Ayahuasca and 5-MEO-DMT. There are a number of websites that go in-depth into these topics so that you can be safe when choosing to work with Kambo. Additionally, there is very little research into how these two medicines work with each other, so rather be safe and practice with caution. When both worlds - the rainforest and the lab - converge, we are required time to integrate them both. And this oftentimes is a slow, steady and respectful process that allows both paradigms to integrate individually before connecting harmoniously. So with that in mind, please do your research and empower yourself by being informed. If you willing choose to take the Covid vaccine, do not use Kambo to try get rid of it or purge it out of your body. This is physically dangerous, and in my opinion is disrespectful to the Covid jabs that you have autonomously chosen to be in your body. These are powerful substances that both deserve respect. Empower yourself with information. Cultivate the clarity on your choices. Believe in your body's capacity. Trust your decisions. Show respect to the wisdoms of these medicines. If you have worked with Kambo, I would love to hear your experiences! And if you have any further thoughts or questions on this topic, feel free to reach out.
