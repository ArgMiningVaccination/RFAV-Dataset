Special Report: Raising Awareness of Hate Crimes and Hate Incidents During the COVID-19 Pandemic On May 20, 2022, the one-year anniversary of the enactment of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, the Department of Justice issued a new guidance document with the Department of Health and Human Services, aimed at raising awareness of hate crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic. This guidance provides an overview of the rise of hate crimes and hate incidents during the pandemic, including a surge of hate crimes and hate incidents against Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities, and several steps that law enforcement, government officials, and others can take to raise awareness of increased hate crimes and incidents, and to use increased awareness as a tool for the prevention of and response to hate crimes.

The guidance makes clear that in light of the continuing public health emergency, when resources can be scarce, it is vital that individuals with disabilities are not prevented from receiving needed health care benefits and services as this violates federal civil rights laws. Read the Guidance (February 4, 2022) Read the Press Release Guidance on Legal Requirements to Support Greater Accessibility and Equity in COVID-19 Vaccination Programs OCR has issued guidance reviewing legal standards and best practices for improving access to COVID-19 vaccination programs and ensuring nondiscrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin. Whether information is distributed via flyers, online information portals, or in person at vaccine distribution sites, there is a legal obligation that COVID-19 vaccination programs be accessible and free of discriminatory barriers that limit a communities' ability to receive vaccinations and boosters. The new guidance ensures that entities covered by civil rights laws understand their obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, laws requiring that federally assisted health care providers and systems ensure fair, equitable access to vaccines. Recipients of Federal financial assistance includes state and local agencies, hospitals, and health care providers administering vaccines and boosters. Read the Guidance Read the Press Release HHS and DOJ Guidance on Long COVID as a Disability The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice jointly published a guidance document on \"long COVID\" as a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act. The guidance, released as we commemorate the 31st anniversary of the ADA, provides additional clarity on how these disability nondiscrimination laws apply to people who may be newly covered under these laws because of the impact of the COVID-19 infection on their bodies and their lives. The document discusses when long COVID may be considered a disability under the ADA, Section 504, and Section 1557, and shares examples along with related resources that may be helpful. Read the Guidance (July 2021) Read the Press Release - On Monday, August 2, 2021, the White House Office of Public Engagement, in conjunction with the Departments of Health and Human Services, Education, and Labor, hosted \"A Conversation about Long COVID,\" to review the guidance, share information on how to access supports, and answer questions. If you missed it, you can watch the video here . NON-DISCRIMINATION IN ACCESS TO THE COVID-19 VACCINE At the beginning of the COVID-19 public health emergency, the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) made clear that civil rights laws remain in effect during disasters or emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-discrimination is central to President Biden's National Strategy for the COVID-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness, including his Executive Order on Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response and Recovery and Improving and Expanding Access to Care and Treatments for COVID-19. The federal civil rights laws that OCR enforces also require non-discrimination in the Nation's efforts to vaccinate the public against the COVID-19 virus regardless of race, color, national origin, disability, gender, age, or sex. OCR has issued guidance outlining legal standards under the federal civil rights laws prohibiting disability discrimination and providing concrete examples of the application of the legal standards in the context of COVID-19 vaccine programs and how to implement them. OCR also issued a Fact Sheet setting out key actions to provide access to vaccination programs for people with disabilities. The OCR guidance and fact sheet are companion pieces to resources and information compiled by HHS agencies on best practices for ensuring vaccination accessibility. Disability Access in Vaccine Distribution Fact Sheet HHS Office for Civil Rights Guidance on Federal Legal Standards Prohibiting Disability Discrimination in COVID-19 Vaccination Programs Read the Press Release If you have questions or want to file a complaint with OCR, you can do so here. OCR has issued a variety of guidance documents to provide additional information about civil rights protections during the COVID-19 pandemic, including: \"Civil Rights Protections Prohibiting Race, Color and National Origin Discrimination During COVID19: Application of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\", which you can read here. \"Ensuring the Rights of Persons with Limited English Proficiency in Health Care During COVID-19\", which you can read here. \"Ensuring Non-Discrimination based on Disability or Age\", which you can read here.

Joint Guidance to Help Emergency Preparedness, Response and Recovery Providers Comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. NON-DISCRIMINATION IN CRISIS STANDARDS OF CARE At the beginning of the COVID-19 public health emergency, OCR made clear that civil rights laws are not suspended or waived in times of disaster, including COVID-19. As set forth in this March 2020 bulletin: \"OCR enforces Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act which prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability in HHS funded health programs or activities. These laws, like other civil rights statutes OCR enforces, remain in effect. As such, persons with disabilities should not be denied medical care on the basis of stereotypes, assessments of quality of life, or judgments about a person's relative \"worth\" based on the presence or absence of disabilities or age. Decisions by covered entities concerning whether an individual is a candidate for treatment should be based on an individualized assessment of the patient based on the best available objective medical evidence.\" As a result of complaints filed with OCR and requests for technical assistance, OCR has worked with states and within HHS to address non-discrimination in crisis standard of care plans and practices. Examples of how OCR has worked with states, HHS components, and the Health Care Resilience Crisis Standards of Care Taskforce to operationalize these principles appear below, along with conference presentations and podcasts on this topic in which OCR has participated. DISABILITY AND CRISIS STANDARDS OF CARE Best Practices from OCR's Work with States and Other Entities on Crisis Standards of Care Resource allocation decisions should be based on individualized assessment of each patient using best available objective medical evidence concerning likelihood of death prior to or imminently after hospital discharge Such assessments should not use categorical exclusion criteria on the basis of disability or age; judgments as to long-term life expectancy; evaluations of the relative worth of life, including through quality of life judgments, and should not deprioritize persons on the basis of disability or age because they may consume more treatment resources or require auxiliary aids or supports. When using prognostic scoring systems with patients with underlying disabilities, reasonable modifications may be necessary for accurate use. Healthcare providers should not \"steer\" patients into agreeing to the withdrawal or withholding of life-sustaining treatment or require patients or their families to consent to a particular advanced care planning decision in order to continue to receive services from a facility. Patients must be given information on the full scope of available alternatives. Providers should not consider for re-allocation a ventilator or other piece of life-sustaining equipment that is brought to the hospital by a patient whose life is dependent on that equipment AGE AND CRISIS STANDARDS OF CARE On January 14, 2021, OCR announced it worked collaboratively with the State of NC, the North TX Mass Critical Service to revise each entity's crisis standards of care (\"CSC\") guidelines to reflect best practices for serving individuals with disabilities and the elderly. After OCR provided technical assistance to each entity through a collaborative process, they issued CSC plans that incorporated the following provisions: Prohibition on the use of a patient's long-term life expectancy as a factor in the allocation and re-allocation of scarce medical resources; Prohibition on the use of categorical exclusion criteria, instead requiring an individualized assessment based on the best available objective medical evidence; Prohibition on the use of resource-intensity and duration of need as criteria for the allocation or re-allocation of scarce medical resources. This protects patients who require additional treatment resources due to their age or disability from being given a lower priority to receive life-saving care due to such need; Inclusion of language stating that reasonable modifications to the use of clinical instruments for assessing likelihood of short-term survival should be made when necessary for accurate use with patients with underlying disabilities. Inclusion of new protections against providers \"steering\" patients into agreeing to the withdrawal or withholding of life-sustaining treatment, clarifying that patients may not be subject to pressure to make particular advanced care planning decisions, must be given information on the full scope of available alternatives, and that providers may not impose blanket \"Do Not Resuscitate\" policies for reasons of resource constraint, or require patients to consent to a particular advanced care planning decision in order to continue to receive services from a facility; and Inclusion of language stating that hospitals should not re-allocate personal ventilators brought by a patient to an acute care facility to continue pre-existing personal use with respect to a disability. Under this language, long-term ventilator users will be protected from having a ventilator they take with them into a hospital setting taken from them to be given to someone else. In addition to the agency's work with covered entities regarding CSC guidelines, OCR recently worked collaboratively with the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) to advise on the development of a statement on CSC guidelines during COVID-19, issued by the NAM and nine other national organizations reflecting key best practices for CSC plans. In the December 18, 2020 National Organizations Call for Action to Implement Crisis Standards of Care During COVID-19 Surge, several recommendations address resource allocation decisions based on age. In particular, the recommendations state: \"Make resource allocation decisions based on individualized assessments of each patient, using the best available objective medical evidence concerning likelihood of death prior to or imminently after hospital discharge, including clinical factors relevant and available to such determinations, which may include age under limited circumstances. However, such assessments should NOT use categorical exclusion criteria on the basis of disability or age; judgments as to long-term life expectancy; evaluations of the relative worth of life, including through quality of life judgments, and should NOT deprioritize persons on the basis of disability or age because they may consume more treatment resources or require auxiliary aids or supports.\" OCR is the statutorily designated federal agency responsible for coordination of all civil rights regulations promulgated by federal agencies under the Age Discrimination Act. Under OCR's regulations, explicit mention of age as a basis (even if one factor among many) for a denial or de-prioritization with respect to federally funded benefits is generally prohibited. 45 CFR 91.11. However, methods for resource allocation that may have a disproportionate negative impact correlated to age can be used if \"the factor bears a direct and substantial relationship to the normal operation of the program or to the achievement of a statutory objective.\" 45 CFR 91.14. Under 45 CFR 91.13 of OCR's regulations, age can be explicitly considered if: (a) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other characteristics; and (b) The other characteristic(s) must be measured or approximated in order for the normal operation of the program or activity to continue, or to achieve any statutory objective of the program or activity; and (c) The other characteristic(s) can be reasonably measured or approximated by the use of age; and (d) The other characteristic(s) are impractical to measure directly on an individual basis. Under 45 CFR 91.15, the recipient of federal funds has the burden of proving that use of age falls within the exceptions. This means statements saying providers may use age distinctions are generally not appropriate because each provider has to justify such use individually.

To this end, the Guidance clarifies that: IHS hospitals will not allocate life-saving care using on the basis of disability or age through assessments of quality of life (both pre- and post-treatment), judgments about a person's relative \"worth,\" or consideration of factors unrelated to near-term survival. Resource allocation decisions must be based on individualized assessments of a patient's ability to benefit from treatment, rather than categorical age or disability exclusions or estimates of long-term survival beyond hospital discharge. Reasonable modifications must be made where necessary to ensure individuals with disabilities have equal opportunities to benefit from treatment resources. Decisions whether or not to provide care will not be made based on resource intensity and IHS hospitals will not impose blanket Do Not Resuscitate policies for reasons of resource constraint. Personal ventilators brought by patients related to pre-existing disabilities will not be reallocated. Patients will not be steered or pressured towards refusing life-saving care or treatment based on protected characteristics such as age or disability.
