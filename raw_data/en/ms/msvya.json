But one major one is the eye contact! unfortunately, ASD is genetic. \"It remains unclear whether the real incidence of ASD has increased. If it has, this would have major implications for understanding the causes of autism. Autism is among the most heritable of developmental disorders: siblings of those with autism have a fifty times higher risk of ASD than the general population, and identical twins show a 60-90% concordance, compared to 0-5% in fraternal twins. An enormous research effort, in multicentre studies and international consortia, is being made to identify the genes that predispose individuals to ASD, with limited success to date. The most consistently replicated genetic linkage findings have implicated sites on chromosome 2q, 7q and 15q. Current opinion is that several genes, maybe ten or more, can predispose to ASD. This, as well as the likely heterogeneity within the autism spectrum, may explain why identifying genes for ASD has so far proved very difficult.\" [https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(05)01103-6](//www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(05)01103-6) \"There is increasing evidence that autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) can arise from rare highly penetrant mutations and genomic imbalances.\" [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2010.11.078](//doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2010.11.078) OP, since autism is characterized by impaired language development and repetitive movements, its hard to diagnose it during infancy. The good age for screening is when the child is 2 or 3 y/o. Please, don't worry about it now and enjoy your baby. I never knew that oh I'm not looking for it at all. I just didn't know if it's a possibility in babies. Thank you! And I didn't know if it was genetic or not. So it's good to know it's not Autism research is ongoing, but it is believed to be genetic, in the sense that it is caused by mutations in your genes and it can run in families. I would suggest doing a little research instead of just taking someone's opinion for fact: [https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Fact-Sheet#3082_6](//www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Fact-Sheet#3082_6) My second has autism. I had a concern when as an infant he never made eye contact and as he got older he was obsessed with watching the ceiling fan turn long past that development phase. He started talking on time but then completely lost it 6 months later. We were lucky to catch it early and start early intervention. He's doing great now though! Aside from a few odd behaviors and a hard time with schedule changes you'd not know something was different. My first son has autism, he's non verbal and is quite severe. He seemed to be a completely normal infant up to about 1 year, he was a little late on some development milestones and was a fussier than average baby but like other posters said until language is developing it's really really hard to know. I wish there was a way to know I'm watching this baby like hawk wondering all the time if she has autism or not. She's a great sleeper and such good eye contact and smiles so signs are looking positive for neurotypical so far i noticed around 4 months old with my first. So it is possible to notice even though he was a baby. He was diagnosed at 18 months. Nonverbal, but making lots of progress. So proud of my little guy! Yes to all of this i just wanted to add again eye contact is only a sign. Some children with autism make great eye contact. Having multiple signs is more of a red flag. Also at this stage i have heard looking at their surroundings is normal and not focusing as much on people or things that move constantly hi i just posted above! similar to previous poster my son never slept. Ever. Maybe 3 hours in a day. Severe colic. Wouldn't/couldn't eat. No eye contact (which at a newborn stage i wouldn't consider a red flag but would come to be one later) we thought he was deaf because he wouldn't respond to any noises no matter how loud or startling they were, also obsessed with ceiling fan and wheels at a young age, he twirled and flapped his hands for hours on end. We also thought he was having seizures but it was just a twitch he developed (sort of like Tourette's). I will also add he had a very traumatic birth and head injury at birth. Had we not already been closely working with our doctors and staff at a children's hospital i am sure this would all have been over looked due to his age. We suspected some delays and possible special needs already because of his birth. So his doctor was very supportive and aware of what his needs might be. I will say as a mom of a child with autism please don't stress yourself at this age. Babies develop at different stages and if your child doesn't hit every milestone on time it's okay. I know it's hard not to worry especially when our kids can't communicate at this age. It's hard not to compare our babies to others but they will develop on their own timeline and it's okay! I had suspicions almost from birth. Newborns eat and sleep. My son did neither. He couldn't tolerate my breastmilk, was incredibly fussy, and vomited constantly. He NEVER slept. Like at 2-3 weeks old he'd sleep for maybe 5-7 hours altogether over the course of 24 hours. It was as if he was a motor in hyperdrive 24/7. He's 3 now on it's still like he's on full throttle. I do them on other little ones starting at 6 months to determine developmental delays in areas of cognitive, communication, gross/fine motor, social emotional and self help skills...
