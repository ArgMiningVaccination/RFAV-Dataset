Objective: The harmful use of psychoactive substances represents one of today's largest public health problems. Yet, in spite of its global relevance, current treatment for substance use dis- orders (SUDs) is still not entirely successful. T he purpose of this study was to investigate alter- native treatments and conceptions from traditional Amazonian medicine adapted to SUDs. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 practicing experts at a well-established addiction treatment center in the Peruvian Amazon and performed qualitative content analysis on the collected data. Main categories were deductively dened and corresponding subcategories inductively developed.Results: Our ndings revealed characteristic features and consequences, causes and antecedents, and treatment methods of SUDs as the main categories. Overall, concepts of disease etiology boreresemblance with contemporary biopsychosocial models of SUDs. The Amazonian therapeutic meanshowever differed markedly from current Western ones. The main methods involved dietary retreats,healing ceremonies, and purging rituals. The integral application of Amazonian methods, as well as their traditional implementation according to prescribed ritual protocols, were emphasized by the experts as crucial for efcacy and safety of treatment delivery.Conclusion: We suggest further scientic attention to these therapies, including clinical studies, for which our results provide conceptual underpinnings. Findings from this research expand the cross- cultural understanding of SUDs and, in the long run, may enhance its treatment options. Keywords: Substance use disorders; addiction; traditional Amazonian interviews; addiction treatment; alternative medicine; Peru; Amazon Introduction The harmful use of psychoactive substances is one of today's most substantial public health problems, beingamongst the main contributors to the global burden of morbidity. 1It is associated with avoidable health impair- ments, disabilities, and early death,2implying both indi- vidual suffering and high societal costs, economically amounting to over $600 billion per year in the USA alone.3 However, in spite of the magnitude of and internationalconcern with the problem, current treatments for substanceuse disorders (SUDs) are not yet entirely successful; valuable evidence-based therapies are available, 4but relapse rates remain high.5This recurrent pattern of SUDs, along with neuroscientic studies showing long-term cerebral changes in this context, 6point to the chronic nature of the condition.7In an attempt to improve existing treatment options, some research has therefore explored alternative or tradi-tional healing practices for SUDs, 8in a parallel way as such therapies are often used for somatic chronic diseases, likecancer. 9-11Specically traditional Amazonian medicine, an ancient healing system involving the use of medicinalplants and ritual techniques from the Amazon rainforest, 12 ought to be investigated. SUD treatments based onAmazonian medicine are already being offered in some therapeutic contexts in South America, including the pioneering Takiwasi Center (Takiwasi Centro de Reha-bilitacio \u00b4nd eT o x y de Investigacio \u00b4nd e Medicinas Tradicionales, or Takiwasi Center for Treatment and Rehabilitation) in Peru, whose addic- tion treatment protocol combines Western psychotherapywith Amazonian medicine. Intern al statistics from the center suggest good results, but so far no scientic studies have assessed the effects of this treatment empirically. However, to evaluate how this treatment works and whether it iseffective requires rst gaining insight on how SUDs areunderstood within this medicinal system. 13Once a funda- mental conceptual understanding of Amazonian treatment processes has been established, clinical assessment ofCorrespondence: Ilana Berlowitz, Department of Psychology, Uni- 2, 1700 Fribourg, Submitted Oct 06 18 2017.Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria. 2018;40: 200-209 Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry Brazilian Psychiatric Association doi:10.1590/1516-4446-2016-2117efcacy can follow at a next s tage. The overall objective of our research was therefore to identify conceptions andpractices of SUDs as understood in the Amazonian medi-cinal practice used in the Tak iwasi treatment framework. It is important to note that the illness concepts explored in this study reflect a contemporary adaptation of Amazo- nian medicine, which may differ from more ancient or tradi- tional versions in signicant ways. Amazonian medicine, asit is practiced in Peru today, reflects a blend of traditions,modied by centuries of exposure to colonial and postco- lonial influences, rather than the native science it originally was. 14As such, current Amazonian medical practice and its application in the Takiwasi treatment are understood as a kind of hybrid system15or Third Space,16i.e., a construct that evolved from the interaction of different culturalsystems. Rather than giving an ethnographic account of traditional Amazonian medicine in its most original form, it is this hybrid medical practice, its methods, and its under-lying concepts that the present study aimed to investi-gate. More specically, our study intended to capture expert practitioners' understanding of the etiology (aim 1) and treatment (aim 2) of SUDs. We further aimed to assesswhich among the Amazonian techniques applied in the Takiwasi protocol is seen as the main constituent in SUD therapy (aim 3). Finally, we intended to discuss similaritiesand differences between the adapted Amazonian and current scientic views of SUDs (aim 4). Methods Participants Our sample consisted of a group of 13 expert practitioners of traditional Amazonian medicine that presently do or inthe past have worked with the Takiwasi Center. Selecting practitioners on the basis of their work association with this institution ensured that all experts were (a) knowl-edgeable in Amazonian medicine, (b) experienced with SUDs, and (c) well-acquainted with the standard treatment regime at the center. This also entails that their expertiserelates specically to the aforementioned Third Space, 16 within which they act as boundary objects17,18or hybrid actors, bridging the different medical and cultural contexts. Sample size was determined on the basis of recommenda-tions by Morse 19,20concerning data adequacy. Takiwasi treatment protocol The Takiwasi Center was originally founded in 1992 by a French medical doctor after a mission with Doctors With-out Borders for an unrelated healthcare project in Peru. The Takiwasi Center was the rst clinical institution in the world to apply traditional Amazonian medicine to SUDs,and is ofcially recognized by the Peruvian health depart-ment. Its treatment protocol combines Amazonian and Western therapeutic methods. The clinical staff working at the center thus consists of health professionals from bothsystems (i.e., curanderos/as , psychologists, nurses, etc.). Western therapeutic methods include individual psycho- therapy (such as Gestalt or Analytic therapy) and grouppsychotherapy (e.g., relapse prevention, psychodrama, etc.),milieu therapy, and occupational therapy, as well as occasional biomedical health checks. The center gener- ally does not administer psychopharmacological treat-ments for SUD (or comorbidities) except in rare cases, inwhich immediate stabilization is necessary (for instance, by means of tranquilizers). Traditional Amazonian meth- ods essentially involve the use of local medicinal plantsin the context of traditional rituals. The duration of the inpatient program varies, but is typically between 3 to 12 months (about 7 months on average; internal statistics),depending on individual clinical requirements. Amazonian medical treatments are administered in a weekly routine and in parallel to Western interventions to all participantsthroughout the entire program. The exact treatment plan, in terms of which technique is applied at which stage and with which frequency, is adapted individually and decidedon in a case-by-case manner. On a typical day of treat-ment, a patient may do physical exercises in the morning and perform daily chores (cooking, gardening, cleaning, etc.) with the help of an occupational therapist. Individualtherapy sessions may also take place during that time. Afternoons and evenings are dedicated to group inter- ventions, Amazonian or Western, depending on the dayand patient. The rst weeks tend to focus on the detoxi- cation process, while the remainder of the treatment aims at deeper therapeutic work. In accordance withPeruvian legislative requirements, a therapeutic commu- nity such as Takiwasi needs to be gender-specic. The residential treatment program therefore serves exclusivelymale patients, with a maximal capacity of 18 beds. Themajority of treatment seekers use a combination of alco- hol and illicit drugs (cocaine-related substances, canna- bis, amphetamines, opiates, or tranquilizers) and are fromPeru or other Latin American countries, with a minority of European or North American patients (internal statistics). Besides the male-only residential treatment for SUDpatients, the center also operates outpatient services for males and females with psychosomatic problems. Data collection We conducted semi-structured expert interviews using guiding questions (Table 1) leaning on those develo-ped by Berger-Gonza \u00b4lez, Stauffacher, Zinsstag, with the common-sense model of illness representation,22a health psychology framework for exploring dimensions of illness concepts. Ourresearch focused on the follow ing three dimensions: causes, consequences, and management (i.e., treatment). All inter- views were conducted by a trai ned psychologist (IB). Data w e r ec o l l e c t e di nt h eS a nM a r t \u00b4n Province of Peru between October 2013 and September 2014, until saturation occur- red. Saturation was dened in terms of data adequacy, i.e.,when the most salient information was identied and nofundamentally new categories were emerging, at which point data collection was discontinued. 19Most interviews were held at the Takiwasi Center facilities (77%), and the restat the interviewees' home/workplace. Interviews were con- ducted in Spanish, except for one in English. The average interview length was 70 minutes (range, 35-123 minutes),distributed across one to three sessions per participant, Rev Bras Psiquiatr. 2018;40(2)Amazonian medicine for addiction therapy 201depending on time availability and circumstantial demands. Interviews were tape-recorded and subsequently tran-scribed verbatim. The study was approved by the relevant ethics committee and conducted in accordance with inter- national regulatory requirements (no. 88-2013, Fribourg,Switzerland). Participants were carefully informed aboutthe purposes of the study, and their consent was obtained. Data analysis We took a conventional approach to content analysis, as is recommended when existing research literature on the subject is limited. 23We performed qualitative content analysis24by means of a computer-assisted (Microsoft Ofce) iterative process: in a rst analytic step, main cate- gories were deductively developed on the basis of ourresearch questions and the illness representation model. 22 These categories had initially been dened as 1) char- acteristics of SUDs, 2) causes of SUDs, and 3) treatment of SUDs, but the preliminary labels were subsequentlyadjusted to more precisely match the data at hand. Sub- categories or coding categories (''codes'') within these main themes were then developed from the data in a step-wise inductive procedure, identifying common clusters of themes. The iterative process thus involved a repetitive analysis of the data material, in which the emerging codingsystem was continuously revised, until a nal set of codes was established. To assess the nal coding system's reliability, a random sample of 20% of the textual materialwas re-coded by an independent rater (VA). The indepen-dent rater was experienced in qualitative analysis and psychological research but had no prior involvement in our study, as recommended by Krippendorff. 25In cases of discrepancies between the two ratings, consensus was reached by discussion and adjustment of codes. For each of the three main categories, Cohen's kappa was calcu-lated as a chance-adjusted between-rater agreement mea- sure. 26In the scope of this study, we specically focused on the Amazonian treatments applied in the Takiwasiframework. Western methods used at the Takiwasi Center(such as psychotherapy) were therefore not probed for in the interviews, and not considered in the analysis. Simi- larly, aspects mentioned by expert practitioners as partof their personal medicinal repertoire but never applied at Takiwasi Center were also not considered in this analysis. With regard to identication of the main treatment constit-uent, participants were asked to indicate which of theAmazonian therapeutic methods they had mentioned was most important for SUD treatment. We encouraged expertpractitioners to select one method if possible, but allowed multiple choices if necessary. Preferential choices per method were subsequently summed up and the mainmethod identied on the basis of the majority rule. Results Sample characteristics are shown in Table 2. The age ofthe expert practitioners ranged between 35 and 86 years, with 15% (n=2) being female. The majority of experts were born (77%, n=10) and lived (93%, n=12) in SouthAmerica, but there was diversity with respect to the sample's cultural background. All participants had recei- ved extensive training in one or several traditional systemsof Amazonian medicine (e.g., Asha \u00b4ninca, Quechua-Lamas, Chazuta traditions), reporting an average of 28 years of traditional medical experience. It was not generally possible for respondents to separate the learning period from pra-ctice, since, as they explained, in Amazonian medicine the learning process occurs concurrently with and through practice. An extreme case was presented by one partici-pant who had started his career in traditional medicine at age 14, and, during the interview, at age 86, insisted he was still learning. With regard to how they had acquiredtheir expertise in SUDs, participants mentioned as their most important source of knowledge instruction by teacher plants (n=8; see below for the concept of teacher plants),years working at Takiwasi (n=6), instruction by senior pra-ctitioners of traditional Amazonian medicine (n=2), years of clinical work in other contexts (n=1), or their personal life experience (n=1). Most participants (69%, n=9) consideredthemselves to be a curandero/a (general practitioner) with one or more areas of specialization within traditional medi- cine, including the self-given labels of ayahuasquero (spe- cializing in the use of medicines based on ayahuasca plant, Banisteriopsis caapi ; main alkaloids harmine, harma- tetrahydroharmine), perfumero/a (specializing in the use of water-based therapies such as plant baths),huachumero/a (specializing in the use of medicines based on the huachuma plant, Echinopsis pachanoi ; main alka- loid mescaline), preparador de plantas (specializing in the preparation plant remedies), or curioso/a (general prac- titioner considered hierarchically below curandero/a ). Besides their training in traditional Am azonian medicine, participants reported additional training a nd/or work experience in eldsTable 1 Interview guidelines (condensed form) - How do you as a practitioner of traditional Amazonian medicine understand addiction/substance use disorders?

The presentation of ndings is structured along the three main categories dened in the analytic process. Wefound four codes within the rst main category ''characte- ristic features and consequences of SUDs,'' seven codes in the second main category ''causes and antecedentsof SUDs,'' and ve codes in the third main category ''treatment methods for SUDs.'' Inter-rater reliability was excellent, with 0.87, k= 0.81, and k= 0.93 (rst, second, and third main category, respectively). In the following sections, the codes within each main category are presented by means of a conden-sed summary of statements per code, including citations that illustrate the thematic content. We followed Meuser & Nagel's 27recommendation to stay as close as possible to the original material and wording used by the expertpractitioners. The percentage of participants that raised concepts in each coding category and the total number of mentions per code are given in Table 3, the order ofpresentation reflecting level of prominence in the data per main category. Main category 1: concepts regarding characteristic features and consequences of substance use disorders Contextualization/label Subsumed under this code are conceptual issues in which the health condition was tagged or embedded into a wider context. Most of the expert practitioners (85%, n=11) rai- sed such meta-level aspects, a ''spiritual illness,'' a ''cultural illness'' rather than an individual affliction, or''primarily a Western problem'' not observed in more traditional societies until recently. Addiction or SUD was explained as ''one of the most difcult problems.'' Spiritual-energetic concepts A majority of expert practitioners (62%, n=8) considered that there is a pronounced spiritual dimension to addic- tions. Some participants referred to a search for spiritual meaning or ''lling an existential void.'' Experts that men-tioned this category generally spoke of spirits or dis- embodied entities involved in SUDs: entities which are ''negative,'' ''malec'' or ''unhealthy'' were explained as push-ing the person toward drug use or other (self-)destructive behaviors. One expert phrased it as follows: ''The addict is a person that has lost the connection to his soul, to his spirit,and he is inhabited by a spirit, an entity that leads him todestruction, towards death. [...] Addiction does not just imply the consumption of a substance, but also entering into an e n t i r ew o r l d-aw o r l do ft r a n s g r e s s i o n s ,aw o r l do fl i e s ,aw o r l dof pacts and obscure relationships. All of this has an impact on that person on the spiritual level, and the person ends up becoming a kind of marionette, manipulated by spirits.'' Psychosocial concepts An equally large portion of expert practitioners (62%, n=8) discussed aspects of SUDs that can be classied as psy- chosocial in nature. Affective problems were commonlymentioned, and drug use was explained to often be anattempt to alleviate emotional difculties. A general negati- vistic outlook was described, in which the person ''has lost all motivation and appreciation for l ife.'' Practitioners reported that an affected person typically ''feels well only when using drugs.'' Moreover, relational aspects were emphasized by some respondents, explaining t hat addicts have dysfunctional relationships with drugs, the env ironment, and themselves. Some experts pointed to irresponsible, deceitful or aggres- sive behaviors, for instance: '' persons with addictions show a lack of ability to respect limits and boundaries.'' Physical concepts A number of expert practitioners (38%, n=5) considered it to be a basic feature of SUDs that the person's body is affected, but there were comparatively few mentions inthis coding category. Practitioners explained that ''theTable 2 Sample characteristics (n=13) Mean (range) n (%) Sex Female 2 (15)Male 11 (85) Age at time of interview 52.2 (35-86) Years of experience in TAM 28 (6-74)Years working with Takiwasi 13 (2-22) Place of birth Peru 8 (61)Colombia 1 (8)Argentina 1 (8)France 1 (8) New Caledonia 1 (8) Australia 1 (8) Place of residence Peru 10 (77)Colombia 1 (8)Argentina 1 (8) Australia 1 (8) Ethnic afliation, self-identied Peruvian mestizo 6 (46)Indigenous Amazonian 3 (23)Western 4 (31) Specic TAM tradition trained in Asha\u00b4ninca 1 (8) Quechua-Lamas 1 (8)Chazuta 1 (8)Putumayo 1 (8)Various 9 (68) Areas of medical specialization * Curandero 9 (69) Ayahuasquero 9 (69) Huachumero 2 (15) Curioso 2 (15) Perfumero 1 (8) Preparador de plantas 1 (8) TAM = Traditional Amazonian medicine. *Most participants reported various areas of specialization simultaneously.

It was furthermore suggested that SUD patients usuallydemonstrate ''a lack of connection with their own body.'' Main category 2: concepts regarding causes and antecedents of substance use disorders Familial and immediate social environment This code appeared in the causal explanations of all expert practitioners, and accounted for the largest number of men- tions in this main category. Familial problems that werenamed to contribute to SUDs included a lack of love, care,or guidance from one's parents. Moreover, the absence of discipline in the family was suggested to play a role in the etiology of SUDs. Typical patterns of dysfunctional fami-lial relationships were mentioned, as well as living with a person that uses drugs or alcohol, or peer pressure, for instance: ''there are many reasons [for developing anaddiction]; sometimes it is about choosing a friend, the friend that you don't know but you think he is your friend; the friend that makes you do things you shouldn't do, like drinkingalcohol or smoking, or takes you to the discotheques where there is much risk.'' Another example: ''It all depends on one's home, if one's home is well [...]. If a parent also has problems,a disorganized life - that's where it originates.'' Personality and emotional tendencies Statements about such tendencies featured prominently in the data, with 85% of experts (n=11) reporting at least one concept in this context. Emotional antecedents that were mentioned as causally linked to SUDs included anger,anxiety, or grief, but also low self-esteem and feelings of loneliness, separation, or not belonging. Personality traits included tendencies to curiosity, experimentation, lookingfor intense experiences, a lack of willpower, or a ''childishrebelliousness.'' A disposition labeled as ''being weak'' was pointed to by several respondents: ''some let themselves get carried away more than others; because there are manypeople that are very weak and allow the vice to dominate them too much.'' Life stressors Stressful life events were mentioned by a majority of expert practitioners (62%, n=8) as contributing to the devel- opment of SUDs. Common examples included traumaticexperiences such as sexual violence and childhood abuse, but also disappointing events in the course of one's life: ''Addiction sometimes comes because of a disappointment,I believe. [...] Personal problems, a disappointment at work, or disappointments in love life, or possibly also disappoint- ments by ones' relatives.'' Biological and hereditary factors A majority of respondents (62%, n=8) suggested that biological factors play a role in the development of SUDs,referred to as ''physiological disturbances,'' a ''weak bodily system,'' ''contaminated body,'' or genetic predispositions. One of the experts explained that heredity played an impor-tant role in SUDs which extended beyond the somatic level:''So there is an inheritance, I believe, something cross- generational, with a somatic part and a psychological part and a spiritual part.'' Another expert explained that ''...thebody of the person demands the liquor, he feels the need, because the body is contaminated, [the body] is sick.'' Spiritual-energetic antecedents Slightly more than half of the expert practitioners (54%, n=7) pointed to energetic or spiritual antecedents of addi- ction. These were described as ''energetic disturbances,''''energetic pathogens,'' or ''malec or unhealthy spirits thatTable 3 Percentage of experts (n=13) who mentioned each category and number of mentions per category CategoryExperts/category n (%)Mentions/category n Characteristic features and consequences of SUDs 13 (100) 101 Contextualization/label 11 (85) 25Spiritual-energetic concepts 8 (62) 33Psychosocial concepts 8 (62) 34Physical concepts 5 (38) 9 Causes and antecedents of SUDs 13 (100) 156 Familial and immediate social environment 13 (100) 37Personality and emotional tendencies 11 (85) 30Life stressors 8 (62) 19Biological and hereditary factors 8 (62) 15Spiritual-energetic antecedents 7 (54) 25 Larger sociocultural context 7 (54) 22 General remarks concerning causes 6 (46) 8 Treatment methods for SUDs 13 (100) 252 General treatment process and components 13 (100) 83Healing ceremonies with teacher plants 13 (100) 54Dietary retreats with teacher plants 12 (92) 40 Purging rituals with emetic plants 11 (85) 49 Further Amazonian modes of treatment 11 (85) 26 SUDs = substance use disorders.

Several ways of acquiring these were proposed, among them ''relational imbalances between the human and the spirit world,''''spiritual transgressions,'' ''w itchcraft,'' or ''the use of sacred plants in an incorrect way.'' One healer explained this in the following way: ''Often the Amazonian healers talk about the plants - because the plants have a spirit, a mother, and ifone does not treat them with re spect, the plants may punish the person, possess the pers on, rob the person's spirit.'' Larger sociocultural context Sociocultural conditions that contribute to SUDs were brought up by about half of participants (54%, n=7). Theyincluded factors such as economic problems, a lack of social cohesion, a lack of future perspective, as well as certain occupational environments inherently associatedwith consumption (e.g., agricultural labor and alcohol).The experts explained that there are structures specic to Western society that seem to foster addictive tendencies, in particular the absence of sacred spaces and initiatoryor healing rituals, which, according to the experts, are vital for well-being: ''[historically,] there had been a deliberate attempt to remove people from their culture and theirculture's traditional mechanisms of healing, and that's the reason why in my experience there's subsequently so much addiction, because those methods of maintenanceof the soul have been removed, and therefore the impactof this Western malaise of addiction is even greater, because there's no resistive process.'' General remarks concerning causes All participants expressed a variety of causal factors for the development of SUD, while mono-causal explanationswere absent in the data set. A number of participants (46%, n=6) explicitly addressed this, through statements such as ''it is a complex problem,'' ''there's a biological, a spiritual,and an energetic component,'' or ''it's multi-causal.'' Main category 3: concepts concerning treatment methods for substance use disorders General treatment process and components All participants raised concepts related to the general treatment process and its components. Three components were generally pointed out as main constituents: purgingrituals, dietary retreats, and healing ceremonies. The expert practitioners reported the use of a variety of plants: ''Some clean, others purify, others open our understandingand knowledge.'' They emphasized that, to ensure safety and efcaciousness, these plants have to be applied in the correct manner, for which adherence to traditional ritualis critically important. A certain class of plants the healersreferred to as ''teacher plants'' was reported to play a sig- nicant role in the treatment. One expert explained that these plants ''are teaching individuals to know themselves,to know their strengths and weaknesses, and to balance those.'' The plants in general were explained to show their effects slowly: ''The processes in traditional medicine arelong, the healing occurs slowly.''Healing ceremonies with teacher plants All the respondents mentioned healing ceremonies involv- ing specic teacher plants. The experts explained that the plant preparations used for such ceremonies at Takiwasi are chiefly ayahuasca and purgahuasca (the central ingredient of both being the vine Banisteriopsis caapi) . The experts described such ceremonies as following a prescribed ritual protocol that traditional healers guideby means of '' icaros '' (special healing songs) and other therapeutic measures. The respondents further descri- bed several behavioral and food restrictions that need to be observed in the context of such healing ceremonies.Several functions that these ceremonies may serve were mentioned, among them cleansing, becoming aware of previously unconscious aspects of self and life, or con-necting with ''non-rational layers of experience, where one's deep suffering lies.'' Statements like ''the plants make you see what you have inside'' were common. In oneexpert's words: ''Generally speaking, a plant ceremony is like a large operating room. A very deep kind of energetic surgery is taking place. It is like restructuring, clearing thepersonal and then also transpersonal weights, inheritedproblems that one's family lineage may carry and that may create difculties for the person now.'' Dietary retreats with teacher plants Nearly all participants (92%, n=12) discussed traditional dietary retreats. The expert practitioners reported thatthis intervention involves spending time (usually 8 days) in an isolated hut in the forest while ingesting teacher plants. The traditional healer visits the patient three timesa day to administer the medicines (prepared from teacherplants), attend to his needs, and supply basic food (plain rice and cooked green plantains). Patients are required to follow strict nutritional and behavioral rules during theretreat period; the experts emphasize the omission of salt, sugar, or spices, and restrictions on social contact, sexual activity, exposure to heat or cold, and toiletries. Some ofthese restrictions persist for several weeks after the retreat, albeit in an attenuated fashion. One expert descri- bed this process as a ''technology of use of medicinalplants.'' They explained that the person needs to be alonein nature and follow these rules so ''the plants can work'' and will not produce adverse effects. These are also the conditions that enable the plants to teach, say the experts,namely through dreams, visions, or sudden insights. The dietary retreat is described as an intense therapeutic process during which ''the strength of the [misused] druggets liberated from the body.'' In one case the following description was given: ''Childhood problems may come to the surface. One meditates on that and frees oneself fromit. The plants activate you, they extract from you, they make you see.'' Purging rituals with emetic plants A large majority of participants (85%, n=11) mentioned purging rituals in which emetic plants are administered in a ritual setting. The experts reported that under the gui-dance of a traditional healer, the prescribed plant extract Rev Bras Psiquiatr. 2018;40(2)Amazonian medicine for addiction therapy 205is ingested along with several liters of water, which are subsequently purged. The experts explained that this is done to detoxify the body and alleviate withdrawal anddrug craving. Other effects mentioned included ''eliminat-ing memory traces of the drugs from the body,'' ''clearing energetic charges,'' ''establishing a strong contact with one's body,'' or helping with anxiety. The expert practi-tioners explained that different purging plants have distinct properties, may act on specic bodily and/or psychological systems, and that effects are multi-layered: ''The purgingrituals act not only on a physical level, but also emotionally; when they vomit, they vomit not only the toxins, the sub- stances, but also the anger, the rage, and also the spiritualpart [...]. The purge is not just a mechanism of cleaning the organism from the drug or the alcohol, but everything gets cleansed at the same time, negative thoughts, emotions,and bad memories, as they say.'' Further Amazonian modes of treatment Other Amazonian techniques used for SUD treatment were reported by 85% of experts (n=11), among them plant baths, steam baths, techniques called '' sopladas '' and '' icaradas ,'' and the ingestion of tonic plant prepara- tions on a daily basis. Plant baths and saunas are expla- ined to aid the detoxication process and ''help balancethe The sopladas and icaradas were explained to involve ''an intervention in the physical and energetic- spiritual body of the person'' and also described as bal-ancing. For example: ''An icaro , a song the received, is sung, and tobacco ( mapacho ) or perfume or cinnamon ( canela del monte ) or blessed water, according to what the healer senses, is applied on the body [of the patient]and the person becomes more balanced energetically.'' The song component of the described intervention isreferred to as icarada , and is often applied in conjunc- tion with a soplada , i.e., blowing tobacco, cinnamon, or medicinal liquids onto the patient's body. Identication of the most important method for SUD When asked which of the Amazonian therapeutic meth- ods used at Takiwasi was most efcient for SUD treat- ment, most expert practitioners expressed that it was nota single method, but the interplay between the different methods and plants that was efcacious. For instance: ''it's an integral, it's an ecosystem [...] so I really couldn'tsay that one is more or less important, I think they're all part of an integral system.'' We encouraged experts to nonetheless select one or a set of techniques, whileallowing for multiple choices per participant. Summing preferential choices per method yielded a score of 5 for purging rituals, 7 for dietary retreats, 5 for healingceremonies with ayahuasca , and 1 for ceremonies with huachuma (Figure 1). The latter, however, is not currently practiced at the Takiwasi Center and has only rarely been used there in the past. Discussion This study investigated illness concepts and therapies of traditional Amazonian medicine adapted to SUDs. Inter- views with 13 expert practitioners revealed a multifacetedunderstanding of and treatment approach for SUDs. Theexperts pointed out a large spectrum of relevant aspects on different levels of analysis, including biological, psy- chosocial, sociocultural, and spiritual-energetic factors.The categories that emerged in the analysis bear resem- blance to contemporary scientic concepts of SUDs which Figure 1 Identication of the main Amazonian interventions used in the context of substance use disorders according to 13 expert practitioners.

Such models outline how psychosocial factors (e.g., stressful life events), personality features (e.g., sens ation-seeking), and contex- tual factors (e.g., the availability of drugs) interact withphysiological predispositions and contribute to vulnerability to SUDs. 28,29The expert practitioners discussed substance use as an attempt to regulate affective states, self-esteem,or interpersonal difculties. This account matches the well- known self-medication hypothesis of SUDs, according to which drug use reflects an endeavor to assuage painfulfeelings. 30Nevertheless, the Amazonian framework of understanding differs from the classical biopsychosocial approach with regard to some observations related tospiritual-energetic concepts. Certainly, the relevance of spirituality noted by the experts is in line with the world- wide spread of spiritually oriented approaches suchas Alcoholics/Narcotics Anonymous and related 12-stepinterventions. 31Such treatments are exceedingly com- mon today, with evidence of benecial effects,32and research investigating the signicance of spirituality inthese approaches relative to the perspective of traditional healing systems, such as the Amazonian one, would be of interest. Nonetheless, when spiritual-energetic factorsrefer to non-material forces or subtle energy processes, the Amazonian concepts diverge from the contemporary scientic understanding of SUD. Yet, since a substantialportion of expert accounts emphasized precisely these aspects, future studies should aim to further examine the nature and role of these processes in the Amazonianapproach and their signicance for treatment. Regarding Amazonian therapies, the analysis revealed a wide range of methods for SUDs (see Table 4 for a general overview of treatment methods applied in theTakiwasi protocol). The main groups were purging rituals with emetic plants, dietary retreats with teacher plants, and healing ceremonies with teacher plants (for surveyson Peruvian medicinal plants, see Bussmann & Sharon 14 and Sanz-Biset et al.33). Clearly, the Amazonian ther- apeutic means differ markedly from Western ones, andcall for further scientic study. Indeed, there has been anincrease in scientic interest in these methods and speci- cally in the ayahuasca brew in recent decades (usually a combination of Banisteriopsis caapi and admixture plants, such as ), with a growing benecial effects for psychosomatic problems, includ-ing substance use. 34-37Interestingly, contrary to what thisupsurge of specic interest in ayahuasca would imply, the view that Amazonian treatments need to be applied in conjunction with each other as an integral system pre-vailed in our sample. A small majority of expert practi-tioners considered dietary retreats with teacher plants to be especially important for SUD treatment, within the context of an overall view that all the components worktogether, and purging rituals were also among the top three components identied. However, systematic empiri- cal research examining Amazonian methods other thanayahuasca , such as dietary retreats or purging rituals, is virtually nonexistent at present. An exception is the work of Sanz-Biset and Can igueral 38,39on what they termed ''strict diets'' and ''depurative practices'' for a wide range of mostly somatic ailments. These ethnopharmacologi- cal publications focus mainly on the description of plantspecimens, but also include an account of dietary condi-tions required for some of the examined plants. Beha- vioral rules, such as certain food restrictions or mandatory social isolation, as mentioned in their work, broadly matchthe descriptions provided by our sample. Our results fur- ther indicate that these dietary conditions are considered necessary for both therapeutic efciency and safety of theAmazonian plant medicines, as is the adherence to tradi- tional ritual. Another ethnopharmacological study provides an account of Amazonian plant diets not as a therapeuticmethod, but as a tool for learning the trade of a traditional medical practitioner 40(for the Amazonian concept of plants that teach medicine, see also41). Further research on therapeutic applications of those techniques in thecontext of psychosomatic problems and specically SUDs is needed to elucidate the nature of these interventions, the mechanisms involved, and their short- and long-termeffects. Since most expert practitioners explained that the efcacy of Amazonian treatments lies in their integral, systemic application, our ndings imply that examiningthe treatment as a whole, rather than isolating its com- ponents, may be the most fruitful approach for study. This is in fact consistent with general methodological recom-mendations for clinical research on alternative medicines,as practitioners across traditions tend to maintain that the overall effect of their treatment does not necessarily equal the sum of its parts. 13,41Similarly, since our results show that the experts consider the behavioral rules and the ritual component of Amazonian treatments as crucial for both efciency and safety, these aspects should be inclu-ded and further examined in future studies. At this stage, more in-depth qualitative research seems most suitable for this purpose. Our strategy of encouraging participants to select a core treatment modality, despite the prevailing view that the trea- tment consisted of an integral system, unduly deempha-sized the holistic nature of the treatment concepts and isthus a limitation of the present study. There are a number of further limitations. As mentioned earlier, our ndings can- not be taken to reflect Amazonian medicine in a historicallytraditional sense, but represent a contemporary adapta- tion or hybridization thereof. Medical systems are cultural systems, which are subject to change and adjust dyna-mically to new contexts and influences. 42Arguably, pra- ctitioners with less influence from Western society mayTable 4 General overview of methods applied in the Takiwasi treatment protocol Main Amazonian methods Purging rituals with emetic plants Dietary retreats with teacher plants Healing ceremonies with teacher plants Main Western methods Individual psychotherapy (e.g., Gestalt, Analytic)Group psychotherapy (e.g., relapse prevention, psychodrama)Milieu therapy Occupational therapy Biomedical health checks Rev Bras Psiquiatr. 2018;40(2)Amazonian medicine for addiction therapy 207still exist in remote rainforest areas, but for that very reason are unlikely to have had extensive experience with SUDs. Moreover, this study aimed to identify conceptswithin the scope of the Takiwasi treatment program. Ourinformants hence had to be knowledgeable in this specic implementation of traditional Amazonian medicine. How- ever, this requirement at the same time limits the degreeto which our ndings can be generalized to represent Amazonian conceptions beyond that clinical context. Like- wise, some of the participants had received Western health-related training in addition to the traditional Amazonian training, which may partially account for the coherence of their responses with Western concepts. The fact thatour participants relied on Spanish terminology such as curandero/a to denote their profession also alludes to their embeddedness in a westernized cultural context, sincethese terms reflect a Hispanic rede nition of originally indi- genous concepts and terminologies (e.g., unlike the Amazonian Trio tribe, which uses the term '' pijai'' rather than curandero/a 43). Furthermore, we did not collect in- depth data on participants' char acteristics, their cultural afliation and proximity, thei r specic teachers, or their motives for working at Takiwasi. This would have facilitatedcontextualization of results and improved the understanding of these expert practitioners' roles within the cross-cultural medical context. We also did not elaborate on the back-ground history of the Takiwasi Center and its evolution, 44 nor did we discuss the center's role as a boundary object(i.e., as an artifact acting at the boundary of different worldsand involved in the coordination between them 17,18)i nt h e wider sociocultural context, as this was beyond the scope of this work. Finally, we did not explore the experts' views on treatment success and retention in the interviews. Futurestudies should aim to do so and, if possible, compare these parameters to conventional SUD treatments, such as other therapeutic communities. This was the rst study to conduct expert interviews with this focus and thus to provid e insight into a largely unex- plored but promising approach. In view of the need forimproved SUD treatments, alternative approaches suchas the Amazonian one clearly warrant scientic atten- tion. Our ndings provide conceptual underpinnings for clinical efcacy studies of this treatment, as well as forinvestigating its transferability to other cultural contexts. Furthermore, understanding cultural convergences and differences with respect to underlying concepts may expandthe cross-cultural understanding of SUDs and aid future cooperation between practitioners from biomedical and traditional systems. The Takiwasi approach may serve asa clinical example in this regard, as traditional healers apply their knowledge to a Western problem and join efforts with Western-trained health professionals, who in turn adoptpractices from the traditional context. We are condent thatthis research will aid the development of enhanced SUD treatments that combine efcacious methods from both medical systems.
