With all of the advancements in modern medicine, people often forget or ignore the benefits of acupuncture. However, acupuncture is one of only a few health care options that has a history encompassing a time frame extending back before 10,000 BC. Over that time, acupuncture has helped millions of people recover from hundreds of sicknesses and heal in a non-invasive, natural way. In fact, the World Health Organization recently released a document describing the many benefits of acupuncture, revealing that this approach to health care has been proven to help with over 28 conditions. With the overwhelming success of acupuncture, our [Redondo Beach acupuncturist](/acupuncturist-redondo-beach-ca/)s at Pro-Active Wellness Center in Redondo Beach have put together this short article to provide you with some basic information about this health care option. Welcome to Pro-Active Wellness Center The success of acupuncture is largely tied to its unique approach to healing. Traditionally, acupuncture has focused on restoring the flow of the body's vital substances which allows the body to heal itself. To accomplish this, acupuncturists focus on creating a balance between the bodies organ systems so that it can function properly. Ancient Chinese medical practitioners labeled one of the body's vital substances as Qi (chee). Qi is what allows a person to function and is responsible for determining a person's health state. HOW DOES ACUPUNCTURE WORK? While the study of acupuncture is complex, practitioners focus on stabilizing the pathways of the Qi which flows through various vessels in the body. It is believed that when these vessels become unbalanced, the cells, organs, and tissues within the body are deprived of their necessary nutrition and other vital substances. Unless these disruptions are corrected in a timely matter, the affected area of the body often becomes diseased or even dies. Conversely, if these vessels are opened up and remain open, normal function in the body can be restored. In fact, many patients report a reduction or absence of symptoms such as pain, tiredness, and nausea immediately upon receiving their first acupuncture treatment. While the Western doctor views the human body mechanically as a machine that needs to be fixed, the Eastern doctor views the human body as a dynamic organism that is capable of thriving when it is in a balanced state. Thus the Western doctor is like a mechanic and the Eastern doctor is like a farmer. Plants cannot be made to grow, rather the correct environment is created so the plants can thrive. WHAT CAN ACUPUNCTURE HELP WITH? The chronic problems we face with our health have three underlying causes. The first is emotional stress. Stress can create imbalance at several levels in our bodies including in our hormones and neurotransmitters which impacts our endocrine and nervous systems. This can impact any organ system or muscle group in our bodies. The second problem is trauma. Traumas occur throughout our life and the effect of them accumulates with time. If the healing from a trauma is interrupted, complete healing might never occur causing a chronic problem. The third problem is toxicity. Unfortunately, we live in a toxic environment. Worse than that, many of us have habits or lifestyles in which we expose ourselves to even more toxins. In any case, toxicity leads to malfunction of our bodies which robs us of our health. With repeated exposure to stress, trauma and toxins, it is easy to understand how our bodies natural state becomes disrupted. While many health care professionals resort to chemical prescription drugs and surgery to treat the symptoms that result from the imbalances, acupuncturists focus on restoring the flow of vital substances and helping the body to heal naturally.
