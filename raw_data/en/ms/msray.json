The only sound is the low hum of the air conditioner working hard to keep the heat and humidity at bay, and for some reason you cannot sleep. You've worked out during the day and you're absolutely exhausted. No matter - the Sandman refuses to visit. If you were to consult a traditional Chinese medical (TCM) practitioner about your predicament, they would almost certainly point to your liver. The function of the liver in traditional Chinese medicine is to regulate the qi, or life force, flowing through the body. In mainstream medicine, the liver is the organ that performs a number of essential biological functions. TCM practitioner Samuel To Ching-san is a graduate of the University of Hong Kong's School of Chinese Medicine and he has a PhD in acupuncture from Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine. He has been practising TCM in Hong Kong for more than 13 years.

So when someone's yin (cool, nighttime energy) and yang (warm, daytime energy) are unbalanced, where there is too much yang that leads to the qi overheating the liver, it eventually becomes liver fire,\" To says.

The liver is like a filter for the entire body, converting the 'yang' qi of the day to 'yin' qi at night, hence creating a balance. If that filter is dirty or blocked, the yang will overflow and you wake up.\" This TCM theory loosely aligns with Western medicine.

To says: \"Heat is all around you in summer, and your liver has to filter all the heat you have absorbed during the day, too.\" According to TCM's holistic approach, the largest contributory factor to imbalances in the liver are day-to-day choices in lifestyle and diet.
