Sincerely, Michael Cheikin MD Medical Director L_iv_2016.r03.a01.doc PRACTICE POLICIES M Cheikin MD Dear Patient: 1/29/2016 f_pp&p21_r20.a02.doc Welcome! We are glad to have the opportunity to wo rk with you. Our mission is to provide high qualit y holistic medicine and physiatry within the constraints of the current health care s ystem. This page will review our policies and proc edures. Please see our website, www.cheikin.com for more information about Holistic Medicine and P hysiatry. 1. In most cases, your health plan will cover: Initial office visits up to 60 minutes (only \"face-to-face time\" is covered; and you will need a referral at the time of visit if you have an HMO) Follow-up office visits between 15-40 minutes (same requirements as initial visit) Conventional lab tests and their review during office visits Conventional medications and treatments prescribed by a physician if on the plan's formulary (and subject to the plan's copays, deductibles and other restrictions) Phone calls to other physicians and practitioners during office visits Counseling of patient Coordination of care with family members during office visits 2. Your health insurance plan will not cover (but a Healthcare Savings Account may cover) these and other services for whi ch there are fees: Holistic Services such as educational materials, co aching, nutrition, acupuncture, yoga, special programs etc. for which there are separate fees \"Non-covered\" lab tests Interpretation of lab tests for which there is no e stablished code or reimbursement by insurance plans Access to special web site materials Copays (due at time of visit) and Deductibles Office visits that go over time \"Case Management\" assistance with health carrier is sues (such as coverage, referrals) and legal/administrative matte rs Phone and email services Phone calls to other practitioners not during offic e visit time Review of tests and other information not during vi sit time (see lab policy, other side) Visit cancellations or time lost due to lateness on your part Copying costs Completion of forms 3. Here are additional policies and procedures that will allow us to provide the best and most cost-ef fective care: a. We will schedule office visits for 30-45 minutes . If you need more time, we can schedule more freq uent visits to cover your medical needs. You can also elect to pay privately if you w ant an extended visit, but this must be scheduled i n advance. b. Because we reserve 30-45 minutes for your visit , for a no-show or cancelled visit with less than t wo full business days (i.e. Thursday 10 am for a Monday 10am visit), there will be a fee of $150. Lateness of more than 15 minutes will ca use your appointment to be cancelled with this fee. If making appointments in advance is difficult for you, you can call the day of your next needed visit for any open appointment slots or to be placed on a waiting list. c. Because of the complex needs of many of our patient s, we sometimes run late up to 45 minutes and canno t guarantee time slots. Please plan your appointment accordingly, i ncluding time for checkout after the visit with the physician. If you cannot work within this parameter, then we can disc uss options during our first visit. d. If your insurance carrier requires a referral, it i s your responsibility to make sure the referral is obtained from your primary care physician before the visit. You will be financially responsible fo r the office visit if a referral is not obtained. If an office visit is cancelled due to lack of referral, you wil l be charged a $150 cancellation fee. e. During office visits, let's be sure to renew pr escriptions. There may be a fee for non-urgent phon e renewals. f. You will be required to provide copies of any do cuments that are pertinent to your care or that you want me to review. Our staff cannot provide such services due to time constraint s. g. While I will try to handle urgent issues related to the care I am providing, over the phone, you ma y need to come in (I will do my best to see you soon) or you will need to go to a l ocal emergency room, urgent care center or primary doctor. h. Forms will be completed at our discretion. Some must be filled by your primary doctor. i. Returned checks will be charged a $30 fee. j. Unfortunately with the increase in deductibles a nd copays, patient responsibility for charges is in creasing. We are required to notify you about our collection policies. Past due balance s will be charged 1.5% per month after 30 days. Ou r collection company charges 26%, to which a handling fee of 6% is added for a t otal collection fee of 32%. Charges go into collect ion ONLY AFTER multiple attempts to collect from you. Please be sure to upd ate us with changes of address and health insurance to help avoid such a scenario. k. You are expected to maintain a relationship with a primary care physician to handle routine medical issues such as medication renewals (for medications not prescribed or adjuste d by me) vaccines, colds, and related conventional care. l. Nutriceutical supplements are provided in the sa me way as pharmaceuticals. We make our best effort to provide effective agents for your problems. We cannot guarantee results and cann ot accept returns except in the case of clear manuf acturing defects. Small portions are available to test some agents at a red uced cost. m. Many of our patients are very sensitive to chemi cals. Therefore, please do not wear any commercial scents or lotions, including those that may remain on previously worn clothes. Due to the ongoing malpractice and health insurance crisis in Pennsylvania, many doctors have left the state and/or have stopped participating in insurance plans. Agreeing to these mutual commitments at the beginning of our relatio nship will allow us to make the most of our visits, and allow us to focus on providing y ou with the best quality we can. Thank you in adva nce for your understanding and cooperation. Please feel free to discuss any conce rns you have about the above during our visit(s). I have read and agree to be bound by the above poli cies. I understand that I can print a copy from the website. PLEASE ALSO REVIEW AND SIGN OTHER SIDE ___________________________________________________ _______________________ Patient's (or BOTH parent/guardian's) signature D ate HMO LAB POLICIES M Cheikin MD Dear Patient: 1/29/16 f_p&p_hL_r16.a03.doc With the ever-deteriorating \"coverage\" by insuranc e carriers, there has been confusion and frustratio n over responsibility for visit referrals and payment and interpretation of laboratory studies. Most holistic practices do not participate in health insurance plans because of th ese difficulties. While we \"accept\" most insurance plans for medically necessary office visits, our patients are required to be pro-active regarding their coverage and their laboratory studies. The following policies apply: 1. It is your responsibility to understand your cov erage, and to review your policy with your carrier before accepting any services, whether medical, lab or other. Because of the huge numbers of insurance plans, we are unable to manage the specifics of your plan. It is your responsibility and entitlement to know how your plan works. There is no guarantee that any service will be covered by your carrier. S ome plans capitate to specific labs (i.e. Quest or LabCorp). 2. We have no input or control over your insurance carrier's policies regarding coverage, deductibles, co-pays, exclusions or what they deem (often arbitrarily) to be \"experimental\". We will do our best to provide appropriate diagnostic codes and treatment codes to medically j ustify the services provided and the labs ordered. Only medically necessary and conventional services and labs will b e ordered for coverage by your insurance. 3. Non-conventional services and labs (i.e. acupunc ture, yoga, heavy metal tests, halide tests, etc.) that we believe are not covered by insurance (such as homocysteine not cove red by Aetna) will be your responsibility. As best as we dknow, we will tell you in advance before such services or studies are performed. 4. If you know that your carrier does not \"cover\" c ertain important labs (such as homocysteine by Aetn a) that are provided by conventional labs such as Quest or LabC orp, we can often perform the lab at a discount com pared to what you might pay. In such cases, we must work out the details in advance. 5. Some of the \"non-covered\" lab costs, including c o-pays, deductibles, and non-conventional labs may be submitted for reimbursement if you have a HSA (Health Care Saving s Account) or MSA (Medical Savings Account). 6. Fees for \"non-covered\" labs provided by our office, which include handling and interpretation, are non - refundable . Under extenuating circumstances, and with prior a pproval by Dr. Cheikin, there may be a partial refu nd provided. You are required to complete any test ki ts within 30 days or by any provided expiration dat e. 7. There will be a minimum fee of $30 to be paid in advance if you request the office staff to assist you in rectifying issues related to your individual carrier's policie s and not within the scope of physician's services (i.e. appropriate diagnostic and lab codes, referrals, etc.) 8. You are responsible for returning for an office vis it within 3-4 weeks after having labs performed , to interpret the labs and to adjust your program accordingly. We cannot send you copies of labs without review and interpretation, because of the medico-legal responsibility for acti ng upon these studies. Furthermore, no insurance company pays for interpretation of many of the labs ordered with in the scope of this holistic practice . If you wish for a interpretation between visits, or do not return for a visit within 6 weeks after having labs done, the re will be a $175 fee to cover the cost of the interpretation without you r presence. This fee cannot be charged to your insu rance company and will be your responsibility. For your safety, without review, labs will only be released to a phy sician who is assuming responsibility for you continued care (i.e . your primary care or other). 9. LabCorp, Quest and most other labs now provide a patient portal to enable you to review and print y our results as they become available. If available, you are responsible for providing a copy to your primary care physicia n. 10. The \"reference ranges\" provided by most labs a re based on a \"typical\" American population and DO NOT represent \"normal\" or \"healthy\". It is potentially dangerous to self-interpret labs that are within and outside of the reference range to self-diagnose without the participation of a licensed physician. I have read and agree to be bound by the above poli cies. I understand that I can print a copy from the website). ___________________________________________________ ____ Patient's (or both guardian's) signature Date PLEASE ALSO REVIEW AND SIGN OTHER SIDE Michael Cheikin MD Holistic Medicine & Physiatry 832 Germantown Pike, Suite 3 Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania 19462 610-239-9901 cheikin.com f_consent_h_r12.a04.doc REQUEST AND CONSENT FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE HOLISTIC MEDICINE PROGRAM I consent and request to participate in the HOLISTI C MEDICINE Program. HOLISTIC MEDICINE is an art of healing involving the evaluation and treatment of t he body, mind and spirit, using a program that is s pecifically tailored to re-establishing balance in the body. M odalities may include, but are not limited to, conv entional (standard) diagnostic testing and treatment, specia l (non-covered) diagnostic testing, special diets, special supplements, herbs, acupuncture, yoga, energy medic ine techniques, ayurvedic and Chinese medical treat ments, mind-body techniques such as meditation, hypnosis, journaling, and breathing exercises. I have been advised to discuss the risks and benefi ts of HOLISTIC MEDICINE with my doctor(s) and other health care practitioner(s), especially if I have any ques tions about participation. I understand that I am expected to continue my usual medical care. I understand that the HOLISTIC MEDICINE Program will not replace, sub stitute for, or provide the routine medical care that shoul d be provided by my primary care physician. I unde rstand that I might be referred back to my primary care physician if the HOLISTIC MEDICINE evaluation suggests an un derlying medical condition that requires further conventiona l and/or urgent medical evaluation and treatment. I recognize that significant sickness or even death could occur as a remote but real possibility of th is therapy which alters function of the body, mind or spirit. I am also aware that HOLISTIC MEDICINE may mask an under lying condition or retard a more exact diagnosis where co nventional or standard therapy(ies) may be known to be indicated. Contra-indications for HOLISTIC MEDICINE may includ e but are not limited to pregnancy, active chemothe rapy and active treatment by another provider. I will i nform my treating physician if any of these conditi ons exist. Certain medications or social habits are known to a ffect the potential results of HOLISTIC MEDICINE an d these include alcohol, tobacco, steroids or narcotics. I will inform my treating physician of use of any su ch substances. The undersigned understands the hazards and potenti al dangers involved in treatment by means of HOLIST IC MEDICINE. The nature and consequences of the above treatment have been fully explained, and the under signed is convinced that the treatment is in the best inte rest of the patient, but that no guarantee of resul ts has been made. I understand that I may withdraw this consent at a ny time. I understand that it usually requires a series of t reatments to significantly change my condition. I have discussed the charges and have made payment arrangements to c omplete this series of treatments. NOTICE OF NON-COVERAGE: Most (if not all) insurance companies (such as Med icare, Medical Assistance, HMO's, etc.) will not cover some or all of the serv ices that this HOLISTIC MEDICINE Program provides. As such, I understand and agree to be personally and fully res ponsible for payment for such non-covered services, or the non- covered portion of such services. I understand tha t there are Holistic Membership and Program fees fo r services that are not covered, and that such fees can not be submitted for reimbursement by my carrier. RESPONSIBILITY AND RELEASE FOR PARTICIPATION IN HOL ISTIC MEDICINE PROGRAM I understand that I have certain responsibilities i n participating in the HOLISTIC MEDICINE PROGRAM. These include, but are not limited to: providing a comple te and honest history, following through on recomme nded tests and treatments, returning for follow-up visits as s cheduled, abiding by the practice policies and proc edures, recognizing the limits of my health insurance plan, and advising my other health care practitioners of my participation in this program.
