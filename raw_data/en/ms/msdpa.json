The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all pregnant women be vaccinated against influenza and pertussis, or whooping cough, to protect both themselves and their babies after birth. When mothers get the Tdap and flu vaccines during pregnancy, some of the antibodies their immune system develops against those diseases are passed through the placenta to the fetus. After birth, the children still have some protection against flu and pertussis from those maternal antibodies. \"Our study helps strengthen the growing evidence of long-term safety of vaccination in pregnancy for infants,\" wrote Lakshmi Sukumaran, MD, MPH, of the CDC Immunization Safety Office, and her colleagues in Pediatrics. In fact, the researchers found that babies whose mothers received the Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis) vaccine were slightly less likely to be hospitalized for respiratory problems. Pertussis, commonly called whooping cough because of the [sound a person makes](http://www.parents.com/videos/v/97819228/what-does-whooping-cough-sound-like.htm) during a coughing fit, rarely kills older children or adults but can kill babies. Family members, [especially siblings](http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2015/09/08/siblings-give-babies-more-pertussis-than-moms-do/#52a3ea23263a), are those most likely to pass pertussis on to a newborn. Previous studies have already looked at the [safety of the flu](http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2014/11/25/safety-of-flu-and-pertussis-vaccines-in-pregnancy-assessed/#5f497062bdbe) and [pertussis vaccines](http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2015/10/20/pertussis-booster-in-every-pregnacy-safe-for-mother-and-child-study-finds/#5afab7b2375f) during pregnancy. (The evidence related to the [safety of the flu vaccine in pregnancy](http://www.redwineandapplesauce.com/2014/01/08/the-real-story-on-the-flu-vaccine-during-pregnancy/) is particularly extensive, and the evidence on [Tdap during pregnancy](http://www.redwineandapplesauce.com/2014/11/25/safety-of-the-tdap-in-pregnancy-and-exploring-the-evidence-for-pertussis-cocooning/) is catching up fast.) In fact, babies whose mothers got the Tdap vaccine had [even greater protection against pertussis](http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2017/04/03/pertussis-vaccine-in-pregnancy-protects-9-of-10-newborns-from-whooping-cough/#1de960627118) than the protection offered by the first two infant vaccines against pertussis. Similarly, [mothers who get the flu vaccine](http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2017/08/02/mothers-flu-vaccination-in-pregnancy-protects-newborns-even-the-second-time-around/#6599fcf93294) are [protecting their babies against the flu](http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2016/05/03/a-flu-shot-during-pregnancy-protects-babies-from-flu-up-to-6-months-later/#561a09ee5087) for at least 6 months after birth. Further, researchers aren't aware of any way either vaccine could cause death or hospitalization in older or younger infants. Nevertheless, since some mothers don't get either vaccine because they worry about the safety of the vaccines, particularly during pregnancy, the researchers wanted to learn about any risks beyond the newborn period. The researchers used the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) to investigate whether infant hospitalizations or deaths were linked in any way to their mothers' getting the flu or Tdap vaccines during pregnancy. The VSD tracks approximately 10 million people's health records every year, including 125,000 pregnant women, from eight U.S. health care systems. For this study, the researchers used the five sites whose patients make up more than 90% of the overall VSD population: Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation in Wisconsin and Kaiser Permanente systems in Oakland, Pasadena, Denver and Portland. Of the 413,034 live births from 2004 to 2014 in the database, 25,222 babies were hospitalized and 157 died in their first six months. (The study excluded twins and other multiples, preterm births (before 34 weeks), babies with birth defects, those who died during birth due to pregnancy complications and those who died or were hospitalized because of injury or poisoning.) The researchers then compared the infants in what's called a \"case-control study.\" That is, they separated the \"cases\" (hospitalizations and deaths) from the \"controls\" (no hospitalization or death) and looked at the percentage of infants in each group whose mothers had received the Tdap or flu vaccine during pregnancy. When the researchers compared the risk of hospitalization or death among those whose mothers did or didn't receive either vaccine, they found no difference. A baby's exposure to the mother's flu vaccine in the womb did not increase the risk of death or hospitalization, and neither did exposure to the Tdap vaccine in utero. Of the babies who were hospitalized, however, 2.2% had flu and 3% had pertussis. About half of all infants under 4 months old who contract pertussis are hospitalized, and somewhere from two to seven infants per 1,000 under 6 months old end up in the hospital from flu. The most common causes of death among infants in the study were unknown causes, sudden infant death syndrome and conditions developed at birth. The researchers also looked at vaccination trends across the decade of the study period. There were several jumps in vaccination rates, such as flu vaccine increases after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and Tdap increases after California's 2010 pertussis epidemic and the CDC's 2012 recommendation for Tdap during every pregnancy. Neither infant deaths nor hospitalizations, however, showed any increase during these times. This isn't the first study to look at long-term outcomes of children whose mothers received the Tdap or flu vaccine during pregnancy. Past studies have looked at children's growth curves through 7 months old, their rate of chronic conditions up to 1 year old, and their development scores just past 1 year old. None of these showed any differences among children whose mothers did and did not receive flu or pertussis vaccines either. The bottom line: so far, there is no evidence that getting the flu or pertussis (Tdap) vaccines during pregnancy causes any harm to the developing fetus, but there is a lot of evidence showing that these vaccines protect the baby after birth.
