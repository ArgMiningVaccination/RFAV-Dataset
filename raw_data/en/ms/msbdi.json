Professor Holston's influential scholarship on citizenship and the anthropology of Brazil has served as an indispensab le model for my own work. Over the past seven years, I have been deeply inspired by hi s insistence upon maintaining excellence in anthropological inquiry; the elegance with which he presents his arguments; and his commitment to making anthropology relevant to the problems of modern society. Professor Holston's example of careful scholarship combined with intellectual fervor will always remain with me. I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to my co-chair , Professor Nancy Postero, who has been a fantastic mentor throughout the conc eption and execution of my doctoral project. Professor Postero's expertise in Latin Ame rican and political anthropology has marked my work in important ways. Her dedication to theoretical rigor and the public relevance of anthropology are complemented by her u nique gift for mentoring junior scholars. Professor Postero has been a steadfast so urce of encouragement and a powerful role model along the way. Professor Thomas Csordas has supported and influen ced my scholarship in numerous ways. Most importantly, having the opportu nity to work with him led me to pursue medical anthropology. Professor Csordas expr essed interest in my research from the beginning, and he gave me the fortuitous opport unity to participate in a U.S.-Brazil Consortium focused on health, cultural diversity, a nd social inequality. My involvement in the Consortium broadened my academic horizons an d helped pave the way for the ix realization of my doctoral project. I am grateful f or his kind guidance and support throughout my doctoral program. I am grateful to have an eminent sociologist of ra ce like Professor Evans on my doctoral committee. I was initially drawn to his wo rk on apartheid in South Africa because part of my family has lived there in exile for decades. When I first presented my research proposal to him several years ago, Profess or Evans reassured me of its relevance and contribution to the social study of race. Since then, he has received my updates with constant kindness and encouragement. His collaborat ion has been a tremendous boon. Professor Gerald Doppelt graciously agreed to join my committee toward the end of the project, and he has been an excellent additi on. His detailed, elegant work in political philosophy, and particularly his scholars hip on multiculturalism and liberalism, has helped me to think through challenging and ofte n contradictory terrain. I particularly appreciate his critical feedback on the theoretical foundations of my project. This project would never have left the paper, had it not been for the exceptional generosity of numerous Brazilians who extended thei r expertise, time, and friendship to an endlessly curious and stubbornly persistent anth ropologist-in-training. I can only imagine how odd it must be to have a stranger arriv e in one's life out of nowhere, and ask to shadow him or her while relentlessly posing odd questions. Thus, I was humbled by the willingness of people in the field to share the ir lives with me. The \"fieldwork\" experience went far beyond academic exploration and taught me a great deal about human kindness and solidarity. My research was generously funded by a Fulbright-H ays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad fellowship, and by a National Scienc e Foundation Doctoral Dissertation x Improvement Grant. Pre-doctoral fieldwork was made possible by grants from the UCSD Center for Iberian and Latin American Studies, the UCSD Institute for International and Comparative Area Studies, and the FIPSE-CAPES U.S.- Brazil Consortium project directed by Professor Thomas Csordas. The UCSD Depa rtment of Anthropology provided me with fellowships and teaching assistant ships, as well as office space, during my program. During my two years of write-up at UC B erkeley, I was fortunate to receive office space from the Department of Anthropology, a nd to participate in Professor Stanley Brandes' dissertation writing workshop. I a m deeply grateful for all of this assistance. While I was in Brazil, several respected anthropol ogists helped to mentor me. These include Professors S\u00e9rgio and Mundicarmo Ferr etti, who graciously invited me to participate in their research group and even shared ethnographic forays with me. I greatly appreciated the opportunity to discuss my research with these renowned scholars of Afro- Brazilian religion in Maranh\u00e3o and their bright, cr eative students. In S\u00e3o Paulo, Professors Carlos Eug\u00eanio Moura, Vagner Gon\u00e7alves d a Silva, and Jos\u00e9 Guilherme Magnani also extended kind and helpful guidance. Pr ofessor Esther Hamburger, a colleague of my chair Professor Holston, provided c rucial support with logistical matters of fieldwork. During the past several years, I have been fortuna te to have the steadfast support of friends in the U.S. and Brazil. In particular, I want to thank my dissertation-writing partner at UC Berkeley, James Battle, for helping m e stay the course; my dear friends Lotta Rao and Mana Barari for providing much-needed emotional support and laughter; and my roommate-turned-friend Angela Arthur for giv ing me a safe haven during the xi final stretch. I am also grateful to my wonderful c olleagues at the UCSD Department of Anthropology, and in particular to Paula Saravia an d Jorge Montesinos for their kind hospitality and support during my defense. In Berke ley, I am also indebted to my supervisor from the Ford Foundation's Difficult Dia logues Initiative, Dr. Hilda Hern\u00e1ndez-Gravelle, for her tremendous and consiste nt kindness, patience, and compassion. In Brazil, I am grateful to Viviane Bar bosa for easing my stay in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds; Luana Negrelly for being a great roommate, fellow an imal lover and friend in S\u00e3o Paulo; and Kathy Knight Depintor for her gringa companionship in S\u00e3o Paulo. Though they are thousands of miles away, my family has been my rock throughout this process. They have supported me thr ough my unconventional life choices, endured my stress-induced histrionics, and above all reassured me that I could reach my goals. My mother, Lynn DeMarcus Pagano, ha s encouraged me through thick and thin. To say how much I admire and appreciate h er strength and humor would not be enough. Quite simply, I owe everything to her. My b rother, Matthew Pagano, has provided big-brotherly guidance and has often taken late-night calls \"for the team\" despite the time difference. He has helped me to la ugh at my own follies and has brought me joy during difficult times. The newest addition to our family, Jim Soll, has often lent an ear and given me helpful advice. I admire his ki ndness and gentle approach to life, and I aspire to become more like him. Finally, during t he writing of this dissertation I have thought frequently of my father, Dr. Roberto Pagano . He is responsible in large part for my academic pursuits and for much of who I am. I wo uld have loved for him to see this day. xii VITA 1998 Bachelor of Arts, University of Florida 2002 Master of Arts, University of Florida 2005-2006 Teaching Assistant, Department of Anthrop ology University of California, San Diego 2007 Research Assistant California Department of Health Services/UC San D iego 2009-2011 Research Associate Ford Foundation, Difficult Dialogues Initiative Berkeley and Oakland, CA 2011 Doctor of Philosophy, University of Californi a, San Diego PUBLICATIONS Pagano, Anna. 2006.

FIELD OF STUDY Major Field: Sociocultural Anthropology xiii ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION Health in Black and White: Debates on Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities in Brazil by Anna Pagano Doctor of Philosophy in Anthropology University of California, San Diego Professor James Holston, Chair Professor Nancy Postero, Co-Chair In 2006, the Brazilian Health Council approved a Na tional Health Policy for the Black Population. The Policy is striking because it promotes the image of a biologically and culturally discrete black population in a natio n where racial classification has historically been relatively fluid and ambiguous. I t transforms established patterns of racialization by popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra ) to be considered a special- needs group by the public health apparatus. This co nstruction resembles the United States' dominant mode of racialization based on hyp odescent and represents a significant xiv departure from hegemonic portrayals of Brazil as a racially mixed nation. Furthermore, the Policy challenges national ideologies of racial and cultural unity by affirming the existence of an essential black body with specific health concerns, as well as an essential Afro-Brazilian culture that materializes in recomme ndations for culturally competent health care. As such, the Policy constitutes an imp ortant site for new negotiations of racial and cultural identity in Brazil. In this dissertation, I explore the political and s ocial implications of treating racial and ethnic groups differently within Brazilian heal th care. I examine how the re- definition and medicalization of racial and cultura l identities unfolds in public clinics, temples of Afro-Brazilian religion, and social move ments based in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Through an analysis of ethnographic data that I collected over twenty-four months, I assess the impact of recent developments in race-conscious health policy on Brazilians' lived experiences of race, ethnicity, a nd health disparities. I argue that the new Policy, and its associated hea lth programs, signals the emergence of a new biopolitical paradigm in which t he Brazilian state formalizes citizens' racial and ethnic differences in order to address inequalities among them. I also show that many aspects of these programs, which inc orporate global discourses and concepts related to health equity, fail to resonate with Brazilian citizens' notions about race and health. Consequently, patients and healthc are providers often resist the new measures. The result is a disjuncture between polic y and practice that ultimately hinders Brazil's efforts to reduce health inequalities amon g its citizens. 1 PART I: RACE, MEDICINE, AND BIOPOLITICS IN BRAZIL Chapter 1: Introduction Recently, in response to over two decades of mobili zation by black movement activists and health professionals, the Brazilian g overnment implemented a National Health Policy for the Black Population. This health initiative is striking because it promotes the image of a biologically and culturally discrete black population in a nation where racial classification has historically been r elatively fluid and ambiguous. 1 In so doing, it transforms established patterns of racial ization by (popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra ) to be treated as a special-needs group by the pub lic health apparatus. This construction resembles the United States' domi nant mode of racialization based on hypodescent and represents a significant departure from hegemonic portrayals of Brazil as a racially mixed nation. 2 The new Policy, and its associated race-conscious health programs, signals the emergence of a new biopolitical paradigm in Brazil. Under this new paradigm, the state formalizes citizens' racial and ethnic differences in order to address inequalities among them. Other examples include race-based affirmative action programs in higher education and employment, which Brazil implemented in 2001. A lthough these biopolitical maneuvers have raised awareness about the extent of inequalities by skin color, they have also contributed to increased racial essentialism i n the public sphere. More than ever before, Brazilians are making citizenship claims ba sed on supposed biological and 1 E.g., Harris (1974). 2 See Davis (1999), Silva (1998), Schwarcz (1993), a nd Skidmore (1993a) on political and intellectual discourses of race mixing and nationhood, particula rly during the Vargas regime (1930-1945). 2 cultural differences among them. This is especially the case in the arenas of health policy, health activism, and medical research. In \"fixing\" the black population numerically and politically, the state reinforces the image of an e ssential black body with unique health concerns, as well as an essential Afro-Brazilian cu lture that emerges in \"culturally competent\" health care programs directed toward bla ck citizens. There is little question that significant health d isparities exist in Brazil between racialized groups. This fact is demonstrated by a s pate of epidemiological studies produced by Brazilian researchers in recent years. These studies have only begun to appear in the last few years because prior to the l ate 1990s, the Brazilian public health system did not record patients' race data. Since th e Ministry of Health mandated the collection of these data, researchers have been abl e to demonstrate that black Brazilians die in greater numbers than whites ( brancos ) from HIV/AIDS, homicide, alcoholism and mental illness, stroke, diabetes, and tuberculosis (e.g., Ara\u00fajo et al. 2009, Batista 2005, Batista et al. 2004, Santos et al. 2007). They have also shown that blacks experience higher rates of maternal and infant mortality in co mparison to whites (e.g., Martins 2006). In fact, black women's ( pretas ) maternal mortality rates were seven times those o f whites in 2001 (Chor & Lima 2005). As of 2000, blac k Brazilians' ( pretos and pardos ) life expectancy was 5.3 years less than that of whi tes (Cunha 2008). This scenario represents a serious public health problem for Braz il, particularly given that just over half of the Brazilian population now identifies as eithe r preto or pardo (IBGE 2009). As in the United States, Brazilian epidemiologists have not yet reached a consensus about the etiology of these disparities. Are they caused principally by widespread socioeconomic inequality? Racial discrim ination in health care? Genetic or 3 lifestyle characteristics? At first glance, socioec onomic status would seem to be the most likely cause based on the unrelenting correlation b etween skin color and life chances in Brazil (Lovell & Wood 1998). Blacks ( pardos and pretos ) represent nearly three-fourths of the poorest ten percent of Brazilians. Meanwhile , whites account for nearly 83 percent of the richest one percent (IBGE 2009). Furthermore , the illiteracy rate for pretos and pardos in 2008 reached a total of twenty-seven percent (1 3.3 and 13.7 percent, respectively), whereas for whites it was only 6.2 p ercent (ibid). Many Brazilian epidemiological studies attribute h ealth disparities to poverty, arguing that residing in poorly served areas interf eres with treatment access and adherence (e.g., Batista 2005). Others, however, sh ow that racial health disparities persist even after controlling for factors such as income a nd education (e.g., Barata et al. 2007). Meanwhile, explicitly racialist studies are becomin g increasingly commonplace in Brazil; more and more researchers assume that medically sig nificant differences exist a priori between \"blacks\" and \"whites,\" and thus set out to test hypotheses based on that assumption (e.g., Jaime et al. 2006, Ribeiro et al. 2009, Vale et al. 2003). Complicating the picture further is a pervasive pr oblem of statistical ambiguity. Many recent epidemiological studies do not separate \"preto\" and \"pardo\" into separate categories, but instead lump them together to form the epidemiological category of \"negro.\" This practice is endorsed by social demogr aphers of Brazil such as Lovell & Wood (1998) and Silva (1988), who argue that indivi duals switch more frequently between these self-declared categories than between either \"preto\" or \"pardo\" and \"branco\" (white). These demographers also claim tha t similarities between pretos' and pardos' life chances (i.e., educational attainment, income, life expectancy) justify 4 consolidating the two categories within statistical analyses (Wood & Carvalho 1988, Silva 1985). When it comes to health data, however, the consoli dation approach obscures internal variations between pretos' and pardos' epi demiological profiles. For instance, recent epidemiological studies show that pardos' mo rbidity and mortality patterns are either similar to those of whites (Chor & Lima 2005 , Cardoso et al. 2005) or are intermediate between those of blacks and whites (Lo tufo et al. 2007, Fonseca et al. 2007, Lessa et al. 2006). In spite of these findings, the Brazilian government has opted to institute a black health initiative that combines b lacks and browns into a single epidemiological category, and treats them as a homo genous population within Brazilian public health care. In this dissertation, I will ex amine the sociopolitical origins and consequences of that decision. In addition to examining the implications of this n ew biopolitical paradigm for Brazilian ideologies of race and citizenship, my an alysis engages a broader debate concerning racial profiling in medicine. While some scholars argue that race should be purged from medical research altogether (e.g., Full ilove 1998), others maintain that race impacts health in real and measurable ways and shou ld therefore be preserved as a scientific variable (e.g., Risch et al. 2002). My o wn position approximates Troy Duster's (2003b) argument that, since social stratification among racialized groups produces health disparities over time, race-conscious resear ch and policy can be important tools for addressing the health effects of racism. However, i f these tools describe and operationalize race in an uncritical manner, they m ay also contribute to the reification of 5 racial differences (Duster 2005). 3 Indeed, race-specific health policies can easily b ecome critical sites for the production of re-biologized discourses of race because they often (re)inscribe differing biological phenomena between racialized groups. Even when policy rationales attribute health disparities to both bio logical and social factors, the process of defining a racialized body according to health crit eria has a race-naturalizing effect. This topic is timely because in the last few decade s, race has regained vigor as a primary site of action and investigation within the domains of epidemiology, public health, pharmacology, and genomics in societies acr oss the globe. The contemporary medicalization of race represents a revival of simi lar practices in various locales during the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth cen turies (e.g., Epstein 2004, Laguardia 2005). Despite its promised health benefits, howeve r, the re-introduction of race as a central variable in medical research and practice r emains controversial. Many scholars have issued warnings about the possible consequence s of affirming race as a biological reality, such as increased racism, eugenics, and ge nocide in extreme cases (e.g., Stepan 1991). With this in mind, I argue that even ostensi bly antiracist initiatives and discourses, like the ones I analyze here, must be alert to race -naturalizing elements. In addition to raising concerns about the medical ization of race, the case of race- conscious health care in Brazil invokes the problem of reconciling citizenship equality with special recognition and/or rights for certain kinds of citizens. As Holston (2008) has argued, the doling out of special treatment to subg roups of citizens is a fundamental feature of Brazilian citizenship. In Brazil, women are permitted to retire five years earlier 3 I assume that biological human \"races\" do not exis t. Rather, I use the term \"race\" to signify a shift ing social construct that can nevertheless impact healt h due to social stratification and exclusion. So as not to compromise readability, I have avoided placing the word \"race\" in quotes throughout the body of the te xt. 6 than men; college-educated prisoners have the right to a private cell; and senior citizens are allowed to go to the front of the line in all p ublic spaces, including public clinics and hospitals. These examples of \"differentiated citize nship,\" as Holston calls them, have never generated substantial controversy among Brazi lians\u2014perhaps because, as Holston points out, group-differentiated rights have histor ically benefitted elites. Race-based affirmative action, by contrast, mainta ins the regime of differentiated citizenship but favors those with less power. Affir mative action has therefore met with significant resistance since its inception in 2001, when the Brazilian government began to implement quotas for black ( preto ) and brown ( pardo ) citizens in some sectors of federal employment and several public universities. In some cases, quotas are also set aside for indigenous citizens and/or for former students of B razil's beleaguered public school system. Citizens have responded to the quotas with public outrage and lawsuits; many Brazilians believe affirmative action amounts to st ate-sponsored racism (e.g., Veja 2006). Prior to the advent of affirmative action, Brazil h ad never formalized citizens' racial differences\u2014at least, not since slavery ended in 18 88. Even in times of slavery, the crown made legal distinctions based on individuals' status as slave, freed ( liberto ), or free, as opposed to their race per se (Holston 2008 ). The new race-based affirmative action policies in education and health, therefore, represent a striking reversal of the Brazilian state's historical reticence on race with in the realm of policy. Affirmative action in health care, however, is dis tinct from affirmative action in education because Brazil's new initiative does not mandate health care quotas for black citizens, give them special priority in the clinics , or afford them the right to special treatment. Rather, it makes the moral claim that ci tizens who self-identify as black 7 (negro /a) should be recognized as physically and culturally different from the res t of the population, at least in regard to health care. Braz il's National Health Policy for the Black Population, then, embeds both a politics of recogni tion and a politics of difference, but not a substantial politics of redistribution. The l imited redistribution that occurs lies in the state's reallocation of public funds to promote sci entific research on the health specificities of the black population, in addition to financing public forums and educational materials on black health issues. These measures carry significant symbolic weight but, I argue, are negligible in terms of ame liorating health disparities or changing public health practice on a grand scale. For several reasons, it is difficult to situate th is case vis-\u00e0-vis the vast body of literature on reconciling group rights and individu al rights within liberal democracies (e.g., Taylor 1994, Kymlicka 1995, Benhabib 2002, Y oung 1990). First, Brazil is not a liberal democracy in the classic sense. It is close r to a social democracy due to the state's strong emphasis on social rights. Second, as stated above, race-conscious health policy in Brazil does not extend special rights to black citi zens, at least not in the sense of obligating health care providers to treat self-iden tified black patients differently. The literature cited above, by contrast, addresses legi slated group rights within such spheres as political representation and legal pluralism, as opposed to recognition in and of itself. Nevertheless, a few concepts from the literature on multicultural citizenship are useful for understanding the cultural politics of r ace-conscious health care in Brazil. One is what Taylor refers to as \"cultural survival\" and Kymlicka calls \"polyethnic rights.\" Polyethnic rights include legal protection and/or g overnment funding for certain cultural practices of minority groups, with the goal of help ing these groups to integrate more 8 effectively into the wider society (Kymlicka 1995: 30-31). \"Cultural survival\" implies state protection for the maintenance of minority gr oups' cultural traditions (Taylor 1994: 61). There is an element of state protection for cu ltural survival when, under the new black health initiative, the Brazilian state funds conferences on Afro-Brazilian religious healing, as well as cultural competence training fo r public health employees on Afro- Brazilian religious practices. Furthermore, by fund ing cultural competence training, the state indirectly attempts to protect the right of A fro-Brazilian religious practitioners to non-discrimination within public health care on the basis of creed. In affiliation with the new black health initiative, members of Afro-Brazil ian religions have launched a movement against religious intolerance within publi c health care facilities. I discuss this movement in detail in Part III. Taylor's (1994) theorization of multiculturalism a nd the politics of recognition also helps to elucidate the case I analyze here. Ta ylor frames his discussion in terms of the tension between the politics of universalism, o r equal recognition, and the politics of difference. The politics of equal recognition arise s from a \"difference-blind\" liberal tradition that upholds human dignity as a universal value. Universalism implies identical rights for all citizens, while the politics of diff erence entails differentiated citizenship claims by specific individuals or groups. Despite t he apparent opposition between the two orientations, Taylor argues that the politics of di fference is actually informed by a presupposition of universal and equal human potenti al, which he interprets as the equal right of all members of society to assert their own identity and to have it recognized by others. The paradoxical result is that \"the univers al demand powers an acknowledgement 9 of specificity\" (39). As I show in Parts II and III , advocates of the new health initiative for black Brazilians make the same argument. This tension between universalism and the politics of difference emerges in the case at hand because the Brazilian health care syst em is based on a strong universalist philosophy that proclaims the value of equal treatm ent for all citizens. Although the National Health Policy for the Black Population does not currently mandate differentiated treatment according to race, the emergence in Brazi l of a special area of medicine devoted to black patients' particular needs has spa rked protest from Brazilian intellectuals, scientists, and health care professi onals who interpret the Policy as racist (e.g., Fry et al. 2007). Furthermore, the idea that practitioners of Afro-Brazilian religions should be allowed to wear their religious ornaments during certain kinds of medical examinations, while other patients must remove all ornamentation, constitutes a claim for differentiated treatment. Thus far, though, I have heard only anecdotal evidence that some public health providers have refused to accomm odate these patients' religious- based needs. In contrast to affirmative action quot as in higher education, opposition to the black health initiative has not yet escalated t o the level of litigation. Although Brazil's new black health initiative does not currently entail legally enforceable special rights for black patients, I ar gue that it has important implications for biopolitical citizenship. Biopolitical citizenship can be defined as the relationship of citizens to the nation-state in matters of not only biological life and health, but also \"political representation and inclusion in the poli ty and society\" as enacted through these realms (Epstein 2007:13). As Epstein notes in his s tudy of U.S. minority activism for inclusion in clinical research, \"biomedical inclusi on was not just a matter of counting up 10 bodies; it also was a broader indicator of 'who cou nted.'\" (2007: 90). Epstein's formulation of biopolitical citizenship, aptly char acterized in this quote, is useful for understanding some of the aims and effects of Brazi l's new black health initiative. This case differs in important ways, however, from both affirmative action in higher education and the case of U.S. minority heal th activists described by Epstein. Affirmative action claims within Brazilian higher e ducation and public employment rest entirely on the premise that racism leads to unequa l educational and socioeconomic outcomes for black and brown Brazilians as compared to whites. These claims make no reference to biological differences by race. Meanwh ile, in Epstein's analysis, minority health activists demanded to be included in biomedi cal research on the grounds of supposed biological differences that were already w idely accepted within U.S. society; therefore, the process of \"categorical alignment,\" or \"the merging of social categories from the worlds of medicine, social movements, and state administration,\" encountered little resistance (13). Brazilian black health acti vists, by contrast, have had to import the discourse of medically significant racial differenc es wholesale from abroad, complete with racial categories informed by hypodescent, and have therefore faced an uphill battle in convincing many Brazilian healthcare providers, health officials, and researchers to take their concerns seriously. At the same time, as I will show, international pressure and socially liberal political regimes conspired to fac ilitate the creation of the black health agenda in Brazil. The case I analyze is similar in some aspects to t he one described by Petryna (2002), in which Ukrainian citizens demanded repara tory treatment from the government based on health damages incurred from Chernobyl. Pe tryna interprets their claims as the 11 exercise of \"biological citizenship,\" which she arg ues is instantiated when the \"biology of a population has become the grounds for social memb ership and the basis for staking citizenship claims\" (2002: 5). Although biology is certainly a significant part of the citizenship claims made by Brazilian black health a ctivists, it is not simple biology or the right to protection of \"bare life\" (Agamben 1995) t hat underlies their claims. Rather, they demand to be included in a specific way. Their clai ms are based on the choice to identify, and to be identified, as an innately different kind of citizen, as opposed to a citizen who acquires special needs following a disaster (as des cribed by Petryna). On the Brazilian Census, and on the patient race forms now utilized within public clinics and hospitals, citizens (at least in theory) declare their own rac ial identity. Black health activists' campaign to re-constitute \"black\" and \"brown\" as \"n egro\" expresses their intent not only to massify the black population for stronger politi cal representation, but also to be counted in a particular way. Another important aspect of Petryna's analysis tha t pertains to Brazil's black health initiative is the concept of compensatory ju stice. Alongside their claims for specialized health care, Brazilian black health act ivists demand reparation for health damages incurred due to racism. In these compensato ry claims, they attribute health disparities to not only racial discrimination withi n public clinics and hospitals, but also to generalized social inequalities between blacks and whites. Activists identify entrenched racism as the ultimate cause of inequalities in hea lth, housing, education, and the like. In making these claims, activists construct the Brazil ian black population as \"vulnerable\" (vulner\u00e1vel ) and hold the Brazilian state responsible for rect ifying black citizens' bodily suffering, if not the underlying social inequalitie s that produced them. In the 12 compensatory aspect of their claims, activists invo ke the principle of citizenship equality by demanding equal access to public health services . Taking Brazil's new race-conscious health progra ms as a point of departure, this dissertation examines how citizens in two contrasti ng Brazilian cities, S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and S\u00e3o Paulo, negotiate the contentious issue of formalizi ng racial and ethnic differences for health purposes. Through an analysis of ethnographi c data that I collected over twenty- four months in public clinics, low-income neighborh oods, and temples of Afro-Brazilian religion, I assess the impact of recent development s in race-conscious health policy on Brazilians' lived experiences of race, ethnicity, a nd health disparities. I show that race- conscious programs designed by the state, and infor med by global norms of racial identity and health, contradict well-established no tions of race and health in Brazil. Whereas a relatively small group of Brazilians in s ocial movements and government support the creation of health programs for blacks, non-activist citizens tend to deny the existence of health disparities by race. They also construct racial identity in ways that challenge the race categories deployed within the c ontext of new race-conscious health measures. Furthermore, healthcare providers routine ly circumvent the new initiative in various ways, for instance by neglecting to record their patients' self-declared racial identity. Together, these factors create a disjunct ure between policy and practice that, I argue, ultimately hinders the Brazilian government' s efforts to reduce racial and ethnic health disparities amongst its citizens. In the next section, I provide an overview of key concepts that I employ throughout the dissertation. 13 Note on Language It is difficult to choose appropriate terminology w hen discussing race in any context; this difficulty is compounded when writing in English about Brazil's famously complex system of racial classification. My intenti on is not to import or superimpose North American norms of racial classification, but r ather to present my analysis in as clear a manner as possible. It is challenging to cr eate etic terms for the purpose of analytical distance, given that my Brazilian inform ants use multiple words (e.g., only be meaningfully translated as \"black.\" Eac h of these terms connotes a specific feeling or political message that does not reliably come through in my attempts to translate them directly into English. Throughout th is dissertation, therefore, I use English- language terms such as \"black,\" \"white,\" \"African B razilian\" and \"European Brazilian,\" in addition to emic terminology whenever possible. I am aware that I may be recreating the very \"black/white\" discursive divide I critique in the Brazilian case by using those terms, but I do so for lack of a more precise analy tical lexicon for discussing race in Brazil. Race and Ethnicity At various times throughout human history, \"race\" h as been used in many ways: to describe separate species united under a common human genus (polygenism); distinct genetic subtypes within the human species (monogeni sm); or, most recently, a group of individuals who subscribe to a particular identity based on putative shared biological and/or cultural traits. The concept of ethnicity us ually refers to the sense of cultural difference and shared traditions that members of a group experience vis-\u00e0-vis the larger 14 society in which they are embedded. However, ethnic identity also includes, more often than not, members' belief in a common biological or igin or descent\u2014aspects that also pertain to the concept of race. These concepts are therefore not easily separated. As Wade (1997) observes, the concepts of race and ethnicity are often used interchangeably: Racial identifications use aspects of phenotype as a cue for categorization, but these are seen as transmitted intergenerational ly\u2014through the \"blood\"\u2014 so that ancestral origin is important; likewise eth nicity is about origin in a cultural geography in which the culture of a place is absorbed by a person (almost \"into the blood\") from previous generations . (21) There is, then, a notion of biological inheritance (blood) implicit in both race and ethnicity. Wade makes two other pertinent observati ons: first, that ethnic distinctions are often made within a single race category such as bl ack or white, and vice-versa; and second, that biological clues used to categorize pe ople in terms of race are interpreted in strikingly different ways depending on the cultural /geographical context (20-21). The same phenotype that signifies \"black\" in the U.S., for example, may signify moreno, mulato, or pardo (mixed/brown) in Brazil. These two factors call att ention to the mutable, unstable nature of both racial and ethnic identity. Nevertheless, race continues to animate and inform i dentity politics around the globe. Although social scientists have eschewed the race concept as a unit of sociological and biological analysis for human populations, we f ind ourselves obligated to retain them since they organize the lifeworlds of our informant s (not to mention our own). In this dissertation, I assume that biological human races do not exist. Rather, I use the term \"race\" to signify a shifting social construct that can nevertheless impact health due to social stratification and exclusion. Although I rec ognize that race is a culturally- and historically-contingent social construct, and not a biological reality, I must deal with race 15 and racism here because my informants use this term inology. Additionally, I must unpack their understandings of race as a biological entity as well as a sociocultural one. That being the case, it is important to review the epist emic precursors for the conceptualization of race as biology. Biologization and the Re-Biologization of Race According to Graves (2001), the genealogy of race as a biological concept can be separated into two general phases: pre- and post-Da rwin. Prior to the early fifteenth century, Europeans' awareness of human diversity wa s limited, although social and cultural stratification was well established. Grave s notes that in many areas of Europe, Jews were considered inferior and were believed to carry contagious, blood-borne diseases. There is no evidence, however, that they were considered a biologically distinct type of human. The European conquest missions radic ally changed the way Europeans conceptualized diversity. Western colonialism broug ht highly diverse world populations into close contact, which led to a shift from \"grad ient\" to \"categorical\" understandings of human variation (Brace 2005). This was particularly the case in the Americas, where the juxtaposition of Europeans, indigenous peoples, and later enslaved Africans created a social context that naturalized the idea of absolut e racial difference. The subjugation of indigenous peoples and Africans in colonial context s also introduced a racial hierarchy that was reflected in emerging biological theories of race in Europe. This historical shift is often termed the \"biologization\" of race. French physician Fran\u00e7ois Bernier presented the fi rst formal classification of human races in 1684, although he saw the aggregate of humans as one species \"form\" and races as sub-varieties (after Plato's theory of forms) (Graves 2001). Enlightenment 16 scientists often drew on Aristotle's scala naturae to posit a \"Great Chain races. For example, Linnaeus' Systema Naturae (1735) stratified Homo sapiens into four varieties (European, African, Asian, and American), with Europeans occupying the top rung of the ladder and Africans, the lowest . In general, eighteenth-century naturalists put for th monogenic theories of race, whereas during the nineteenth-century, polygenism b ecame the dominant model for race theories. \"Monogenism\" refers to the theory that hu man races have a common biological origin and thus belong to a single species, while \" polygenism\" denotes the idea that human races are actually separate species. Monogeni sts' belief in the unity of the human species, however, did not prevent them from advanci ng racist theories. Perhaps the most striking example of this was presented by Joseph Ar thur Comte de Gobineau, a monogenist who published his \"Essay the Inequali ty of Human Races\" in 1853-1855. Gobineau divided the human species into three major races: Negroid, Caucasoid, and Mongoloid. He then measured the relative worth betw een each race according to its ability to found a \"great civilization.\" Predictabl y, Gobineau concluded that \"Aryans\" (Caucasoids) were the superior race, while Negroids were the lowest. He also posited racial intermixing as the primary cause of the down fall of great civilizations. His ideas had a profound impact on the racial policies of man y states, including Brazil (where Gobineau served as a diplomat) and Nazi Germany. In addition to numerous other contributions to the field of biology, Darwin's On the Origins of Species (1859) affected the perception of human variation in lasting ways. His theories of evolution and species-level progres s were taken up by racist thinkers who used them to affirm the biological superiority of E uropeans. In his later work Descent of 17 Man (1871), Darwin attempted to debunk polygenist theo ries of race by invoking the principle of interfertility as well as the general likeness of human physical form (Graves 2001). Since humans of different \"races\" could inte rbreed, he reasoned, they must be members of the same species. He also pointed out th at individuals from different racial groups displayed many more physical commonalities t han differences from one another. Furthermore, he argued that humans' physical variat ions were actually gradations that blended into each other so subtly that it complicat ed scientific efforts to group humans into sub-varieties (ibid). Although Darwin did not dispute the thesis of inequality among races, he did offer an alternative explanation for them by attributing supposedly unequal abilities and traits to environmental factors rathe r than to innate incommensurability. Darwin's theories influenced various fields of soc ial as well as scientific inquiry. Social Darwinist theories soon emerged that adapted Darwin's theory of natural selection to create models of social progress and evolution. Herbert Spencer, arguably the most important Social Darwinist, coined the phrase \"surv ival of the fittest.\" This phrase expresses the idea that competition between individ uals and groups in society is what drives social evolution. Spencer devised a Lamarcki an theory of the heritability of acquired social traits, such as culture, intelligen ce, and even social status, from previous generations. The tenets of these Social Darwinist t heories influenced racial science to a great extent, since human races considered inferior were further denigrated by the idea that not only biological deficits, but also social and cultural deficits, could be passed down from generation to generation. These theories also served to legitimate the status quo of social hierarchy by blaming subjugated group s for their disadvantaged position. 18 Another area profoundly marked by the concept of e volution was the burgeoning field of physical anthropology. Early anthropologic al studies of human variation sought to determine racial differences in traits such as i ntelligence. Paul Broca founded the field of physical anthropology in France, while physician Samuel George Morton founded the American School of Anthropology. Both were polygeni sts who examined various aspects of the human anatomy, particularly brain size, to s upport theses of racial inequalities in intelligence and other developmental measures. In his discussion of these historical lowlights of anthropology, Brace (2005) asserts that the biological race concept was the ba sis for the creation of anthropology as a formal academic discipline. Anthropology, in additi on to other fields of study such as craniometry and phrenology, was frequently employed during the nineteenth century in service of scientific racism. \"Scientific racism\" r efers to the use of (pseudo) scientific methods to demonstrate supposedly scientific bases for inequalities between people of different \"races.\" In the United States, scientific racism reached it s peak during the years surrounding the Civil War. Uncertainty regarding th e future of slavery, and later anxiety over the increasing integration of freed slaves int o U.S. society provided powerful stimuli for research that sought to demonstrate blacks' inf eriority as well as the supposed degeneracy that could result from miscegenation. As in other nations undergoing the transition from slavery to emancipation during the nineteenth century, social forces determined the directions of scientific research in the antebellum United States and encouraged the production of racist theories bolste red by apparently neutral scientific methods. 19 Another influential figure of the nineteenth centu ry was Sir Francis Galton, who in 1883 coined the term \"eugenics\" to describe the science of improving human stock through careful mating decisions. 4 Galton argued that the English state should encour age its most intelligent subjects to reproduce at a gre ater-than-average rate in order to compensate for overpopulation among the working cla sses, whom he assumed were less intelligent. Galton termed this problem of overpopu lation among less fit individuals \"dysgenesis\" because their reproduction supposedly brought down the intellectual quality of the population. His ideas were taken up by eugen ics movements in the United States, Latin America, and Europe during the early twentiet h century. Galton's formulation of eugenics is often describe d as \"positive eugenics\" because he recommended increased reproduction among individuals assumed to be fit, as opposed to limiting reproduction among less fit ind ividuals or even eliminating them. The interpretation of Galton's ideas varied conside rably according to national context. In Brazil, for example, Galton's ideas were combined w ith Lamarckian theories that stressed the heritability of acquired traits. This engendered a \"softer\" form of positive eugenics in which public sanitation and hygiene wer e stressed over and above restrictive mating practices (Stepan 1991). In both Brazil and the United States, however, restrictive immigration policies appeared with a view toward ke eping people from Asian and African countries out of the national body, while e ncouraging others to enter freely. The earliest restrictive policy in the U.S. was the Chi nese Exclusion Act of 1882. Beginning in 1913, the U.S. Public Health Service allowed eug enicist Henry H. Goddard to administer IQ tests to immigrants at Ellis Island. The result was an exponential increase 4 Galton, Francis. 1883. Inquiries into Human Faculty and its Development . London: Macmillan. 20 in the number of immigrant deportations based on di agnoses of \"feeble-mindedness\" (Brace 2005). Soon thereafter, Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1924, which instituted nationality quotas and expanded existing restrictions to such an extent that most groups aside from northern and western Europeans we re barred from entering the country. Although eugenics discourses of the early twentiet h century did not always invoke race explicitly, they were key to the biolog ization of race because they reinforced the idea that characteristics such as intelligence and resistance to disease, as well as moral character and degeneration, were heritable traits. These elements have surfaced repeatedly in discourses that biologize race. The e ugenics movement gained popularity in the United States during a time of intense racial s trife and anxiety about the character of the nation. This fact was reflected in the compulso ry sterilization laws and immigration restrictions, as well as frequent lynchings of blac ks in the U.S. South. Eugenics reached its peak around the end of the 19 20s. By the 1930s, a significant number of scientists in the United States and Brita in had begun to doubt its tenets. Just as anthropologists had played a key role in the develo pment of scientific racism, they were instrumental in its dismantling. The investigations of Franz Boas were crucial to challenging theories of racial variation in cranial size and intelligence. By measuring the cranial forms of immigrants to the United States an d their children raised in the U.S., Boas demonstrated the low heritability of head shap e and cranial capacity. The children's crania often changed remarkably in regard to size a nd shape as compared to their parents, and Boas concluded that this was a result of enviro nmental factors such as nutrition. His 21 student Ruth Benedict later published Race, Science, and Politics (1940), which attempted to discredit racist concepts in science a nd linked race science to fascism. During the 1930s, population genetics began to cha llenge earlier theories regarding biological variation and eugenics. Early genetic studies of sickle cell anemia, for example, demonstrated that genetic mutations an d variability could be beneficial in certain environments, rather than absolute liabilit ies. Around the same time, the new technology of electrophoresis began to demonstrate great hemoglobin variability in world populations that did not correspond to existing rac ial categories. In 1946, A.S. Wiener used serological data to show that Australoids and \"Negroids\" (Africans) had different blood allele frequencies, thus contradicting earlie r anthropometric models that had placed them within the same group based on similar phenoty pe. Also in 1946, geneticists Theodosius Dobzhansky and Leslie Dunn produced a st udy titled Heredity, Race, and Society that challenged the concepts of correlation betwee n physical features and mental ones; racial purity; and the inheritance of grouped traits, as opposed to the inheritance of separate traits. This last finding was particularly important, since it indicated that traits such as skin color, for instance, are inherited ind ependently of biologically adaptive genetic traits such as the sickle cell trait. This finding lent scientific validity to the idea that there could be no significant differences in a daptive fitness or ability between so- called \"races\" (Templeton 2003). World War II was another watershed in the \"de-biol ogizing\" of race. The extreme scientific racism deployed by the Nazi regime in th e Holocaust shocked world communities to the extent that theories of scientif ic racism fell out of favor more quickly than might have otherwise happened. In 1950, UNESCO declared in its \"Statement on 22 Race\" that theories of racial inequality were irrat ional and that, in light of the Holocaust, it was important to realize that \"racial groups\" we re more alike than different. The following year, however, UNESCO issued a \"Statement on the Nature of Race and Race Differences\" that characterized the race concept as useful to scientific inquiry in some contexts. Nonetheless, biologized discourses of race were sidelined for several decades following World War II. Although racialist practice s persisted in U.S. identity politics and scientific research during this period, raciali st discourses in policy decreased markedly. Rabinow and Rose (2003) observe that \"the link between biological understandings of distinctions amongst population g roups and their sociopolitical implications seemed broken or at least denaturalize d\" (18). According to Duster (2003a), race re-entered publi c discourse noticeably in the mid- to late 1970s. At that time, scientific journa ls in addition to more general media began to demonstrate a rekindled interest in identi fying genetic explanations for phenomena that had been explained using terms of so cial or environmental models. Due to advances in molecular genetics, scientists began to hypothesize differences in disease course and drug response between African-Americans and whites, which in turn were attributed to genetic differences (e.g., Kahn 2004) . Duster (2003a) questions the theory of genetic causality in relation to heart disease and cancer, noting that whites had exhibited higher rates than blacks of both during the 1930s. Regardless, the last few decades have seen a dramatic increase in the search for genetic markers for disease and in the development of drugs tailored to presumed genetic s pecificities among racial or ethnic groups. These trends have prompted scholars to proc laim the advent of a new era in which race is increasingly medicalized. 23 Medicalization Although there are many definitions of the term, \" medicalization\" generally denotes a process by which problems or conditions t hat were once understood as primarily social are recast as objects of medical i nterest and authority (Zola 1972). Examples include substance abuse, depression, and e ven homelessness (Mathieu 1993). Medical anthropologists have argued that medicaliza tion often preempts political responses to social problems by reinterpreting them as isolated pathologies that afflict individuals, rather than as systemic issues that im pact social groups (e.g., Kleinman, Das, & Lock 1997, Lock & Scheper-Hughes 1996, Rhodes 199 6). Like other forms of social suffering, racism and the disadvantages associated with being a racial or ethnic minority can be medicalized if they are framed as risk facto rs for illness. Additionally, many scholars have argued that race itself is increasing ly medicalized to the extent that \"race groupings have been legitimized by their use in med ical literature and practice as acceptable descriptive labels that are integral to the proper diagnosis and treatment of disease in humans\" (Witzig 1996: 675). Prior to the appearance of the term \"medicalization \" in the social science literature, several scholars had already explored t he encroachment of medicine into an increasingly wide array of social arenas. An import ant contribution of medicalization theories in general is the recognition of medicine as socially constructed, rather than neutral and value-free. Talcott Parsons was one of the first to theorize medicine as an institution of social control. He did so through th e concept of the \"sick role,\" explained as a mechanism that temporarily legitimated the social deviance created by illness episodes (Parsons 1951). According to Parsons' theory, the m edical doctor held great authority due 24 to his power to confer sick roles through diagnosis and to help patients achieve social reintegration through recovery. Michel Foucault was another key theorist in regard to medicalization, as evidenced by his treatises on th e transformation of the folk category \"unreason\" into the psychiatric diagnosis of \"madne ss\" (1965) and on the emergence and consolidation of the medical \"gaze\" (1973). Freidson (1970) and Zola (1972) later drew on Parso ns' work to develop the concept of \"medicalization.\" Freidson described me dicalization in the following critical manner: \"The medical profession has first claim to jurisdiction over the label of illness and anything to which it may be attached, irrespect ive of its capacity to deal with it effectively\" (1970: 251). This viewpoint is charact eristic of the early medicalization theorists, who tended to minimize any positive effe cts stemming from the marked expansion of biomedicine as a primary arbiter of so cial concerns. Instead, they implied that medicalization was actually over -medicalization, and that it was not only unnecessary, but ultimately detrimental. Some polit ical economy theorists, such as Navarro (1986), viewed medicalization as motivated p rimarily by the capitalist expansion of the medical industry, rather than by the goal of optimizing human health. Irving K. Zola, who is often considered the most i nfluential medicalization theorist, also viewed the \"medicalizing of society\" as a consequence of the medical profession's increasing authority over various aspe cts of social life: ...medicine is becoming a major institution of social control, nudging aside, if not incorporating, the more traditional institut ions of religion and law. It is becoming the new repository of truth, the place whe re absolute and often final judgments are made by supposedly morally neut ral and objective experts (1983 [1972]: 247). 25 Subsequent theorists, such as Conrad (1992) and Loc k (2001) have challenged earlier portrayals of medicalization as a totalizing proces s. Conrad offers a much broader definition of medicalization than Zola's: Medicalization consists of defining a problem in me dical terms, using medical language to describe a problem, adopting a medical framework to understand a problem, or using a medical interventi on to 'treat' it. This is a sociocultural process that may or may not involve t he medical profession, lead to medical social control or medical treatment , or be the result of intentional expansion by the medical profession (21 1). He offers an analytic framework of medicalization c omprising three levels: the conceptual, the institutional, and the interactiona l. At the conceptual level, medical vocabulary comes to define a problem or condition, regardless of involvement by the medical institution. At the institutional level, or ganizations adopt a medical framework for treating a problem, with or without medical aut horities\u2014although, he argues, this level often does involve some kind of input from me dical authorities. The interactional level is the one that involves the medical professi on to the fullest extent, because it occurs through doctor-patient interactions where doctors p rescribe medical treatments for \"social\" problems. Conrad's multi-level schema of m edicalization preserves the agency of laypersons by suggesting that at all levels, ind ividuals or subgroups may choose to reject medicalization or actively seek it. Medicalization of Race The \"medicalization of race\" denotes a process thr ough which the race concept is taken up by the domains of biomedical research and practice as a key variable in explaining patterns of variation in human disease. Often, race is treated within these domains not as a social concept or indicator of cul tural behaviors, but rather as a proxy 26 for genetic variation (Root 2003). Although the med icalization of race is commonly portrayed in the literature as a recent phenomenon due to the advent of geneticizing discourses, race has been medicalized for quite som e time now. Epstein (2004) observes that in the nineteenth cen tury, U.S. physicians applied the \"principle of specificity,\" tailoring treatment to the idiosyncrasies of the patient (190). The application of this principle subsided around t he late nineteenth century as U.S. physicians began to adopt the tenets of European sc ientific medicine that treated the illness using a \"one size fits all\" approach (ibid) . The practice of focusing on racial and gender differences in medicine, however, re-emerged in the U.S. around the 1980s. A similar pattern occurred in Brazil, although the ti meline was slightly different. Around the end of the nineteenth century, some notable Bra zilian physicians and psychiatrists advanced theories of medically significant racial d ifferences between blacks, mulatos , and whites. 5 It is not clear, however, whether these theories i nfluenced medical practice to any significant degree. During the twentieth cen tury, these theories subsided and have only re-emerged in the last ten to fifteen years. The literature is replete with examples of histori cal emphases on racial difference in medicine. Comaroff (1993), for instance, describ es how eighteenth-century British missionaries to Africa associated black bodies with myriad kinds of diseases. On a similar note, Tapper (1999) analyzes colonial physi cians' role in establishing a link between African bodies and sickle cell anemia. Late r, medical researchers in the U.S. drew on these physicians' theories to conclude that sickle cell anemia was a \"black\" 5 For instance, Bahian psychiatrist Raimundo Nina Rod rigues conducted forensic studies of alleged criminals. He concluded that mulatos were particularly susceptible to mental instabilit y and criminal insanity, while blacks were so mentally inferior to whites that accused criminals of different \"races\" should be judged using different legal criteria according to their mental capacities (Skidmore 1993). 27 disease based on assumed genetic continuity between Africans and U.S. blacks. Additionally, several scholars show that the ration ale for the Tuskegee syphilis project stemmed from medical experimentation on U.S. slaves that allegedly \"proved\" the existence of medically significant physical differe nces between blacks and whites (e.g., Hickey 2006, Washington 2006). These scholars' anal yses demonstrate the considerable historical depth of race-medicalizing practices; pe rhaps a more apt term is the \"re- medicalization of race.\" Regardless of the terminology used, the contempora ry medicalization of race is enacted in various sites, including biomedical rese arch, health policy, health activism, and pharmaceutical markets. Race in medicine and he alth-based identity politics is so tenacious precisely because pragmatism trumps moral concerns about the possible consequences of medicalizing race. As King (2000) n otes in her discussion of the Tuskegee Syphilis project, the issue of whether to recognize racial differences in medicine or to assume that all subjects are biologi cally the same presents a major dilemma: \"Because medicine is pragmatic, it will re cognize racial differences if doing so will promote health goals. As a consequence, potent ial harms that might result from attention to racial differences tend to be overlook ed, minimized, or viewed as problems beyond the purview of medicine\" (425). Even when it is not clear that medicalizing race will promote health goals, however, market logic an d citizenship claims conspire to ensure the longevity of race in medicine. Although race is now medicalized in different ways and for ostensibly different ends than in the past, it remains a uniquely powerful metaphor for conceptualizing human difference, at e ver-deeper levels and in subtler ways. 28 Biopower and Biopolitics The concepts of biopower and biopolitics help to c larify the link between the medicalization of race and techniques of governance . \"Biopolitics\" refers to the constitution of life and welfare as central targets of modern state techniques for regulating the productive potential of their popula tions (Foucault 1978, Rose 2006). Foucault (1978) asserts that, whereas in the past s overeign power asserted itself by deciding its subjects' life or death, modern forms of state power (especially from the end of the eighteenth century on) are expressed through a \"positive influence on life, that endeavors to administer, optimize, and multiply it, subjecting it to precise controls and comprehensive regulations\" (137). This power over l ife exists in two \"poles\": the \"anatamo-politics of the human body\" and the \"bio-p olitics of the population\" (139). The first is dedicated to increasing the (individual) b ody's productive potential, while the second is focused on regulating the population at l arge. The main purview of biopolitics is \"public hygiene, with institutions to coordinate medical care, centralize power, and normalize knowledge\" (2003: 244). Accordingly, biop olitics is often channeled through \"campaigns to teach hygiene and to medicalize the p opulation\" (ibid). Within Foucault's analytical scheme, medicine thus emerges as \"a powe r-knowledge that can be applied to both the body and the population, both the organism and biological processes, and it will therefore have both disciplinary effects and regula tory effects\" (2003: 252). At first glance, medicine seems to function primar ily as a tool of state dominance within this theory. As Rabinow & Rose (2003) have n oted, however, Foucault later refined this portrayal of state power through his t heory of governmentality that accounts for \"the variety of ways of problematizing and acti ng on the individual and collective 29 conduct in the name of certain objectives which do not have the State as their origin or point of reference\" (5). This second phase of theor izing state power and, by extension, biopower, is crucial to understanding various ways in which individuals and groups participate willingly in medicalization and even se lf-medicalize, as discussed by Lock (2001) and Conrad (1992). In this dissertation, I d raw on theories of biopolitics and governmentality to explain how the medicalization o f race and racism occurs through both state-centered and non-state-centered mechanis ms. Applying a Biopolitical Framework to the Medicaliza tion of Race In the final analysis, do developments such as pha rmacogenomics empower the patient to manage his or her own treatment, or do t hey imprison the patient within a racialized system of medical logic? Many theorists of contemporary biopolitics have interrogated the mixed impulses that pervade the co ntemporary medicalization of race. While many of them note the potential for renewed s cientific racism, they often suggest that biopolitical processes in the age of genomics are not as totalizing or top-down as in the past. Rose (2007) is quite optimistic regarding the libe rating possibilities presented by genomic medicine. According to Rose, the goal of bi opolitics in the age of genomics is to maximize health, rather than to normalize populatio ns. He draws a clear conceptual line between the biopolitics originally theorized by Fou cault and that of century: \"[Today's] is a biopolitics organized arou nd the principle of fostering individual life, not of eliminating those that threaten the qu ality of populations; it is a biopolitics that does not operate under the sign of the sovereign st ate; it is a biopolitics that does not seek to legitimate inequality but to intervene upon its consequences\" (167). Rose also claims 30 that the current \"molecular gaze of contemporary ge nomics\" actually counteracts the outmoded, racist idea that physical differences ind ex differences in mental and moral characteristics (161). He argues further that, rath er than contributing to increased racialism, genomic medicine produces comm that demand genome-specific remedies (ib id). Other theorists are more pessimistic regarding con temporary biopower and race. Shim (2000) argues that by presenting race, class, and gender as individual characteristics that increase the risk of developing certain diseas es, biomedical researchers conceal the structural and environmental causes of health dispa rities. At the same time that they strive to produce personalized medical solutions based on genomic technology, researchers also invoke old racial groupings. In a later study, howe ver, Shim (2005) presents a more nuanced interpretation of how epidemiological knowl edge is produced, as well as the existence of resistance from subjects. Both she and Montoya (2007) argue that epidemiologists, more often than not, recognize the weaknesses and limitations of race variables in determining disease patterns. Their an alyses provide a counterpoint to totalizing accounts of the medicalization of race, because they show that researchers can and do resist bioreductionism in matters of race an d health. Rabinow & Rose (2003) present a more ominous view of the consequences of medicalizing race through the use of genomic techno logies. They argue that, while developments such as SNP (single nucleotide polymorp hism) mapping and the Human Genome Project strive to individualize health inter ventions, they do so by re-inscribing old racial distinctions: \"it is striking and distur bing that the core racial typology of the nineteenth century...still provides a dominant mold through which this new genetic 31 knowledge of human difference is taking shape\" (20) . The authors predict that SNP mapping will \"undoubtedly\" reiterate historical per ceptions of difference between population groups read as \"races\" (ibid). It is int eresting that Rose, in this collaborative text, presents genomics in such a negative light in comparison to his discussion of the liberating and empowering possibilities of genomic medicine in The Politics of Life Itself (2007). Regardless of the race-naturalizing implications o f genomic medicine, Epstein (2007) shows that the re-inscription of race catego ries in biomedical research is not necessarily an unwelcome development for potential subjects. In his study of race categories within U.S. biomedical research and heal th policy, Epstein identifies a biopolitical paradigm that he terms the \"inclusion- and-difference paradigm\" (passim). \"Inclusion-and-difference\" refers to the political objective of including minority groups in biomedical research based on presumed medically significant differences. The inclusion-and-difference paradigm holds that these differences must be measured in order to provide equitable medical care to all groups. Ra ther than a top-down, state-centered form of biopolitics, Epstein identifies a process o f negotiation between state, science, and society. In his case study of minority health activ ism during the 1980s and 1990s, \"inclusion-and-difference\" claims were deployed usi ng the mechanism of \"categorical alignment,\" whereby social activists successfully a rgued that social race categories should also be the operative categories in scientif ic research and health policy. By presenting their demands in ways that resonated wit h the language of biomedical research and policy, activists were able to achieve their go al of being included in research that inscribed their differences. This example of negoti ated biopolitics presents a striking 32 departure from earlier theories of state-centered, top-down biopolitics. Although the scenario Epstein analyzes bears many similarities t o the biopolitical dynamics surrounding the introduction of race-conscious medi cine and health policy in Brazil, it also serves as a useful foil to highlight some key differences between the Brazilian and U.S. contexts. As such, I will draw on his work thr oughout this dissertation. Other analyses of contemporary biopolitics suggest that the market, rather than the state, has become the ultimate arbiter of biopo litics\u2014particularly in advanced liberal democracies of the West (e.g., Clarke et al. 2003, Rabinow & Rose 2003, Kahn 2004). Although race-based pharmacogenomics and market int ervention are beginning to appear in the Brazilian context as well, they lie beyond t he scope of this dissertation. When I conducted fieldwork in Brazil between 2005 and 2009 , the creation of \"black health\" (sa\u00fade da popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra ) as a field of medical and political intervention wa s rooted almost entirely in the realm of public health polic y and practice. As I will show in later chapters, black health activists leveraged their un iversal citizenship right to public health care to make claims on the state for race-conscious health policies and practices. Overall, the analyses discussed in this section in dicate that, although the contemporary medicalization of race has the potenti al to breathe new life into old racial typologies, the biopolitical rationale at work is s omewhat different from the one described by Foucault in History of Sexuality . Rather than a state-centered, top-down form of \"power-knowledge,\" contemporary biopolitics involves the \"active participation of citizens in the drive for health\" (Rose 2001: 6) and is more predicated than ever before on market forces. What this means for the medicaliz ation of race is a greater degree of citizen involvement in negotiating categories and c rafting policies that ultimately shape 33 popular consciousness regarding the link between ra ce and health outcomes\u2014for better or for worse. Race and National Identity in Brazil As Telles (2004) observes, Brazilians utilize at l east three kinds of racial identity models: the traditional/popular model, the Census m odel, and the model popularized by the black movement. The traditional/popular model f eatures a wide spectrum of terms to describe skin color and physical features. In addit ion to terms such as \"branco\" (white) and \"preto,\" (black) it includes many intermediate color terms such as moreno, mesti\u00e7o, sarar\u00e1 , etc. In fact, when IBGE, the Brazilian Census bur eau, included an open-response color question on the 1976 national household surve y (PNAD), citizens replied with 136 different color terms. The Brazilian Census normall y provides only four 6 \"Parda\" refers to either brown or a grayish color, while \"a marela\" is yellow or Asian. The Census model is used for official documents such as birth certificates. The bipolar model propagated by the black movement emphasizes the ter ms branco (white) and negro (black), where \"negro\" encompasses all people with (usually, visible) African ancestry. Brazilians' preference for phenotypic description, rather than pseudo-biological classification using fixed categories, reflects the ir widespread belief that many Brazilians embody a racial mixture. This belief is evident in figures from the 2000 Brazilian Census: nearly 40% of Brazilians classified themselves as b rown (pardo), meaning racially mixed. In everyday life, someone who is officially classif ied as pardo may be referred to as 6 There is significant ambiguity embedded in the ques tion posed by Census takers: Qual \u00e9 sua cor ? color?] 34 moreno , mulato , mesti\u00e7o or a whole host of other terms that denote mixed a ncestry. Silva (1998) attributes this multiplicity of color terms to Brazilians' collective assumption that separate races do not exist in Brazil. In addition to asserting a mixed-race national ide ntity and denying the existence of racism in Brazil, Brazilians have traditionally constructed racial identity as a malleable condition rather than an essential one. The ethos o f whitening ( branqueamento ) constitutes a major ideological tool through which this is accomplished. \"Whitening\" refers both to a pseudoscientific theory and to a s ocial practice. During the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, prominent scientists and intellectuals affirmed that the Brazilian population was growing progressively whiter due to miscegenation and the mass influx of European immigrants following the abolition of slav ery (Skidmore 1993a). Although this belief was subsequently debunked, the ethos of whit ening continues to influence racialization practices in Brazil. As a social prac tice, \"whitening\" refers to Brazilians' tendency to identify with the lightest racial categ ory permitted by their skin color. Socioeconomic class also plays an important role in social whitening. There is a popular saying in Brazil that \"money whitens\" ( o dinheiro embranquece ), meaning that higher socioeconomic status may allow an individual to be identified with a more desirable race category than someone of similar appearance but les s material wealth. Brazilian \"whitening\" is often contrasted with the U.S. pract ice of \"hypodescent,\" or the tendency to assign mixed-race individuals in the United Stat es to the more socially subordinated racial identity they embody, e.g., \"black\" instead of \"white.\" Although Brazilians' aesthetic hierarchy privileges European features and light skin over African features and dark skin, Brazilian s tend to identify strongly with a 35 discourse of mixed-race national identity. This dis course is often accompanied by the argument that, due to a high degree of racial mixin g, racial discrimination cannot logically exist in Brazil. The negation of racism b ased on a discourse of pervasive miscegenation is a key component of the Brazilian i deology of racial democracy (Skidmore 1993a). The ideology is likewise bolstere d by the value placed upon cordiality in interpersonal relations in Brazil; many Brazilia ns claim that there is no racism in their society because people of all colors interact withi n the same social spaces. Florestan Fernandes, a prominent sociologist of race in Brazi l, famously characterized Brazilian cordiality as the \"prejudice of having no prejudice .\" In the last few decades, the ideology of racial de mocracy has been dealt serious blows by events such as the Brazilian state's admis sion that racism is a significant problem in Brazil. Former President Fernando Henriq ue Cardoso spearheaded this shift in official discourse when he acknowledged the existen ce of racial discrimination in Brazil during his 1995 inaugural speech. Cardoso also proc laimed in his Independence Day speech later that year that \"we wish to affirm, and truly with considerable pride, our condition as a multi-racial society and that we hav e great satisfaction in being able to enjoy the privilege of having distinct races\" (Fry 2000: 100). His statement ran counter to the powerful theme of racial amalgamation present i n the Brazilian nationalist text. In 1996, Ministries of Justice and Foreign Affairs hosted an international conference on \"Diversity, Multiculturalism, and Aff irmative Action.\" According to Reichmann (1999: 20), this was the first time such concepts had appeared within the context of a national-level, state-sponsored event in Brazil. These concepts are important for affirmative action discourse because they reinf orce the notion of distinct, discrete 36 cultures coexisting in a \"diverse,\" \"multicultural\" polity. This idea runs counter to the traditional Brazilian ethos of cultural unity achie ved through centuries of miscegenation. In order to understand the contemporary paradigm s hift in Brazil's policy on racial inequalities, it is necessary to understand how racial ideologies and national identity were co-constituted historically in Brazil . A confluence of state policies and discourses produced by the intellectual elite led t o the crafting of a particular nationalist text concerning race, aspects of which endure to th e present day. Throughout the nineteenth century, the two major issues confrontin g the Brazilian state were abolition and nationhood (Holston 2008). Intellectual product ion of the time reflects a continual preoccupation with formulating a sovereign, unique national identity. This objective was complicated, however, by the fact that much of the population was of color\u2014which, according to European racial determinists of the da y, sounded a death knell for national progress (Skidmore 1993a). As pressure for abolitio n increased domestically and from abroad, Brazilian intellectuals countered racial de terminists' condemnation of their racially mixed population with the theory of whiten ing ( branqueamento ). This theory held that people of color were steadily disappearin g from the Brazilian population through miscegenation with whites. The mulato was tentatively accepted as the face of the nation, but only with the accompanying understa nding that he would grow progressively whiter (Skidmore 1993a). In the years surrounding the abolition of slavery, the Brazilian government began to implement several pro-European immigration polic ies. In 1850, the state passed the Land Law (Lei de Terras), which subsidized land sal es to European immigrants in exchange for labor. The law also dissolved the prev iously existing principle of land 37 ownership through occupation. Henceforth, the law s tipulated, all agricultural land holdings deemed unproductive would be returned to t he Crown (Holston 2008: 131). The passage of this law reflected the state's desire no t only to render Brazilian landholdings more productive, but also to gradually substitute s lave labor with immigrant labor. The net effect of the law was to deny property to poor immigrants and citizens (Holston 2008: 133). Furthermore, the law did little in terms of l and reform; most of Brazil's arable land remained in the hands of a rich few. Thousands of E uropean immigrants who were unable to acquire or maintain land joined the masse s of urban poor in the cities. Over generations, immigrant and Brazilian-born populatio ns intermingled and co-constructed the urban periphery of cities such as S\u00e3o Paulo. On May 13, 1888, the institution of slavery was ab olished by means of the Lei \u00c1urea (Golden Law). Following abolition in 1888, th ere was significant social disruption and, from the point of view of the elite, minimal i ntegration of the slaves into the economy and civil society. Brazilian intellectuals of the time predicted that the presence of African cultural influences would cripple the na tion's progress toward modernization. S\u00edlvio Romero was one of the first scholars to defe nd the premise of whitening through miscegenation. In Hist\u00f3ria de literatura brasileira (1888), he praised the mulatto as embodying the true spirit of Brazil, but continued to privilege the contributions of the Portuguese over those of the Indian and the African in the construction of Brazilian \"civilization.\" At the same time, he claimed that t he population was gradually growing whiter. The Brazilian public health apparatus began to flo urish in the second half of the nineteenth century in response to epidemics spurred by immigration and urban 38 congestion in Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo (Stepan 1981). The most serious threats to public health were the yellow fever epidemics of th e early 1850s and early 1870s that affected Rio de Janeiro and several other areas. Ch alhoub (1993) argues that the medical ideology deployed by the state during the yellow fe ver campaigns in Rio dovetailed with reigning ideas about race. Since elites desired an influx of European immigrants to expedite their whitening project, they chose to foc us their energies on eradicating yellow fever, which affected elite whites more than blacks , rather than on staunching the flood of mortality by smallpox and tuberculosis among the ur ban poor. Chalhoub argues that both elites' action and in action demonstrated that they were \"changing the en vironment in order to help nature\" to eliminate blacks from the nation (462). Fear of contagion from blacks led the municipal government to raze their corti\u00e7os (poor urban dwellings) and banish them to the periphery where they constructed favelas . The late nineteenth-century development of Brazil' s public health system was prompted not only by epidemics, but also by popular intellectual paradigms of the time such as Darwinism and Positivism. Stepan (1981) arg ues that the introduction and circulation of these ideas within Brazil encouraged intellectuals to seek scientific solutions for social problems. Borges (1993) refers to this process as the \"medicalization of social thought\" and documents the prevalence fro m 1880-1940 of medical and social theories regarding the prevention of environmental and hereditary degeneration in Brazil. The push for hygiene and sanitation was intimately tied to Brazil's modernization project, which was threatened by racial and climatic determi nists' condemnations of the country's capacity for progress. Stepan (1981) interprets the development of public health and medical science in Brazil as an attempt to overcome these negative predictions through 39 an emphasis on \"cleaning up\" the social and natural environment: \"through science Brazil could escape an historic fatalism concerning its ab ility to change events, and the nation could emerge as part of the modern, civilized world \" (58). The concept of using science to improve the popula tion went hand in hand with theories of scientific racism. Scientific racism wa s based on theories of Social Darwinism and race evolution, and drew on the work of intelle ctuals and scientists such as Spencer, Gobineau, and Lombroso (Johnson 2002). Two key comp onents of scientific racism were purification and hierarchy: \"pure\" races were suppo sedly stronger and more stable than hybrids, and whites were considered superior to bla cks, mulatos, and indigenous Brazilians. Around the turn of the century, scienti fic racism in Brazil continued to coexist with theories of whitening that were bolstered by i mmigration policies (Skidmore 1993a). For example, in 1890 the Brazilian government prohi bited the entry of African and Asian immigrants without a special exemption from Congres s (Johnson 2002). Similarly, between 1890 and 1920 the state of S\u00e3o Paulo offere d financial incentives to help attract European immigrants. Explicit support for theories of scientific racis m peaked around the turn of the century, but slowed significantly with the arrival of the belle \u00e9poque around 1914. Skidmore (1993a) observes, however, that even after the scientific community rejected scientific racism, the Brazilian elite continued to espouse racist sentiments. The main difference was a shift in the language used, from t erms such as racial \"inferiority/superiority\" to discussions of \"ethnic integration.\" It was a softened discourse surrounding the same principle of whiteni ng (207). 40 Scientific racism was eclipsed by the eugenics mov ement of the 1920s. The Brazilian eugenics movement was largely \"positive\" in character, meaning that the focus was on Lamarckian theories of hygiene and sanitatio n rather than on restricting marriage and reproduction practices, as was the case in othe r Latin American nations around the same time (Stepan 1991). Once again, it was believe d that healthy practices could strengthen the Brazilian \"race,\" thus contributing to the modernization of the nation. Carneiro (1994) suggests that eugenics played a sig nificant role in dictator Get\u00falio Vargas' (1930-1945) populist ideology that emphasiz ed discipline of body and spirit, in addition to racial \"strength.\" At the same time, Va rgas' national propaganda included a celebration of the country's unique mestizo culture . Intellectual support for the principle of whitenin g remained popular through the 1920s and 1930s, the period during which the social sciences were consolidated in Brazil. Lima (2007) argues that there were clear parallels between the sanitizing discourse of public health and the ideology of whitening; both p roposed the strategy of gradually eliminating undesirable elements from the body poli tic and replacing them with stronger, purer ones. However, by this point Brazilian biomed ical literature rarely, if ever, mentioned race explicitly. Rather, public health di scussions of race usually invoked the \"Brazilian race\" ( a ra\u00e7a brasileira ), especially in terms of strengthening the populat ion through public health interventions. Beginning with the 1930s, intellectual discourses on race changed dramatically. Sociologists and anthropologists began to publish s ignificant literature on African cultural contributions to brasilidade (Brazilian-ness). Gilberto Freyre's work is general ly considered to have had the greatest impact ever on the Brazilian race imagination. His 41 seminal work Casa Grande e Senzala (The Masters and the Slaves) (1933) praised indigenous and African cultural contributions to Lu so-Brazilian civilization. Freyre glorified the Portuguese colonizers' superior capac ity for miscegenation, which supposedly led to the forging of an authentic Brazi lian mestizo subject. This ideology, subsequently labeled \"Luso-tropicalism,\" held that the Portuguese colonizers of Brazil were accustomed to \"intermixing\" with Africans and Asians. Due to this contact, he reasoned, the Portuguese were a more hybrid people and therefore could not be racist. Freyre also refuted the idea of innate racial degen eracy among blacks, claiming that any negative traits they were thought to possess, such as indolence, resulted from their former condition as slaves. Ultimately, however, Freyre di d not abandon the idea that blacks and Indians were socially inferior subjects. Skidmore ( 1993a) argues that Freyre unintentionally reinforced the whitening ideal by p ortraying Indian and black Brazilians as weak subjects, whereas the Portuguese colonizer appeared as a strong, paternal figure. Nonetheless, Casa Grande e Senzala propagated the idea that Brazil could be a modern, progressive nation while celebrating its mestizo he ritage. Freyre's best-known legacy, and the central tenet of Casa Grande e Senzala , is the image of Brazilian society as a \"racial democra cy\" wherein the three constitutive races receive equal opportunity and treatment. Thes e ideas dovetailed with Vargas' populism and bolstered Brazil's reputation abroad a s a racially tolerant nation. The ideology or myth of racial democracy has since been subjected to significant criticism, principally by social scientists in Brazil and abro ad. Freyre was followed during the 1940s and 1950s by scholars of African cultural \"retentions\" in Brazil. These scholars, who include d Ruth Landes (1947) and Melville 42 Herskovits (1966), predicted that as \"archaic \"Afro -Brazilian practices disappeared, Brazil would become increasingly modern (Brown 1999 ). Agier (1995) notes two main trends in academic production on Afro-Brazilians du ring this period: first, racial differences were interpreted in terms of social cla ss, and were thus predicted to disappear with economic modernization; and second, a signific ant dichotomy arose between sociological analyses of black populations in indus trial areas, on the one hand, and anthropological analyses of Afro-Brazilian cultural practices, on the other. In 1950, UNESCO funded a large-scale research proje ct on race relations in Brazil. The purpose of this study was to highlight the ease of relations between people of different colors in Brazil, which would serve as a model for the rest of the world. Researchers on the project included Charles Wagley, Roger Bastide, Thales de Azevedo, Marvin Harris, Florestan Fernandes, and Fernando He nrique Cardoso. The focus was on the socioeconomic status of pretos and pardos , which was shown to be significantly lower than that of whites. For the first time, the ideology of racial democracy had been challenged through statistical data. The new school of thought that resulted from these studies is often referred to as \"racial revisionism \" since racial dynamics were approached in a new way by \"revisionist\" scholars (Winant 1994 ). The UNESCO researchers attempted to explain how eco nomic inequality between the races could exist in a racial democracy such as Brazil. The fact that they framed their response in this way implies that they were operati ng under the assumption that Brazil was, indeed, a racial democracy. Researchers such a s Thales de Azevedo and Fernandes predicted that the \"race problem\" would disappear t hrough the continued social and cultural assimilation of black Brazilians. Fernande s (1964) came closest to refuting the 43 validity of the myth of racial democracy. Other rev isionists focused solely on the class problem, which they saw as the true cause for inequ ality between the races. Winant (1992) adds that the revisionists did not consider the social construction of race, but instead viewed existing racial categories as a give n. Beginning in the 1960s, the Brazilian government's stance toward Afro-Brazilian culture changed significantly. The administration o f J\u00e2nio Quadros (1961) was short- lived but had a significant impact on official disc ourse regarding African contributions to the nation. Quadros initiated an era of reaching ou t to decolonizing African nations and promoting Brazil as a cultural bridge between Afric a and the West (Santos 2005). He did this primarily in the interest of possible arms sal es to African nations, as well as to mitigate potential competition in the area of agric ulture from nations with climates similar to Brazil's. Quadros envisioned a political alliance of post-colonial Third World countries in Asia, Africa, and South America, with Brazil as the South American leader. Within Brazil, he created a series of programs and centers destined for the study of Afro- Brazilian culture. Quadros' successor, Jo\u00e3o Goulart , continued to praise African contributions to Brazilian culture and endorsed the ideology of racial democracy (ibid). In 1964, a military junta seized the Brazilian gov ernment and transformed it into a military dictatorship for the next two decades. The military government opted to remove the color question from the 1970 Census on the grou nds that it was irrelevant. According to Nobles (2000), \"...military leaders displayed low tolerance for discussions of any sort about race. They characterized criticism of racial democracy as 'acts of subversion'\" (111). Skidmore (1993) also attributes the military government's removal of the color question to its reluctance to highlight racial ineq ualities in the country. This posture did 44 not last long, however, since the Census bureau's 1 976 national household survey (PNAD) utilized two kinds of color questions: an ope n response one, and one with fixed, pre-formulated options. Moreover, the color questio n was reinstated on the 1980 Census and has been present ever since. In the 1970s, a group of scholars referred to as t he \"post-revisionists\" or \"structuralists\" began to theorize racial inequalit y as a central governing technology of the Brazilian state (Hasenbalg 1979). They argued t hat the Brazilian state depended upon the racial hierarchy in order to function as a capi talist society. Hanchard (1994) criticizes the structuralists' economic reductionism, or their perception of racial inequality as a function of class, as well as their failure to attr ibute agency to black Brazilians. Their focus, he claims, was on white domination and econo mic forces instead of on the political construction and contestation of racial inequality. Winant (1992) also notes that the structuralist theories are no different from the re visionist ones in their class reductionism. He adds that the relative political conservatism no ted by structuralists on the part of Brazilian blacks can be attributed to the ban on po litical activity that was imposed by the military dictatorship at that time: \"The structural ist problematic\u2014of a frozen racial inequality, 'smoothly maintained' by an all-powerfu l elite\u2014stemmed from the conjuncture in which it emerged\" (182). This politi cal scenario was soon to change. In the wake of economic disappointments and denunc iations of the military regime's human rights violations, the government em barked upon a process of redemocratization in 1975. The late 1970s and 1980s were known as a period of abertura or \"opening\" following the strict repression of civ il society. Gradually, political 45 associations and interest groups began to contest t heir lot in society and demand change. Black activism formed a significant component of th is new political backdrop. Black Movement Activism My use of the term \"black movement\" comes from the Portuguese term \"movimento negro.\" I use the term in accordance wit h academic literature and Brazilians' common use of the term to denote a set of political and cultural organizations generally dedicated to the empowerment of black Brazilians an d the valorization of black identity in Brazil. When I refer to the \"black movement,\" it is with the acknowledgment that there is no single black movement in Brazil, but rather a plethora of organizations with diverse membership and areas of focus. Since its beginnings in the early twentieth centur y, black movement activism in Brazil has constituted a reaction to the ideology o f racial democracy. Bacelar (1989) notes the following general characteristics of blac k movement organizations: a strong emphasis on black identity; the adoption of a binar y model of race (black and white); denunciation of the myth of racial democracy in Bra zil; commitment to procuring better social, economic, and political conditions for the black population; commitment to acknowledging the importance of the negro in the construction of Brazilian society; and commitment to preserving and protecting \"black cult ure\" (cultura negra ) against undesirable commercialization and folklorization by hegemonic sectors of society (88- 89). Brazilian black movement organizations engage in diverse activities such as promoting candidates from their own ranks for polit ical office, staging public protests, organizing Afro-Brazilian cultural events, and hold ing lectures and conferences to discuss various subjects concerning the \"black comm unity\" ( comunidade negra ), as 46 activists often call it. The central ideological as pect of Brazilian black movement activism to be explored in this dissertation is the explicit emphasis on the construction of a particular black identity, which is based on an \" African\" phenotype and the affirmation of certain cultural and, increasingly, biological c haracteristics assumed to be essential to a collectivized black identity. S\u00e3o Paulo has been the central site of black moveme nt activism throughout Brazilian history (Hanchard 1994). In addition to a number of S\u00e3o-Paulo based black press organizations that arose in the early years o f the twentieth century, the Frente Negra Brasileira (Black Brazilian Front) emerged there in 1931. The Frente demanded full socioeconomic integration for blacks and denounced the state government's intense recruitment of European immigrants. Frente activist s' main tactics included public protests and organized \"invasions\" of clubs and ass ociations in the city that prohibited blacks from entering. The Frente managed to become a political party in 1936; it remained active until 1937, when populist dictator Get\u00falio Vargas shut it down, in addition to all other political parties. The next wave of black movement activism was charac terized by cultural production, ostensibly because artistic activity wa s considered less of a political threat to the state than outright political organizing. One o f the most famous black cultural movements of the 1940s through the 1960s was the Te atro Experimental do Negro (Experimental Black Theater, or TEN), which was crea ted in Rio de Janeiro by Abdias do Nascimento. In addition to theatrical productions th at strived to improve the perception of black aesthetics in Brazil, TEN sponsored Afro-Brazi lian cultural and literary events. Additionally, TEN published a literary journal, Quilombo , which ran articles about black 47 culture and politics in Brazil. In the mid-fifties, the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Cultural do Negro (ACN), another major black cultural organization, flourish ed in S\u00e3o Paulo. The sixties saw the rise of the Black Power movement in Brazil, which c entered much more on aesthetics than on political organizing. By the late 1960s, al l black movement organizations had been effectively repressed by the military dictator ship. Activists and scholars usually identify the 1978 cr eation of the Unified Black Movement (Movimento Negro Unificado, or MNU) in S\u00e3o Paulo as the start of a new, revitalized black movement in Brazil (e.g., Hanchar d 1994). Since that time, countless black movement organizations have sprung up around the country. Some focus generally on improving the life conditions and image of black s in Brazil, while others are dedicated to more specific causes, such as Afro-Brazilian cultural rights, black women's reproductive health, or the preservation and empowe rment of historical maroon communities ( comunidades remanescentes de quilombos ). Contemporary black activists in Brazil have constructed hybrid, globalized black identities (Sansone 2003). In so doing, they have taken ideological cues from libera tion movements in the Caribbean, Latin America, and Lusophone Africa as well as from the U.S. black civil rights movement. Public Health in Brazil In order to fully appreciate the significance of ra ce-specific health care in Brazil, it is necessary to understand the citizenship ideol ogies underpinning the Brazilian public health system. The health care system in Brazil con sists of vastly unequal public and private tiers (Almeida et al. 2001). Citizens who h ave the means to purchase private health insurance, or who receive it through their e mployer, are able to access first-rate 48 private medical care. Those without access to healt h insurance depend on universal, though often precarious, public health services. Al though there are significant regional differences in the quality of care and the availabi lity of medications and medical technology, Brazil's universal health care represen ts an important advance in the social contract between the Brazilian state and citizens. The Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade (Unified Health System, or SUS) was born from the 1988 Brazilian Constitution, which introduced sever al important innovations regarding the way health would be conceptualized by the democ ratizing state. For the first time, health became a universal citizen's right and the s tate became formally responsible for guaranteeing \"universal and equal access\" to health care (Brazil 1988). Prior to the creation of SUS, many public health services were a vailable only to citizens with a registered employment card ( carteira de trabalho assinada ) since social security financed a large part of public health care. Since the imple mentation of SUS, the state has provided a full array of primary and complex, preve ntive and curative medical services to all citizens. 7 As Petryna (2009) has noted for the Ukraine, Brazi lians increasingly exercise their \"medical citizenship\" by making lega l claims on the state to provide high- cost medications and medical procedures ( passim ). Major innovations of SUS include a focus on primar y and preventive health services and the institutionalization of community participation in the planning, monitoring and evaluation of health care. The premi um SUS places on community participation has produced countless partnerships b etween public health departments and 7 This is also the case for non-citizens. During the nearly five years I spent in Brazil, I often access ed public health services. 49 civil society organizations, as well as creating pa rticipatory health councils composed of citizens, public health providers, and public healt h administrators. Since the advent of SUS, citizens have been expected to exercise \"socia l control\" ( controle social ) of health services by monitoring them and, in a limited capac ity, helping to plan them. The Health Reform Movement (also known as Reforma Sanit\u00e1ria , or Sanitary Reform movement) that led to the creation of SUS ar ose within the context of re- democratization in Brazil. One of many new urban so cial movements that emerged during the late 1970s and 1980s, the Movement deman ded improvements for the ailing national health care system. In addition to health activists from a variety of NGOs and neighborhood associations, the Movement was compris ed of public health professionals, professors, and community activists from neighborho od associations (Cohn 1995). Although there were many smaller popular movements organized around obtaining better local health care facilities, the Health Reform Mov ement was the largest, most diversified, and most durable of them all. Weyland (1995) argues that the Health Reform Movement was more successful due to the elevated so cial position of many of its members, who managed to penetrate the State by occu pying seats in federal- and state- level institutions that influenced policymaking, su ch as the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Social Security, and state-level health departments ( secretarias de sa\u00fade ). The Movement's included a curb on privatiz ation and the over-emphasis on curative, rather than preventive, services; stre ngthening of the public sector to provide equal access to health care for all citizens; an in creased focus on preventive measures, especially vaccination and sanitation, in order to bring down health care costs; decentralization of health care management to the s tate and municipal spheres of 50 government; and a focus on providing basic care to the poor (Weyland 1995). The peak of the Movement's influence occurred shortly after the Eighth National Health Conference (1986), when activists presented a propo sal outlining their demands to the National Constituent Assembly. Many of their demands influenced aspects of the new Constitution, although subsequent conservative lega l interpretation of these principles allowed for a significant degree of outsourcing and privatization of services (ibid). Despite the relationship between eugenics and the \"sanitation\" goal of public health in early 20 th -century Brazil, race was not an explicit object of biomedical research or epidemiological analysis in Brazil prior to the 1990s. This does not mean that Brazilian medical research and practice were unconc erned with race. During the nineteenth century, some medical researchers drew c lear associations between blackness and physical or mental degeneracy (Peard 1999, Skid more 1993a). However, there was no Brazilian Tuskegee; because post-1920s Brazilian race ideology did not rest on the premise of absolute racial difference, but rather o n racial hybridity, there was no cultural logic to support the conceptualization of blacks as a physically distinct population (Silva 1998). ***** Ethnographic Field Sites My study of race and health disparities in Brazil l ed me to many places in northeast and southeast Brazil between 2005 and 200 9. Multi-sited ethnography was an important element of this study, given both the nat ional-level implementation of black health policy, and the vast socioeconomic and cultu ral diversity that exists among different regions of the country. In general, multi -sited ethnography helps to illuminate 51 trends in the data that would not otherwise be visi ble and prevents the overgeneralization of findings from one site to an entire field (Marcu s 1998). I begin with a brief overview of each of my field sites. My long-term fieldwork in 2007-2009 consisted of on e year in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds do Maranh\u00e3o, followed by a second year in S\u00e3o Paulo. I chose these two cities because my preliminary fieldwork had revealed that northeast a nd southeast Brazil were particularly active regions of citizen activism and policymaking around race-based health inequalities. The most active locations were major capital cities in the northeast, such as Salvador, Recife, and S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, while the most acti ve sites in the southeast included Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo. In the end, I chose S\u00e3o L u\u00eds because it was the founding site of the National Network for Afro-Brazilian Religions an d Health, which I discuss in detail in Part III. Additionally, I chose S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds because fewer researchers were examining the creation of black health initiatives there than in Recife or Salvador. I chose S\u00e3o Paulo because it presented a useful ethnic and socioecono mic contrast to S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds that enriched my understanding of the ways in which the racializa tion of health policy and health care were unfolding in drastically different parts of th e country. Furthermore, despite the existence of sociological research on black health activism in S\u00e3o Paulo, there was little, if any, research on the nexus between black movemen t activism and Afro-Brazilian religious activism in the area of health. S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds is the capital of Maranh\u00e3o state. Its popu lation in 2010 was a little over a million.8 S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds has a hot, humid, tropical climate and is located partially on an island, with bridges linking different parts of the city. T he waters surrounding the city are grey 8 Source: www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat. Last accessed Fe bruary 27, 2011. 52 and brackish; each day the bay empties out complete ly, leaving canoes and small boats immobile atop a muddy bank, and then floods again, replenishing itself. Maranh\u00e3o is the poorest Brazilian state, and even though the infras tructure in urbanized S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds is much more robust than in Maranh\u00e3o's rural interior, the city remains significantly underdeveloped. Despite the historic center's statu s as a tourist destination, the remainder of the city displays the marks of pervasive poverty . These include regular citywide power and water shortages and a large number of shantytow ns ( invas\u00f5es or favelas ), many of which are wooden shacks mounted on spindly wooden s tilts over sewage-polluted water (called palafitas ). In 2009, approximately twenty-four percent of S\u00e3 o Lu\u00eds' population self-identified as white percent percent as brown indigenous ( ind\u00edgena ). 9 S\u00e3o Paulo is the capital of S\u00e3o Paulo state, the we althiest state in Brazil. It is Brazil's largest city and the world's seventh large st metropolitan area. When I first arrived in S\u00e3o Paulo in May 2008, the city seemed t o me like an unfathomable concrete jungle. I had been living in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds for nearly a year, and the southern hemisphere winter could scarcely have looked more different be tween the two cities; it was swelteringly hot in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and bitingly cold in S \u00e3o Paulo. The thick vegetation and ramshackle houses of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds were replaced by skys crapers and asphalt as far as the eye could see. The common sight of donkey-drawn wagons and people dawdling along in shorts and T-shirts in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds gave way to busines smen and women in suits, rushing up and down Avenida Paulista and queuing up for the metr\u00f4. Of course, my initial impression of S\u00e3o Paulo was shaped by the fact that I arrived in the city center and stayed 9 Ibid. 53 there while I got my bearings. Later, I would ventu re into the urban periphery and visit favelas and invas\u00f5es that reminded me of some of the ones I had visited in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds. Nonetheless, during the year I spent in S\u00e3o Paulo, I was continually awed by its incredible diversity and sheer magnitude. The city of S\u00e3o Paulo registered over eleven millio n inhabitants in 2010. 10 The population density is roughly 7838 people per squar e kilometer, as compared to 1211 in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds. S\u00e3o Paulo's per capita GDP in 2008 was mo re than twice that of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds (roughly US$19,550 in S\u00e3o Paulo, as compared to US$ 8,977 in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds). Although both cities have high Gini coefficients (45 in S\u00e3o Paulo and 49 in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds), indicating significant socioeconomic inequality, in 2010 about twenty-nine percent of paulistas were living in poverty, as compared to nearly fifty -five percent of ludovicenses (residents of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds). 11 Figure 1 shows the distribution of income througho ut Brazil in 2000. I have inserted arrows pointing to S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and S\u00e3o P aulo. The figure makes apparent the significant disparities in income distribution betw een northeast and southeast regions of the country, and particularly around S\u00e3o Paulo and S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds. The darker spots represent higher income, while the lighter spots represent lo wer income. S\u00e3o Paulo is Brazil's most ethnically diverse city, with substantial enclaves of Italian, Japanese, and Arab descendants. The city a lso has a huge immigrant population, with particularly large numbers of immigrants from Portugal, Japan, Spain, Italy, Bolivia, Korea, China, Chile, Argentina, and Germany. In 201 0, roughly sixty-five percent of 10 Ibid. 11 Ibid. 54 paulistas identified as white, six percent as black, twenty- eight percent as brown, and 1.4 percent as Asian or indigenous. 12 Figure 1. Household Income, 2000. 13 Below, Figure 2 shows the distribution of pretos an d pardos throughout the country. I have added arrows to indicate S\u00e3o Paulo and S\u00e3o Lu\u00ed s on the map, and would call the reader's attention to the significant difference in ethnic composition between the two locations. 12 Ibid. 13 Source: www.ibge.gov.br. Last accessed February 26, 2011. 55 Figure 2. Distribution of Race/Color (Pretos and Pa rdos), 2000. 14 It would be difficult to overstate the difference between living in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and living in S\u00e3o Paulo. There are enormous geographica l, climatic, socioeconomic, cultural, and ethnic differences between the two cities. Ludo vicenses and paulistas speak with different accents and display local variations in i nflection, vocabulary and even grammar; ludovicenses prefer to conjugate their verbs using the second-person singular pronoun t\u00fa while paulistas tend to use the more common voc\u00ea . Therefore, in relocating from S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds to S\u00e3o Paulo at the midpoint of my fieldwork, I had to adjust rapidly to different nuances of living, eating, dressing, speaking, trav eling, and even interacting socially to a certain extent. Although I had lived alone in a ren ted apartment in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, the high cost 14 Source: www.ibge.gov.br. Last accessed February 27, 2011. 56 of living in S\u00e3o Paulo led me to rent rooms in othe rs' apartments. In S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, a significant part of my week was spent shopping for and cooking fresh food, hand washing my clothing, and battling one insect infest ation after another inside my apartment. I frequently had to collect water in buc kets in anticipation of water shutoffs. I wore light sundresses and sandals throughout the ye ar, and I usually travelled to field sites by bus or by collective van (transporte coletivo ). In S\u00e3o Paulo, by contrast, I relied heavily on pre- packaged foods and precut vegetables and fruits from the local grocery store, as I tend to do in the United States. I laundered my clothing at home in the washing machin e, which was considered a luxury in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds but was commonplace in S\u00e3o Paulo. The h ouse and apartment I shared in S\u00e3o Paulo came with access to high-speed, wireless inte rnet, which was a boon after the dial- up connection I had endured during my year in S\u00e3o L u\u00eds. I often traveled by subway to field sites in S\u00e3o Paulo, although I often had to t ake buses when going to the periphery, and then public vans ( peruas ) to my final destination once I arrived in the rig ht neighborhood. In terms of social interaction, my in teractions with informants were much more intimate in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds than in S\u00e3o Paulo. In S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, I often found myself eating meals at people's homes and being invited to stay t he night when events ended late. In S\u00e3o Paulo, by contrast, my informants tended to kee p me more at arm's length, in that most of our interactions took place in public space s rather than in their homes. This was due in part to the size of the city, which meant th at my informants were scattered around the four corners of the city. Usually, I ended up m eeting informants in the city center, unless I was visiting a terreiro (temple of Afro-Brazilian religion) or doing house hold surveys or clinic visits (really, short interviews) in the periphery. While this scenario did 57 not conform to my idea of traditional ethnography, it quickly became apparent that I would need to adjust my expectations, given the hur dles of distance and transport in S\u00e3o Paulo. ***** In the next chapter, I explore the racial narrativ es of Brazilian patients and health care providers. My intent is to establish a \"baseli ne\" of Brazilians' everyday understandings about race and health that will help the reader understand the sharp contrast between the ideological claims of Brazil's new black health initiative, and the cultural context into which it is being introduced. 58 Chapter 2: Everyday Narratives on Race, Racism, and Health Toward the end of my year of fieldwork in S\u00e3o Paulo , I began to teach English to supplement my income. M\u00e1rio, one of my students, wa s a financial consultant at one of S\u00e3o Paulo's many multinational firms. His wife, Ang ela, was a social worker for S\u00e3o Paulo's public health department. Both white paulistas in their early twenties, M\u00e1rio and Angela lived in Liberdade, S\u00e3o Paulo's Japanese dis trict. Liberdade is a middle-class neighborhood located near the city center. One nigh t after our English class, as M\u00e1rio and Angela gave me a lift to the Liberdade subway stati on, they asked me about my research. When I described my topic, the following conversati on ensued: M\u00e1rio: But why should there be a health policy for blacks? That sounds like racism. Angela: No, we had to take a workshop about that at work. Bl acks have specific health issues because they are more\u2014geneti cally they have issues, like they are born with sickle cell anemia because it's a disease of the black race, and they also suffer more from lots of other health problems. Like having diabetes and hypertension that are more comp licated [than in whites]. M\u00e1rio: Ah, yes. In that case, it makes sense\u2014if they have specific genetic issues, like for instance the way blacks are better at sports. This exchange exemplifies several common themes th at arose frequently in my conversations with Brazilians about black health is sues. M\u00e1rio, like many Brazilians, considered policies for specific racial groups to b e divisive and even racist\u2014unless, that is, they addressed blacks' genetic differences. In other words, he did not see the need to create a special health policy for blacks based on racial discrimination or social inequalities between blacks and whites; the only ac ceptable reason to treat blacks 59 differently, in M\u00e1rio's opinion, was their greater genetic predisposition to certain diseases. M\u00e1rio also expressed his belief that blac ks are genetically unique in some way that confers superior athletic prowess. Meanwhile, Angela had learned at work that black p atients had worse health problems than whites, although she could not articu late exactly why that was the case. Like M\u00e1rio, she seemed to find the genetic explanat ion most plausible. After all, she had learned that sickle cell anemia was a \"black diseas e,\" and she knew that it was genetic. From there, she applied the genetic explanation to other health problems from which (she had learned) blacks suffered disproportionately, li ke diabetes and hypertension. When I discussed the National Health Policy for the Black Population with other Brazilian friends and acquaintances, they often bro ught up the race-based affirmative action quotas that had been instituted in several B razilian universities in 2001. Many denounced affirmative action in both education and health as examples of \"puta racismo\" (\"damned racism\"). Not surprisingly, this reaction was more common in white or lighter- skinned Brazilians than in black or darker-skinned Brazilians. Several months earlier, I had attended a course f or community volunteers at a large public hospital in S\u00e3o Mateus, a low-income a rea of S\u00e3o Paulo. \"Sa\u00fade Popula\u00e7\u00e3o Negra e Controle Social\" (The Bl ack Population's Health and Social Control), had been organized and paid for by the state health department of S\u00e3o Paulo. The course was meant to encourage active com munity members to \"monitor\" (monitorar ) the implementation of a new race-tracking system at the hospital. All hospital employees had taken the course and had bee n trained to ask patients, \"What is 60 your color or race?\" ( Qual \u00e9 sua cor ou ra\u00e7a? ) at intake and during medical consultations. The course instructor, Arlene, was a black health activist and nurse's assistant. She and the students, who were mostly adults in the ir forties and fifties, lived in low- income neighborhoods scattered around the impoveris hed Zona Leste (East Zone) of S\u00e3o Paulo. Arlene had very light brown skin and identif ied as negra (black), while the students represented many different phenotypes and racial identities. The class took place in a hospital meeting room with flimsy-looking whit e walls that resembled particleboard. Around nine in the morning, when most of the studen ts had arrived, Arlene called the class to order. She stood in front of the raised pl atform, on the same level as the students, who sat at student desks in a semi-circle formation . First, Arlene reviewed the question that she had assigned as last week's homework: \"Why is negra: para qu\u00ea?\") In other words, she was asking why public healthcare providers should pay special atte ntion to black patients' health issues. She formulated the question in a way that affirmed blacks' health as an ontological entity, distinct from the health of non-blacks. Arlene aske d them to go around in a circle and share their responses. Gilda, a petite white homemaker, answered that it is important \"to recognize the black race's student, a middle-aged white woman, responded that \"blacks are discriminated against a bit, but then, so is everyone. I am also discriminated against as a white woman [branquela ].\" Others nodded in agreement. She finished with t he phrase, \"health is for everybody\u2014not just for blacks.\" Next, a light brown- skinned woman named Zelda 61 commented, \"each person should be respected as uniq ue.\" Another light brown-skinned woman echoed her white classmate in stating that \"h ealth is for everyone\u2014people of all colors, not just for blacks.\" Finally, a young blac k woman with plaits in her hair cited some statistics stating that black men and women di e earlier and receive less anesthesia during surgery than whites. She referred to \"black people's illnesses\" ( doen\u00e7as de negro ) and stressed the importance of early detection for diseases like sickle cell anemia. As shown by this sample of their comments, the stu dents expressed a wide variety of reactions to the idea of a special area of healt h care devoted to blacks. Three students of about twelve were in favor of public clinics and hospitals devoting special attention to blacks' \"specific\" health issues ( doen\u00e7as espec\u00edficas ). Only one an elderly white Spiritist, believed that race-conscious health poli cy was warranted due to racial discrimination within the clinics. About half of th e students opposed the idea of paying special attention to blacks' health issues, and sev eral even found it racist. They interpreted it as exclusionary toward non-blacks, e ven though Arlene had taught them that blacks had in fact been excluded from quality health care in Brazil. Furthermore, the students who expressed resistance to the new policies seemed to believe that public clinics would henceforth priori tize black patients over non-black patients. This belief emerges in the students' view of public health as a limited good. \"Health for all\" had been a rallying cry of the Popular Health Movem ent (Movimento Popular da Sa\u00fade) during the 1980s, when citizens fought for the righ t to universal public health care in Brazil. Now, when students were faced with the prosp ect of race-conscious health care, they revived their slogan but imbued it with a slig htly different meaning\u2014whereas 62 before, they uttered \"health for all\" to protest th e exclusion of the non-employed from public health care, they now used it to mean \"no sp ecial treatment for certain groups.\" The fact that students framed their opposition in this way also evokes the wider debate within Brazil over affirmative action quotas in public universities and government employment. Although race-conscious health care pra ctices do not involve quotas or prioritizing black patients over non-blacks, the Br azilians with whom I spoke over the years often assumed that they did. More often than not, they would articulate their disapproval of race-conscious health care by denoun cing affirmative action quotas in university admissions, thereby conflating the two i ssues. I recount these stories not only to illustrate the immense variability of narratives on race and health expressed by Brazilian citizens, but also to highlight the extent to which the idea of race-conscious health care remain s a strange concept to many Brazilians. Having grown up in the United States, w here minority health initiatives blend relatively easily into the fabric of racialized \"co mmon sense\", I was particularly aware of Brazilians' discomfort with the idea. For most Braz ilians, the practice of making racial distinctions between citizens\u2014even with the goal of combating inequality\u2014smacks of racism. In this chapter, I present ethnographic data from r esearch with patients and health care providers in Brazilian public health clinics a nd low-income neighborhoods. I show that a majority of patients and healthcare professi onals who participated in my study do not perceive health inequalities along racial lines . Rather, they tend to attribute health inequalities to social class. Moreover, my informan ts tended to categorize racial identity in ways that challenged the race categories deploye d by the National Health Policy for 63 the Black Population. Finally, I show that, in resp onse to the disjuncture between politicized versus \"commonsense\" discourses on race and health in Brazil, both patients and providers routinely circumvent the new race-con scious health measures being implemented in public clinics throughout the nation . My overall goal in this chapter is to give the rea der an idea of how non-activist Brazilians think about race and health. Although it seems plausible that recent shifts in Brazil's official discourse on race could have a \"t rickle-down\" effect on the Brazilian people's racial ideologies, this is speculation tha t lies outside the scope of this dissertation. Instead, I will focus on the followin g question: to what extent do Brazilians still view race as fluid and situational? Researche rs who have studied Brazilians' everyday uses of discourses on race and color prese nt varying results. Twine (1998) found that white middle-class Brazilians tended to identify both light- and dark-skinned Brazilians of African descent as black ( pretos ). Although whites in the small town where she conducted her fieldwork expressed the discourse of mesti\u00e7agem (race-mixing) to claim that there was no racism in their town, they consistently discriminated against both light- and dark-skinned African Brazilians when it came to marriage and hiring practices. People of color, on the other hand, tended to \"whit en\" their racial identity by identifying as moreno . In her ethnography of a Rio de Janeiro favela, She riff (2001) argues that residents actually classified race in terms of black and whit e ( negro and branco ), although they used a plethora of terms such as moreno and mulato to describe people's phenotypic features. Sheriff draws a distinction between her i nformants' conception of race as a deeper, immutable condition, on the one hand, and t heir understanding of color as a 64 superficial configuration of physical features, on the other. In addition to essentialist (bipolarized) racial discourses and descriptive col or discourses, Sheriff identifies a \"pragmatic discourse\" that serves to soften referen ces to blackness by substituting them with such terms as moreno . Many scholars observe that Brazilians tend to avoi d mentioning race or color (e.g., Twine 1998, Goldstein 2003). According to Sh eriff, Brazilians' conspicuous silence regarding these topics indexes a collective public denial of racism, although she argues that privately, Brazilians are painfully aware of i ts prominence in their daily lives. She reads this silence as both a public capitulation to racism and a private, though shared, form of resistance. Brazilian anthropologist Jo\u00e3o C osta Vargas (2004) contends that Brazilians' reluctance to discuss race actually ste ms from their hyper-consciousness of unequal racial dynamics within their society. Their silence around issues of race, according to Vargas, serves to reinforce and mainta in white supremacy in Brazil. Patients' Narratives on Race and Health These features of Brazilian popular race ideology were illustrated repeatedly over the course of my own fieldwork with public health p atients in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and S\u00e3o Paulo (see Table 1). 15 I conducted 159 short interviews, each lasting bet ween 10 minutes and one hour, with patients in public clinics and low-i ncome neighborhoods served by the public health system. I focused on public health pa tients\u2014who tend to live in lower- income areas\u2014rather than wealthier Brazilians with access to private health care, in order to capture the discourses of the population directl y affected by the shift toward race- 15 Due to practical circumstances, my sample was not r andomized, and because of the small data set my results would not be considered statistically signi ficant. Nevertheless, I believe these descriptive d ata reveal some important trends that shed light on my researc h questions. 65 conscious public health policy. I realize, however, that my analysis provides only a partial picture of Brazilians' racial discourses. In both S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and S\u00e3o Paulo, I accompanied comm unity health workers on their routine neighborhood rounds. At each househol d in S\u00e3o Paulo, I obtained consent and administered the interview to any adult family member who answered the door. Several of these visits stretched into longer conve rsations, with additional family members and neighbors drifting in and out and contr ibuting to the discussion. I conducted most of the S\u00e3o Paulo interviews in a recently inco rporated urban community of Tabo\u00e3o da Serra, a town located in the western periphery o f Greater S\u00e3o Paulo. A handful of the S\u00e3o Paulo interviews also took place at a neighborh ood association in the Campo Limpo subdistrict. In S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, I interviewed clinic pati ents waiting to be seen in the lower- income neighborhood of Cruzeiro do Anil. I was care ful to conduct the interviews on several different days of the week and in various s pecialty as well as general departments. As Table 1 shows, most of my patient informants wer e women. This was because clinic directors authorized me to conduct interviews durin g weekdays, when many men were out either working, or looking for work. Table 1. Characteristics of Sample Population. CITY % MALE % FEMALE YEARS OF AGE (avg.) YEARS OF SCHOOL (avg.)

As a result, residents were now receiving regular garbage collection, water, el ectricity, and mail service. However, there were still occasional water shortages that la sted for four to five days. There were no banks in the area, and only a couple of public tele phones. The community had begun roughly thirty years earlier as an invas\u00e3o (\"invaded\" community) when three migrants from northeast Brazil seized the land and claimed i t as their own. They subsequently divided the land into lots and sold them to familie s, most of whom were also northeastern migrants. The prices varied from 500 reais (about US$300 in mid-2009) to a television set. Although the community had problems with marijuana and cocaine dealers and gangs, the violence had quieted down considerably b y the time I did fieldwork there. Two of the community health workers I accompanied on ro unds, Alice and Elisa, giggled that there used to be presuntos (corpses) in the streets every weekend when they w ere young. Elisa remembered her mother making everyone lie dow n on their living room floor while she listened to bullets whizzing past the roof tile s. At the time of my fieldwork, residents reported that there was only about one \"presunto\" p er month on the neighborhood streets. They attributed the decrease in violence to the fac t that members of the community's rival gangs had killed each other off. Jardim Solid\u00e1rio lies flush against a large grocery store, a massive cemetery, and a medical waste repository. There are several evangel ical churches and one large Catholic 16 Place names have been changed to protect the commun ities that participated in my study. 67 church in the area. Flooding is a big problem in th e community, since many houses are balanced precariously on sloped dirt lots and many of the roads are unpaved. Residents often lose their homes during the rainy season and are forced to rebuild. The houses vary widely in appearance. Many are bare brick or \"Madei rite\" (a synthetic wood-like material) with \"Brasilit\" roofs (sheets of corrugat ed iron), but others are concrete block and some are painted in bright pastels. When I was there, there were very few cars parked on the streets. Satellite dishes sprang from the to ps of many houses, and between the houses were dark, narrow alleyways with tiny steps leading up or down the hill to the next level. Next to many of these alleyways were tin y yards where miscellaneous building scraps had been piled up and abandoned. La mpposts were few and far between, and many of the posts sported a crazily threaded ar ray of \"gato\" (illegal) wires plugged into the main power line. Several families ran smal l bars, lanchonetes (snack bars), and dry goods stores from their garages. Although I did fieldwork at three clinics in S\u00e3o L u\u00eds, I conducted most patient interviews at an ambulat\u00f3rio , or walk-in clinic located within the urgent care facility in Cruzeiro do Anil. In mid-2008, the facility drew a little over 300 patients per day from Cruzeiro do Anil, in addition to many other neighbo rhoods located in the periphery of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds. The clinic offered both emergent and non- emergent general medical care, as well as specialized care on certain days. The clini c's services included dermatology, gynecology, cardiology, and pediatrics as well as v accinations and patient education and monitoring groups for diabetics and hypertensives. Since the clinic had lost funding, no dental services were available. The clinic was prec ariously stocked and staffed, which often sparked outrage among the patients. Each morn ing, beginning about 6 AM, a long 68 line would form around the block. The line would pe rsist all day from 7-8 AM, when the clinic usually opened, until 6-7 PM, when it was cl osed to non-emergent cases. It was commonplace to see posted signs declaring \"no banda ges today\" on the clinic's front wall. Specialists were present for only a few hours on one morning or afternoon per week, thus forcing patients to wait long hours in t he hopes of obtaining an appointment slot. My first impression of the clinic was that it resembled a prison; the reception area was protected by a barred door and a full-time secu rity guard. The lone receptionist worked from inside a cage, complaining loudly to hi s co-workers about the impatient, desperate people in line and scribbling down vital statistics when patients thrust their ID cards through the bars, trying to get his attention . The receptionist, security guard, and custodial staff often referred to the clinic among themselves as a prison ( I conducted patient interviews in two dis parate cities of northeast and southeast Brazil, the patients' responses demonstra ted a remarkable uniformity. When I asked patients to identify their \"color or race\" (t he format used by Brazilian Census takers), more often than not they would respond wit h self-conscious laughter, glance at the skin on their own forearms, and ask me what I t hought. Similarly, when they answered the question, they would often present the ir responses in the form of another question, for instance, \"I don't know, moreno ?\" Only fifteen percent of patients referred to themselves as \"negro\" or \"negra,\" even when they had very dark skin and prominent African features. Those who identified themselves a s \"negro/a,\" however, tended to 69 pronounce the term in an emphatic way that indicate d its charged nature. Only two people referred to themselves as \"preto/a,\" the mor e traditional term for \"black.\" 17 Table 2. Self-Identified Race or Color. Table 3. Beliefs Regarding Health Outcomes between Blacks and Whites. Although 45% of my sample identified as moreno/a , indicating their subscription to the idea of racial mixture, 47% expressed the id ea that blacks and whites were essentially different at a physical level (Table 3) . This was in response to questions about health-related differences between blacks and white s. 18 Additionally, in both cities, interviewees repeatedly told me that blacks are hea lthier than whites. A striking 43% stated that whites actually have worse health outco mes than blacks. Many people commented that blacks age more slowly, have a lower incidence than whites of diseases ranging from skin cancer to leprosy to AIDS, and ge nerally enjoy better overall health 17 In Table 2, I have listed only the four most common ly listed race/color categories. 18 The color terms were phrased in the respondent's pr eferred terminology, elicited earlier in the interv iew.

If s he were white, she would no longer be alive.\" --43-year-old unemployed woman, 12 years of school, identified as morena Other responses asserted blacks' superior toleranc e for pain, illness, and childbirth: \"Blacks are stronger than whites. I am diabetic, b ut I don't feel the symptoms that other diabetics have. I also have high blood pressu re, but it's controlled with medication.\" --74-year-old homemaker, 11 years of school, identi fied \"People of color ( a cor morena ) are stronger than white people ( a cor branca ). If a moreno complains, it means s/he is already very ill.\" --71-year-old retired woman, 0 years of school, ide ntified as morena 71 \"Whites get sick more often, people of color ( a cor negra ) are more resistant. White women who have had one child look like they'v e had ten, while black women with four or five children look as if they haven't had a ny.\" --48-year-old college-educated housewife, identifie d as morena The stereotype of blacks as more physically resist ant to pain and suffering is echoed in many countries that participated in the A tlantic slave trade. Harriet Washington illustrates this point powerfully in her book Medical Apartheid (2006), which recounts the long history of African-American research subje cts' abuse in the name of medical science. When I asked them why blacks would be more resilient ( resistentes ) than whites, several people responded that blacks' ancestors had been slaves and therefore had to be strong and healthy in order to perform slave labor. They implied that these traits were passed on to their descendants. In contrast, only 4% of respondents stated that bl acks suffer from more health problems than whites. Significantly, many of these responses, like those that affirmed the opposite, relied on the trope of blood. For instanc e, a 50-year-old negra homemaker with six years of formal schooling told me, \"Blacks have thicker blood. They have more diabetes, cholesterol, and heart attacks. They suff er more.\" The theme of blacks having \"stronger\" or \"thicker\" blood was recurrent. Once, during a visit to a neighborhood association in Campo Limpo, S\u00e3o Paulo, I was interv iewing two black women who identified as negra , and an elderly man who identified as branco . The man was the father-in-law of one of the women, Maria. The other woman, Carol, said, \"the black race has more health problems...it's in the blood.\" When I asked what kinds of illnesses blacks experience disproportionately, Carol responded, \"st rokes and sickle cell anemia.\" Maria 72 added that \"arthritis and osteoporosis are more pre valent in [people of] our color.\" When I asked why blacks would suffer more strokes, she r eplied, \"Their blood is stronger. It clogs their veins ( entope as veias ).\" Carol and Maria's father-in-law agreed with her . A few people also mentioned that blacks suffered m ore from skin diseases, and one person specifically mentioned vitiligo. Of the respondents who claimed blacks have worse health outcomes, few offered non-essentialist explanations for the perceived disparity. For instance, as a 41-year-old branca female shopkeeper observed, \"blacks do not have good living conditions. When they do not h ave a clean living environment, their social milieu produces more illness...especially du e to [poor] diet.\" Two other respondents noted that blacks have less time to see k treatment for health problems because they work so much, and that they have less financial resources to seek \"quality\" (i.e., private) health care. Overall, however, essentialist explanations for pe rceived physical differences between blacks and whites dominated respondents' an swers about unequal health outcomes according to race. This finding was surpri sing, considering the affirmation by many scholars (i.e., Skidmore 1993a, Silva 1998) th at Brazilians do not believe in separate races, but rather in one Brazilian race wi th many \"colors\" ( cores ) or phenotypes. In fact, when I asked my informants to define \"race ,\" many replied either that they did not know how to define it, or they rejected the con cept outright. A common response was, \"race is for dogs. There is only one human rac e.\" Whether this was an example of the public denial of race in service of the ideolog y of racial democracy that Sheriff proposes, I cannot say. But it is difficult to reco ncile informants' discomfort with, or 73 rejection of, the race concept with their perceptio n of physical differences between blacks and whites that are significant enough to cause obv ious health disparities. Most surprising of all, however, was the assertion by 43% of respondents that whites have worse health outcomes than blacks. This , combined with the 51% who believed there were no racial health disparities, w ould most likely constitute a significant obstacle to their acceptance of a health policy to address worse health outcomes among black Brazilians\u2014although, at the time of my resear ch, virtually none of my informants were aware of the new policy. While they were aware that they were now being asked to identify their race or color in SUS clinics, they d id not know why (and even that was done on a haphazard basis, as I will discuss below) . My informants' responses corroborate Sheriff's arg uments that Brazilians 1) often experience discomfort in discussing race open ly; 2) tend to prefer euphemisms for blackness, such as moreno ; and 3) at times, express a discourse of race (as opposed to color) as an essential biological quality. As my in formants' responses showed, Brazilians articulate competing and malleable concepts of race and color. Sometimes they naturalize race, while other times they portray race as a flex ible part of one's identity that can fluctuate according to factors such as relative soc ioeconomic status. Their responses reveal, as Sheriff found, \"a profound ambivalence a bout concepts of race, color, and racialized identity\" (2001: 31). Nevertheless, Brazi lians live comfortably with these seeming contradictions, negotiating them with humor and euphemisms, as Sheriff discusses. I did not get the sense, as Sheriff did in her stu dy, that most of my informants shared a bipolarized model of race. When I elicited interview respondents' race and/or 74 color schemes, the average number of colors listed by each was 3.5. Respondents self- identified their color/race using the following ter a nd amarela (yellow). When I asked respondents to list all the possible human races or colors they could think of, they listed many additional categories. As I mentioned in the Introduction, recent epidemi ological studies show that black Brazilians have higher rates of maternal and infant mortality, and die in greater numbers than whites from HIV/AIDS, homicide, alcoho lism and mental illness, heart disease and stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and tub erculosis (Ara\u00fajo et al. 2009, Batista 2005, Batista et al. 2004, Chor & Lima 2005, Cardos o et al. 2005, Fonseca et al. 2007, Lessa et al. 2006, Lotufo et al. 2007, Martins 2006 , Santos et al. 2007). If we are to accept these findings, how can we explain my inform ants' widespread belief to the contrary? Are these subjects misrecognizing (Althus ser 1971) the racialized configuration of power relations and how they affect black Brazil ians' bodies unequally? If so, from what sources could this misrecognition have origina ted? The trope of whites as having \"weaker\" blood, and African Brazilians having \"stronger\" blood, also appears in Gilberto Freyre's Casa Grande e Senzala . In his seminal work, Freyre argues that the Portuguese wer e better able to withstand life in the tropics because they had intermixed with Moors; whe n they came to Brazil and intermixed with enslaved Africans, their ability to adapt to life in the colony improved dramatically. It appears that the tropes recorded b y Freyre in 1934 have long inhabited 75 the collective Brazilian race imagination (if we ca n speak of such a thing) and are continually reproduced through Brazilians' habitus (Bourdieu 1977). Pierre Bourdieu (1977) syste m of lasting, transposable dispositions which, integrating past experiences, f unctions at every moment as a matrix of perceptions, appreciations, and actions and makes possible the achievement of infinitely diversified tasks...\" (82-83, emphasis in the origi nal). Bourdieu argues that social reproduction occurs constantly through habitus, whi ch in turn is constituted through an iterative feedback loop between social actors' subj ectivity and the objectivity of the social field. In other words, individuals in a give n society continually and unconsciously adjust their thoughts and actions to comply with th e unstated collective norms of their social environment. A key aspect of this process is that social actors, according to Bourdieu, learn to expect only what the social fiel d teaches them is possible. Bourdieu argues further that social actors are incited by th e social order to misrecognize systems of inequality as natural or self-evident. How does Bourdieu's theory apply to the case at ha nd? Again, if we accept the statistics generated by the Brazilian epidemiologis ts cited above, there is a significant mismatch between my informants' perception of black s as having equal or even better health than whites, on the one hand, and the statis tical picture of blacks' worse health outcomes, on the other. Up until recently, these st atistics were not available; they are still not publicized widely, beyond the occasional newspa per article. 19 Prior to the Brazilian government's acknowledgement of racism and endorsem ent of race-conscious public 19 E.g., Folha de uilibrio/noticias/ult263u586716.shtml. Last accesse d December 16, 2010. 76 policies, then, Brazilian citizens had little basis for generating an alternative ideology to the myth of racial democracy. That is not to say th at Brazilians are unaware of racial inequalities in their daily lives, but rather that their habitus of denying the existence of race-based inequalities in the field of health is s o strong that alternative accounts are effectively discouraged\u2014at least, most of the time. Part of their dominant habitus, as I mentioned above, draws on colonial narratives about the physical strength of blacks versus whites in the tropics. Another important asp ect of their habitus involves attributing observable inequalities to class rather than race p er se. 20 The working-class Brazilians I interviewed do not misrecognize their socioeconomic ally subjugated position in society; to the contrary, most were adamant that health ineq ualities lie between rich versus poor citizens, but not black versus white citizens. Rath er, if the aforementioned epidemiological studies are reliable (and many of t hem claim to have controlled for socioeconomic status), then my informants misrecogn ize the additional health costs of being nonwhite in Brazil (see Silva 1985). Health Care Professionals' Narratives on Race and H ealth I observed a similar range of racial discourses ex pressed by public health professionals enrolled in a course called \"The Blac k Population's Health\" (\"Sa\u00fade da in October 2007. The c ourse took place in a small town called Chapadinha, located about four hours by coll ective van from S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds. In contrast to the course I observed in S\u00e3o Paulo, which was or ganized by the state health department, the course in Chapadinha was organized by AKONI, a S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds black 20 But is there such a thing as race \"per se\" in Brazi l? Or anywhere else, for that matter? Under Brazil' s new biopolitical regime, the state increasingly pin points racial discrimination as the cause for obser ved inequalities between blacks, browns, and whites in measures of health, education, employment, and a ho st of other quality of life indices. 77 movement association working for the empowerment of African Brazilians. In this case, the state health department of Maranh\u00e3o sponsored t he course, since AKONI had received state funding along with other NGOs with co mmunity health projects geared toward \"specific populations\" ( popula\u00e7\u00f5es espec\u00edficas ). The goal of the Chapadinha course was to educate public health workers from quilombo areas (former maroon communities) about \"black health.\" The course was held in an old, dusty meeting room within Chapadinha's city hall. Due to the scorching heat outside, the improvised c lassroom's lights were kept off throughout the course. AKONI activists had decorate d its walls with Ministry of Health posters about institutional racism and the quesito ra\u00e7a/cor (the race/color item now included on patient charts). One poster featured a white pai-de-santo (priest of Afro- Brazilian religion) in full ceremonial dress along with the phrase, \"Consult the b\u00fazios [oracle], but take the [HIV] test.\" The students, who included SUS nurses and communit y health workers, sat in a circle in the center of the room. They ranged in ag e from about twenty-five to forty, and all had either white or light brown skin. Many of t hem wore clinic uniforms or SUS T- shirts. The instructors were both black movement ac tivists from S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds. In addition to being the founder of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds' oldest and most fame d black movement organization, Dr. Lucas is a physician and professor of medicine at t he Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o. At the time of the course, he was also serving on the Technical Committee in charge of drafting the National Health Policy for the Black P opulation in Bras\u00edlia. Gl\u00f3ria is an occupational therapist who, at that time, had just defended her undergraduate thesis on the racial identities of sickle cell anemia patient s in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds. 78 Dr. Lucas began the class by asking, \"Why is black health an important issue?\" He then answered his own question by explaining tha t the public health section of the Brazilian Constitution guarantees the three princip les of \"equity, universality, and comprehensiveness ( integralidade ).\" 21 However, he added, since there is no real equity within SUS, the black population is rendered \"vulne rable.\" He went on to recount events in Brazilian history during which the government ha d shown preferential treatment toward European immigrants and white landowners by using land quotas. At this point, I looked around the room and notice d that the students' eyes were glazing over. Dr. Lucas held up a SUS book titled SUS from A to Z and pointed to the array of ethnically diverse, smiling people on the cover. \"When we mix, we become more beautiful,\" he told the class. \"We want each popula tion group to receive adequate health care. We need identity to form communities and a co untry with diversity. SUS providers need to recognize the particular features of each g roup.\" Next, he reviewed elements of the National Health Policy for the Black Population and observed that \"negros\" and \"Afro-descendants\" accounted for fifty percent of t he Brazilian population. He explained to the class that the Policy is important because b lacks have special health concerns such as sickle cell anemia and hypertension. Hypertensio n, he explained, is elevated in blacks both due to \"social conditions\" and because their h igher levels of melanin cause them to \"absorb more salt\" than whites. After Dr. Lucas finished his presentation, Gl\u00f3ria told the class about her research with sickle cell anemia patients. She had interview ed countless patients who self- 21 Actually, the three principles of Article 196 are equality , universality, and comprehensiveness. \"Comprehensiveness,\" or integralidade , refers to the full array of health services, both preventive and curative, provided by SUS. It also indicates the pr inciple of holism in health care, or defining healt h as general well-being, rather than merely the absence of sickness. 79 identified as \"moreno\" even though, as Gl\u00f3ria excla imed, \" I knew they were black (negros )!\" She then spoke about the unconscious racial dis crimination manifest within the Portuguese language, for example within popular phrases such as \"a coisa t\u00e1 preta!\" [the situation is looking \"black,\" or unfavorable]. Next, the instructors opened the floor for student discussion. An environmental health specialist named Marcos recalled instances o f discrimination that he had observed in the SUS clinic where he worked. Almost always, h e said, a beautiful ( bonita ) female patient is treated differently than a dirty one ( mulher suja ). A female community health agent spoke of a black friend of hers who had exper ienced discrimination during their graduation. \"She is black, but she is a marvelous p erson!\" she exclaimed. Marcos pointed at Gl\u00f3ria and said, \"if I were to call her 'black' ( negra ), she could sue me!\" Gl\u00f3ria responded that it is not even easy for blacks to id entify as negro . A young morena nurse named Soraya then posed the following question: \"if we want equality, then how can we have university quotas for blacks?\" She added quick ly that, despite her light skin and straight hair, \"I'm not racist\u2014I have black ancesto rs.\" Her comment sparked a flurry of debate among the students, most of whom agreed that the quotas were racist and/or insufficient to solve the deep-rooted causes of rac ial inequality in educational access. Soon, it was time to break into small groups. We h ad to answer questions such as, \"why is it important to study black health?\" In my group, the students began by discussing the \"typical health problems of underser ved populations\" [ doen\u00e7as Marcos mentioned that schistosomiasis was brough t to Brazil by Africans. Dr. Lucas, who was listening in , confirmed this. Soraya then asked Dr. Lucas if blacks are more physically \"resistant\" or hardy than whites, and Dr. Lucas 80 replied that whites and blacks present the same deg ree of resilience. He added that elevated rates of hypertension and diabetes in blac ks are due more to unfavorable life conditions than to genes, although genes also play a role. The following group question, \"how do you work with the black population?\" was me t with mystified silence. \"I've never thought about it before,\" admitted Soraya. \"Y ou treat the patients' differences in order to bring equality to everyone,\" prompted Dr. Lucas. When it was time for each of the four groups to pr esent, our group's presenter, a male community health worker, surprised us by devot ing most of his commentary to affirmative action in higher education. \"Often, bla cks are discriminated against not by whites, but by other blacks,\" he stated. \"If we alr eady have university quotas, why not have a health policy for the black population? Howe ver, this policy cannot be a long-term solution, otherwise it will become harmful ( prejudicial ). You can't have different programs for different groups.\" He then spoke brief ly about women's health programs, but did not seem to find those problematic. ***** I chose to recount the Chapadinha class here becau se it provides a window into the various models of racial identity currently cir culating in Brazil. While the activist- instructors conveyed a bipolarized model of racial identity, and global discourses on the relationship between race and health, their student s' responses varied considerably. Unaccustomed to \"seeing\" patients in terms of race, the students grasped for a common denominator. They came up with university quotas, w hich are the prototype for formalized racial difference in contemporary Brazil ian society. As evidenced by their remarks, students' opinions of university quotas ra n the gamut of tentative acceptance to 81 strong opposition. Overall, they seemed to feel the quotas were at best unnecessary and at worst, discriminatory. 22 At the same time, the students expressed fundament al discomfort with the prospect of openly acknowledging someone's race. Th is point was made most powerfully when Marcos expressed his fear of being sued simply for referring to someone as negro . Over the course of fieldwork, I would hear this ide a repeatedly from non-activists who seemed to misunderstand the Brazilian law that crim inalizes racist speech, or the 1989 Ca\u00f3 Law ( Lei Ca\u00f3 ). Although the instructors articulated a bipolarized model of racial identity, both they and the students also expressed mixed models o f racial identity. Consider Dr. Lucas' comments, for instance, about the multi-colored peo ple on the cover of SUS from A to Z . While he praised their obvious mixed heritage, he a lso extolled the value of group identity and stressed the need for doctors to recog nize and treat the specificities of each racial group. Meanwhile, several of the students we re reluctant to utter the term \"negro\" or even to make direct references to race. Marcos, for example, contributed to a discussion of racial discrimination in the clinic b y recounting the differential treatment he had witnessed of \"beautiful\" versus \"dirty\" women. He seemed to be discussing race in the coded way I often observed during my fieldwork. Non-activists, in relating hypothetical instances of discrimination between bl acks and whites, would often refer to the black person as \"disheveled\" [ menos arrumado ] or even \"ugly\" [ feio ] and to the white 22 Here, I mean \"discriminatory\" in a negative sense, as opposed to the term \"positive discrimination\" which Brazilians and members of other nations such as Britain often use to describe affirmative action . 82 person as \"beautiful\" [ bonito ] or \"well put-together\" or \"well-dressed\" [ arrumado or bem-vestido ]. Additionally, the class revealed varied attempts b y both instructors and students to theorize racial health disparities and their causes . Dr. Lucas, for instance, affirmed that genetic predisposition to salt sensitivity is linke d to blacks' higher rates of hypertension. Although this theory has been debunked by several p rominent scientists (e.g., Cooper et al. 2005), researchers still wrestle with nature-nu rture hypotheses in their attempts to explain disparities in hypertension between blacks and whites (e.g., Brewster et al. 2000, Kaufman & Hall 2003). Like them, Dr. Lucas acknowle dged that \"social conditions,\" by which he seemed to mean the consequences of poverty , probably play a significant role in these disparities. The students also struggled to explain the connect ion between race and health outcomes. Recall Soraya's question about blacks bei ng more physically resilient than whites. This belief was quite common among the non- activists with whom I interacted over two years of fieldwork in northeast and southe ast Brazil. Some of the students also demonstrated an interest in the origins of diseases such as sickle cell anemia and schistosomiasis, which in both cases were traced to Africa. 23 Finally, Dr. Lucas effectively reinterpreted the B razilian Constitution when he substituted \"equity\" for \"equality.\" This choice of language can be traced to the current vogue of the word \"equity\" in health disparities re search and activism on a global scale, not to mention race-conscious policies in general. The idea that \"unequal groups must be 23 In subsequent research of the literature on schisto somiasis, I found no data to support an African ori gin for this disease. Incidentally, the schistosome S. mansoni , which is the vector for the variant of the disease that is endemic to Brazil, was discovered by Bahian physician Manuel Augusto Piraj\u00e1 da Silva in the ea rly twentieth century. 83 treated unequally\" to achieve justice is ubiquitous in the sphere of affirmative action in Brazil and abroad. I discuss this in detail in Chap ter 4. Although no SUS administrators or providers were w illing to go on record saying they were against race-conscious health programs, s everal administrators reported working with colleagues who questioned the need \"be hind the scenes\" for such programs. Similarly, SUS administrators reported that many pa tients had expressed confusion or discomfort when asked to declare their race or colo r in public health clinics. Some patients, they told me, interpret the question itse lf as racist, and voice the fear that SUS will use this data to discriminate against them. 24 Others simply do not see the need for these programs. My interview with Dr. Karen, the director of a Cam po Limpo public health clinic in the periphery of S\u00e3o Paulo, brought forth severa l of these issues. Tall and blonde, Dr. Karen is actually a nurse from the southern Brazili an state of Santa Catarina. 25 Even though most would identify her as white, she self-i dentifies as parda due to her indigenous ancestry. When I told her about my proje ct, she shrugged and commented, \"for us, color is totally irrelevant. In our day-to -day work, color does not matter at all. The black population is only different in terms of hypertension. For us, the relevant patient categories are age and sex.\" I asked her wh o \"us\" was, and she replied, \"the Ministry of Health.\" Then, I proceeded to ask her a bout the differences between blacks and whites in regard to hypertension. She told me t hat blacks are more likely than whites 24 Various providers and administrators of public heal th clinics in S\u00e3o Paulo reported incidents with patients over the race/color question. In S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, none of the clinics I visited were collecting race /color data from patients. 25 In Brazil, people with bachelor's degrees are commo nly addressed as \"Doctor.\" Also in keeping with established social etiquette, health professionals are addressed by their title and their first name, rather than their last name. 84 to have higher blood pressure readings and medicati on-resistant hypertension. She did not know why this was the case; although she thought it could be genetic, she could see no \"structural\" (physical) differences between blacks and whites. In terms of hypertension treatment, she affirmed that all SUS patients recei ve ACE inhibitors such as Captopril or Enalapril, since these medications are the only one s provided by the Ministry of Health. When asked about the National Health Policy for th e Black Population, Dr. Karen commented that it is nothing more than political ma neuvering that allows the state to say it has done something for blacks. Next, I asked abou t race statistics and recordkeeping in the clinic. Although according to the law, doctors and nurses must mark the patient's race on certain patient records, and the patient is supp osed to declare his or her own race, Dr. Karen revealed that in her clinic no one does this. When health professionals do note a patient's race, they just look at the patient and d ecide what color she is. That way, patients never become upset, because they are never aware their race is being recorded. Seeing that the form for pap smears had only \"black \" (negra ) and \"white\" ( branca ) categories, I asked Dr. Karen which category doctor s and nurses checked when faced with a brown patient. She answered, \"white. They on ly check negra when the patient is really black (\u00e9 negro mesmo ).\" Dr. Karen's comments reiterate several features of popular race ideology in Brazil. By identifying herself as parda , she asserted her own disbelief in the bipolar model of race. She also asserted that color is not an important factor in the medical encounter, except in relation to higher rates of hy pertension in blacks\u2014and even then, there is no difference in treatment. Importantly, D r. Karen affirmed health professionals' 85 tendency (like other Brazilians, according to their traditional race ideology) to whiten their patients' racial identities. What struck me most about our interview, however, was Dr. Karen's revelation that health professionals do not conform to the Min istry of Health directive to ask patients to self-declare race. Whether it is due to their own lack of conviction in the importance of this metric, or to their reluctance t o ask their patients to identify their race, health professionals were quietly disregarding the directive. During my fieldwork in six other clinics in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and S\u00e3o Paulo, I heard ti me after time from doctors, nurses, nurses' aides, community health workers, and social workers that they either did not record patients' race, or else they simply marked d own whatever they perceived the patient's race to be. This pattern was also reported by Dr. Daniel, a pr imary care physician in Cap\u00e3o Redondo, near Campo Limpo in the southern periphery of S\u00e3o Paulo. Dr. Daniel identifies as pardo due to the mixture of black, white, and indigenous ethnicities in his family. He hails from Santar\u00e9m, Par\u00e1, in the north of Brazil. Similar to Dr. Karen, Dr. Daniel did not think Brazil needed a separate healt h policy for blacks. He told me, \"'Black health' ( sa\u00fade da popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra ) is a false argument because there is no discrimination against blacks in SUS, and whites al so present with sickle cell anemia. When a white baby is diagnosed with sickle cell dis ease, no one talks about 'black health'!\" He likened the new race-conscious health policy to an infamous episode involving race-based admissions quotas at the Feder al University of Bras\u00edlia. About two years earlier, identical twins had made the news wh en one was classified as black and admitted under the quota system, while the other wa s denied entry through the quota 86 system because he was classified as white. \"[Black movement activists] complain that there needs to be health policies for blacks, and t hey think they are helping themselves this way, but really they are asking for a worse si tuation,\" added Dr. Daniel. He felt, like Dr. Karen, that the Lula administration had impleme nted the new health policy to improve Brazil's image on the international human r ights scene. \"It's populism,\" he remarked. \"It's not a 'mea culpa' from the Brazilia n government for years of oppression against blacks; it's image control.\" Dr. Daniel agreed with Dr. Karen that blacks suffe r disproportionately from hypertension. Unlike her, however, he attributed th is fact to a structural difference in blacks' and whites' physical makeup. Since blacks h ave more smooth muscle than whites, he explained, they produce more of a partic ular enzyme that causes muscle contraction, which in turn causes higher blood pres sure. This has been proven through research in Africa, he said. For this reason, they must take ACE inhibitors. I recalled that when I had visited hypertensive patients on neighbo rhood rounds with community health teams in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Recife, everyone seemed to take Captopril. Dr. Daniel confirmed that it is prescribed to everyone, regard less of race. I expressed surprise; hadn't he just identified ACE inhibitors as a \"blac k\" drug? He responded that they must be given to blacks, because \"genetically they are b etter for blacks,\" but they can be given to whites as well with no adverse effects. To illustrate his point further, Dr. Daniel relate d a House episode in which a black patient refuses to take the congestive heart failur e drug, BiDil, which is marketed to blacks in the United States. In response, Dr. House rips up the prescription he was writing, writes the exact same one (the patient had not read the first one) and tells him 87 this \"new\" drug is for everyone, irrespective of ra ce. House's black staff doctor becomes angry when he discovers what House has done, but Ho use maintains that he tricked the patient for his own good. Dr. Daniel told me he oft en has to resort to this type of white lie with his own patients. I asked whether Dr. Daniel's clinic collected pati ents' race data, and he said, \"No\u2014it's not important to us.\" On referral forms, he sometimes fills it in, but only if he can check \"black\" or white\" for a racially \"unambig uous\" person. Occasionally, he checks \"pardo\" (which is present on some forms but not others), but only if the person has indigenous or \"Latin\" features\u2014not \"cabelo duro \" (hard hair) or a \"nariz achatado\" (flat nose). If the patient has brown skin and \"mix ed\" features, it is only possible to check \"white\" or \"pardo\" because they will get mad if you label them preto , he said\u2014especially older women. To avoid confusion and problems, he av oids filling it in most of the time. And nobody seems to care. Dr. Daniel's comments reproduced several of the sa me themes as Dr. Karen's, such as confusion over how to classify patients acc ording to race; denial of the existence of racial discrimination within SUS clinics; the vi ew that the new Policy amounts to political lip service; and the identification of hy pertension as the only legitimate area of special concern for black patients. However, Dr. Da niel differed from Dr. Karen in his affirmation that blacks suffer more from hypertensi on due to racial differences in their physical makeup. Regardless of their diverging etio logical theories, Drs. Daniel and Karen echoed their colleagues' and patients' questi oning of race-specific health policy, and reiterated their subtle rejection to race-speci fic health measures. 88 Health professionals' reluctance to ask patients t heir race is so pervasive that in 2009, the S\u00e3o Paulo State Health Department produce d a 106-page guide addressing the problem, titled, \"It's Not Offensive to Ask ( Perguntar N\u00e3o Ofende )!\" 26 Other studies indicate that an unwillingness to discuss race is a lso common among health professionals in other parts of Brazil. In Rio de Janeiro, for in stance, Ara\u00fajo et al. (2010) found that most health professionals they interviewed expresse d significant discomfort (constrangimento ) with the new norm of having to ask patients their r ace. Many reported, furthermore, that their patients found it not only awkward but also difficult to choose a single race category. The health professionals also revealed that some of their patients did not want to declare their race because they feared the information might somehow be used to discriminate against them in the future. Th e researchers express their surprise at discovering that so many health professionals were uncomfortable asking about patients' race, since most of the professionals thought it wa s important for identifying patterns of discrimination and health inequalities. The authors conclude that, \"there is more here than meets the eye. Something that is silent in Brazil; that is not discussed, but that we feel in everyday relations\" (245). The researchers' assessm ent lends support to Sheriff's (2001) contention that silence is a significant feature of racial dynamics in Brazil. Patients and Providers: A Counter-Biopolitics There are significant continuities between the nar ratives of patients and health professionals that I have recounted here. Although they tend to perceive one another as representing different interests, patients and heal th professionals are united in their 26 Available at: http://www.crt.saude.sp.gov.br/resour ces/crt_aids/pdfs/livro_quesito_cor.pdf. Last acces sed March 25, 2011. 89 rejection of the state's attempts to implement a ne w and foreign regime of racial classification within SUS clinics. By complaining w hen asked to identify their race, giving counter-normative answers such as moreno , or otherwise refusing to identify themselves as black, patients subvert the Ministry of Health's efforts to register and calculate a black population that will become the o bject of the new Policy. Similarly, by either neglecting to supply the racial data request ed by the Ministry of Health, or whitening their patients' racial identities, health professionals circumvent the race- specific health initiative. Whether they do it base d on their objection to the Policy's premises, their fear that racial separation will in tensify if they collaborate with the black/white classification scheme, or simply their reluctance to \"talk race\" with their patients, health professionals quietly resist the s tate's newly adopted biopolitical paradigm. Patients and providers, of course, do not perceive themselves as complicit. Rather, they tend to see one another as adversaries. Patien ts complain that doctors do not fulfill their required hours in the clinic, thereby causing patients to wait weeks and months before they are seen. Once in the office, patients claim that the doctors scribble on clipboards and prescription pads, rarely even pausi ng to look at the person sitting before them. Doctors, meanwhile, censure patients for non- compliance with prescribed therapeutic regimens and for missing appointments. Most of all, they criticize the patient- members of their clinics' participatory management boards for complaining so much. Patients and providers, then, are often locked in a near-constant face-off. Nevertheless, they have become strange bedfellows amidst the impl ementation of the National Health Policy for the Black Population. 90 Given their unspoken complicity and subtle circumv ention of racial tracking in the clinics, patients and public health professiona ls have become, paradoxically, purveyors of a \"counter-biopolitics\" vis-\u00e0-vis the state's new regime of race-conscious medicine (Comaroff 2007). Now that the state has ado pted global discourses of racial categorization and of the association between race and health outcomes, it has instituted a new mode of biopolitics that seeks to track black B razilians and, at least according to the new Policy, to maximize their health. The moment of race tracking during the medical encounter becomes a site for altered rituals of int erpellation between state and subject (Althusser 1971). In the process, the state concede s that blacks have been categorically excluded from equitable health care and proposes to redress their exclusion through an ideological makeover of the public health system, i ts employees, and their practices. In response, patients and providers have resisted the new practices and insisted on maintaining the old status quo of Brazilian popular race ideology. Ironically, therefore, the supporters of the former status quo become coun ter-biopolitical subjects. Reports of patient and provider resistance to the newly instit uted system of race-tracking in public clinics and hospitals indicate that the state's int erpellation of subjects as either negro or branco has not yet taken hold. 91 PART II: THE BLACK HEALTH AGENDA Chapter 3: The Birth of the Black Health Agenda in Brazil Today in Brazil, public health policy includes a va riable called \"the black population's health\"....We have this specific variabl e because in the past, no one admitted that the black population had specific features. Citing the principle of universality, [the Ministry of Health] assumed that everyone was included without considering their differences... [bu t] a universality that does not recognize difference is not universal. It is op pressive. - (Cl\u00e1udia, Brazilian public health administrator a nd black health activist) 27 In the last several years, Brazil has become a pro minent site for health activism and medical intervention directed toward citizens o f African descent. It is now one of the few nations in the world with race-specific health policies and programs (others include the United States and Britain). How did this happen in Brazil, a country that historically avoided formulating policies based explicitly on ra ce? My objective in this chapter is to examine the social, political, and cultural conditi ons that gave rise to the black health agenda in Brazil. By \"black health agenda,\" I mean the set of politi cal objectives and strategies aimed at the creation of a special area of public h ealth care and policy for black Brazilians. My use of the term \"black health\" to qu alify areas of activism, policy, and practice should not be read as an affirmation that blacks necessarily experience health care or health issues in a separate way; rather, it is an emic term drawn from my Brazilian informants and translated roughly into English. 28 As I discuss the ways in which the concept of \"black health\" is brought into being wit hin the Brazilian context, I will use the 27 Interviewed by the author on September 8, 2005. All informants have been given pseudonyms. The Brazilian \"black movement\" ( movimento negro ) refer s to a diverse array of civil society and government al organizations at the municipal, state, and federal levels devoted to combating racism and celebrating black identity. 28 Whereas in the original Portuguese, the term is sa\u00fade da popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra (\"the black population's health\"), I have it to \"black health\" in my writing. 92 emic term due to a lack of comparable alternatives. However, throughout my analysis I strive to problematize the concept itself, much lik e Paul Rabinow problematizes the concept of \"French DNA\" in his ethnography of propri etary genomic struggles between the United States and France (Rabinow 1999). Although the discursive network I describe here cam e into being through transnational channels, the black health agenda is now a \"cottage industry\" in Brazil owing to a critical mass of activists, researchers and policymakers who are invested in it. The domestication of the Brazilian black health age nda rests on the alignment of racial categorization and various medico-racial discourses between government officials, scientists, and activists. As Steven Epstein descri bes in the case of U.S. biomedical research, Brazil has now adopted an \"inclusion-and- difference\" biopolitical paradigm wherein citizens are able to access certain public goods by being identified as, and by identifying as, a racial minority (Epstein 2007: passim ). These include both educational goods, such as admission to higher educational inst itutions under a quota system, and health goods, such as being screened for certain di seases considered more prevalent in blacks. Black Health Activism in Brazil Feminist segments of the black movement have occup ied a vanguard role in promoting black health interests in Brazil from the 1980s up to the present (Fry 2005). During the 1980s, activists from the black women's movement began to raise awareness about reproductive health issues that they perceive d as affecting black women in a distinct way. They asserted that black women suffer ed disproportionately from maternal mortality, uterine fibroids, sexual and domestic vi olence, complications arising from 93 septic abortions, and sexually transmitted diseases . They also claimed that black women were subjected to hysterectomies and invasive steri lization procedures more often than white women, and attributed this fact to racial dis crimination in public health services (Pinto & Souzas 2002, Oliveira 2004). 29 This early mobilization by black women activists occurred mainly in S\u00e3o Paulo. As a result , S\u00e3o Paulo was the first Brazilian city to mandate the collection of epidemiological data b y race in 1990. However, until recently these data were collected sporadically and only in the form of birth and death statistics. Black health activists first pressured the state t o address racial health disparities on a national level at the 1986 National Health Conf erence. National Health Conferences bring together citizens and state health care provi ders and administrators every three years for participatory planning. The final report from the 1986 Conference recommended increased public funding for the study of illnesses believed to affect certain \"racial-ethnic groups\" in a disproportionate manner (Oliveira 2002). Despite activists' efforts, however, there were no significant nationa l policy developments concerning black Brazilians' health until 1995, when President Fernando Henrique Cardoso convened an Interministerial Working Group (GTI) fo r the Valorization of the Black Population. Although the GTI's Subgroup on Health c oncluded that specific health programs for blacks were unnecessary, its participa nts endorsed the creation of a special 29 At that time, their sterilization claims were base d on anecdotal evidence due to the lack of epidemiological data by race in Brazil. More recent studies, however, indicate either that white, blac k, and brown women obtain sterilization in equal measures (Berqu\u00f3 1999) or that black women actually encounte r more obstacles than white women in obtaining steril ization via the public health system (Vieira 2004). These data, however, are based on patients who spec ifically requested surgical sterilization. Black wo men activists often assert that black women receive mor e hysterectomies for uterine fibroids or endometrio sis, while white women are offered less radical treatmen t options. Epidemiological data at this level of specificity do not currently exist. 94 program for sickle cell anemia. The 1996 founding o f the Sickle cell Anemia Program (PAF) marked the first time the Ministry of Health had instituted a program targeting an illness associated with the black population (Olive ira 2004, Fry 2005). Another significant contribution by the Subgroup o n Health was a report listing illnesses that were more prevalent in the black pop ulation. The report conceptualizes the illnesses in two main ways: first are \"genetically determined\" illnesses with a \"hereditary, ancestral, and ethnic point of origin\" (sickle cell anemia, hypertension, diabetes, and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency ); and second are illnesses arising from adverse socioeconomic conditions (e.g., malnut rition, substance abuse, AIDS and other STDs, septic abortions, work-related illnesse s, and mental health problems). The report attributes hypertension and diabetes, heart disease, renal failure, cancer, and uterine fibroids both to \"genetic determinants\" and to adverse socioeconomic conditions. The report also states that even normal life proces ses such as growth, pregnancy, giving birth, and aging can become pathological processes within the black population due to \"unfavorable socioeconomic and educational conditio ns.\" While the report acknowledges that these illnesses (with the notable exclusion of sickle cell anemia) also occur in other \"racial/eth nic groups,\" it stresses that they affect the \"black population\" in a more aggressive fashion due to \"economic, social and cultural deficiencies ( car\u00eancias ).\"30 A similar statement in the report attributes black s' higher rates of hypertension both to genetic makeup (inclu ding increased sensitivity to sodium) and to their supposedly higher salt intake, which i s explained as a function of their different palate ( paladar ) as compared to whites. Such statements are tantam ount to 30 Ibid. 95 blaming not only socioeconomic conditions, but also cultural differences for the exacerbation of certain health problems among black Brazilians. The blanket characterization of certain illnesses as genetically determined among the \"black population\" has the unintended effect of naturalizing race as a biological fact rather than a social construction. I will discuss t his point in more detail in the following chapter. The point I want to make here is that the authors of the report mix genetic and environmental models to explain higher rates of dis ease among black Brazilians. According to Krieger & Basset (1993), the genetic m odel affirms the existence of inherent biological weaknesses in socially defined \"racial\" groups, while the environmental model blames material deprivation as well as certain health-related behaviors for the higher incidence of disease among certain groups in society. Neither model takes into account the social dynamics that create oppression along \"racial\" lin es in the first place. Although the Round Table report does not recommend the creation of specific government programs for \"black\" health issues, it d oes encourage the portrayal of the \"black population\" as a discrete racial group with specific health needs. The report recommends that health professionals take continuin g education courses on the black population's \"specific ethnic conditioning factors and socioeconomic-cultural aggravating factors.\" It also incites the \"problems\" (sua problem\u00e1tica ) and \"take preventive measures and seek medical ca re in time, demanding their rights from public health authoriti es.\" 31 This portion of the report 31 Ibid. 96 identifies the \"black population\" as a special-need s group in relation to health care while calling on its members to become an active, organiz ed community. 32 Despite its avowed reluctance to implement black h ealth programs, the GTI Round Table played a significant role in legitimati ng the construction of the \"black population\" as a discrete population group with cle ar-cut associated health risks. The GTI health report projects a series of strategies that Fry (2004) calls \"intense proselytism for the specificity of the black population's health in Brazil\" (125). These strategies include research initiatives, publications about black heal th issues \"in popular language\" for distribution in black communities, and the implemen tation of PAF throughout the national territory. 33 The GTI Subgroup on Health also recommends the inc lusion of a race/color item on public health documents. This me asure was implemented nationally in 1996, although, as I discussed in the last chapter, health care providers often fail to comply with it. Black health advocates (i.e., activ ists, researchers, policymakers, and health professionals who promote the black health a genda) claim that statistics from these records continue to underestimate the number of bir ths and deaths within the \"black population\" by as much as fifty percent (UNDP & PAHO 2001:9). In spite of problems with implementation, however, the GTI's recommendat ions and actions in the area of black health were significant forerunners to propos als for the National Policy for the Health of the Black Population. Finally, the Subgroup on Health recommended the in clusion of a race/color item on patient information documents. In 2001, activist s and policymakers adopted the ideas 32 Fry (2005:358) discusses the creation of the rheto rical figure of the \"responsible black community\" i n his analysis of PAF. 33 Ibid. 97 set forth in the Subgroup's report as the basis for the incipient National Health Policy for the Black Population (UNDP & PAHO 2001). The final v ersion of the Policy would retain some, but not all of the target illnesses; s ignificantly, it would also make no explicit etiological claims about biological versus social causation. The formation of the GTI occurred within a larger political context of deepening human rights discourse in Brazil, signaled most cle arly by the 1996 launch of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's National Human Rights Pr ogram (Fry 2005). The National Human Rights Program committee set the stage for af firmative action policies in Brazil when it recommended measures to increase equal oppo rtunity for blacks, especially within higher education and public-sector employmen t (Htun 2004). The Program committee also recommended that IBGE, the Brazilian Census bureau, alter the race categories on the national Census by combining preto and pardo into a new term, negro . Although IBGE declined to change the categories on the Census itself, it began to present some data in terms of \"black\" and \"white,\" where \"b lack\" ( negro ) represented the sum of pretos and pardos. These shifts within Brazil were powerfully influen ced by trends abroad. The 2001 Third World Conference against Racism, Racial Discr imination, Xenophobia, and Related Forms of Intolerance in Durban, South Afric a was crucial to the implementation of affirmative action in Brazil; in fact, by the en d of the Conference, the Brazilian state had instituted the first race-based quotas in feder al employment. The Durban Conference's Plan of Action also incited national g overnments to create public health strategies for communities of African origin as a k ey component of affirmative action. 98 Shortly after the Durban Conference, Brazil began to craft partnerships with the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and the British Department for International Development (DFID) to help guide the creation of a national policy directed toward t he health needs of black Brazilians. These international organizations provided both fin ancial and ideological support to cohorts of black movement activists and state healt hcare policymakers through workshops, conferences, and seminars. In 2004, the Brazilian Ministry of Health, along w ith the country's Special Secretariat for the Promotion of Racial Equality (S EPPIR) and PAHO, signed a declaration expressing their intent to develop \"sa\u00fa de da popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra\" (SPN), or the black population's health, as a special area within the Brazilian public health system (SUS). At that time, the Ministry of Health appoint ed a task force of black movement activists, researchers, and health professionals to formulate the National Health Policy for the Black Population. 34 For simplicity, I will refer to the Policy through out the remainder of this chapter as \"the SPN Policy.\" \"SPN\" stands fo r \"sa\u00fade da popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra\" (the black population's health) and often appears in wri ting by black health activists. The declaration marks a critical transition in the Brazilian state's discourse on the relationship between race, racism, and health: [We recognize] that the principle of equity within SUS, to be effective, requires consideration of the different degrees of vulnerability to which diverse sectors of Brazilian society are exposed, a nd that the black population (popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra )\u2014representing nearly half of the Brazilian populat ion\u2014 possesses specific demands and problems in relation to health; [we recognize] that the lack of scientific knowledge co ncerning the health of the 34 The official name for the Policy is \"Pol\u00edtica Naci onal de Sa\u00fade Integral da Popula\u00e7\u00e3o Negra\" which ca n be translated roughly as \"Comprehensive National He alth Policy for the Black Population.\" 99 Afro-descendant Brazilian population stems from the misconception that Brazil is a racial democracy....(Ministry of Health 2 004) In this excerpt, for the first time, the Ministry of Health officially recognizes black Brazilians as a vulnerable population that wa rrants separate consideration within health policy. At the same time, it conceptualizes the \"black population\" as single group comprising all \"preto\" and \"pardo\" individuals, whi ch totaled around fifty-one percent of the Brazilian population as of 2008.35 The endorsement of lumped race categories within an official document is noteworthy considering the state's continuing reluctance to include a \"negro\" category on the Census (see Telle s 2004). This discussion began during the late 1980s and early 1990s, when social scienti sts also began to publish data showing that \"negros\" and \"n\u00e3o-negros\" (blacks and non-blac ks) had drastically different socioeconomic indicators and life chances (e.g., Ha senbalg & Silva 1988, Wood & Carvalho 1991). Although the idea of collapsing the categories initially drew little support outside of intellectual and black movement circles, in 1996 the Cardoso administration endorsed it as part of the National Program on Human Rights (Nobles 2000). Nevertheless, IBGE, the Brazilian Census bur eau, opted to retain the categories \"preto\" and \"pardo\" as distinct items of the Census color question. From its very inception, the SPN Policy broke with the status quo of Brazilian health policymaking by virtue of its transnational and citizen-participatory governance. As cited above, the Policy was crafted by a coaliti on of Brazilian and non-Brazilian activists, scientists, and public health officials. The Policy is also unique because it is the only Brazilian health policy that links race and in stitutionalized racial discrimination to 35 Source: www.ibge.gov.br. Last accessed March 1, 201 1. 100 health outcomes. Although a specific health policy exists for indigenous Brazilians, that policy attributes their unfavorable health outcomes to the rough environmental conditions in which they live, rather than to discrimination o r inherent biological tendencies. The SPN Policy was approved by a participatory Natio nal Health Council in 2006, and it became official on May 13, 2009. 36 The Policy opens with discussions of the principles of social control ( controle social ), or citizen participation, and equity. Specifically, it asserts, \"the principle of equalit y...should entail the principle of equity, which is based in the promotion of equality through the recognition of inequalities and strategic action to overcome them.\" 37 The Policy thus establishes equity, or compensator y justice, as a necessary pre-condition for the fulfi llment of equality. After establishing these principles, the Policy as serts the following main directives: 1. Inclusion of the themes \"racism\" and \"the black pop ulation's health\" in medical education for public health professionals; 2. More substantive opportunities for the black moveme nt to participate in policymaking and policy monitoring ( controle social ); 3. State subsidization of scientific research concerni ng black health issues; 4. Official recognition of popular health knowledges a nd practices, including those of Afro-Brazilian religions; 5. Increasing the black population's access to health services; 6. Improving epidemiological data through the systemat ic collection of patients' race/color data; 36 On May 14th, 2009, the Policy was published in the Di\u00e1rio Oficial da Uni\u00e3o , the Brazilian official press that serves to publicize new laws and normative ord ers, among other official appointments and communications. The Policy was published not as a l aw, but as a portaria . A portaria carries the force of a law in some cases, but is issued by a Minister of S tate (in this case, the Health Minister) rather tha n decreed by the President or legislated by Congress. 37 Di\u00e1rio Oficial da Uni\u00e3o , 90, 14 May 2009, p. 31. 101 7. Creation of health education materials geared towar d the black population that respect diverse knowledges and values, especially t hose of Afro-Brazilian religions; 8. Establishment of international cooperation with the goal of improving the black population's health; 9. Establishment of partnerships between the governmen t and non-governmental organizations in order to strengthen the implementa tion of black health initiatives within SUS; 10. Earmarking funds within state and municipal health care budgets to implement the Policy.38 The Policy changed significantly over the decade th at passed between its initial drafts and its final version. The most striking cha nge is its target illness list, which in the final version includes the following health problem s: infant and maternal mortality, violent deaths, sickle cell anemia, sexually-transm itted diseases and HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, Hansen's disease (leprosy), cervical cancer, breast cancer, and mental health issues (in that order). In a major departure from e arlier proposals (e.g., UNDP & PAHO 2001, Ministry of Health 2001), the Policy avoids c lassifying these health problems according to genetic versus social etiology. Most surprising is the complete disappearance of h ypertension and diabetes, both of which had been classified in earlier proposals a s having a genetic component. At some point between the April 2007 version of the SPN Poli cy and the final version of May 2009, these diseases were summarily discarded. This may be due in part to the growing doubt in international medical literature regarding the genetic basis for hypertension and diabetes in people of African descent (e.g., Cooper et al. 2005, Green et al. 2003). However, given the existence of Brazilian medical r esearch that indicates higher rates of diabetes and hypertension in \"pretos\" (e.g., Chor & Lima 2005) and \"negros\" (e.g., 38 Di\u00e1rio Oficial da Uni\u00e3o , 90, 14 May 2009, p. 31-32. 102 Batista 2005, Lessa et al. 2006, Santos et al. 2007 , Horta et al. 2008) as compared to whites, it is not clear why these illnesses disappe ared from the Policy. 39 The Black Health Agenda in S\u00e3o Paulo At the time of its passage, many of the Policy's e lements had already been partially in effect since the early 1990s. This was due to the efforts of civil society organizations, especially in S\u00e3o Paulo. As mentione d above, many of the early black women's health activists were based in S\u00e3o Paulo. T heir chief concern was the apparent imbalance in sterilization rates for black versus w hite women. According to Leonardo, the coordinator of black health initiatives for the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, former Mayor Luiza Erundina de Souza (1989-1992) was largely responsib le for getting black health issues on the city's political agenda. Souza was a member of the socialist Workers' Party, and her cabinet was the first to designate a seat specifica lly for a representative of black movements in S\u00e3o Paulo. In 1990, with Souza's suppo rt, S\u00e3o Paulo's Municipal Health Department instituted a race/color item on SUS pati ent records. 40 Around this time, several civil society organizati ons in S\u00e3o Paulo were also mobilizing around black health issues. One of the f irst was Geled\u00e9s Black Woman's Institute (Geled\u00e9s Instituto da Mulher Negra), forme d in 1988 by a group of black women activists who felt that black women's health issues were not receiving proper attention from either the feminist movement or the black move ment. From the beginning, Geled\u00e9s activists focused on raising awareness about dispro portionately high rates of sterilization, 39 Follow-up interviews with policymakers who had coll aborated on the SPN Policy yielded no information on the reasons for the disappearance of hypertensio n and diabetes from the Policy. 40 The legislation is: Portaria n\u00ba 696/90, Prefeitura de S\u00e3o Paulo. Available at www.saude.sp.gov.br. La st accessed March 15, 2010. 103 domestic violence, and septic abortions among black women, in addition to diseases such as uterine fibroids, hypertension, and sickle cell anemia, which they identified as prevalent among blacks.41 The activists held seminars on these health issues for community leaders in areas of the city with particu larly high concentrations of blacks, such as the east and south sides of S\u00e3o Paulo. The activists also produced literature for the public on black women's health issues. From Gel ed\u00e9s' founding, its members strived to cultivate partnerships with international organi zations and the United Nations. For instance, Geled\u00e9s activists attended UN conferences where they denounced the alleged eugenics project of the Brazilian state by virtue o f the mass sterilization of black women. 42 In 1997, a faction of Geled\u00e9s members left the org anization and founded their own NGO, Fala Preta, which also focuses on black wom en's health issues. Fala Preta has conducted health education seminars for black women and youth on reproductive health. Additionally, the organization has held conversatio n groups ( rodas de conversa ) where black women congregate and speak about their experi ences of racial discrimination in all areas of public life, including the healthcare syst em. 43 Although Geled\u00e9s and Fala Preta are the two of the most well known NGOs in the sphere of black women's health activism, several ot her civil society organizations have been instrumental in getting black health issues on to the political agenda of S\u00e3o Paulo. One of these, OGBAN, arose from its founder's direct experiences with racism in the public health system. Arlene, a black movement acti vist and former SUS nurse's aide in 41 Interview, S.C., Geled\u00e9s, July 2009 42 Ibid. 43 Interview, E.P, S\u00e3o Paulo Municipal Health Departm ent, 2009. 104 the eastside district of Guaianazes, has very light brown skin and long, wavy black hair that is usually tucked into a bun. She was in her f ifties when I interviewed her and was living in a housing project in Itaim Paulista, a lo w-income neighborhood in the east periphery of S\u00e3o Paulo, with her adult children and grandchildren. At that time, Arlene was commuting to the hospital daily by bus to help care for her husband, who was suffering from advanced alcoholism. She confided th at she had received criticism over the years from fellow black movement activists for being married to a white man. Arlene's activism began in the late 1980s, when sh e was working at a SUS clinic in Guaianazes. She remembers feeling angry at work when she witnessed nurses cuddling white babies while treating black mothers and their children \"as if they were contagious.\" She also noticed that doctors and nurses often comp lained that black people smelled bad, and that black men were drunks. During patient exam s, she observed that doctors and nurses often avoided touching black patients, even when necessary in order to make a proper diagnosis. When Arlene complained to her supervisor Beth abou t racism in the clinic, Beth told her she was imagining things. Beth, an African Brazilian nurse with light brown skin, added that she had never experienced racial p rejudice and doubted it was taking place in the clinic. According to Arlene, Beth did not identify as negra back then; during our interview, Arlene joked that Beth must have con sidered herself Japanese ( japonesa ) since she was married at the time to a Japanese-Bra zilian. As the months went by, Arlene began to speak more and more with Beth about the racial discrimination against black patients. A s a result, Beth gradually began her own entr\u00e9e into black health activism. In 1993, Arlene founded a black health organization 105 called OGBAN. Beth served as its Health Director, a nd other black women's health activists occupied the remaining leadership posts. The group began by providing HIV/AIDS education for samba schools, whose members were mostly African Brazilian. Later, through a partnership with the Municipal Hea lth Department, OGBAN members trained health professionals to collect race/color data from patients. The group also formed partnerships with S\u00e3o Paulo blood centers an d conducted seminars and workshops for sickle cell anemia patients and healt hcare providers. Beth remained Health Director for OGBAN until 1997, when she founded the Sickle Cell Anemia Association of S\u00e3o Paulo State ( AAFESP). According to Beth, she became devoted to the cause after meeting her first young sickle cell anemia patient in the early nineties. AAFESP provides support and hea lth education for sickle cell anemia patients and their families. Several years ago, Bet h designed a patient education booklet that uses cartoons to illustrate the origins of sic kle cell anemia centuries ago in Africa. It also explains in lay terms the genetic basis for si ckle cell anemia, in addition to its symptoms and treatment. The booklet has been adopte d for use all over Brazil and distributed internationally in English and Spanish. Beth remembers that during the 1990s, many black movement activists were concerned that c onducting public health campaigns on sickle cell anemia would lead to increased discr imination against black Brazilians. They drew comparisons with the employment discrimin ation and the generalized stigmatization suffered by sickle cell trait carrie rs in the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s. In the early years of her activism, Beth traveled to Jamaica on a MacArthur Foundation fellowship to study how other countries were diagnosing and treating sickle cell anemia. There, she learned that both Jamaica a nd the United States were using 106 electrophoresis to test newborn infants for the gen etic mutation. When she returned to Brazil, she leveraged this information to convince S\u00e3o Paulo's Municipal Health Department to implement neonatal testing for sickle cell anemia. The electrophoresis technology eventually spread to other cities and st ates before it was implemented at the national level in 2001. Similar to subsequent Brazi lian black health initiatives, sickle cell anemia programs in Brazil were informed from their inception by a transnational network of organizations, actors, technologies, and concept s regarding race and health. As demonstrated by Beth's influence on the craftin g of health policy, citizen participation in policymaking and monitoring is a c entral component of the Brazilian public health system (SUS). As I mentioned in the I ntroduction, this participatory process is called \"social control\" ( controle social ) in reference to the ideal of citizens' agency over public policy. Many of the activists whom I interviewed affirmed t hat the state did not simply \"give\" them black health programs; rathe r, activists forced the implementation of these programs through their demands. In 2003, a coalition of black health activists, hea lth professionals, and health administrators came together in S\u00e3o Paulo for the f irst Municipal Conference on the Black Population's Health (Confer\u00eancia Municipal de Sa\u00fade da Popula\u00e7\u00e3o Negra). In Brazilian Portuguese, this type of \"conference\" is actually a political meeting in which civil society actors pressure the government to ins titute specific changes. The Conference's final report states that its goal was to \"insist that the Municipal Health Department of S\u00e3o Paulo implement public policies f or the black population in order to 107 create equity between diverse ethnicities/races, th us promoting affirmative action...\"44 The activists' insistence eventually paid off. By 2 005, S\u00e3o Paulo's Municipal Health Department had instituted a participatory policymak ing body, called the Commission on the Black Population's Health (Comiss\u00e3o de Sa\u00fade da Popula\u00e7\u00e3o Negra). In 2006, the Department gained a special sector devoted to black health issues. S\u00e3o Paulo's State Health Department created a simi lar division in 2007, known simply as the Technical Group for Strategic Actions (GTAE). The GTAE is responsible for developing health programs for special-needs gr oups, including black and indigenous Brazilians, women, disabled people, laborers, child ren, and the elderly. It also focuses on specific health issues experienced disproportionate ly by some of these groups, such as hypertension, diabetes, and mental and oral health problems. When I was conducting fieldwork in S\u00e3o Paulo in 2008-2009, the GTAE was t raining public health professionals on Afro-Brazilian culture, black health issues, and the importance of providing race/color data on patient records. At that time Leonardo, Bla ck Health Coordinator for the GTAE, was also producing print and television PSAs and le cturing about black health issues on public TV and radio stations. Concrete changes, however, were slower in the maki ng. It was not until 2007 that the Ministry of Health mandated the collection of r ace and color data at all stages of patient care in the SUS\u2014not just for births and dea ths\u2014and even then, compliance with 44 Secretaria Municipal de Sa\u00fade de S\u00e3o Paulo. 2003. I Confer\u00eancia available at: http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/cidade/secretarias/ upload/saude/arquivos/cms/PopulacaoNegra.pdf. Last accessed February 9, 2011. 108 the mandate remained spotty due to a lack of enforc ement. 45 In addition, the Municipal Health Department's black health division was cripp led by limited funding and internal resistance from administrators who thought it was u nnecessary.46 Despite these problems, S\u00e3o Paulo is widely considered the vanguard in publ ic programs and policies around black health issues. The Black Health Agenda in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds When I was in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o in 2007-2008, the contrast with S\u00e3o Paulo could hardly have been more dramatic. Although ther e were some efforts to implement the race/color question, especially within state-le vel HIV/AIDS services, epidemiological data disaggregated by race were sorely lacking. The re were no black health programs in effect at either the municipal or the state level, aside from state-funded civil society initiatives. This situation seemed somewhat strange considering S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds's large black population: in 2000, the sum of pardos and pretos totaled 68% of the population of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, while in S\u00e3o Paulo they constituted a mere 30 % of the city's population. 47 However, municipal and state health administrators whom I interviewed in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds explained that there was little need to implement b lack health policies, given that blacks are not a minority there. They reasoned that target ed policies were only necessary for numerical minorities such as indigenous citizens.48 In addition, Maranh\u00e3o is a much poorer state than S\u00e3o Paulo, which significantly li mits its ability to channel resources into group-specific health initiatives. 45 This data comes from various visits to clinics and interviews with health administrators in S\u00e3o Paulo . 46 Interview with E.P., S\u00e3o Paulo, November 2008. 47 Source: www.ibge.gov.br. Last accessed March 1, 201 1. 48 Interviews with S.V. and C.C., S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, June 2008. 109 Instead, in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds black movement activists were entirely responsible for carrying out community health projects aimed at the black population. The State Health Department of Maranh\u00e3o and the Municipal Health Dep artment of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds both reserved funds for civil society organizations to d eliver health education and, in some cases, preventive services, to populations consider ed \"vulnerable\" ( vulner\u00e1veis ). These groups included black and indigenous Brazilians, LG BT people, sex workers, drug users, and transvestites. At the beginning of each three-y ear budget cycle, the Health Departments invited local civil society organizatio ns to compete against one another for funding. The most active group on black health issues was A KONI, a black women's organization founded in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds in 2004. In 2007-2 008, AKONI was training SUS providers about blacks' specific health needs and p articipating in citizen health councils, as well as engaging periodically in direct action n egotiations with public health officials. Laura, one of the founders, explained the status of NGOs as informal health services contractors in the following way: We know that we are training health professionals, and that this is not our role, but rather the role of the state. So why do w e do it? Because we have long-term experience [with black Brazilians]. And w hat is the political role of AKONI and the black movement....? [We] do the work, and then [we] negotiate with the government to take over and cont inue the training [of health professionals]. 49 At the time of my fieldwork, the Health Department s had no plans to take over the health education services provided by civil society groups. However, Laura explained that sensitivity training ( sensibiliza\u00e7\u00e3o ) to change SUS professionals' perceptions of 49 Interview with L.P., Feb. 21, 2008 . 110 marginalized groups represented the first step towa rd convincing them that these groups required specialized health care. She added that th e National Health Policy for the Black Population had generated significant resistance amo ng SUS administrators and providers who refused to comply with its stipulations. Civil society organizations, therefore, needed to convince them not only to record patients' race/ color data, but also to give specialized care to \"vulnerable\" groups. Additionally, Laura explained that civil society a ctors often play an instrumental role in bringing health professionals into certain communities that may harbor mistrust of the public health system, such as members of Afro-B razilian religions or quilombos (rural maroon communities). Since activists are oft en members of these communities, they can facilitate SUS professionals' entry into t hese spaces. Within SUS, the National STD/AIDS Program has been the vanguard in reaching out to groups deemed \"vulnerable;\" the Program accomplishes this by empl oying cultural insiders as mediators between SUS and reclusive communities. Perhaps for this reason, many of the SUS/civil society black health partnerships that I encountere d involved municipal, state, or national STD/AIDS programs. Like the black health NGOs in S\u00e3o Paulo, AKONI main tained ties with international organizations and with Bras\u00edlia. In a ddition to receiving state and municipal funding, AKONI received support from UNICEF and the Brazilian Ministry of Health. In October 2007, AKONI brought Ana Costa, Coordinator of the Ministry's Black Health Technical Committee, to S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds for a lecture on b lack health issues. The event coincided with the release of AKONI's UNICEF-funded project to help improve health outcomes among black children in quilombos of rural Maranh\u00e3o. 111 Important ideological shifts were also taking plac e in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds at the level of scientific research during the period of my field r esearch. In 2008, the Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o (UFMA) was initiating a new Master's de gree program in Black Women's Health. The Department of Community Health (Sa\u00fade C oletiva) that housed the new program was also spearheading efforts to implement the race/color question throughout HIV/AIDS services in Maranh\u00e3o. By conducting a majo r research study funded by the National STD/AIDS Program, Principal Investigator Je an, a European Brazilian medical researcher at UFMA, hoped to demonstrate that black HIV/AIDS patients had unequal treatment experiences that led to their worse healt h outcomes as compared to non-blacks. Jean collaborated on the study with colleagues from state and municipal STD/AIDS departments in S\u00e3o Paulo. These colleagues traveled to S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds periodically to attend research meetings and to assist with research desig n and implementation. In addition, the study took methodological cues from Harvard's Unive rsity's Enhancing Care Initiative, thereby incorporating transnational influences alth ough data were collected solely in Maranh\u00e3o.50 to HIV/AIDS cli Lu\u00eds, where they asked patients to self-identify their race or color according to Brazilian Census categories (i.e., white or branca, brown or parda , black or preta data collection, Jean's research assis tants tallied results by dividing participants into two categorie s: negro and n\u00e3o-negro , or black and 50 The ECI aims to improve care for AIDS patients in r esource-poor nations, including Brazil (http://www.eci.harvard.edu). 112 non-black; the \"negro\" category included those who had identified as either \"preta\" or \"parda\" when asked by interviewers. According to the research team's final report, the study concluded that, although \"black\" patients reported worse socioeconomic statu s and overall living conditions than \"non-black\" ones, their data \"did not indicate sign ificant differences in their experiences...as people living with AIDS.\" 51 In fact, Jean's team found that twice as many \"non-blacks\" as \"blacks\" reported feeling disc riminated against by public health care providers. Furthermore, Jean's final report qu estions the validity of combining \"preto\" and \"pardo\" into a \"negro\" category, for tw o reasons: first, respondents who self- identify as \"pardo\" (or another intermediate term, such as \"moreno\") might not identify with the term \"negro,\" in which case researchers ar e imposing an inaccurate category; and second, \"pardo\" and other intermediate terms ca n imply a mixture of indigenous and white ancestry, rather than African ancestry with e ither or both of these. The report thus questions two principal tenets of the black health agenda, namely, the imperative of the combined \"negra\" category, and the idea that black (or brown) patients necessarily receive worse health care. Of course, it is possibl e that the black and brown patients interviewed by Jean's team either misrecognized the ir experiences of discrimination, or were too proud to admit to them. In the report, the researchers do not speculate about this possibility. Regardless of its conclusions, Jean's study provid es an example of the networks of expertise formed by advocates of the black healt h agenda. Jean has been heavily involved in minority health policy (minority in ter ms of relative access to social goods, 51 \"Relat\u00f3rio T\u00e9cnico Final de Pesquisa Financiada pel a PN DST/AIDS.\" 2008. 113 not population percentages) since his days as a pos tdoctoral researcher in S\u00e3o Paulo (2002-2003). There, he worked for the state of Paulo's Centro de Refer\u00eancia e Treinamento (CRT), an HIV/AIDS prevention and treat ment center. Based on his reading of U.S. literature concerning health disparities be tween racialized groups, Jean helped the CRT to collect self-declared race data from all of its patients (previously, staff members had recorded patients' race based on their own impr essions). Jean informed me that the CRT was the first institution in S\u00e3o Paulo, and pos sibly Brazil, to collect systematic race data from patients. According to Jean, self-classif ication is particularly important in Brazil because Brazilians rely heavily on social cu es, such as how a person is dressed, to determine racial identity; for example, he added, a doctor might classify a shabbily dressed patient as \"preto\" (black) whereas the pati ent might self-identify as \"pardo\" (brown). After concluding his postdoctoral fellowship at th e CRT, Jean moved to Maranh\u00e3o. There, he continued to collaborate with c olleagues in S\u00e3o Paulo, frequently bringing them to S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds for joint research projec ts and lectures at the Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o. He also worked closely with local black health advocates, such as Dr. Lucas and Gl\u00f3ria, whom I mentioned in Chapte r 2. Dr. Lucas was raised by his indigenous mother and black father on a former quil ombo in rural Maranh\u00e3o. His interest in black health issues stems from growing up among communities of African Brazilians, who lived in abject poverty in areas where there wa s often no potable water. After moving to S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and studying medicine, Dr. Lucas completed his residence in pathology at the University of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, in S \u00e3o Paulo state. Between his experiences in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and S\u00e3o Paulo, Dr. Lucas be came increasingly aware of the large 114 gap in living conditions between black and white Br azilians. When he returned to S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds in the late 1970s, he founded the Centro de Cu ltura Negra (Black Culture Center), the first black movement organization in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds. In 2007-2008, Dr. Lucas was teaching courses on black health issues (especially sickle c ell anemia) at the Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o and traveling frequently to quilombo terri tories throughout the state to provide health care. He also made occasional trips to S\u00e3o P aulo, where he networked with fellow black health advocates and brought back literature on black health issues. One of his mentees was Gl\u00f3ria, whom he provided with state of the art medical textbooks on sickle cell anemia, since she could not find adequate lite rature in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds. Gl\u00f3ria is a tall, thin, dark-skinned woman in her mid-twenties. She has an infectious smile and shining dark eyes. When I met her at the class in Chapadinha, she had just finished her undergraduate thesis in occup ational therapy. Her research topic was treatment for sickle cell anemia in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds. In ad dition to receiving informal mentorship from Dr. Lucas, Gl\u00f3ria was mentored by Leonardo, th e coordinator of the GTAE in S\u00e3o Paulo. Additionally, I saw Gl\u00f3ria on a regular basi s at the home-based terreiro (temple) of M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia, who became my key informant concern ing Afro-Brazilian religion and healing in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds. Gl\u00f3ria's story illustrates, on ce again, the interconnected web of black health activists throughout Brazil in general, and between S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and S\u00e3o Paulo in particular. Due to the personal biographies and soc ial networks of the black health advocacy community in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, S\u00e3o Paulo was the m ain point of reference within Brazil for them regarding black health politics. Like most of the black health advocates in S\u00e3o Lu\u00ed s, Gl\u00f3ria had become involved with the black health agenda following her introduc tion to black movement activism. 115 Through her activism, she came to see sickle cell a nemia as a black health issue with social justice implications based on the state's fa ilure, in many cases, to provide adequate diagnosis and patient care. Although Brazil has a w ell-established Sickle cell Anemia Program (Programa de Anemia Falciforme or PAF), its implementation varies widely from state to state. Gl\u00f3ria told me that during her research, she found that Maranh\u00e3o's Program existed on paper, but that it suffered in p ractice from severe resource shortages. This meant that infants were not routinely tested f or sickle cell anemia at birth (one of the PAF's stipulations) and that patients had to fight to access adequate treatment. Furthermore, Gl\u00f3ria was incensed by her finding tha t HEMOMAR, the treatment facility in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds for blood-borne diseases, provided no p atient education on the African origins of sickle cell anemia. For Gl\u00f3ria, as for m any black health activists, a diagnosis of sickle cell anemia, or even of one's status as a ca rrier, logically implied the adoption of a black identity. Gl\u00f3ria told me that her phenotypically white cousi n had recently discovered, at age thirty, that he was a carrier of the genetic mu tation for sickle cell anemia. Although Gl\u00f3ria tried to explain to him that his diagnosis m ade it impossible for him to be white, he resisted adopting a black identity, telling her, \"I love black people, Gl\u00f3ria, but I'm not black, I'm white. Can't you see that my skin is whi te?\" In response, Gl\u00f3ria reminded him that their grandfather was black, and therefore he was, too. In so doing, she invoked an ancestral model of racial identity, similar to the rule of hypodescent utilized in the United States (the \"one drop\" rule). Her cousin, however, upheld the traditional Brazilian mode of phenotype-based racialization by insisting he wa s white. 116 When I asked Gl\u00f3ria why she felt it was important for sickle cell anemia patients to identify as black, she replied, \"To take care of themselves, I think they have to become aware [of their racial identity] ( se conscientizar )...when someone finds out they have this disease that originated in Africa... they begin to think, 'then who am I?'\" Gl\u00f3ria's response indicates that for her, a diagnosis of sic kle cell anemia provides fundamental information about one's ancestry and racial identit y that is related to self-care. For Gl\u00f3ria, as for other black health activists, diagnosis has the potential to become a \"technology of the self\" (Foucault 1988). According to Michel Foucault, technologies of the self are discourses and practices that \"permit individuals to effect...a ce rtain number of operations on their own bodies and souls, thoughts, conduct, and way of bei ng, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, purit y, wisdom, perfection, or immortality\" (ibid: 18). Whereas Foucault was preoccupied with t echnologies of state and institutional domination during the earlier part of his career, h e later began to focus increasingly on \"the technologies of individual domination...how an individual acts upon himself, in the technology of the self\" (ibid: 19). As Burchell (19 96) notes, government for Foucault was the point at which techniques of domination and tec hniques of the self came together (20). He emphasizes that the relationship between t he two is not unidirectional or one- dimensional; rather, techniques of domination may b e \"presupposed by, or are conditions for the possible existence of\" techniques of the se lf (ibid: 21). In the Brazilian black health agenda, there is a constant feedback loop be tween the National Health Policy for the Black Population and its associated programs, o n the one hand, and the re-crafting of 117 racial identity that individuals undertake in refer ence to a medicalized conception of race, on the other. These two elements of governance are intimately intertwined. In this chapter, I have examined the sociopolitica l conditions that set the stage for the birth of black health agenda in Brazil. Althoug h much of my analysis refers to collectivities such as \"black health activists\" and \"health professionals,\" it is important to remember that these groups comprise individuals who engage with the black health agenda in their own personal ways. Drawing on the i deological material embedded in the black health agenda, they construct particular iden tity discourses and practices. These techniques of the self enable individuals to re-def ine themselves in accordance with new norms of governance, which in turn present new poss ibilities for subject making. 118 Chapter 4: The Black Health Epistemic Community in Brazil In this chapter, I examine how the Brazilian black health agenda is produced discursively by an epistemic community of activists , government officials, scientific researchers and intellectuals in Brazil and beyond. I use the term \"epistemic community\" in the sense that Haas (1992) has defined it, as a group of individuals with \"recognized expertise and competence in a particular domain and an authoritative claim to policy- relevant knowledge within that domain or issue-area \" (3). These individuals produce a range of discourses that constitute the Brazilian b lack health agenda in particular ways. 52 Each member of the epistemic community is responsib le, to varying degrees, for the circulation and naturalization of specific knowledg e and truth claims about the relationship between blackness and health in Brazil . I argue that black health activists in particular utilize these claims to formulate not on ly a biologically based politics of difference, but also a new kind of biopolitical cit izenship in Brazil. In response to political influences from abroad, as well as activi sts' citizenship claims at home, the Brazilian state has institutionalized a biopolitica l paradigm that affirms race as a primary determinant of health inequalities in Brazil. 53 It is important to note that the discourses of the black health epistemic community in Brazil do not go unchallenged. In fact, they are vociferously debated by a group of scientists and researchers who argue that the black health agenda racializes medicine and promotes unncessary racial division (e.g., Fry 2004 , Laguardia 2005, Maio & Monteiro 52 Briggs and Hallin (2007) describe \"biocommunicabili ty\" as the process through which health discourses and practices are communicated to citizens in ways that confer authority and power to certain kinds of information while obscuring or disqualifying others . 53 Epstein (2007) defines biopolitical paradigms as \" frameworks of ideas, standards, formal procedures, and unarticulated understandings that specify how c oncerns about health, medicine, and the body are ma de the simultaneous focus of biomedicine and state pol icy\" (16). 119 2005, Pena 2005, Maggie 2007). Government officials also challenge the black health agenda in both direct and indirect ways. In 2008, b lack health activists were outraged by the mysterious disappearance from the federal budge t of funds earmarked for black health programs. 54 In 2010, the Brazilian Senate approved the Racial Equality Statute (Estatuto da Igualdade Racial) but eliminated provisions for black health programs based on a lack of conclusive genetic evidence for diseases conside red more prevalent in blacks. 55 Dem\u00f3stenes Torres, the senator who demanded the rem oval of the health provisions, explained his position in the following way: \"I'm n ot going to contribute to racial divides. There are [also] poor whites, Indians, and browns [ pardos ].\" 56 Like the researchers and intellectuals cited above, Torres i nterpreted health disparities as a consequence of poverty rather than of race per se . Meanwhile, black health activists attribute blacks' worse health outcomes to a variet y of factors, including an unequal distribution of wealth between blacks and whites, r acial discrimination in medical settings, and blacks' biological predisposition to certain diseases. The data I present in this chapter are based on nar rative analysis of interviews with, and texts produced by, members of the black h ealth epistemic community in Brazil. My objective is not to evaluate whether my informan ts' discourses accurately describe the reality of racial health disparities in Brazil. That is exceedingly difficult to do, given that epidemiological data by race in Brazil are sti ll relatively scarce and ethical research standards impede the observation of medical encount ers between patients and health 54 \"27 de Outubro-Dia Nacional de Mobiliza\u00e7\u00e3o Pr\u00f3-Sa\u00fad Electronic document, available at: Last 9, 2011. 55 Estatuto da Igualdade Racial, ma s retiram cotas.\" Electronic document, available at: http://correiobraziliense.com.br. Last accessed June 18, 2010. 56 Ibid. 120 professionals. Rather, I am interested in how disco urses on healthcare inequalities and unequal treatment become naturalized and institutio nalized, especially in the midst of considerable ambiguity surrounding the causes and l ived reality of health disparities in Brazil. 57 Here, I examine the discourses of key figures in S \u00e3o Lu\u00eds and S\u00e3o Paulo who create and disseminate the black health agenda, bot h locally and nationally. Although I separate them analytically into the categories of a ctivist, government official, scientist, and intellectual, many of my informants occupy more than one of these categories simultaneously. For example, several of the activis ts with whom I worked also held public health posts. Over the course of our interac tions, it became clear that many activist-officials felt uneasy about occupying both roles simultaneously. Their activist colleagues often intimated that they were \"sell-out s\" who had been co-opted by the government. Some also expressed frustration with th e bureaucratic limits imposed on their work by the realm of public service. Neverthel ess, the activist-officials often conceded that their posts afforded them greater inf luence on health policy outcomes. As my informants often articulated during interviews a nd political meetings, the increasing entry of activists into public service reflects a c hanging relationship between the state and civil society since the 1990s. Whereas in the past activists' role was primarily one of opposition and protest vis-\u00e0-vis the government, ci vil society and the state increasingly fuse and form \"partnerships\" ( parcerias ). 57 See Rouse (2009) for an incisive analysis of how he alth care providers and patients manage the uncertainty surrounding racial health care disparit ies in the United States. 121 Most of the health researchers and health administ rators whom I interviewed were white, middle-class Brazilians with advanced academ ic degrees. The activists whom I interviewed were middle or lower middle-class Brazi lians who identified as negro or negra . Nearly all had begun their activism within black m ovement organizations (movimentos negros ) that focused on eradicating racism in many areas of society, and subsequently moved into black health activism. Many activists held advanced academic degrees, and several were employed in the medical f ield as doctors, nurses, nurses' assistants, laboratory technicians, or clinical soc ial workers. As such, the activists constituted an elite group in comparison to the mas ses of low-income black Brazilians they purported to represent. Burdick (1998b) argues that the socioeconomic chasm between elite black Brazilian activists and their n on-activist constituents produces an enormous ideological gap and limits non-activist bl ack Brazilians' support for black movement initiatives. This ideological gap is also responsible in large part for the circumscription of the black health agenda to the e pistemic community I discuss here. As an elite group, black health activists have acc ess to national and transnational channels of communication and information via inter net technology and their attendance at conferences on racial health disparities. In gen eral, the activists I worked with in S\u00e3o Paulo had greater access to financial resources tha n the activists in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds. These resources, which they obtained from Brazilian gover nment agencies and from international NGOs and foundations, afforded them th e mobility to be in more frequent contact with colleagues in distant locations. Easy access to national and transnational activism networks meant that activists in both citi es were constantly exposed to globally- produced discourses on race and health. They, in tu rn, disseminated these discourses 122 locally through internet blogs and sites, print med ia, and presentations at meetings and conferences. Many of their discourses on health out comes in the black population resemble those produced in countries such as Britai n and the United States. Meanwhile, most non-activist Brazilians are unfamiliar with su ch concepts as \"racial health disparities\" and \"health equity.\" The activists, officials, health professionals an d researchers who co-create the Brazilian black health agenda are a diverse group w ith varying discourses, but they share a few key beliefs. First, they tend to define \"blac k\" as negro , a category created through the collapsing of the Census \"brown\" ( pardo ) and the black health epistemic community also claim tha t black Brazilians need culturally sensitive health care. To this end, they recommend that the state provide health professionals with training on aspects of Afro-Braz ilian culture, particularly Afro- Brazilian religion. Furthermore, they accept the id ea that negros suffer disproportionately from a number of health problems including sickle c ell anemia, hypertension, diabetes, maternal and infant mortality, substance abuse, and others. My informants differed, however, in their accounts of what causes these hea lth disparities. In the following section, I draw on my ethnographic research to anal yze in detail the major discursive themes that constitute the black health agenda. The se include the politics of categorization, the imperative of self-declaration, etiological claims, medicalizing racism, and discourses of difference. The Politics of Categorization Categorization is the sine qua non of contemporary debates about race and health, and it suffuses discussions of racial/ethnic identi ty and disease etiology in Brazil. As 123 Bowker & Star (1999) have noted, systems of racial and ethnic classification embed \"ethical choices\" with significant political and so cial implications, in part because \"each standard and each category valorizes some point of view and silences another\" (5). For this reason, it is important to examine the choices underlying schemas of racial categorization, and to consider the alternatives th at were either discarded or not chosen\u2014 and their consequences. In his analysis of health d isparities research in the United States, Epstein (2007) argues that the static race categori es used by biomedical researchers obscure the \"complex sociopolitical processes\" that shape individuals' racial identities (228). Similarly, Brazilian scholars contend that r ace is a particularly problematic variable for health research and policymaking in Br azil due to the multiple ways in which Brazilians construct racial identity (e.g., Pena 20 05, Laguardia 2005, Monteiro 2004, Grin 2004). Since the topic of black health first began to cir culate within Brazil in the 1980s, activists have defined the black population as the aggregate of Census-identified pretos and pardos. They have done so based on their convic tion that pretos and pardos experience similar social and biological tendencies that produce poorer health outcomes. Defining the black population in this way increases the total number of black Brazilians, and represents a marked contrast to the Census bure au's traditional definition of the black population as the total number of pretos. This stat istical tactic serves to bolster activists' claims for special health resources for blacks; aft er all, how can the Brazilian government ignore the needs of over half of the population? According to the 2008 nationwide household census (PNAD), pretos represent 6.8% of the total Brazilian population, pardos %, and brancos, 48.4% (IBGE 2009). 124 When IBGE released these figures in 2009, black hea lth activists took to their blogs and web sites to proclaim that the black population (pr etos + pardos) now constituted the majority of the Brazilian population. 58,59 In comparison to the 2000 Brazilians Census, the 2008 PNAD figures indicate a 5% increase in par dos, a 0.3% increase in pretos, and a 5% decrease in brancos. Although the reasons for th is shift are not clear, one contributing factor could be that increasing numbers of young Br azilians are identifying as brown or black in order to compete for affirmative action qu otas in public universities (e.g., Schwartzman 2007). Activists' bipolar mode of racialization mirrors t he traditional U.S. practice of hypodescent. It defines blackness based on ancestry rather than primarily phenotypic features, as is the case in Brazilian popular racia lization practices. In other words, this model encourages even light-skinned individuals to identify as \"negro\" based not only on their skin color and facial features, but also on t he presence of African Brazilians in their family trees. Although black movement activists wer e the ones who propagated this model initially, many public health professionals a nd biomedical researchers adopted it following the Ministry of Health's endorsement of i t in 2004 (see previous chapter). Of course, the process of adopting a new racial i deology is not seamless. New activists undergo a process of attitudinal change ( conscientiza\u00e7\u00e3o ), in which they make contact with black movements and learn to conceptua lize race in new ways. Many of my activist informants described their own experiences of learning to identify as negro or negra and beginning to recognize racism in various socia l contexts, including medical 58 One example is black women's health organization Ge led\u00e9s' web site: http://www.geledes.org.br/noticias/pnad-conclui-que -maioria-da-populacao-brasileira-e-de-negros-2.html . Last accessed June 22, 2010. 59 Source: www.ibge.gov.br. Last accessed June 16, 20 10. 125 encounters. Several of them told me that racism had not been a salient issue in their lives prior to their entr\u00e9e into activism, which often oc curred when they entered university and met black student activists. Activists who have adopted new ways of perceiving race and racism, in turn, disseminate these ideas through engagement with var ious publics. S\u00f4nia, for instance, is a sociologist and black health activist at Geled\u00e9s, o ne of the most prominent black women's health NGOs in S\u00e3o Paulo. In 2007, Geled\u00e9s b egan to partner with Conectas, a local human rights organization, to teach low-incom e women about black women's health concerns and how to report discriminatory tr eatment in public clinics. S\u00f4nia said the women only realized they had been the victims o f racial discrimination after their activist instructors encouraged them to reinterpret their experiences with doctors and nurses through the lens of race. Mariela, a light-skinned black health activist and public health administrator in S\u00e3o Paulo, related a similar story. When S\u00e3o Paulo' s municipal and state health departments first began to require the collection o f patients' self-declared race data in public clinics and hospitals, Mariela led state-spo nsored workshops on racial discrimination and cultural sensitivity for public health employees. 60 She recalled that employees in the workshops were unaware of the role of racial dynamics in their daily interactions. As a result, Mariela had to teach the m to \"see race.\" Concomitant with these shifts in race ideology, bl ack health activists develop fluency in biomedical language and concepts as well as in the language of citizenship and 60 The term in Portuguese for these sessions is \"ofic ina de sensibiliza\u00e7\u00e3o,\" (literally, \"sensitization workshop\"). 126 rights. During my fieldwork, I attended several wor kshops given by SUS administrators to groups of black health activists. The content of these workshops was remarkably consistent; they usually reviewed the 1988 Constitu tional articles affirming health as a universal citizen's right; described the bureaucrat ic layout of SUS; and explained the procedures for filing formal complaints about publi c health services. The workshops used the language of active citizenship and encouraged p articipants to \"fazer valer seus direitos,\" or to make sure their rights were upheld , by participating in planning meetings and serving on public clinics' governing councils ( conselhos gestores ). In addition to attending SUS-sponsored workshops, activists also read scientific articles about black health issues. Gaining knowled ge in these areas equips them to communicate with government officials, health care providers, and biomedical researchers as they make claims for improved treatm ent and research for diseases that affect blacks disproportionately. In the process, m any activists acquire (or at least find the language to articulate) genetic understandings of r ace that are based on ancestry rather than phenotype alone. Beth, President of the S\u00e3o Paulo Sickle cell Anemi a Association, described to me how black health activists from the Association tea ch non-activists about race and genetic risk for disease via community outreach activities. For instance, the Association provides health education classes to newly diagnosed sickle cell patients and their families. Beth explained that about 10% of these patients initiall y identify as white, but they usually adopt a genetic model of racial identity after atte nding the Association's classes: If you have light skin, and all of a sudden you are diagnosed with a black disease, you gain a new identity... [our patients] begin to look at their families and notice they're not so white. And sickl e cell anemia demonstrates 127 that...On the last day [of class] we ask people to identify their own color. Nobody can call themselves white anymore\u2014they all en d up [identifying] as pardos! [laughs] It is striking that Beth refers here to sickle cel l anemia as a \"black disease,\" since earlier in our interview she had stated unequivocal ly that it affected people of all colors. Specifically, she had explained that her own patien t manual was titled, \"Sickle cell Anemia: Our Problem\" ( Anemia Falciforme: Um Problema Nosso) because sickle cell anemia was not exclusively a black disease (emphasi s mine). How does one account for this discursive ambiguity? A bit of probing reveale d that Beth was aware of the discrepancy between the Association's racial politi cs and the diverse geographic origins of sickle cell disease (which are not exclusively A frican). Beth admitted that she purposely emphasizes the African roots of sickle ce ll anemia to patients in order to promote antiracism: \"...socially people are perceiv ed [as white], but we want them to understand the wider context [of ancestry]. Within this wider context, it is impossible to be racist.\" Beth assumed that if phenotypically white Brazilia ns believe they have a common heritage with phenotypically black Brazilians, they will be less likely to discriminate against them. This assumption, however, is a slippe ry slope. The characterization of sickle cell anemia as a \"black disease\" could end u p perpetuating the misconception that only phenotypically black Brazilians need to be tes ted for the genetic mutation. Although Brazil's Sickle cell Anemia Program mandates screen ing in all Brazilian-born infants, my informants reported that this goal is far from bein g realized. In fact, during my research I heard many stories of (and met several) phenotypica lly white Brazilians who had only discovered they carried the trait in their twenties or thirties. 128 Although the statistical correlation between sickl e cell anemia prevalence and African ancestry is rarely challenged in the United States, it is more tenuous in Brazil due to blurry racial distinctions. Regarding this point , Fry (2005) observes that \"even though it is recognized that the illness is disseminated t o the four corners of the country through miscegenation, sickle cell anemia is associated inc reasingly with the 'black population'\" (358). As I stated above, members of the black heal th epistemic community operationalize the \"black population\" as over fifty percent of the Brazilian population, which represents the sum of \"pardos\" and \"pretos\" c ounted by IBGE. But when activists conflate genetic markers for sickle cell disease wi th African ancestry, this number would seem insufficient. To put it crudely, how much Afri can ancestry must one have in order to be considered at risk for inheriting the sickle cell trait? Based on genetic samples collected across Brazil a nd analyzed for markers of geographic origin, Pena and Bortolini (2004) estima te that eighty-seven percent of Brazilians possess more than ten percent African an cestry. They calculate that approximately half of this eighty-seven percent sel f-identified as \"white\" on the 2000 Brazilian Census. The authors thus conclude that ge netically-based \"racial\" distinctions are problematic for identifying policy beneficiarie s because, in addition to the fact that race does not exist from a genetic standpoint, phen otype is an unreliable indicator of geographical ancestry in Brazil. In their study of perceived versus genomic ancestry among residents of Rio de Janeiro, Santos et al. (2 009) also found a significant mismatch between research subjects' classification of their own and each other's ancestry, on the one hand, and their actual genetic markers for Euro pean, African, and Amerindian ancestry, on the other. 129 During my fieldwork, it became clear that black he alth activists were well aware that their political discourses sometimes contradic ted existing scientific data. Andr\u00e9, a longtime black health and labor activist in S\u00e3o Pau lo, conceded that activists' discursive association of sickle cell disease with African anc estry is a deliberate political tactic. Without any probing, he characterized this tactic a s \"subterfuge\" ( um subterf\u00fagio ). Here is an excerpt from our interview: Anna : Why was it subterfuge? Andr\u00e9 : Because there is sickle cell anemia in North Afric a, but also...I think it's also in the Mediterranean. There's a part of E urope that has it too, and a part of Asia too, the Syrians, look how many Syrian s have sickle cell anemia. 61 And not all Syrians are black, actually Syrians ar en't black. Anna : Yes. In Iran, [sickle cell anemia] is endemic too . 62 Andr\u00e9 : Right. It's endemic, so it's not an issue. So it' s subterfuge. A subterfuge that worked....Because we didn't have a [specific] disease. We had no way to complain about a [specific] disease, so we used sickle cell anemia. Anna : Why didn't you have any way to complain about a d isease? Andr\u00e9 : Because here in my country, mental illness is som ething a drunk has, it's a black thing....You couldn't say that you had [a mental illness]... So we said that [sickle cell anemia] is a black problem. That was it. It's subterfuge that enabled us to discuss all the social diseases we have. Anna : Beginning with sickle cell anemia. Andr\u00e9 : Yes. From there, I can speak about uterine fibroi ds [in black women], about mental health, from there I can speak about t he kind of working conditions I have. 61 There is a substantial population of Syrian-descend ed Brazilians in S\u00e3o Paulo (called s\u00edrios ), where this interview took place. 62 This comment might seem idiosyncratic. I have follo wed sickle cell epidemiology in Iran due to my own ethnic background. 130 In this excerpt, Andr\u00e9 described the strategic dis cursive process through which sickle cell anemia became the most visible black he alth issue in Brazil. As Beth and Andr\u00e9's comments show, even though activists know s ickle cell anemia is also endemic to geographic areas outside of Africa, they purpose ly emphasize the association between sickle cell anemia, Africa, and blackness. They do so in order to support their argument that blacks have fundamentally different health nee ds, despite their awareness that this argument might not be scientifically or medically j ustifiable. Their approach is strategic because scientific discourses carry a unique legiti macy; they have the aura of \"hard\" facts that allegations of diffuse structural racism tend to lack. Moreover, activists know that sickle cell anemia is considered a \"black\" disease in the United States, and that the Brazilian state has a vested interest in maintainin g its international reputation as a protector of human rights and promoter of racial eq uity. Therefore, it behooves the state to implement policies that demonstrate its dedicati on to the diverse needs of its multiethnic population. Andr\u00e9's revelation recalls Fry's argument (2005) t hat Brazilian black health activists have leveraged sickle cell anemia as a po litical tool in their efforts to transform Brazil into a \"black-white\" society based on the su pposed genetic difference of African Brazilians. Fry views this tactic as an extension o f the Brazilian black movement's efforts to convince Brazilians who identify as \"pardo\" to a ssume a black identity. He does not clarify, however, why black movement activists migh t want to portray African Brazilians as incommensurably different from European Brazilia ns in the first place. In 2007, a leading Brazilian public health journal ( Cadernos de Sa\u00fade ) featured a debate over whether it makes sense to categorize th e black population as a vulnerable 131 group in relation to HIV/AIDS, as the National STD/A IDS Program and the Ministry of Health have done since 2005. In that issue, Fry and colleagues from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ) argue that black health activi sts and the Ministry of Health are racializing AIDS and homogenizing epidemiological d ata in order to serve a political purpose, namely, the ideological construction of Br azil as a racially bipolarized society where blacks and whites have distinct physical char acteristics and health needs. The authors point out that epidemiological data from Br azil's National AIDS Program show a steady increase in AIDS cases among \"pardos\" since 2000, but relatively stable rates among \"pretos.\" The authors thus critique the use o f the category \"black population\" (popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra ) on the grounds that it masks the differences betw een the epidemiological profiles of pretos versus pardos. In response to Fry et al.'s arguments, Paix\u00e3o & Lo pes (2007) assert that pretos and pardos should occupy a single category since th eir epidemiological profiles resemble one another more than either resembles that of whit es. They arrive at this conclusion by comparing the ratio of new AIDS cases in 2005 betwe en pretos and pardos and between negros (pretos + pardos) and brancos; the first rat io is considerably smaller than the second. Paix\u00e3o & Lopes also cite AIDS mortality sta tistics to argue that pretos' rates of AIDS deaths are much higher than the percentage of pretos in the total Brazilian population, while pardos' and brancos' shares of AI DS deaths are markedly lower than their representation in the total population. The journal issue also includes debate papers by s everal other researchers (Chor 2007, Guimar\u00e3es 2007, Barata 2007, Camargo 2007, Tr avassos 2007), who echo Fry et al.'s concern that classifying AIDS as a black heal th issue is not only scientifically 132 unsound, but also racializes the epidemic in a dang erous way by identifying blacks as a risk group for HIV/AIDS. The common thread uniting the arguments of these other researchers is that the data are too ambiguous to m ake straightforward claims about the black population's vulnerability to AIDS. Travassos illustrates this point when she asks, \"Why highlight race/skin color as the expression of the pauperization of AIDS in the country? Why leave out the multiplicity and complex ity of the social factors involved in the process?\" (2007: 518). Only Paix\u00e3o and Lopes ar gue that AIDS should, in fact, be classified as a black health issue. This debate exemplifies the level of ambiguity tha t surrounds the attribution of diseases to specific racialized groups. It also sho ws the extent to which the same statistical data can be manipulated to serve opposi ng political agendas. Peter Fry and his co-authors are among the most vocal opponents to th e black health agenda, while Marcelo Paix\u00e3o and Fernanda Lopes are staunch suppo rters of it. In fact, Lopes directed the now-defunct national Program Against Institutio nal Racism (Programa de Combate ao Racismo Institucional), a bilateral initiative b etween the British and Brazilian governments that was key to introducing the black h ealth agenda into Brazil (discussed in Chapter 3). Given the interests of the researchers involved in this debate, it is important to examine the discursive and practical effects of epi demiological ambiguity. As other anthropologists have argued (e.g., Rouse 2009, Whit marsh 2008), uncertainty surrounding the causes and expression of health ine qualities among racialized groups can end up weakening attempts to denounce and counterac t those inequalities. Health activists, therefore, strive to reduce epidemiologi cal ambiguity so that their claims appear 133 authoritative and self-evident. The framing process es described by Andr\u00e9 and Beth are examples of ambiguity reduction\u2014both described how black health activists framed sickle cell anemia as a black disease, in spite of the highly ambiguous correlation between racial identity and the distribution of the sickle cell trait throughout the Brazilian population. Another form of ambiguity reduction deployed by Br azilian black health activists is their claim that pardos and pretos constitute a uniform epidemiological population of negros . In collapsing the two populations, activists attemp t to create a \"black and white\" system of racial classification in Brazil. In addit ion to their claims of genetic continuity between pardos and pretos, activists argue that the two categories should be collapsed into one because black and brown people suffer simi lar effects of racism, such as employment discrimination and low socioeconomic sta tus\u2014which ostensibly affect health outcomes (Figueroa 2004). However, as I mentioned in the Introduction, recent epidemiological studies indicate that although pret os fare dramatically worse than brancos (whites) on most mortality and morbidity in dexes, pardos' rates of disease and death from a variety of causes are either similar t o those of brancos (Chor & Lima 2005, Cardoso et al. 2005) or fall somewhere between thos e of pretos and brancos (Lotufo et al. 2007, Fonseca et al. 2007). The major outlier is th e rate of violent deaths for pardos aged 15-29 years, which resembles that of pretos and is much higher than that of brancos (Chor & Lima 2005). In addition, both pretos and pa rdos have a lower life expectancy than whites do\u2014which, at least for \"pardos,\" is lik ely due in large part to the spike in violent deaths within the 15-29 age range. These da ta suggest that collapsing preto and pardo categories for health policy makes the most s ense when addressing health issues 134 with a social etiology (e.g., violence), rather tha n complex chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Besides the issue of differing epidemiological pro files between pretos and pardos, some Brazilian researchers question claims of genet ic continuity between the two categories. Recall Jean's (the European Brazilian m edical researcher in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds) observation that \"pardo\" does not necessarily conno te the presence of African ancestry, but can also apply to individuals with mixed indige nous and European ancestry for lack of a more precise Census category. Despite this obs ervation, Jean affirmed during our interview that pardos and pretos with African ances try exhibit higher rates of hypertension that is more severe and harder to trea t than hypertension in whites. Thus, although he questions the accuracy of the category \"pardo,\" he believes there is a common genetic basis for at least one disease betwe en light- and dark-skinned African Brazilians. Telles (2004) also argues that \"pardo\" is a problematic Census category if lumped together with \"preto\" to form a single \"popu la\u00e7\u00e3o negra.\" Since the Census registers self-reported racial identity, and the Na tional Health Policy for the Black Population utilizes these numbers, its target popul ation may capture individuals without African ancestry (e.g., indigenous Brazilians) who are phenotypically brown while excluding individuals who have African ancestry but lack a black phenotype. The Imperative of Self-Declaration The imperative for patients to declare their own r acial identity, rather than permitting health professionals to declare it for t hem, is a particularly salient issue within the Brazilian black health agenda. Over the last fe w years, the Ministry of Health has conducted a widespread campaign to encourage patien ts to declare their own \"race or 135 color\" ( ra\u00e7a ou cor ) on medical forms. In S\u00e3o Paulo, the state health department often contracts black health activists (many of whom are psychologists or sociologists) to conduct training sessions for hospital staff on app ropriate procedures for collecting patients' self-declared race and color data. Accord ing to many of the health administrators and activists whom I interviewed, se lf-declaration is important because, in a context of significant interethnic mixture, healt h professionals must rely on patients' knowledge of their own ancestry rather than trying to guess their ancestry through phenotypic clues. This claim indicates their belief that race is a reliable proxy for ancestry, and that ancestry can provide important c lues regarding patients' health vulnerabilities. Prior to the early 1990s, epidemiological data by race were rarely collected in Brazil; only birth and mortality statistics feature d a race variable. In recent years, however, the Ministry of Health has invested increa singly in the production of epidemiological data by race in order to get a clea rer picture of racial inequalities in health. The Ministry's shift in data collection pol icy occurred as a result of pressure from black health activists and new legislation. As Mari ela, a black health activist and SUS administrator, explained: The color question [on patient records] serves to r eveal race relations and how they interfere in the process of health care... . People get sick and die as a result of their social conditions, which are due to race relations and social inequalities. But when they enter the clinic, those relations are reproduced there. That's why [health professionals] end up tre ating their patients differently. And they don't even realize it. Mariela's comments reflect the importance that adv ocates of the black health agenda place on collecting patients' race data. In essence, they rely on the color question 136 (quesito cor ) to provide proof that racial health disparities e xist in Brazil. Although still inadequate due to spotty recording practices in man y areas, epidemiological data by race have been instrumental in persuading the Brazilian government to approve black health initiatives. Mariela's statement also posits social factors, including blacks' relative socioeconomic disadvantage and racial discriminatio n in health care, as the primary cause of racial health disparities in Brazil. Another element that emerges in Mariela's comments is the claim that blacks are treated differently (i.e., unequally) from whites i n health care settings. Black health activists both denounce and demand differentiated t reatment in health care using the same language, i.e., tratamento diferenciado (differentiated treatment). This seems at first glance to be contradictory. Activists denounce wors e treatment for blacks but they do not reject discrimination per se ; in fact, they make political claims for \"positive discrimination\" ( discrimina\u00e7\u00e3o positiva ) in the form of culturally sensitive treatment for blacks, as well as treatment that takes into accoun t their specific physical features and biological tendencies. Although Mariela's statement reveals her understa nding of the utility of the color item, she still does not explain why it is so impor tant for the patient, rather than the health professional, to declare the patient's race. If the objective were to provide evidence of racial health disparities stemming from racism, wou ldn't hetero-classification (i.e., classification by the health care provider) constit ute a more reliable measure of how others in society perceive the patient? Patient sel f-declaration makes it possible for a person with African or Indian ancestry to identify as white, thereby obscuring any correlation between her health status and her statu s as a disenfranchised minority. In 137 addition, the color question does not take into acc ount the race of the health care provider. If the objective of the question is, as M ariela states, to reveal how racial dynamics influence medical encounters, wouldn't tha t information also be useful? Recently, Bastos et al. (2009) conducted a large-s cale study of self-declared racial identity. They found that the way respondents ident ified their own race shifted significantly depending on the interviewer's phenot ype. Specifically, respondents tended to identify themselves as one shade lighter than th eir interviewer. This study demonstrates the considerable influence of relation al dynamics in constructing racial identity in Brazil. In a practical sense, it shows that racial identity is not stable even when self-declared, and that it can shift considerably a ccording to context. Nevertheless, the public health professionals I int erviewed all stressed the importance of self-reported race on patient records . Miriam, a European Brazilian health educator at the CRT in S\u00e3o Paulo (see Chapter 3), r ecalled the significant changes in patients' race statistics that ensued when the CRT first instituted a self-declaration policy in 2004. At that time, Miriam and her colleagues re -classified their current patients' race data according to self-declared racial identity, th en compared those data with the race data that had previously been recorded by staff. Th e largest increase was in \"pardos,\" followed by \"pretos.\" To the staff's surprise, they suddenly gained about twenty-five indigenous patients, all of whom had previously bee n classified by health professionals as \"pardo\" or \"preto.\" Based on these results, the sta ff concluded that they had been \"whitening\" their patients' racial identities. Given the highly contingent nature of both self- a nd hetero-classification of patient race in Brazilian public health settings, b oth methods are problematic if the goal is 138 to generate consistent epidemiological data that re flect racial identity. During fieldwork, however, it gradually became clear that activists w ere more concerned about the patient's right to self-determination than with the quality o r consistency of epidemiological data. An episode from my fieldwork illustrates this point . On October 27, 2008, a group of black health activists gathered at the radio and te levision workers' union in Bixiga, a neighborhood of downtown S\u00e3o Paulo. The occasion wa s the third annual Black Health Mobilization Day, and activists from black movement s (movimentos negros ) all over Brazil were commemorating the day with special meet ings and events. Early that afternoon, I was down at the union headquarters hel ping the activists to hang posters and organize the auditorium for a debate to be held in the evening. The posters we were hanging, which came from the Ministry of Health, en couraged patients to self-identify their race when accessing health care in public cli nics and hospitals. Each poster featured the slogan: \"HEALTH: What is your color/race/ethnic ity? You are the best person to declare your color. With this information, the publ ic [health] service can better serve you.\" Underneath the slogan was a photographic line up of seven faces, each one cropped below the nose and representing a different ethnici ty. I turned to Pai Cesar, a fervent black health acti vist and priest of Afro-Brazilian religion, and asked him why self-declaration is so important. He looked at me quizzically and replied, \"It's an issue of the right to declare your own identity, rather than allowing the state to dictate your identity to you.\" I then asked him about the possible pitfalls of self-declaration, such as white people identifying as black and vice-versa. 63 Tentatively, I 63 The way I framed this question demonstrates the ext ent to which I was using North American racial ideology at this point in my fieldwork. 139 added that it seemed as though self-declaration cou ld misrepresent both racism in health care and the correlation of certain race categories with risk for genetic illnesses like sickle cell anemia. Pai Cesar quickly replied, \"genetic ma keup is irrelevant in Brazil due to miscegenation,\" adding that black health activists were much more concerned with black Brazilians' unequal access to health care and with racial discrimination in the clinics. He skirted the issue of data quality. In his explanation, which was echoed by other blac k health activists during fieldwork, Pai Cesar affirmed that one of the funda mental issues underlying self- declaration is the right to self-determination. Rat her than allowing the state to impose a racial identity upon its citizens, as it routinely does on infants' birth certificates, activists and many health administrators believe citizen-pati ents should have the right to decide how they want to present themselves during a medica l encounter. This ideology of self- declaration/determination of one's racial identity comes from the Brazilian Census, which also requires citizens to declare their own r ace. Earlier, I stated that Brazil's current regime is closer to a social democracy than a liberal democracy due to its focus on social welfar e policies. During the 1990s, however, Brazil, like many Latin American nations, implement ed structural adjustment policies meant to help curb its mounting debt and staggering inflation. Like its Latin American neighbors, Brazilian governmentality still bears tr aces of neoliberalism that have endured from this time. As Burchell (1996) argues, neoliber al governance constructs a relationship between government and th e governed that increasingly depends upon ways in which individuals are required to assume the status of being the subjects of their lives, up on the ways in which they fashion themselves as certain kinds of subjects, up on the ways in which they practice their freedom\" (29-30). 140 In the context of post-neoliberal Brazil, the impe rative of racial self-declaration within health care represents a technology of the s elf that constitutes citizens' relationship to the state in a particular way. Through the act o f declaring one's racial identity within the public clinic, citizens are (in theory) given t he freedom to choose how they want to be viewed and treated. Within Brazil's new biopolitica l mode of governance, citizens who identify as \"parda\" or \"preta\" are tallied and ente red into national epidemiological databases as such. From there, data on their health outcomes join those of other citizens and are used to produce scientific knowledge and to formulate health policies. Thus, in declaring their race, citizens enter a complex cycl e of interaction with the state that both begins and ends by reinforcing particular rationali ties of government. In this case, citizens participate in a form of governance that u tilizes their self-declared vital statistics to create health policy, care, and research that ai ms to fulfill a compensatory logic. This form of governance reinforces the idea that some ci tizens are more vulnerable than others, and thus require specialized health care. Furthermore, as is often the case with neoliberal governmentality, the state appears to entrust citizens with certain aspects of governance (sometimes called \"responsibilization\"), while simultaneously circums cribing their choices (e.g., Ong 2006). In the case of race/color data collection wi thin SUS, the state purports to give citizens the freedom to choose their own racial ide ntity, but limits this freedom by requiring them to choose from a list of state-provi ded categories that may or may not reflect how they actually identify themselves racia lly. In theory, citizens would become co-responsible for their treatment, health outcomes , and, ultimately, the health policies 141 they help to create by declaring their race in the public clinic. In practice, however, this idealized scenario often breaks down due to provide r and/or patient resistance. Etiological Claims Many scholars have questioned the validity of util izing race variables in epidemiological research (e.g., Root 2003, Shim 200 0, Fullilove 1998). Specifically, they question research designs that purport to measure t he prevalence of genetically determined conditions by referencing socially defin ed \"racial\" populations. They also problematize the use of \"race\" as a universal varia ble, given that race categories differ according to social and historical context. Many of these scholars, however, support the use of a race variable to measure the effects of ra cism as a causal factor for health disparities between racialized groups. Jean, the medical researcher in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, criticiz ed some Brazilian epidemiologists' blanket attribution of certain dis eases to the entire black population without taking into account regional differences. H aving researched black health issues in both S\u00e3o Paulo and Maranh\u00e3o, he pointed out that bl acks in Maranh\u00e3o suffer disproportionately from diseases such as malaria, t uberculosis, and Hansen's disease (leprosy). Blacks in urban S\u00e3o Paulo, by contrast, do not often present with these illnesses, as they are tend to be more prevalent in poverty-stricken regions like Northeast Brazil. Jean's comments raise the question of whether illn esses defined as black health problems in Brazil merit this special category, or whether they are, in essence, diseases of poverty. In other words, what is it that distinguis hes black Brazilians' suffering from that of Brazil's impoverished masses? This question is h otly debated between supporters and 142 opponents of the black health agenda. In their rece nt book Divis\u00f5es Perigosas [Dangerous Divisions] (2007), Peter Fry and colleagues from FIOCRUZ, Braz il's premier public health research institute, dismiss t he need for a separate area of public health focused on blacks. They argue that low-incom e blacks suffer from the same health concerns as all impoverished Brazilians. While Fry and his colleagues do not dispute the existence of racism, they contend that creating sep arate policies for black Brazilians will end up creating racial segregation in Brazil in a m anner similar to the United States or South Africa. According to them, public policies ba sed on a bipolar conception of race represent a North American solution to racial inequa lity that does not match Brazil's cultural context. Rather, they assert that only uni versalist policies to improve health and living conditions for all Brazilians are capable of counteracting racism. According to black health activists (e.g., Lopes 20 05), positions like that of Fry and colleagues reduce racial inequality to class in equality. Activists argue that black Brazilians not only constitute the majority of the country's impoverished masses, but also endure additional suffering provoked by racism in a ll social structures and institutions, including the clinic. They claim further that black Brazilians' suffering is qualitatively different from that of poor whites due to both phys ical and social factors. Activists' explanations of health disparities between black an d white Brazilians run the gamut of genetic/biological, social, and combinations of the se. Furthermore, they often classify diseases believed to have a genetic origin in Afric an Brazilians as \"ethnic illnesses\" (doen\u00e7as \u00e9tnicas S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds menti oned in Chapter 3, identified sickle cell anemia, uterine fibroids, hypertension, and diabetes as \"ethnic illnesses\" 143 affecting the black population. She distinguished t hese from diseases such as HIV/AIDS, which she said were more prevalent in socially \"vul nerable\" populations ( popula\u00e7\u00f5es vulner\u00e1veis ) such as the black population, but have no connect ion to blacks' genetic makeup. Laura attributed blacks' social vulnerabili ty both to socioeconomic disadvantage and to unequal access to HIV/AIDS prevention and tr eatment services. When I asked her about the origin of ethnic illnesses, Laura specula ted that the hostile conditions of slavery, combined with artificially engineered cont act between enslaved Africans from diverse geographic areas, had produced genetic muta tions in blacks. These mutations, she explained, were then expressed as ethnic illnesses. The idea that an individual's acquired traits can be passed onto his or her offspring is a key tenet of Lamarckism. During my r esearch, I encountered many activists and non-activists that invoked the duress of slaver y to explain black Brazilians' present- day health patterns\u2014regardless of whether they cons idered them better or worse than the health outcomes of non-blacks. Perhaps the frequenc y of Larmarck-inspired etiological narratives is popul arity of Larmarckian or \"soft\" eugenic theories in Brazil during the late nineteenth and e arly twentieth centuries. Brazilian intellectuals favored Galton's brand of \"positive e ugenics,\" which earned that moniker through Galton's recommendation that governments sh ould encourage fitter individuals to reproduce, rather than limiting the reproduction of individuals assumed to be less fit. Brazilian eugenicists often combined Galton's ideas with Lamarckian theories that stressed the heritability of acquired traits, there by engendering an even \"softer\" form of positive eugenics in which public sanitation and hy giene were stressed over and above restrictive mating practices (Stepan 1991). 144 Although it may be a stretch to connect Brazilians ' present-day racial narratives to turn-of-the-century eugenic discourses, Lamarckian understandings of racial inheritance figured prominently in my informants' accounts\u2014ofte n in combination with discourses drawn from biological and biomedical sciences. Laur a, for instance, combined a Lamarckian explanation with a narrative based on po pulation genetics (i.e., genetic drift). What is interesting about the second part of her ex planation, however, is the idea that enslaved Africans in Brazil represented an isolated mating population. She claimed that the forced contact between Africans from different continental areas had produced genetic mutations, as if enslaved Africans were not also reproducing with Portuguese and indigenous Brazilians. This kind of narrative chall enges an important tenet of Gilberto Freyre's theory of racial democracy, namely, unrest ricted sexual mixing between African, Portuguese, and indigenous Brazilians duri ng colonial and post-colonial times. The discourse of ethnic illnesses is not confined to activists; it has been used by Brazilian medical researchers and endorsed by the B razilian Ministry of Health. In 2001, the Ministry of Health published the Manual of Most Important Illnesses, for Ethnic Reasons, in the Afro-Descendant Brazilian Population (Manual de manual sought to educate health care providers abou t diseases observed to be more prevalent in African Brazilians. Although \"ethnic r easons\" could refer to anything from customs to diet to residential patterns, the manual operationalizes Afro-Brazilian ethnicity as genetic predisposition to a host of di seases. These include sickle cell anemia, G6PD deficiency, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, a nd pre-eclampsia. Although the manual deems it \"unacceptable\" to divide the Brazil ian population into \"black\" and \"non-145 black\" categories given its high level of miscegena tion, the authors simultaneously affirm the existence of and \"black genes\" (M inistry of Health 2001: 46). Many researchers argue that human races do not exi st, at least not in the sense of discrete biological entities that correspond to soc ially constructed race categories such as \"black\" or \"white.\" Brace (2005), for instance, ass erts that biologically adaptive traits are not distributed along the lines of perceived racial boundaries, but rather along genetic clines. Clines differ substantially from race becau se, while \"cline\" refers to the distribution of a particular trait throughout a spe cies, \"race\" designates a population group (sometimes understood as a subspecies) on the basis of shared phenotypic traits such as skin color and the shape of facial features . Similarly, Templeton (2003) argues that race is nonexistent from a genetic standpoint because subspecies do not exist in human populations. Clines, however, do exist and of ten cross so-called racial boundaries. For instance, clines for the sickle cell trait occu r in several regional populations throughout Africa, the Middle East, the Mediterrane an area, and southern India; the high degree of phenotypic variation across these populat ions demonstrates the trait's discordance with the traits normally used to design ate race, such as skin color (ibid.). Genetically determined variation in drug response i s another example of clinal patterning that defies the socially constructed boundaries of race (Wilson et al. 2001). Nevertheless, a number of biomedical researchers co ntinue to assert the validity of using U.S. Census race categories as a proxy for genetic variation in epidemiological studies of health issues such as diabetes (e.g., Ka rter et al. 2002) and hypertension (e.g., Brewster et al. 2000) as well as drug response (e.g ., Exner et al. 2001). Similarly, most of the Brazilian activists and health professionals I interviewed accepted at least some 146 degree of health-related genetic specificity among blacks as a group. Sickle cell anemia and hypertension were the two diseases that respond ents most commonly invoked as proof of this specificity\u2014even though some, like An dr\u00e9, were clearly aware of the contingent nature of \"black\" health problems. J\u00e9ssica is a black health activist and the directo r of a public clinic in Tabo\u00e3o da Serra, S\u00e3o Paulo. As one of the only black clinic d irectors in S\u00e3o Paulo, she was keenly aware of racism within the clinics and recounted ho w her colleagues had given her the cold shoulder when she first became director of a n earby clinic. By night, J\u00e9ssica worked as a nurse at the public Campo Limpo Hospital, and she was completing a master's degree in organizational management at the time of my research. She is in her fifties and has medium-brown skin and straightened hair. Due to her simultaneous positions as health provid er, health administrator, and black movement activist, J\u00e9ssica had a unique persp ective on issues of race and health. Like most of my informants, she presented a mixed a ccount of etiological explanations for black/white health disparities. For instance, s he stated that blacks' higher prevalence of diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and ute rine fibroids may have arisen from their enslaved ancestors' emotional trauma. She als o claimed that black women have more problems with reproductive health because they have \"hotter bodies.\" Additionally, she affirmed that the ACE inhibitor captopril is in effective in blacks and causes more side effects for black cardiovascular patients than for white ones, although she could not explain why. In spite of her biomedical training and experience , J\u00e9ssica's comments indicate that she subscribed to several medical beliefs that contradict basic tenets of biomedicine 147 and evolutionary biology. Her belief in the heritab ility of diseases with psychosomatic origins resembles the Lamarckian model of inheritan ce, as I discussed above in relation to Laura's etiological explanations. J\u00e9ssica's stat ement that black women have hotter bodies invokes elements of both humoral pathology a nd scientific racism. According to Foster (1987), some tenets of humoral pathology hav e lingered in Latin America as a result of Spanish and Portuguese colonizers introdu cing the topic into medical education and practice in the New World. Although humoral path ology seems to have retained more popular influence in Spanish-speaking Latin Am erican countries than in Brazil, J\u00e9ssica's idea that black women have hotter bodies could be influenced by remnants of humoral pathology in Brazilian medical culture. At the same time, the idea of black women having hotter bodies than white women is remi niscent of the scientific racism that was in vogue across Europe and the Americas during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. During the interview, however, it was clear that J\u00e9ssica was expressing hypotheses rather than convictions about the causes of worse health outcomes in blacks. J\u00e9ssica also identified racism in health care as a powerful contributor to worse health outcomes in black patients. In her role as c harge nurse at a public hospital, she claimed she had often witnessed her colleagues verb ally abuse black women in labor: A white woman comes in and screams, screams, scream s, and no one says anything. But normally with black women\u2014even nurses do this, unfortunately, I have seen this\u2014[they say] \"when yo u were getting laid you didn't cry out for your mother or for God.\" They ma ke these vicious comments that they don't make to other women [patie nts]. When a [black] woman yells, \"oh my God!\" [the nurses] tell her to shut up. 148 J\u00e9ssica also observed that black women in labor we re given anesthesia less often than white women in labor. She attributed this prac tice to the widespread belief that blacks could withstand pain better than whites. 64 Additionally, J\u00e9ssica had seen doctors recommend hysterectomies more often to black women with uterine fibroids than for white women with the same problem. 65 To J\u00e9ssica, it seemed that the doctors wanted to sterilize those women in order to prevent the birth of more blacks. J\u00e9ssica's account of unequal treatment of black ve rsus white patients in Brazil is supported by several recent studies. For instance, in a large-scale survey of women who had recently given birth, Leal et al. (2005) found that nearly twice as many white women as black women (pretas) had received anesthesia dur ing normal labor. Pardas' rates fell between those of black and white women. Similarly, brancas were nearly three times more likely than pretas, and nearly twice as likely as pardas, to receive pre-natal care. Although these findings could reflect service diff erences between private and public health care, the authors argue that this sho uld not matter since SUS, Brazil's universal health care system, provides both pre-nat al care and anesthesia during labor. However, during my fieldwork in public clinics, man y working-class women reported having significant difficulty accessing pre-natal c are through SUS. Many of these women, though not all, were brown or black. Also, s everal of them reported difficulty getting to the hospital when they went into labor b ecause they could not afford taxi fare. If these women arrived at the hospital in an advanc ed stage of labor, it is possible that 64 See also Washington (2006) on how the popular beli ef in the United States about blacks' superior pain tolerance impacted the disproportionate use of blac ks as subjects in medical research during the 19 th and 20 th centuries. 65 J\u00e9ssica implied, but did not state, that the docto rs to whom she referred were white. Physicians in b oth private and public practice in Brazil are overwhelm ingly white. 149 epidural anesthesia was no longer an option. At the same time, these data could reflect racist stereotypes that black women either are able to withstand pain better than whites, or are less deserving of scarce resources like anes thesia than whites. It is impossible to know. Despite the significant ambiguity surrounding clai ms of racial discrimination in health care, the Brazilian Ministry of Health has i n recent years launched a prominent campaign against institutional racism ( racismo institucional ). This campaign consists of sensitivity workshops for health professionals, and print media such as booklets, posters, and videos that encourage patients to declare their own racial identity. The campaign is rooted in the now-defunct national Program for Comb ating Institutional Racism (Programa de Combate ao Racismo Institucional-PCRI) , the bilateral initative between the Brazilian government and the UK's Department fo r International Development (DFID) that I described in Chapter 3. In emic terms, the phrase \"institutional racism\" d enotes the unequal treatment of blacks and whites in public spaces such as clinics and hospitals. It also refers to health professionals' unconscious discrimination against b lack patients. Following the creation of the PCRI in 2001, official discourses on racial health disparities shifted from emphasizing genetic etiology to privileging institu tional racism as a primary causal factor. This shift is somewhat curious, given that nearly all of the activists I interviewed between 2005 and 2009 posited genetic differences a s an equally important cause of health inequalities between blacks and non-blacks. The shift may be due to the Pan- American Health Organization's influence on the Bra zilian black health agenda; PAHO has conducted workshops in Brazil focused on \"ethni c equity\" and the elimination of 150 \"institutional racism\" in health care since the ear ly 2000s. 66 Reducing ethnic health disparities in the Americas is the main focus of PA HO's \"Millennium Development Goals\" (MDG), which were established in 2000. During my fieldwork, it became clear that transnat ional discourses on institutional racism had begun to filter into SUS clinics. In som e cases, new antiracist institutional norms caused discomfort and confusion among employe es. One day, for instance, I was sitting in the computer room of J\u00e9ssica's clinic in Tabo\u00e3o da Serra \u2014the de facto employee lounge\u2014when Dr. Miguel walked in. He was a tall, white paulista of about fifty-five with salt-and-pepper hair and dark, twin kling eyes. When J\u00e9ssica told him I was studying race and ethnicity in Brazil, Dr. Miguel r emarked that in Brazil, most people do not see color in terms of black and white; rather, they perceive many intermediate colors, such as mulata \u2014\"like J\u00e9ssica here,\" he joked. J\u00e9ssica smiled but replied firmly, \"Eu sou negra\" (I am black). Dr. Miguel reacted with surpri se, and responded, \"Oh, really?\" J\u00e9ssica explained to him that mulato is a pejorative term because it comes from mula (mule). Dr. Miguel had never heard that before. \"We ll,\" he said, \"I have nothing against negros \u2014at least, not most of them!\" He playfully slapped J\u00e9ssica on the upper arm when he said this, and she grinned. Dr. Miguel then comm ented that it was difficult to know when to call someone negro , because so many people find the term offensive. A few weeks earlier, Dr. Miguel had jokingly asked a child he was treating, \"Why are you so dark ( escurinha ) if your mother is white?\" The mother became very upset. The next day, her husband lodged a complaint against Dr . Miguel, calling his behavior 66 See, for instance, a 2004 PAHO publication titled \" Working to Achieve Ethnic Equity in Health: Ensuring that the Millennium Development Goals Incl ude an Ethnic Perspective in Latin America and the Caribbean.\" Electronic document, available at: http ://www.paho.org/english/ad/ge/torres-ethnicequity.p df. Last accessed March 28, 2011. 151 \"racist.\" Dr. Miguel thought this was going too far . \"I joke around with Japanese children too, asking why their eyes are squinty ( puxados ),\" he added. J\u00e9ssica asked me if doctors made these types of comments to their patients in t he United States, and I responded that doctors, like most Americans, tend to avoid joking about people's racial identity because it is not considered politically correct. \"See?\" sa id J\u00e9ssica, raising her eyebrows and nodding approvingly. When I entered the employee lounge the following w eek, Dr. Miguel was seated at the table, looking rather down. He told me that earlier that day, he had asked a female patient why she has a white baby if she, the mother , is so black ( preta ). The mother had responded angrily, \"I'm not black, I'm morena \u2014don't you see that my hair is straight?\" Virginia, the office manager and a self-proclaimed negra , snorted with laughter and remarked that many patients who are negros de cabelo duro (black with hard hair) claim to be \"moreno\" when asked to declare their race on patient forms. Dr. Miguel laughed too, adding, \"These mulatinhos (little mulatos) always say they're morenos !\" He glanced sideways at J\u00e9ssica to gauge her reaction, and she smiled tightly. This example is emblematic both of the conflicting norms on how to deal with race in clinical settings, and of the way Brazilian s tend to use humor to defuse potentially uncomfortable situations involving race. The exchan ges between Dr. Miguel and J\u00e9ssica revealed their contrasting stances on racial etique tte, and their divergent models of racial identity. Although J\u00e9ssica did not openly censure D r. Miguel for teasing his patients about their skin color, she used my response about U.S. norms of race talk to suggest that this was the proper way for doctors and patients to interact. As clinic director, J\u00e9ssica was Dr. Miguel's supervisor, and he was aware of her pa rticipation in the city's black health 152 committee. Nevertheless, he was confident that she a nd Virginia would take his racial commentary as good-natured ribbing rather than an e xpression of racism. He had not received any formal training on sa\u00fade da popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra at that point, and thus still felt comfortable using racial epithets like \"mulatinho\" to describe his patients. This episode also shows that not only health profes sionals, but also patients are becoming increasingly vigilant about racial discrim ination. Dr. Miguel's patients had received no training on how to recognize and report racism at the doctor's office. It is possible, though, that the child's father had notic ed a Ministry of Health poster posted on the clinic wall with the words, \"Racismo Institucio nal\u2014DENUNCIE\" (Institutional Racism\u2014Denounce it). In the last couple of years, S US has implemented complaint boards ( ouvidorias ) to receive patients' feedback on clinic services. Despite the Ministry's good intentions, I heard from many patie nts that they had never been contacted after lodging a complaint with an ouvidoria . None of the healthcare administrators I interviewed admitted to opposing the implementation of race-specific health measures, al though several doctors and nurses did; I discussed some of their reactions in Chapter 2. T he most vehement opposition to activists' charges of institutional racism in SUS, though, comes from researchers at FIOCRUZ. In their article \"O SUS racist?\"), Maio, Rodrigues argue that the racist attitudes and actio ns of some SUS professionals simply reproduce the same tendencies that exist within soc iety and do not, therefore, constitute pervasive institutional racism, but rather reflect the idiosyncrasies of particular individuals (Maio, Monteiro, & Rodrigues 2007). 153 In addition to blaming health disparities on insti tutional racism, black health activists attribute black Brazilians' worse health outcomes to everyday experiences of racism. They connect these experiences to hypertens ion and to higher rates of mental health problems among blacks. Arlene, for instance, reported feeling unwelcome in many public places in S\u00e3o Paulo before she became involv ed in black movement activism. According to Arlene, she used to confront daily bou ts of insecurity when doing the most mundane things because she expected to be treated b adly. As she explained, You enter [an establishment] without knowing ...how you will be received. Restaurants, for example\u2014I can't tell you how many times I walked by a restaurant, hungry, with money in my pocket, and a thousand times I didn't have the courage to go in. Whether or not Arlene's discomfort was justified by the way she was actually received in public places is irrelevant. The point is that she believed she would not be treated well, and her belief caused her to experience stress and to avoid certain places and situations. Many of the activists in my study\u2014women in particu lar\u2014 reported exceptionally stressful life situations, and they often seemed an xious or depressed when we spoke. Edileusa, for example, complained about the high de gree of job stress she experienced due to racial prejudice and belittlement at work. R aquel and Arlene lived in the urban periphery and battled disintegrating financial cond itions. J\u00e9ssica worked double shifts to support her household as a single mother. Perhaps n ot surprisingly, most of these women suffered from high blood pressure. Although Arlene felt that her involvement in black movement activism helped her to confront racial dis crimination in her own life, it did not appear to diminish the stress she experienced on a daily basis. She reported that her doctor had advised her to \"stop this black movement business\" if she wanted to live to 154 see her grandchildren grow up. Many studies have de monstrated the correlation between perceived prejudice and high blood pressure (e.g., Williams 1998). Although my sample was relatively small, the women activists who parti cipated in my fieldwork brought this correlation to life. Their narratives indicated tha t being aware of racism, and possessing strategies to respond to it, did not necessarily ab ate the stress of experiencing it. Medicalizing Racism By positing racism as a key causal factor for ment al and physical health problems in the black population, activists and other suppor ters of the black health agenda medicalize racism. The National Health Policy for t he Black Population presents urban violence as a public health problem for the black p opulation and calculates health damages in terms of productive years lost for black men. Many activists attribute black Brazilians' lower life expectancy (as compared to w hites) to socioeconomic disadvantage caused by racism in various sectors of society. What are the implications of medicalizing racism? Medicalization, or framing a social problem in terms of its health impact, trans forms an obvious but diffuse social problem into an empirical pathology located in the body of an individual patient. If medicalization is a top-down phenomenon, it could s erve to neutralize a politicized response to social suffering (e.g., Lock & Scheper- Hughes 1996, Rhodes 1996). In the case of the Brazilian black health agenda, however, the medicalization of racism can be understood as an agentive strategy to garner health resources for black Brazilians. It thus constitutes a strategic response to a social proble m that disrupts individual bodies. This argument becomes more evident if one situates the b lack health agenda within the corpus of affirmative action programs in Brazil. Viewed in this way, medicalization represents 155 another strategy to redress inequalities stemming f rom racism. There is one important caveat, however: this kind of medicalization associ ates race and racism with the concept of \"vulnerability,\" a discursive move that, in my a ssessment, can have negative side effects. In an article presented at the First National Semin ar on Black Health in Brasilia, activist Fernanda Lopes identifies the black popula tion's \"vulnerability\" as a leading cause of poorer health outcomes (Lopes 2004). She d efines \"vulnerability\" as \"a set of individual and collective factors related to the de gree and mode of exposure to a given situation and, undeniably, to unequal access to the resources necessary to protect oneself from the undesirable consequences of that situation \" (49). She links black Brazilians' heightened vulnerability to their higher rates of p reventable diseases such as AIDS. What are the consequences of labeling a racialized group as vulnerable? Does this language empower or stigmatize the group in questio n? On the one hand, asserting that social exclusion renders black Brazilians more vuln erable to illness could mobilize resources toward addressing the physical results of entrenched structural inequalities. On the other hand, \"vulnerability\" discourses resemble the language of risk employed in identification of \"at risk\" populat ions. Glick Schiller (1992) critiques the identification of race, ethnicity, or culture as ri sk factors for illness because this language can shift the locus of blame from society onto excl uded groups themselves. Epidemiologists' blanket characterizations of certa in populations as \"at risk\" may reinforce the image of these populations as cultura lly distinct from the rest of the nation, or what Glick Schiller terms \"contagious cultural o thers\" (239). Finally, she argues that 156 the \"racial and ethnic categorization of risky beha vior\" can result in misguided health policy (239). How does this argument apply to the Brazilian blac k health agenda? The Brazilian case is slightly different because members of the e xcluded group are promoting their own characterization as a vulnerable population. Overal l, activists' discourses of vulnerability do not seem to obscure social factors such as racis m. Being labeled \"vulnerable,\" however, may be unpalatable to individuals who do n ot wish to be associated with weakness or heightened predisposition to illness. A s for Glick Schiller's argument that \"at risk\" populations are often constructed as \"con tagious cultural others,\" this could be a danger for the Brazilian black health agenda as wel l if the focus is on contagious diseases such as HIV/AIDS. Even identifying black Brazilians as more likely to experience septic abortions, substance abuse, or mental illness could have a stigmatizing effect. When asked about vulnerability discourses and the potent ial for stigma, however, black health activist Cl\u00e1udia responds that \"everything we do [r elated to black health] is risky....We run the risk of negative stereotypes, but on the ot her hand, they are based in reality.\" She adds that, although the general population might in terpret health \"vulnerabilities\" as stemming from essential characteristics of the blac k population rather than from racism, this risk is necessary in order to denounce racism and reduce health disparities. Discourses of Difference As I mentioned previously, black health activists often make reference to different treatment for blacks and whites in medical settings . These statements can be somewhat confusing, since they simultaneously demand and den ounce different treatment (tratamento diferenciado ). On the one hand, activists often complain that h ealth 157 professionals discriminate against black patients i n various ways. S\u00f4nia, the activist from Geled\u00e9s in S\u00e3o Paulo, expressed this idea in the fo llowing way: Let's say we both go to the doctor's office. The do ctor will ask you about your medical history. \"What illnesses run in your f amily?\" \"How old are you?\", etc. Then I come in. He's going to ask, \"Sin ce when [have you this [medicati on].\" My appointment won't last as long because he is less interested in identifying the origin of [my] illness. So, something that's really common is for them to ask a black patient if he's an alcoholic. \"Have you been drinki ng?\" \"Do alcoholic?\" \"Do you use drugs?\" With yo u, he tries to get your medical history. With me, no\u2014he goes directly to hi s assumptions...even today, black women's illnesses are often seen as be ing related to sexually transmitted diseases....they invoke the idea that b lack women are promiscuous, that black women are prostitutes...tha t they are unhygienic. In this excerpt, S\u00f4nia describes a hypothetical doc tor's discrimination against her, a black woman, as compared to me, a white woman. She attrib utes the doctor's neglect of his black patient to racism and suggests that doctors o ften misdiagnose black patients based on their belief in negative stereotypes about black s, for example, that they are more prone to substance abuse and sexual promiscuity. During o ur interview, S\u00f4nia added that doctors' misperception of the causes of black patie nts' symptoms ends up delaying correct diagnosis until the patient's original comp laint has become more complicated and difficult to treat. In her view, this lag between i nitial presentation and correct diagnosis in black patients is one of the most significant contr ibutors to health inequalities between blacks and whites in Brazil. The discriminatory pra ctices S\u00f4nia described fall under the rubric of institucional ) within black health activists' narratives. Virtually all of my activist informants reported similar discriminatory practices against black patients (in reference to t hemselves and/or to their friends and 158 family), including health professionals' spending l ess time with them as compared to white patients and assuming that they engage in unh ealthy behaviors. The same activists who denounce different treatmen t often demand, in the same breath, that health professionals recognize and att end to black patients' special needs. These activists urge doctors and nurses to see blac k patients as a qualitatively different group than white, indigenous, or Asian patients. Th ey argue that health professionals should take \"a differentiated view\" ( um olhar diferenciado ) of black patients. When I asked S\u00f4nia whether activists are ultimately seekin g equality or different treatment, her answer was \"both\": [We're] asking for equality. But [treatment] has to be differentiated because the same headache may have a different cause betwee n\u2014between you and me. Let's say we go to the doctor with the same com plaint. But that symptom in me should put the doctor on higher alert. Becaus e I might have an illness which is prevalent in blacks, and you might not. Yo u might be temporarily indisposed....so this initial moment which is equal ends up producing illness [in me]. So we ask for equality, but a different vi ew ( um olhar diferenciado ) is also necessary. Here, S\u00f4nia was referring specifically to hypertens ion. Although her suggestion that doctors should take headaches in black patients mor e seriously than headaches in white patients may seem like bad medicine, it is importan t to remember that S\u00f4nia is not a health professional\u2014she is a sociologist. In her as sessment, doctors should not only view black patients as a special group, but they should also follow a different treatment protocol when diagnosing them. In this example, S\u00f4n ia did not say that blacks and whites have unequal access to public health care, but rath er that their treatment becomes unequal if the doctor uses the same treatment protocol to d iagnose everyone. The logical corollary of this statement is that blacks and whites are dif ferent before they ever enter the clinic. It 159 was not clear from S\u00f4nia's narrative whether she be lieved this difference arose from unequal living conditions or from intrinsic physica l specificities. Furthermore, S\u00f4nia was making a case for \"positive\" discrimination between black and white patients, as opposed to the status quo in which negative discrimination (described in her first example) or even benign neg lect (described in her second example) prevails. I asked her if that was what she meant, a nd she confirmed it: A positive differentiated view. That's it. Because today's di fferentiated view causes [blacks] to be neglected...This differentiat ed view of you and me prevents the doctor from requesting a specific exam , an EKG. It leads him to instead prescribe a simple analgesic, and to ignore my symptom. Many of my activist informants similarly articulate d the need for doctors to treat black and white patients differently in a way that would improve their health, rather than in a way that would misdiagnose and demoralize them. Insofar as they confirm the existence of intrinsic differences between blacks and whites, S\u00f4nia's comments provide an example of \"dif ference discourse\" (Ford 2005: passim). Difference discourse is a reaction to raci sm that ends up reinforcing the idea of incommensurability between racialized groups (ibid) . Whereas racist discourse \"insists on racial difference and then punishes it as devian ce,\" difference discourse retaliates against the racist \"punishment of difference\" by cl aiming respect for differences (ibid: 35). In the process, argues Ford, difference discou rse \"describes social identities such as race as a manifestation of underlying differences\u2014a racial culture\u2014while at the same time generating those very differences\" (28). This is also Peter Fry's argument in relation to the black health agenda; he contends that, by tr eating the \"black population\" and programs 160 \"produce what they claim to exist\" (Fry 2004: 133). In addition, Fry predicts that difference-based policy agendas, such as the black health agenda, will lead to increased divisions and racial hostility in Brazil (ibid, Fry et al. 2007). It is too soon to say whether Fry's predictions wi ll materialize. It seems plausible, however, that the black health agenda could signifi cantly affect clinical practice in Brazil. While its focus on awareness of racist behavior wit hin the clinic appears to be useful, the race-medicalizing component of the black health age nda could negatively affect health care decision-making. By following race-specific di agnostic and treatment protocols, medical practitioners may end up misdiagnosing and mistreating certain patients. This is especially the case when the health condition in qu estion is linked to genotype, as with hypertension. Kaufman & Cooper (2010) show that, if physicians follow current guidelines to treat white patients with ACE inhibit ors or beta blockers, and black patients with calcium-channel blockers or thiazide-type diur etics, they have a probability of mistreating patients roughly 45 percent of the time (197). Similarly, clinical studies of treatment response by race demonstrate more variabi lity within racialized groups than between them (e.g., Nguyen et al. 2009, Sehgal 2004 ). Furthermore, Kaufman & Cooper warn that focusing too much on supposed racial diff erences can intensify racial stereotyping within clinical practice. For instance , physicians may undertreat minorities in response to the stereotypical belief that they a re less compliant with prescribed regimens (199). Kaufman & Cooper acknowledge, however, that the re cognition of social categories such as race or ethnicity may be useful in clinical practice when treating health conditions with a social etiology. Krieger (2010) a lso makes this point, arguing that an 161 \"ecosocial\" perspective enables policymakers and pr oviders to address the health effects of racist social exclusion. She refers to both earl y-life and latent health consequences of growing up in impoverished and violent conditions. Krieger thus invokes the substantial overlap between racialized identity and socioeconom ic inequalities in the United States, rather than race itself. She argues, nonetheless, t hat the only way to approach health problems that arise from racial discrimination is t o take into account individuals' race. Given the high correlation between skin color and life conditions in Brazil (e.g., Lovell & Wood 1998), it may be of practical value t o consider racial identity in certain research and policy contexts. There are two caveats to this statement, however. First, stratifying data by race appears to be most useful in relation to diseases with socially produced etiologies. These might include diseases t hat arise from malnutrition, environmental toxins, or domestic violence, for ins tance. Second, in my view, it makes more sense to employ race as a (highly contingent) variable within epidemiological research and policymaking, as opposed to clinical p ractice. If a medical practitioner relies primarily on a patient's racial identity to diagnos e and treat her, the practitioner may become blinded to important details about the patie nt's case, as asserted by the literature on race and response to hypertension treatment cite d above. Implications for Citizenship The black health agenda raises the issue of the leg itimacy of group-differentiated citizen rights. But are black health activists aski ng for special treatment? The National Health Policy for the Black Population calls for an increase in the black population's access to health services, the creation of health e ducation materials geared toward the black population's particular \"knowledges and value s,\" and the creation and 162 implementation of black health initiatives. 67 Its language is sufficiently vague as to make unclear the extent to which the black population wi ll actually receive special treatment, as opposed to being recognized as a different group, but not necessarily treated differently within public health care. James Holston (2008) argues that the uneven distri bution of rights and obligations according to citizens' social characteristics is th e rule, rather than the exception, of citizenship regimes around the globe. He observes t hat the extension of certain privileges to specific groups of citizens has historically bee n endorsed in Brazil, a regime he calls \"differentiated citizenship\" (passim). As I noted e arlier, in Brazil women are permitted to retire five years earlier than men, and college gra duates who are convicted of a crime have the right to a private jail cell. Since the en d of the military dictatorship in the 1980s, Brazilians have increasingly used the language of c itizenship to demand not only equal rights, but also special treatment for specific gro ups. Black health activists, as I have shown, demand sp ecial medical attention for the particular health needs of black Brazilians, but th ey also make these claims on the basis of their exclusion from the right to quality health care, which is a universal citizenship right. In so doing, activists often cite the articl e from the Brazilian Constitution that defines health as a universal citizen's right and t he State's obligation, and guarantees citizens \"universal and equal access\" to health car e (Title VIII, Ch. II, Art. 196). Activists argue, however, that this Constitutional article an d the Organic Health Law (8.080/90), which guarantees the provision of equality in healt h care, can only be fulfilled by adjusting medical treatment to suit different patie nts' needs. Rather than \"equality,\" 67 Di\u00e1rio Oficial da Uni\u00e3o , 90, 14 May 2009, p. 31-32. 163 activists invoke the principle of \"equity.\" Equity has been defined in Brazilian public health literature as \"equal opportunity of access\" to health care (e.g., Almeida et al. 2000). My informants repeatedly defined equity as \" treating different populations differently.\" In other words, theirs is a redistrib utive logic that aims to \"level the playing field\" ( anivelar o campo ) by giving special care to segments of the populat ion deemed \"vulnerable\" by SUS\u2014and especially by Brazil's Natio nal STD/AIDS Program\u2014such as blacks, indigenous Brazilians, and homosexuals. In recent years, \"equity\" has become a buzzword am ong black health activists and SUS administrators who are sympathetic to the black health agenda. They often argue that it is more important to provide equitable, rat her than uniform, services because different patient populations have different needs and degrees of vulnerability that place them at greater or lesser risk for disease. They cl aim that if SUS provides uniform services to all patients, it will end up perpetuati ng unequal health outcomes. Although the term \"equity\" does not appear in the Constitutional articles related to SUS, or in the Organic Health Law that implemented SUS, it does ap pear in the new National Health Policy for the Black Population. Black health advocates' definition of equity refle cts a classic Aristotelian argument: \"the nature of the equitable [is] a corre ction of law where it is defective owing to its universality.\" 68 Equity adapts the law to fit extenuating circumsta nces, and thus ensures justice by allowing, for example, less stre nuous punishment for criminals who exhibit vulnerabilities in relation to other citize ns. Equity in Aristotle's definition legitimizes unequal treatment of citizens in consid eration of their particular needs. This 68 Nicomachean Ethics 5.10 (1908, trans. W.D. Ross. Oxford: Clarenden P ress). 164 conception of proportional or relative justice has been endorsed by scholars such as Young (1989), who argues that equal treatment actua lly produces and maintains social inequality since some groups in society are more pr ivileged than others. In Brazil, intellectual and politician Rui Barbosa famously articulated the Aristotelian conception of equity.69 In a 1920 commencement address to law students in S\u00e3o Paulo, Barbosa reiterated the idea that true eq uality could only be achieved by treating \"unequals unequally, according to the meas ure of their inequality\" ( Ora\u00e7\u00e3o aos Mo\u00e7os ). 70 More than once during fieldwork, I heard black hea lth activists quote Barbosa directly in their claims for equity within SUS. The ir use of Barbosa surprised me, since the quote naturalizes inequality between groups of citizens. Nevertheless, the quote often merely served to reinforce the activists' own natur alization of physical differences between blacks and non-blacks. For instance, at a b lack health rally in Bragan\u00e7a Paulista (a small town in S\u00e3o Paulo state), activist Pai Ces ar made the following comments to an audience of terreiro health activists and black mov ement activists, local SUS administrators, and medical students: Ever since Rui Barbosa, we have erent ( somos iguais por\u00e9m diferentes )...we must understand difference not as difference before the law, but between our bodies\u2014and these differenc es create social differences between us....SUS tells us we are all e qual, but there are pre- existing factors of inequality [among us]. 69 James Holston discusses Rui Barbosa's definition of justice, and his own informants' engagements with it, in Insurgent Citizenship (2008). He also observes the Aristotelian origin of the com pensatory justice argument. a verdad eira lei da igualdade.\" [The rule of equality only exist s insofar as the unequal are treated unequally, acc ording to the measure of their inequality. Within this social inequality, which is proportionate to natural ineq uality, one finds the true law of equality\"] (my translatio n). Available at: http://www.culturabrasil.org/aosmocos.htm. Last acc essed June 22, 2010. 165 In this excerpt, Pai Cesar made two discursive move s: he reaffirmed the principle of equality-in-rights, and he deployed a politics o f difference by naturalizing biological incommensurability between black and non-black Braz ilians. His narrative posited inherent physical differences as a priori ones that establish the basis for social differentiation. Even though he did not specificall y mention racial identity in this excerpt, he invoked it throughout the remainder of his speec h. This kind of essentializing discourse was commonplace at black health meetings and events I attended, and it was usually couched within proclamations of Brazilian c itizens' universal right to health care through SUS. Holston (2008) asserts that the Brazilian formulat ion of equity not only naturalizes the existence of inequality among citiz ens, but also ends up creating more inequality: \"...it accepts that social inequalities exist as prior conditions of either disprivilege or privilege and treats them different ly by distributing resources accordingly\" (29). Although black health activists make claims f or equal access to quality public health services, they simultaneously demand official recog nition of their health-related differences. In so doing, they uphold the status qu o of Brazil's \"inclusively inegalitarian\" citizenship, which combines universal inclusion wit h a politics of difference (Holston 2008: passim). What are the implications of the black health agen da for citizenship equality in Brazil? At least in its present form, the black hea lth agenda does not advocate giving black Brazilians special treatment to the detriment of citizens who do not identify as black. The National Health Policy for the Black Pop ulation does not stipulate, for instance, that black patients should be seen before whites in public clinics. Meanwhile, 166 elderly patients are routinely moved to the front o f the line in SUS clinics. Moreover, while there is some redistribution of human and fin ancial resources in the form of training materials and workshops on black health is sues, the Ministry of Health also funds special health programs for other citizen gro ups, such as women and indigenous Brazilians. For these reasons, while I see the blac k health agenda as an example of differentiated citizenship, I am not convinced that it will create more inequality than already exists in the Brazilian public health syste m. At the same time, however, some of the differentia ted citizenship claims embedded in the black health program naturalize inc ommensurability between blacks and whites. As such, one could conclude that the black health agenda represents a more dangerous form of differentiated citizenship than t he kinds that already exist. Although the black health agenda maintains the status quo of differentiated citizenship in Brazil, its politics of difference goes further since it formal izes racial difference at a deeper level than is currently the case with affirmative action quotas in education. University quotas, at least in Brazil, are based on the premise that b lacks have been excluded from higher education due to socioeconomic disadvantage. They e xist alongside quotas for students who attended the inferior public school system and therefore do not impute any innate differences in scholastic ability to black citizens . Black health programs and policies, by contrast, attribute blacks' worse health outcomes t o innate physical differences, in addition to structural factors such as socioeconomi c disadvantage and institutional discrimination. In this aspect they differ from ind igenous health policy, which highlights 167 environmental and cultural determinants of indigeno us health concerns, rather than alleging indigenous Brazilians' intrinsic biologica l susceptibility to certain diseases. 71 Race-based legislation is particularly controversia l in Brazil because, between abolition in 1888 and the implementation of the fir st affirmative action quotas in 2001, the state avoided distributing citizenship rights o n the basis of race. Although the ideology of Brazilian racial democracy has now been widely debunked, many Brazilians retain the idea that public recognition of race equ als racism. That is one reason that they become so inflamed by affirmative action quotas for blacks in public universities; they view the meting out of different treatment by race not only as unfair and unproductive, but also as a negation of the country's racially ha rmonious self-image. Brazil, like many nations, faces the dilemma of ho w to promote the values of multiculturalism and antiracism without sacrificing fundamental civil rights and formal equality. According to many liberal theorists, the protection of individual rights automatically safeguards group-specific rights beca use individuals have the freedom to pursue group-specific goals in their private lives without fear of discrimination. They argue that benign neglect of particular interests a nd cultures is vital to maintaining a non- normative public sphere that remains neutral on the \"good life\" (e.g., Rawls 1971). Theorists who support group-differentiated rights, however, counter that in practice not all individuals possess equal access to the resourc es necessary to pursue the good life as they understand it (e.g., Taylor 1994, Kymlicka 199 5, Benhabib 2002). 71 Source: National Indigenous Health Policy (Pol\u00edtica Nacional de Aten\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 available at: http://www.funas a.gov.br/internet/arquivos/biblioteca /sauInd_politica.pdf. Last accessed March 31, 2011. 168 But in the present case, I repeat, are black heal th activists really asking for different treatment? The answer is both yes and no. Some activists argue, like S\u00f4nia, that doctors need to treat their black patients differen tly based on their greater vulnerability to certain health problems. Much of the time, however, activists stress the need for blacks to have equal access to public health care. When I first heard black he alth activists say this, I was confused. Wasn't SUS open to everyone? Even I , a non-citizen (albeit a white one), had accessed health care at various public clinics and hospitals during my years in Brazil. In response to my query, my informants stated that two factors impede blacks' access to public health care: distance and the way they are t reated by doctors. Mariela, who is both a black health activist and a SUS employee, pointed out that in S\u00e3o Paulo, the majority of the black population lives in areas that are poorly served by public health facilities. To what extent is her the ory accurate? On the next page, I have juxtaposed maps showing the distribution of health services and of the population by color within the city of S\u00e3o Paulo (Figure 3). The health services map utilizes differently colored dots to indicate various types of public he alth facility (e.g., primary care clinics, specialized clinics, etc). The race/color map combi nes pretos and pardos into one \"popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra;\" the darker the area, the higher the concentration of pardos and pretos. It seems that Mariela was correct in her assertion that the zona sul and upper north and northwest areas of the city have fewer health facil ities. The zona leste (eastern zone), by contrast, appears to be relatively well served by t he public health infrastructure. This is likely due in part to the fact that the zona leste was the epicenter of the Health Reform Movement during the 1970s and 1980s. 169 Figure 3. Public Health Facilities and Distribution of Population by Color in S\u00e3o Paulo, 2000. 72 At the same time, however, it is important to cons ider population density when judging how well served an area is vis-\u00e0-vis its po pulation's needs. As Figure 4 shows, the recently incorporated southern bairros of Marsilac, Parelheiros, and Graja\u00fa (95, 58, and 30 on the map) have an exceptionally low popula tion density, as do Anhang\u00fcera, Perus, and Trememb\u00e9 in the north (2, 63, and 81 on the map). Z ona leste , meanwhile, is densely populated. Therefore, it makes sense that t here would be more health facilities in 72 Sources: Secretaria Municipal da Sa\u00fade de S\u00e3o Paulo (map on left) and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o SEADE (map on right).

When considering these factors, it becomes more dif ficult to affirm the accuracy of Mariela's statement that \"black\" neighborhoods lack health facilities. Figure 4. Population Density of S\u00e3o Paulo, 2000. 73 As I stated earlier, it is also difficult to evalu ate claims of unequal treatment by race because medical encounters are usually private . Additionally, patient care protocols differ from case to case, making it nearly impossib le to assess the quality of individual treatment plans. Further complicating this issue is the generalized precariousness of SUS. It is commonplace for SUS patients of all phenotype s to complain about long waiting 73 Source: http://www.seade.gov.br/produtos/ivj/index. php?tip=map&mapa=2. Last accessed March 21, 2011. 171 lines, rushed appointments, and dismissive doctors and nurses. Although the Brazilian state similarly has no basis for evaluating claims of institutional racism in the clinic, besides a few studies of patients' own assessments of their health care (e.g., Barata et al. 2007), the Ministry of Health has seen fit to imple ment programs and policies to counteract institutional racism. This fact attests to the power wielded by activists' claims. Conclusion In this chapter, I have examined how researchers, public health administrators, and, above all, black health activists discursively enact the black health agenda. Through specific ways of defining blackness and its relatio nship to health, this epistemic community posits African Brazilians as a separate c ategory of citizens that have special health needs and require equitable (not necessarily uniform) health practices. By claiming citizenship rights based on membership in a raciali zed group, black health activists are forging a new kind of racially informed biopolitica l citizenship in Brazil. As part of this process, activists are demanding compensation from the state. This compensation takes the form of adjusting healthcare practices to addre ss health damages sustained by the black population through social exclusion. By provi ding this compensation, the state has endorsed black health activists' biologized politic s of difference. This fact signals the new wave of Brazilian governmentality that interpel lates black citizens as a special class of citizens that can increasingly access reparatory resources through affirmative action programs in education, employment, and now, health care. At the same time, African Brazilians are enjoined to participate in their own interpellation as members of this special citizenship group by declaring their race a s \"preto\" or \"pardo\" on the patient information forms utilized by public clinics. 172 The scenario I describe here is similar to what Ep stein (2007) terms the \"inclusion-and-difference paradigm\" adopted by U.S. social movement activists, scientists, and the state in reference to the use o f racial categories in U.S. biomedical research. In that case, minority activists demanded to be included in biomedical research in a way that defined them as different. Their simu ltaneous demands for inclusion and public recognition of their differences were succes sful, argues Epstein, due to the alignment of \"the enhanced classificatory practices of modern democratic states, the assertive self-naming practices of identity-based s ocial movements, and the new segmenting techniques of the biosciences\" (342). I perceive a similar alignment of factors in the B razilian case. For over a decade, the state has endorsed the collapsing of \"preto\" (b lack) and \"pardo\" (brown) categories in order to constitute \"the black population\" ( a popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra ) numerically. As a result, affirmative action policies such as the National Hea lth Policy for the Black Population are able to define the \"black population\" as over h alf of the total Brazilian population. Brazilian black health activists regularly adopt th is definition of the black population in their discourses, although non-activist Brazilians usually do not. Also, due to the increasing availability of health statistics on the Brazilian population by race, Brazilian scientists are conducting more and more studies of differences in health outcomes between \"white\" and \"black\" Brazilians. The black h ealth epistemic community utilizes these scientific data to fortify their political ca mpaigns for race-specific health policy, which the state, more often than not, approves. And the cycle repeats itself. Thus there is, in Brazil, an intertwinement of state, civil societ y, and science that mirrors the situation described by Epstein in the United States. 173 At the same time, the case I analyze here differs from Epstein's in that there is substantial categorical mis alignment between Brazilians who do and do not part icipate in the black health epistemic community. Whereas the m ajority of U.S. citizens would likely formulate racial categories in the same way as the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which dictates the categories to be u sed in U.S. public health research and policy, most Brazilian citizens do not classify all people of African descent as \"negros.\" Yet, this composite category is increasin gly gaining purchase within the realms of research and public policy in Brazil. 174 Part III: AFRO-BRAZILIAN RELIGIONS AND HEALTH Chapter 5: Health and Healing in Afro-Brazilian Rel igions In Part II, I discussed the ways in which the blac k health epistemic community brings the Brazilian black health agenda into being . In Part III, I examine how health activists from Afro-Brazilian religions establish t he ethnic component of the black health agenda. By bridging their causes, activists from bl ack health movements and from Afro- Brazilian religions co-create the image of an essen tial black body with an essential Afro- Brazilian culture. Within the black health agenda, Afro-Brazilian religion becomes the diacritical marker for Afro-Brazilian ethnicity, an d thus for the black population's cultural difference vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the Brazi lian population. This is a strategic political choice on the part of activists, and does not reflect the diverse demographics of Afro-Brazilian religions. All over Brazil, and part icularly in the southeast, phenotypically white members fill the ranks of Afro-Brazilian reli gious temples ( terreiros ). As I will show, the introduction of race-naturalizing health discourses becomes a significantly divisive factor among health activists from Afro-Br azilian religions. The construction within the black health agenda of black Brazilians as culturally unique reflects a growing trend toward the institut ionalization of multiculturalism in Brazil. 74 The National Health Policy for the Black Population becomes a key part of this process by enjoining the state to recognize Afro-Br azilian religions' healing model as a valid complementary therapeutic system. The Policy also calls for culturally competent medical treatment and health education materials th at reflect the health-related beliefs 74 By \"multiculturalism,\" I mean a state policy that e ndorses the ideology of distinct cultures co-existi ng with a single polity. 175 and practices of Afro-Brazilian religions. Due to t he participatory nature of SUS, members of civil society organizations are largely held responsible for creating this new brand of culturally competent health care. The people whose work I describe in this part of t he dissertation are members of various Afro-Brazilian religions all over Brazil. T hrough diverse life trajectories and pathways, they have become involved in black health activism. Although I refer to \"terreiro health activists\" and \"black health activ ists\" within the dissertation, these are analytical constructs and do not reflect how the ac tivists define themselves. Unlike black health activists, who often refer to themselves as militantes do movimento negro (black movement activists), health activists from terreiro s identify themselves by their ritual post and the divinity or orix\u00e1 to whom they belong. Some ritual posts include ia\u00f4 (female or male initiate who receives divinities), ekede (female initiate who does not receive divinities), ogan (male initiate who does not receive pai-de- santo (priest), iyalorix\u00e1 or m\u00e3e-de-santo (priestess), etc. Thus, for example, a terreiro health activist might introduce herself as \"Silvia, filha (daughter) of Xang\u00f4 and ekede of M\u00e3e L\u00eddia.\" In his study of ritual healing and identity politi cs among the Navajo, Csordas (1999) proposes a three-tiered analytical framework that comprises the following elements: processes of representation between subal tern and dominant societies; internal negotiation among different sectors of the subalter n group; and transformation that occurs within individual members of the subaltern group. I n order to understand terreiro health activists' construction of identity politics based on claims of expertise in ritual healing, it is vital to examine each of these layers. Chapter 6 will focus on activists' external 176 representations of their religiosity and on terreir o members' historical use of ritual healing as a currency for negotiating with elite se ctors of Brazilian society, including the state. Chapter 7 addresses activists' internal nego tiations of racial and ethnic identity. In this chapter, I begin by examining the third layer, individual transformation vis-\u00e0-vis encounters with collective identity politics. First , I provide an overview of Afro-Brazilian religions. Then, I acquaint the reader with my two key informants in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and S\u00e3o Paulo, respectively: M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia and Pai Cesar. The ir stories are meant to help introduce the complex world of Afro-Brazilian religiosity. Fi nally, I describe some of the health- related beliefs and practices of members of Afro-Br azilian religions. Afro-Brazilian Religions: A Brief Background Afro-Brazilian religions are a variety of syncreti c, African-based, spirit- possession religions with diverse pantheons, ritual registers, and ritual practices. Afro- Brazilian religions arose through an amalgamation o f several different African religious systems during the transatlantic slave trade to Bra zil. They are syncretic and comprise elements of Catholicism and Kardecist Spiritism, to varying degrees. While there are many different forms of Afro-Brazilian religion, th e most prominent are Candombl\u00e9, Umbanda, Xang\u00f4, Tambor-de-Mina, and Batuque. Their pantheons and practices vary according to geographic region\u2014although the boundar ies are becoming more tenuous due to migration\u2014and by supposed ethnic origin. Can dombl\u00e9, for instance, is divided 177 into three main ethnic \"nations\" ( na\u00e7\u00f5es ) : Nag\u00f4/Ketu, Angola, and Gege. 75 These are associated with ritual registers based on Yoruba, B antu, and Fon, respectively. 76 The terreiro health activists whom I describe in t his section belonged to Candombl\u00e9 (Ketu, Gege-Nag\u00f4, and Angola nations), Umb anda (traditional and Omoloc\u00f4 nation), and Tambor-de-Mina. In Candombl\u00e9 of the Ke tu or Gege-Nag\u00f4 varieties, initiates receive into their bodies divinities call ed orix\u00e1s (in Angola, they are called nkisis ). In Tambor de Mina they are called voduns . Each orix\u00e1, nkisi, or vodum represents a particular aspect of nature. For instance, Iemanj \u00e1 is associated with the sea. Each divinity is also associated with a specific day of the week, color, number, and so on. Each initiate, in turn, has one principal divinity that is said to preside over his or her head, or ori , as well as two adjunct divinities\u2014one on the left side and one on the right side, so to speak. In Afro-Brazilian religions, the head is the seat of spirituality and the point of entry for communion with the spirit world. Aside from orix\u00e1s/nkisis/voduns, which are African divinities, many initiates of Candombl\u00e9, Umbanda, In standard Brazilian Portuguese, \"caboclo\" designates someone who has mi xed indigenous and Portuguese heritage. It can be somewhat of a derogatory term, since it can also mean a simple or rustic person. In Umbanda and some forms of Candomb l\u00e9, caboclos are portrayed in religious images (i.e., portraits and statues) as t raditional Indian figures who wear feathers. When an initiate receives a caboclo, that spirit usually speaks and/or sings, whereas orix\u00e1s/nkisis/voduns normally utter no more than short calls or sounds. Caboclos 75 Nag\u00f4 and Gege are sometimes combined into a single \"gege-nag\u00f4\" nation . 76 Although Bantu is actually a language family, withi n Afro-Brazilian religions it refers to a ritual re gister for the \"Angola\" nation of Candombl\u00e9. 178 speak \"hillbilly\" Portuguese and often invent words , to the hilarity of terreiro members and attendees. In addition to indigenous-style cabo clos, however, initiates receive a whole range of other spirit figures; although there are stock figures, pantheons vary from terreiro to terreiro. For instance, in Tambor de Mi na, initiates receive caboclos called encantados . Encantados are believed to be the spirits of mort als who entered the spirit realm without having died a physical death. The cat egory of \"encantado\" actually comprises several different sub-categories, such as princesas (princesses), turcos (Turks), and gentis (noblemen). Most of the terreiros I visited in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds were either solely Mina terreiros, or a combination of Mina and Candombl\u00e9. Most of the terreiros I visited in S\u00e3o Paulo, by contrast, practiced Candombl\u00e9. Aside from their ritual and linguistic differences , Afro-Brazilian religions share some common characteristics. They are all spirit po ssession religions with a pantheon of divinities associated with aspects of the natural w orld, and they all have complex ritual features such as intricate ceremonies and periodic ritual obligations that initiates must observe. Members of many Afro-Brazilian religions p ractice animal sacrifice, since blood is believed to be an important source of ax\u00e9 , or life force, which facilitates communion with divinities. Additionally, all Afro-Brazilian r eligious denominations contain significant bodies of therapeutic knowledge that in cludes herbal remedies and ritual healing. Although in recent decades these therapies have begun to be disseminated widely through print media and the internet, in the past they were transmitted verbally from generation to generation by priests and priest esses (Silva 1995). 179 M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia I first visited M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia in July 2006, during th e final games of the World Cup. She was a corpulent woman of fifty-five with deep b rown skin and long braids that were usually pulled back into a bun or ponytail. She was often clad in a brown shapeless shift with the insignia of her employer, mining giant Com panhia Vale do Rio Doce, printed on the right breast. On weekends, however, she would d on a ra\u00e7ao , or a strapless, shapeless white cotton garment held up by a piece of cloth ti ed at the chest. Due to her intense involvement in the local politi cs of black health and terreiro health, M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia was perpetually stressed. She a ngered easily, laughed loudly and often, and had a fiercely protective streak that ap peared whenever one of her family or friends was threatened or hurt. Like other members of Afro-Brazilian religions, M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia drew no line between her ritual family and her biological one. In short, M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia took care of everyone but herself. She batt led diabetes but kept eating sweets and chain-smoking, despite experiencing frequent thirst and urination as well as blurry vision (symptoms of poorly controlled diabetes). She had a lso undergone a hysterectomy several years earlier due to complicated uterine fibroids. Once, when I asked her whether her religion influenced how she treated her own health problems, she chuckled and admitted that she did not practice what she preached. At the same time she lobbied SUS for greater recognition of the terreiros' traditional healing p ractices, M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia used her employee health policy to access private medical care. She e xplained to me that she saw no point in taking up another patient's space within SUS clinic s if she could utilize another source of health care. Rather than using herbal medicine to t reat her diabetes, M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia relied on pharmaceuticals. 180 M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia and her twenty-five year old son, Vice nte, lived in a working-class neighborhood near Cruzeiro do Anil, where her pai-d e-santo's terreiro was located. Vicente's own six-year-old son also lived with them much of the time. The family's wooden house sat at the end of a long street near a wide-open, grassy lot where children sometimes played soccer. Their neighborhood was bot h residential and commercial, and loud serenata music often blared from an informal bar down the st reet. Right next door to their house was a three-story, unfinished brick bui lding that was supposed to have been a private clinic before construction was halted due t o a funding shortage. M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia's two-bedroom house was unkempt and ch aotic; nearly every cent of the wages she earned as a clerical worker went to s upport her religious obligations. She had given up battling the huge nests of termites th at had settled among the exposed wooden rafters of her living room and bedroom. Like most maranhenses (residents of Maranh\u00e3o), M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia was accustomed to living at close quarters with nature. She would calmly watch lizards race up and down her wal ls, devouring the ever-present ants and flies. Her backyard was home to several chicken s, guinea fowl, tortoises, and a constantly barking golden retriever. Her plumbing r arely functioned, but none of this seemed to faze M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia. She would lie in her ha mmock or sit on her faded couches in the living room, smoking cigarettes and talking. Of ten, she would simultaneously watch television or idly accompany the video game her sma ll grandson and his cousins were playing on the screen. M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia had decided several years ago to becom e celibate and devote herself entirely to her religion. M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia did not yet h ave her own terreiro, but was slowly paying the installments on a piece of land she had acquired for that purpose in the nearby 181 municipality of Pa\u00e7o do Lumiar. At the same time, s he was building a two-room brick- and-mortar structure in her backyard where she coul d receive clients during the week and hold meetings with her filhos-de-santo. Until then, she had dedicated a small wooden shed in her front yard as the casa de Exu (the messenger divinity) and used the small room off her front parlor to jogar b\u00fazios (a divination ritual) for clients and to her orix\u00e1 , Oxum. M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia's parents, grandparents, aunts, and un cles all participated in Tambor de Mina, the local variant of Afro-Brazilian religi on in Maranh\u00e3o. Her mother had resisted her own spiritual calling, only dancing in rituals and receiving her caboclos whenever she became very ill with asthma. According to M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia, her mother's asthma would disappear after these rituals, and the n return gradually during the periods that she avoided the terreiro. The young Let\u00edcia al so resisted attending the terreiro, although she experienced periodic unexplained black outs and a generalized sense of anxiety throughout her youth. As a teenager in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, she attended a center for Kardecist Spiritism. She enjoyed studying the doctr ine of reincarnation, but had no reprieve from her symptoms. Eventually, her blackou ts and anxiety became so troublesome that she went to her aunt's Mina terrei ro for spiritual treatment. There, she received caboclo spirits for the first time. She \"d anced\" at, or became a member of, her aunt's terreiro until she moved to Rio de Janeiro w ith her family during the late 1970s, when she was around twenty years old. In Rio, Let\u00edcia stopped attending terreiros and he r spiritual unease returned. Her younger sister was experiencing similar difficultie s; according to Let\u00edcia, since she was not fulfilling her spiritual calling, her spirit en tities would \"grab\" her out of nowhere and 182 leave her to return to consciousness hours or even days later, with no idea of what had transpired. One day, when Let\u00edcia was feeling parti cularly disoriented\u2014she described not being able to feel the ground beneath her feet, as if she were floating\u2014some friends brought her to the Messianic Church. The Messianic Church is actually the Brazilian branch of the Church of World Messianity, a Japanes e religion founded in the 1930s. Using their hands, qualified members strive to heal others by emanating \"divine light\" or johrei into the person's energy field. When a few members applied this treatment to Let\u00edcia, she blacked out. When she awoke later in t he Minister's chambers, he diagnosed spiritual illness and prescribed regular johrei treatments at her home. Let\u00edcia had the treatments and became involved with the Church for some time. In 1984, she moved back to S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and joined the vibrant black movement that had formed there. She described herself prior to he r entry into the movement as a \"poor bourgeoise.\" She was working three jobs and focused on making money, rarely pausing to think about social inequalities. When she return ed to Maranh\u00e3o after several years of absence, however, she was struck by the grinding po verty of the mostly black and brown population, which she had forgotten during her year s in Rio. That shock led her to join the local black movement, where she acquired a new perspective on the ways in which racism structured social inequality. One day, she and fellow activists from the Black C ulture Center of Maranh\u00e3o (Centro de Cultura Negra or a famed ter reiro called Casa Fanti Ashanti. It had begun solely as a Tambor de Mina terreiro, but after its pai-de-santo became initiated into Candombl\u00e9, he built a separate barrac\u00e3o (ceremonial house) for Candombl\u00e9 rituals. Let\u00edcia began to visit the terreiro more regularly, and on one of these visits she first 183 received the divinity Oxum. She recalled feeling de vastated when she awoke from her trance and discovered that she would need to become initiated into Candombl\u00e9. From her family's experience within Afro-Brazilian religions , she had learned that one had to devote one's life to the spirit entities, or suffer the consequences. Reluctantly but obediently, Let\u00edcia became initiated into Candombl\u00e9 at Casa Fanti Ashanti. Seven years later, she received her dek\u00e1 , a ritual step that confers the ability to initiat e others, and became M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia. During my fieldwork in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, I saw M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia at least once per week, either at her home or at one of the many social movement a ctivities with which she was involved. I often attended religious ceremonies at Casa Fanti Ashanti, as well as at the fam\u00edlia-de-santo (\"saint family,\" or initiates Casa Fanti-Ashanti). At these rituals, which routinely l asted all night long, I would wear all white and sit with the assist\u00eancia or audience, listening to the drumming and sung prayers in Yoruba or Portuguese (depending on wheth er the ritual was Candombl\u00e9 or Tambor de Mina). We would watch the filhos dance in a circle until most of them received their spirit entities, and then we would w atch the spirit entities dance. After the ritual, I would either sleep at the terreiro or, if I was lucky, hitch a shared taxi ride home with other people who had attended the ritual. For the annual festival honoring M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia's Oxum, I stayed at the terreiro for most o f the weekend and helped with the preparatory work\u2014e.g., washing clay dishes and pots at an outdoor sink, \"catando\" or removing the bugs and pebbles from dry beans and co rn, and sweeping the kitchen floor. That December weekend was the point at which I felt most integrated into the bustling life of the terreiro. 184 Gradually, her close friends and filhos-de-santo, and Let\u00edcia herself, began to describe me as Let\u00edcia's \"filha\" (daughter, or init iate within Afro-Brazilian religions). I actually went through the initial ritual steps towa rd becoming her filha, although we both knew that I would have to leave S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds at the end of the year. I started with a ritual divination ceremony known as the jogo de b\u00fazios , and eventually went through an eb\u00f3 , or ceremony in which ritual foods are offered to one's orix\u00e1s. I received a fio de contas (string of the ix\u00e1, Oxum, on it. M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia even me to accompany her and some irm\u00e3os-de-santo (\"saint brothers/sisters\") on a trip to the Bahian island of Itaparica, to attend t he centuries-old egungun ancestor rituals. Within Candombl\u00e9, egunguns are the spirit figures o f collective family ancestors who have passed on. Whereas orix\u00e1s are mythical spirit entities associated with the natural elements, egunguns are anonymous representations of ordinary mortals who walked the earth before passing into the orun , or afterlife. The egungun rituals are secretive, and I could only enter as M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia's filha. This is ju st one example of the many ways in which M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia welcomed me into her life. Pai Cesar When I arrived in S\u00e3o Paulo in mid-2008, Pai Cesar was a fiery activist whose schedule of political meetings and events left me d izzy. He identified as negro , which was not surprising given his dark brown skin and un equivocally African features. His tall, solid build and firm, frank manner of speaking ampl ified his imposing presence. At age thirty, Pai Cesar was one year younger than me, but he always seemed much older due to his considerable accomplishments and responsibiliti es. 185 Pai Cesar grew up in a working-class neighborhood of S\u00e3o Paulo's zona norte . his grandmoth er's terreiro located right overhead the family's home. When he was a child, he suffered from kidney problems and from a generalized feeling of restlessness and anxiety. Fr om an early age, Pai Cesar was a wanderer; he left his family home as a young teenag er and moved from terreiro to terreiro, being cared for by the pais- and m\u00e3es-de- santo at each one. Pai Cesar interpreted his kidney problems as \"a mo tive to reaffirm my commitment to my ancestors\" through participation i n Afro-Brazilian religion. He became a ia\u00f4 , or initiate, at age seven. Around age fifteen, he received his dek\u00e1, which authorized him to initiate his own filhos-de-santo. This is an unusually young age for someone to become a pai-de-santo; in fact, Pai Cesa r recalls that he was somewhat renowned within the S\u00e3o Paulo Candombl\u00e9 community a t that time for being the youngest pai-de-santo. Again, health concerns motiv ated his decision to perform the dek\u00e1 at such a young age. Ia\u00f4s are supposed to undergo t his ritual obligation exactly seven years following their initiation. Pai Cesar was lat e, however, and his health problems were growing steadily worse. According to him, his worsening health was a sign from the orix\u00e1s that he urgently needed to perform the cerem ony. He describes his condition around the time of his dek\u00e1: I was limping from kidney disease, because the doct or couldn't cure me, the medication wasn't working anymore, and I was becomi ng addicted to Voltaren. I was becoming famous in the [public] cli nic, but they weren't helping me and I was so swollen my clothes didn't f it....Sometimes I managed to walk normally, sometimes I walked kind o f dragging my feet. All because of my kidneys and circulation. 186 It is not clear exactly what kind of kidney and ci rculation problems Pai Cesar was experiencing. He was probably medicating himself, b ecause Voltaren is a prescription- strength NSAID, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, that is available over the counter in Brazil and is contraindicated for patien ts with kidney problems. However, these details are less important than Pai Cesar's i nterpretation of his illness and its cause (his own failure to fulfill ritual obligations). Pa i Cesar's orix\u00e1 is Oxaguian, and according to Candombl\u00e9 cosmology, Oxaguian's are vul nerable to kidney problems. Members of Afro-Brazilian religions believe that il lnesses occur due to a loss of spiritual, mental, and/or physical equilibrium ( equil\u00edbrio ). Such a loss can occur through an initiate's neglect of his or her relationship with the orix\u00e1. To this day, when something is wrong, Pai Cesar claims he can feel his kidney pain returning. If he does not jogar b\u00fazios to check in with his orix\u00e1, his kidneys begin to th rob as if his heart has taken up residence there. Pai Cesar dropped out of high school early on and worked his way up from a delivery boy to a cook for the supermarket chain P\u00e3 o de A\u00e7ucar. Around age twenty, in response to the AIDS-related deaths of several of h is initiates, he became an activist for HIV/AIDS prevention within Afro-Brazilian religions . He also began to attend black movement meetings, which had a profound effect on t he way he viewed racial dynamics. Prior to his involvement with the movement, he had never been aware that racism existed. Growing up in the zona norte , he told me, children and families of all colors lived, worked, and played together. After attending black movement meetings, however, Pai Cesar began to re-interpret the circumstances o f his own life. He came to see his disagreements with white supervisors as tinged with racial prejudice. He noticed that in 187 the terreiros he attended, filhos-de-santo with dar ker skin were often in charge of behind- the-scenes \"dirty\" work, such as killing animals fo r ritual sacrifice, while whites did less work and were often given more prestigious ritual p osts. When I met him in 2008, Pai Cesar was working at t he office of a state Representative ( deputado ) from the Worker's Party who spoke out against the religious intolerance suffered by members of Afro-Brazilian r eligions. He lived in a cramped kitchenette located in the center of S\u00e3o Paulo. He had neither the time, nor the financial means to have his own terreiro, but he presided ove r the terreiro of a fellow pai-de-santo who had suffered a stroke and was on extended conva lescence. At the beginning of my fieldwork, Pai Cesar always wore ritual clothing. T his consisted of a dashiki with loose, white linen pants; a pano , or length of printed fabric, thrown over one shou lder; and a long string of heavy, wooden beads that he was cons tantly tugging backwards so that they hung down the slope of his back as well as his chest. Most of our deeper conversations took place at Caf \u00e9 Vermont, his favorite LGBT barzinho in downtown S\u00e3o Paulo, where he smoked tobacco fro m a pipe and downed espresso after espresso. He often observed that his love of cappuccino and lasagna did not fit the image of a traditional pai-de-santo. After all, a pai-de-santo was supposed to eat African foods with his hands, his bare feet planted firmly on the beaten-earth floor of his terreiro. By contrast, Pai Cesar identified strongl y with the concrete and the skyscrapers, the frantic pace, and the tangled ethnic spaghetti of S\u00e3o Paulo. He was constantly attending meetings, writing manuscripts, and making Skype calls to Bras\u00edlia from his laptop. Once, he even gave a virtual lecture on HIV /AIDS prevention in Second Life. S\u00e3o Paulo's STD/AIDS Program maintained an HIV educatio n center in the virtual interface, 188 and in December 2008 the director invited Pai Cesar to create an avatar and deliver a lecture to other people's avatars about HIV prevent ion in terreiros. So much for the image of the elderly pai-de-santo passing down secr et knowledge to generations of filhos from his high-backed wicker chair! Although Pai Cesar had not quite finished high sch ool, he was an autodidact, and his knowledge of anthropological and sociological t exts on race in Brazil and Afro- Brazilian religions was superior to my own. Despite his biting criticism of what he viewed as inaccurate and essentializing anthropolog ical discourses on Afro-Brazilian religions, Pai Cesar agreed to let me shadow him. H e often jokingly referred to me during meetings as his anjo da guarda (guardian angel)\u2014more for my ubiquitous presence t han for any concrete form of assistance I may have prov ided him. In January 2009, Pai Cesar accepted a technical ap pointment at the S\u00e3o Paulo Municipal Health Department. Over the years, he had established ties with the AIDS Program through his participation in the AIDS Commi ssion and other participatory citizen councils related to HIV/AIDS and black heal th policy. Although he suspected he was a token hire that allowed the Program to boast of its equitable employment practices and tolerant attitude toward members of Afro-Brazil ian religions, he took the job in the hopes of continuing to pursue his ideals from withi n the system. Pai Cesar's transformation from activist to state employee was abrupt and remarkable. His African-style clothing gave way to more mainstream slacks or jeans and dress shirts or T-shirts. Although he still wore hi s beads most of the time, his pano disappeared. He was forced to give up many of his a ctivist involvements and, as a result, many AIDS activists labeled him a sell-out. Pai Ces ar countered, however, that his 189 motive for taking the job at the AIDS program was s elf-preservation; he needed to earn a living: I won't exchange my abad\u00e1 [religious garment] for a suit, but my closet needs to have both of them. My place of work is the terreiro. I put a [white] cloth on the table and wear white on Fridays. But I 'm practical, and I'll do what I need to in order to get along [in society]. As he felt the anchor of his former identity slippi ng away, however, he decided to live full-time in his former terreiro in Perus, a remote area on the northeast periphery of S\u00e3o Paulo. By the time I left S\u00e3o Paulo in August 2009, he had reduced his activist commitments considerably, although he was still inv olved in black health and terreiro health movements. Healing in Afro-Brazilian Religions Healing rituals take many forms within Afro-Braz ilian religiosity. They can be collective, personal, or client-based. They can ari se from programmed celebrations of health-related orix\u00e1s, or visits from a healing caboclo that the pai- or m\u00e3e-de-santo receives with or without prior notice. Alternativel y, they can consist simply of taking ritually prescribed herbs and perhaps reciting some sung prayers to specific orix\u00e1s. As shown in the cases of M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia and Pai Cesar, co nversion to an Afro-Brazilian religion represents, in itself, a significant mode of spirit ual and, often, physical healing. After making a religious commitment to one's orix\u00e1 s, devotees must maintain constant vigilance over their health. This is becau se, as Pai Cesar explained, the body is the primary medium through which the spirit communi cates. In addition to interpreting manifestations of illness as signs that something i s amiss in one's relationship to his or 190 her orix\u00e1, members of Afro-Brazilian religions must follow a number of preventive measures to preserve their bodies as adequate vesse ls for spirits to enter. The terreiro health activists I came to know over the course of fieldwork spoke frequently of the various foods they had to avoid; they call these kisilas . For instance, Pai Ger\u00f4nimo, a S\u00e3o Paulo Candombl\u00e9 priest, never eats honey. For him and other children of Ox\u00f3ssi, the orix\u00e1 of forests and hunting, honey is a ritually proscribed food; if he eats it, he ends up with diarrhea and indigestion. Addit ionally, according to Pai Ger\u00f4nimo, eating pathways\" ( fechar meus caminhos ) or interfere with his daily objectives, as well as disrupting his communi cation with Ox\u00f3ssi. The same consequences apply if he eats pork in August, becau se the particular \"quality\" (qualidade ) or type of Ox\u00f3ssi that he receives is related to the orix\u00e1 Omolu. Omolu, also known as Obaluaiy\u00ea, is the orix\u00e1 of epidemics, and his ritual month is August. Pork is a kisila for children of Omolu. As a child of Oxum, M\u00e3e Let\u00ed cia could eat fish with scales, but had to avoid fish with smooth skin ( peixe de couro ). Whenever I brought whole fish to her house for our lunch, I would have to be care ful not to buy a smooth-skinned variety. Similarly, Pai Cesar could not eat the Bah ian cuisine he adored because of its main ingredient\u2014palm oil, or dend\u00ea . His orix\u00e1, Oxaguian (a quality of Oxal\u00e1), preferr ed white foods and abhorred the thick, red palm oil. P ai Edson, another Candombl\u00e9 priest in S\u00e3o Paulo, had to avoid ground-growing fruits a nd vegetables ( comidas rasteiras ) because he belonged to Obaluaiy\u00ea, who is associated with the earth (and more specifically with returning to the earth upon death ). Ingesting foods such as watermelon or pumpkin, he said, could land him in the hospital . 191 In addition to observing kisilas, devotees of Afro -Brazilian religions must pay careful attention to certain areas of the body that they believe are particularly vulnerable in children of certain orix\u00e1s. For example, childre n of Oxal\u00e1 are believed to have problems in their kidneys (like Pai Cesar) and bone s. Children of Xang\u00f4 are thought to be especially prone to coronary problems. Obaluaiy\u00ea is associated with contagious diseases such as smallpox, AIDS, and leprosy, and members of Afro-Brazilian religions believe his children are more at risk for developing these illnesses. As in Pai Cesar's story, the manifestation of a particular health problem can be an early sign of one's vocation as a filho of the corresponding orix\u00e1. One night, as we were riding home on the bus, M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia's filho-de-santo Jorge told me he had first come to the terreiro in search of healing for Hansen's disease (leprosy). He seemed a bit ashamed to tell me he ha d suffered from hansen\u00edase , because the disease is still highly stigmatized in Brazil; as in other places around the world, it is associated with poverty and contagion. As Jorge bec ame more involved in Afro-Brazilian religion, he discovered he was a devotee of Obaluai y\u00ea. When he accepted his religious vocation and began to fulfill his ritual obligation s to the orix\u00e1, his symptoms dissipated. At the time of my fieldwork, Jorge was an accomplis hed choreographer and dancer. Sometime after our conversation, I witnessed Jorge incorporating Obaluaiy\u00ea during a ceremony at M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia's house. Immediately, he fe ll to the ground and curled into the fetal position with his muscles twitching and his h ands gnarled up like claws. Subsequently, I saw many devotees of Obaluaiy\u00ea assu me this position when they received the spirit. My informants explained that t he posture represents affliction with 192 advanced leprosy, when the limbs curl in on themsel ves and the appendages dissolve into the body. Due to their association with certain parts of the body, orix\u00e1s have the power not only to harm, but also to heal. For instance, Oxum, the orix\u00e1 responsible for fertility, is associated with the uterus and ovaries. When a woma n has trouble conceiving, or any other gynecological problem for that matter, she ca n make a ritual offering to Oxum and obtain healing, regardless of whether she is a devo tee of the orix\u00e1. Iemanj\u00e1, orix\u00e1 of the ocean and ruler of the ori (head), is linked to mental health issues. Ian\u00e7\u00e3, t he orix\u00e1 of the wind, is associated with respiratory illnesses. Whe n devotees (and their clients) suffer from these afflictions, they often seek healing by making a special offering to an orix\u00e1. They call this offering an eb\u00f3 . During my time in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, I dealt with a recalci trant chronic pain problem. M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia performed the jogo de b\u00fazios to discover wh ether my illness had originated from spiritual or organic factors. The b\u00fazios indicated that my problem was medical, and M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia recommended I see a doctor. When I replied that I had seen many, to no avail, she offered to perform an eb\u00f3 de sa\u00fade (health eb\u00f3). She instructed me to buy several ingredients, including dry white corn, popcorn kern els, white \"seven-day\" candles, cornstarch, coconut milk, condensed milk, and sever al different plants and herbs. As Pai Ger\u00f4nimo later explained to me, eb\u00f3s de sa\u00fade utili ze white foods because Candombl\u00e9 devotees believe they fortify the body. According t o him, eb\u00f3s de sa\u00fade are not meant to cure a medical problem, but rather to \"strengthen\" the individual and help his or her doctor discover the root of the problem. 193 The day of the eb\u00f3, I wore a lilac flowered skirt and a white tank top. I also brought a white dress, as M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia had instructe d me to do. When I arrived at her house, M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia gave the materials to her housek eeper Juliana and instructed her to make the \"comida de Iemanj\u00e1\" (Iemanj\u00e1's food). Alth ough Juliana did not practice Candombl\u00e9, she had learned to prepare ritual foods in the decade she had worked for M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia. I also learned to prepare several of them, since I participated in monthly rituals with M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia and her filhos-de-santo . \"Iemanj\u00e1's food\" is corn pudding. M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia had chosen Iemanj\u00e1's food beca use she had discovered during a jogo de b\u00fazios that I was a filha de Iemanj\u00e1 (daughter of Iemanj\u00e1). Juliana used the white corn to make aca\u00e7\u00e1 , a grainier, insipid paste wrapped in a banana lea f. Aca\u00e7\u00e1 accompanies all food offerings to orix\u00e1s, since pra ctitioners believe that all orix\u00e1s eat it. She then popped the popcorn and placed it in a bowl . Popcorn, explained M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia, is for limpeza (cleansing) and represents doen\u00e7a e sa\u00fade (illness and health). At this point, M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia instructed me to stop asking questions, and to remain quiet for the remainder of the ritual. Next, M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia took the herbs I had brought and crushed them into a bowl, simultaneously singing in Yoruba. She enlisted Juli ana's help to grind some of the leaves in a blender with water, then strained them and add ed them to the bowl. Together, she and Juliana made two large batches of pungent, swee t-smelling banho (an herbal bath). Then, M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia ripped off three sections of news paper and filled them with p\u00f3lvora , which is a black flammable powder. Finally, she bro ke up chunks of pungent charcoal and filled her rustic defumador (censer). 194 M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia led me out to her large, grassy backya rd. First, she had me remove my bra and underwear so they would not get wet. She stood in front of me, waved some long-leaved herbs around me, and brushed them down my outstretched hands and upturned palms. All the while, she prayed to the or ix\u00e1s in Portuguese, asking them to make me healthy. Then, she poured white corn over m y head, followed by popcorn. Her tortoises ( jabotis ) became excited and ambled over to eat the fallen corn. All the while, M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia's golden retriever, perpetually tied up near the back door, barked; she grumpily scolded him. Next, she instructed me to ju mp up and down three times, then forward. After I did so, she made me repeat it, tel ling me to jump higher this time. Finally, she took a broom and swept up the fallen f ood from the ground, disappointing the jabotis. Next, M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia and I walked over to her outdoor concrete laundry area, complete with a large washing tub, a ridged washboa rd, a spigot, and a rustic showerhead mounted on the wall. She had me kneel down in front of her, then proceeded to bathe me with the dark green banho. She poured it over my he ad, rubbed it down my shirt and over my breasts, then lifted my shirt and rubbed it onto my stomach. All the while, she prayed to the orix\u00e1s in Portuguese. After she finished bat hing me, M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia directed me to wash myself off first with water, then with the rem aining banho that she had placed on the laundry counter in a plastic two-liter soda bot tle with the top cut off. I stripped off my clothing, feeling slightly self-conscious. M\u00e3e Let\u00ed cia took my fio de contas and dropped them into the bottle of banho. As I bathed myself, M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia went inside to get my white dress. She brought it out and hung it on the clothesline with my white bra. I reminded her that I had worn that bra on the street that day (which usually renders 195 clothing inappropriate for ritual use), but M\u00e3e Let \u00edcia said it was OK, as long as I did not put on the same underwear I had worn in the street. She waved her defumador around my clothing to purify it as she spoke. Next, she had me squat down in front of her and rubbed more banho on my body, concentrating especially on the area afflicted by pain. Afterward, she told me to rub the green droplets of f my body and to don the white dress. I wiped off my skin as best I could, and wrung out my hair, but when I put on my dress there were still tiny green rivulets flowing from m y hair down onto my chest and staining the front of my dress. I could smell the sweet scen t of the herbs on my skin and in my hair. M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia then instructed me to stand on the con crete sidewalk leading up to the front patio. She placed one piece of balled-up news paper on my left, one on my right, and one in front of me. She then lit each of them one b y one, and told me to jump three times as each ball exploded, then to rub my hands over my limbs and torso in order to brush away all negativity. She lit the defumador and wave d it all around me, directing me to \"bathe\" myself with the smoke. When that was finish ed, we returned to the kitchen and M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia had me sit on a small stool ( banquinho ) in front of the table. She rubbed a fragrant stone on top of my head and behind each ea r, praying aloud all the while. Then, she took red, sweet-smelling liquid from a tiny bot tle and drew crosses with it on my chest and back. I bowed my head to inhale the scent , and M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia commented wryly, \"this stuff is better than French perfume!\" After t his part of the ritual was finished, she led me into a small room off the front door, to the left. This was her \"saints' room\" (quarto do santo ), where she conducted her monthly rituals. It was filled from floor to ceiling with yellow candles for Oxum, and wax and c eramic figurines and portraits of 196 various orix\u00e1s. There were also several altars with ritual objects, such as baskets of eggs (once again, a symbol of Oxum) and stones. The door leading from the room out into the living room remained closed at all times. Several candles were burning in the saints' room a s we entered. M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia placed the bowl containing Oxal\u00e1's food on my right , and the bowl of popcorn on my left. I held the bowl of Iemanj\u00e1's food, and M\u00e3e Le t\u00edcia told me to set it down and then pick it up again three times, slowly. After the thi rd time, she clapped with cupped hands a 3-7-3 sequence three times, as Candombl\u00e9 members of ten do to mark communion with the deities during rituals. She then told me in a k ind voice, \"it's up to you now\" ( agora \u00e9 com voc\u00ea ) and directed me to sit on the floor in front of t he bowls. She placed a white seven-day candle in front of the bowls and then pou red honey over each of the bowls, telling me to ask Oxal\u00e1 and Orixal\u00e1 (the supreme Ca ndombl\u00e9 deity) to bring me health \"and a great love, because this is important too.\" She lit two sticks of white-rose scented incense and then closed the door, leaving me alone to pray in silence for the next hour. ***** In addition to healing rituals like the one descri bed above, practitioners of Afro- Brazilian religions also rely upon medicinal plants to help resolve health problems. I met no one, however, who relied exclusively on ritual h ealing ( or meizinhas ) to get well. Rather, these were complementary measures to biomedical tre atment. When I asked M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia whether she relied more on biomedicine or herbal me dicine from her religion to treat her own illnesses, she replied: 197 It's funny....We [members of Afro-Brazilian religio ns] go to the doctor more often than we use our own secular tradition of maki ng herbal teas...We usually take medication from the doctor. We dope ou rselves up with pills....In the old days there was no doctor, so naturally peop le healed themselves with herbs and leaves....We also go more often to the do ctor because of the exams they do, their diagnoses. You have more options...t o see what kind of problem [you have]. So, due to the diseases that we have today, that are very different from the diseases of the past\u2014there are l ots of diseases today that need a more precise diagnosis. Not that the spirits don't have knowledge. They do. But it's simple compared to today's advanc ed medicine. In this part of our interview, M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia struggl ed with the issue of authenticity and tradition versus practicality and rationality g iven the present context. In her study of Australian multiculturalism, Povinelli (2002) exami nes Aborigines' internal battles with similar issues. She argues that \"multicultural domi nation\" works \"by inspiring subaltern and minority subjects to identify with the impossib le object of an authentic self-identity\" (6). Similarly, in order to garner special recognit ion as a traditional group from the state, members of Afro-Brazilian religions (and other \"tra ditional populations,\" as they are called in Brazil) have to perform a certain kind of identity that has been deemed authentic. In the case of Afro-Brazilian religions, members perform this identity by wearing sacred clothing at public meetings and even ts, displaying their knowledge of medicinal herbs, and generally showing state offici als that they are the authentic custodians of a vital piece of Brazil's cultural hi story that merits promotion and preservation. These, however, are public performanc es; on their own time, M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia and other terreiro health activists availed themsel ves of pharmaceuticals to treat their illnesses. Although terreiro health activists in both S\u00e3o Lu\u00ed s and S\u00e3o Paulo spoke frequently about Afro-Brazilian religions' unique and effectiv e corpus of traditional medical 198 knowledge, I observed terreiro members utilizing he rb-based medicine much more often in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds than in S\u00e3o Paulo. This was not surpris ing, given the drastically different lifestyles and socioeconomic conditions of the terr eiro members I met in each city. In S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, many of the plants needed to make herbal reme dies were readily available near the terreiros; due to the humid climate and incomplete urbanization, they were literally growing everywhere. In S\u00e3o Paulo, by contrast, wher e concrete dominated the landscape and terreiros rarely had space for gardens, it was more difficult and expensive to find the right ingredients for herbal concoctions. During my time in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, several terreiro leade rs (e.g., pais- or m\u00e3es-de-santo) and their caboclos offered me herbal remedies for m y chronic pain condition. They would give me a list of herbal ingredients to buy, I woul d bring the ingredients to the terreiro on a specified day, and then I would leave with a smel ly potion and detailed instructions for how and when to imbibe it. Although none of the pot ions resolved my problem, the process helped me to learn about the folk pharmacol ogy practiced in terreiros. Many terreiros grew herbal ingredients in their gardens, and their leaders took great pride in showing me the various plants. Additionally, many p ais- and m\u00e3es-de-santo in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds held public healing services for clients once a wee k or so, and I often attended these sessions in order to observe how healing worked in the various Afro-Brazilian religious traditions present in the city. As I mentioned before, Tambor-de-Mina dominates th e religious landscape in Maranh\u00e3o. Mina terreiros, however, tend to be highl y syncretic, incorporating elements of Catholicism and a local religious tradition call ed pajelan\u00e7a . Since Pajelan\u00e7a is primarily concerned with ritual healing, participan ts usually refer to it simply as \"cura\" 199 (cure). It comprises ritual elements from indigenou s religions and Catholicism. Pajelan\u00e7a and Mina rituals often take place on different days within the same terreiros. Mina rituals are structurally similar to those of more character istically \"African\"-based religions, such as Candombl\u00e9. They consist of members dancing aroun d the terreiro in a circle to drum beats, receiving their spirits and then dancing in distinctive ways individually, depending on the spiritual entity they have \"incorporated.\" T he main differences between Candombl\u00e9 and Mina, at least to the casual observer , are the different ritual languages used in each (a Yoruba-based ritual register in Can dombl\u00e9, and a Fon-based one and Portuguese, in Mina); the absence of elaborate ritu al costumes in Mina; distinctive rhythmic structures and instruments used in ritual drumming; and the greater presence of Catholic elements in Mina ritual practice. Meanwhile, the Pajelan\u00e7a ritual centers on passagem , in which the terreiro leader receives a number of different spirit entities in r elatively quick succession. Each transition is marked by the terreiro leader trembli ng, eyes closed, and frantically rattling a maraca. Some spirit entities stay a longer time tha n others, and each one has a particular personality. They can include many of the same type s of entities from the Mina pantheon, such as caboclos and encantados; but pajelan\u00e7a ofte n includes animal spirits, while Mina does not. The spirit entities in Pajelan\u00e7a are ofte n comedic, and thus provide great enjoyment for the clients waiting to consult with t hem. As I mentioned earlier in the chapter, caboclos use rustic Portuguese and invent curious names for common items. For example, they often refer to coffee as \"\u00e1gua preta\" or black water. They might call a telephone a \"fuxicador\" in reference to a popular t erm in Northeast Brazil for chatting or gossiping, \"fuxicar.\" Since caboclos are illiterate , they rely on a terreiro member 200 (appointed by the terreiro leader prior to his or h er trance) to write down the ritual prescriptions they dictate after examining clients. During healing sessions, caboclos tend to drink a great deal of sugarcane rum ( cacha\u00e7a ) and smoke lots of cigars. Terreiro leaders often point out, apparently to bolster thei r credibility, that they suffer no ill effects from their caboclos' many hours of drinking and smo king, even though they do not drink or smoke when \"unincorporated\" or without a spirit entity inside their body ( puro/a ). During Pajelan\u00e7a sessions, caboclos would often ca ll me over to watch what they were doing to clients, stating that I needed to see it in order to believe that their healing was authentic. Often, the caboclo would begin by wa lking around the client, blowing cigar smoke all around him or her. After asking the client questions about his or her health problem, the caboclo would often place his m outh on the afflicted body part and suck the skin, as though trying to extract somethin g. Then, the caboclo would straighten up and start gagging, eventually vomiting something into an outstretched bowl or jar held by filho-de-santo. Sometimes this would be a green liquid, while other times it was some noxious object. In the sessions I witnessed, I saw caboclos regurgitate everything from nails to spiders to centipedes ( lacraias ). Sometimes, the caboclo would stand with his back to the client's back, link his elbows through the client's, and then lift him or her up into the air, jumping a few times. Jumping is impor tant in healing rituals from Candombl\u00e9 to Umbanda to Pajelan\u00e7a because it repres ents a liminal state between the ground and the sky, both of which are sacred in Afr o-Brazilian religions. To achieve healing, the client must pass metaphorically from a state of sickness to a state of health, and the sess\u00e3o de cura (healing session) occupies the liminal space betwee n the two. The 201 same applies to the caboclo, who hangs suspended be tween the spirit world, where he resides, and his temporary presence in the human re alm. ***** The examples of individual healing considered abov e rely on the healer-client dyad and address specific health concerns. Besides these individual healing practices, collective and more generalized health-related ritu als also constitute a central part of Afro-Brazilian religiosity. These are usually preve ntive in nature, and tend to pay homage to the orix\u00e1 Obaluaiy\u00ea/Omolu, also known as the vodum Akossi in Tambor de Mina. Rituals for Obaluaiy\u00ea usually take place during the month of August in Candombl\u00e9, whereas Mina terreiros often celebrate Akossi in Ma y. In May 2008, I attended a multi- day ritual for Akossi at the terreiro of Pai Juninh o in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds. It began with a late-night public ceremony on May 29. The filhos-de-santo dres sed in white clothing and danced in a large roda (circle) to the rhythm of abat\u00e1 drums (tall drums with cowhide stretched over the top, laid down horizontally and beaten wit h the hands). As the filhos began to receive Akossi, they dropped to the ground and assu med contorted postures, their limbs trembling in continuous spasm and their hands gnarl ed like claws. An attendant went around covering the body of each incorporated ( incorporado ) filho with a white cloth. I was only allowed to photograph them while they were covered, although no one could explain exactly why this was the case. Normally, I w as not only permitted, but actually encouraged to take pictures of incorporated filhos- de-santo. This was only the case in Mina terreiros, however; in Candombl\u00e9 terreiros, at Mina terreiros would pose gracio usly for my camera, then request a framed portrait of themselves. 202 Akossi, by contrast, seemed to provoke a mixture o f adoration and fear in members of the terreiros I visited. M\u00e3e Let\u00edcia exp lained to me once that this was because Akossi/Obaluaiy\u00ea represents not only protec tion from illness, but also suffering and death. He is thus a liminal figure, neither her e nor there. In many Afro-Brazilian religious traditions, he is associated with the spi rit ancestors ( egunguns ), who are also simultaneously feared and revered due to their \"bet wixt and between\" status; according to practitioners, egunguns lived on the earth one day, but are now part of the spirit world. In this respect, they are different from orix\u00e1s and vo duns, who always resided in the spirit realm. The second day of the Akossi celebration began at noon with a large banquet for a group of dogs. The banquet took place in the terrei ro's front room, which had been set up with long tables bearing figurines of Saint Lazarus and large clay bowls of popcorn. Dogs are Akossi's symbolic animal due to his association with Saint Lazarus, the figure portrayed within Catholic imagery as a beggar/leper , accompanied by a dog that is licking his leg wounds. Since Akossi plays such a central r ole in Tambor-de-Mina, terreiros often treat dogs with special reverence. I visited many M ina terreiros in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds where dogs had the run of the house. They frolicked about the various saints' rooms, in addition to areas from which they would normally be banned with in Brazilian households, such as the kitchen. After the dogs finished their meal tha t day, the human guests were allowed to eat (children were served before adults). That day, the filhos-de-santo were dressed in yell ow and white, which are Akossi's ritual colors. The feasting gave way to an other roda with drumming, similar to the previous night, in which filhos received Akossi and were draped with white cloth 203 sheets so that, I was told, we would not see their \"ugliness.\" The white cloth used in Tambor-de-Mina corresponds to the head-to-toe costu me of straw worn by filhos-de- santo Obaluaiy\u00ea in Candombl\u00e9 terreiros. In Candombl\u00e9 lore, Obaluaiy\u00ea is said to have contracted smallpox as a child. As a r esult, he was left with lesions so disgusting that even his mother, Iemanj\u00e1, could not lay eyes on him. Thereafter, he always wore straw to cover his deformity. The third and final day of the Akossi ritual at Pa i Juninho's house featured a procession from the terreiro to the small leprosy h ospital located about a mile away, down by the inlet. The air was hot and heavy that d ay, and the sky was pregnant with rain clouds. We set off for the clinic around ten o'cloc k that morning, May 31, in a long line of about thirty people. We wore yellow and white, a nd many people carried umbrellas to shield themselves against the unrelenting sun. We c arried bowls of food and cakes for the patients at the clinic, and the abatezeiros beat their drums while the filhos-de-santo sung prayers to Akossi. When we reached the hospital, th e staff was expecting us; this ritual had become a neighborhood tradition. They helped us bring in the food and set up the large cake bearing the words \"S\u00e3o L\u00e1zaro\" on the fr ont. Then, they led us to the patient wards where we visited men and women of all ages, i n advanced stages of deformity from the disease, who were lying in beds or sitting up in wheelchairs. Most had gnarled hands and feet with missing digits; some were also missing noses or lips. These were inpatients from distant towns in rural Maranh\u00e3o who were forced to reside at the hospital because they had no access to adequate treatment at home. Over the years, a village of patients and their families had grown up around the hospital. The terreiro members made 204 a point of hugging the patients and holding their h ands, so I followed suit. The patients seemed quite happy to receive our visit. After about an hour, we left the hospital and retu rned along the same red, dusty path from whence we had come. On the way back, we s topped at the Bonfim Cemetery, where Pai Juninho jumped over the locked gate and t hen had a filho hand over a bowl of Akossi's ritual food. Pai Juninho placed part of th e food offering on top of a tombstone, then wiped off his hands and feet (later I would le arn that this symbolized the dusting off of negative energy). Next, he placed the bowl on top of his head and disappeared from sight among the concrete slabs. Cemeteries are symb olically associated with Akossi and Obaluaiy\u00ea due to the deity's connection with sickne ss and death. As we waited for Pai Juninho to return, three filh os (two women and a man) suddenly received Akossi and fell to the ground, wr ithing. As the vodum arrived, people called out his ritual greeting, \"Atot\u00f4!\" One of the filhas grunted repeatedly, while the filho lay completely stiff and unblinking, as if ca tatonic. Just then, Pai Juninho climbed back over the gate with help from his filhos. He \"s uspended\" ( suspendeu ) or dispatched Akossi to the spirit realm by placing his hands ove r the head of each filho-de-santo who had received the spirit, and then incanting a few w ords. As he did this, the filhos returned to normal and got up, blinking dazedly. Next, Pai Ju ninho picked up a bowl of popcorn and tossed handfuls of it over all of our heads whi le pronouncing words in the ritual Fon register used in Tambor de Mina. Several minutes later, we all exited the cemetery y ard, walking backwards to protect ourselves from the dangerous energy of the eguns. Back at the terreiro, the ritual concluded with Catholic prayers and hymns. The filh os-de-santo sat in a large circle on 205 the tiled floor of the barrac\u00e3o , the enormous room where public ceremonies took pl ace. The terreiro's many resident dogs circulated freely among the filhos and the community members who lined the edges of the room, singing al ong with the filhos. During the prayers, a couple of filhas received Akossi again, but an attendant quickly \"suspended\" the spirit by placing a white cloth over each of th em and pronouncing a few words in the Mina ritual language. After the prayers concluded, everyone went outside, and several filhos-de-santo distributed hot lunches to community members in foi l and cardboard containers (quentinhas or marmitas ). Children rushed to the front of the line and wer e the first to receive food. While the community members ate, a fi lho and filha climbed the great mangueiras (mango trees) outside the barrac\u00e3o and broke off l arge bunches of leaves, which they tossed down to their irm\u00e3os-de-santo (saint brothers and sisters) who were waiting below. After they brought them inside the b arrac\u00e3o, I joined the filhos in spreading the leaves all over the floor of the barr ac\u00e3o, and then sprinkling popcorn over the leaves. After this was finished, I sat for a wh ile in the darkened barrac\u00e3o. The shutters were open and candles burned in each corner. The sm ell of incense filled the air, and outside the wind rustled the leaves of the mangueir as. It was peaceful. ***** In this chapter, I have described the various heal ing modalities that I witnessed over two years of fieldwork in terreiros of S\u00e3o Lu\u00ed s and S\u00e3o Paulo. My intent was to provide the reader with some idea of the substantiv e practices that underlie terreiro health activists' claims to a culturally distinct assembla ge of healing knowledge and a different way of understanding the body, health, and illness. Although the traditional forms of 206 healing from Afro-Brazilian religions are more sali ent in some areas of Brazil than others, and despite the fact that members usually t urn first to biomedicine when treating their own afflictions, this traditional corpus of h ealth knowledge is a powerful source of identity for members of Afro-Brazilian religions. W ithin the context of black health activism, traditional health knowledge becomes a cu rrency with which terreiro members can claim specialized resources and recognition fro m the state. In the next chapter, I substantiate this argument through an examination o f historical and contemporary relations between Afro-Brazilian religions and the Brazilian state. 207 Chapter 6: Afro-Brazilian Religions and the State As I established in Parts I and II, special rights for certain kinds of citizens are nothing new for Brazil; what is relatively new is the state's extension of special rights and/or recognition to black Brazilians and, as I de scribe in this chapter, to religious groups. The second issue is just as contentious as the first, given the separation of religion and state in the Brazilian Constitution. 77 In the following pages, I examine how the Brazilian state handles the dilemma of extendin g special protections and recognition in public policy to members of Afro-Brazilian relig ions. I identify three key strategies. The first is equating Afro-Brazilian religions (as well as other religions, in some cases) with civil society organizations (\"NGOization\"). The second strategy is treating terreiro members as a vulnerable group in relation to health issues such as HIV/AIDS (\"vulnerabilization\"). The third strategy is the co nflation of religious affiliation with racial/ethnic identities (i.e., Afro-Brazilian reli gion as culture, rather than religion per se). The discourse of cultural competence is an instrume ntal part of this strategy. Together, these strategies serve to de-sacralize Afro-Brazili an religions within the public sphere and thus render them a legitimate object of public poli cy. Terreiro health activists, I contend, are co-consp irators in this process; they participate in their own ethnic othering, vulnerabi lization, and NGOization. At the critique Brazil's estado l\u00e1ico (\"lay state\") policy by claiming that the separation of religion and state does not mean that the state should ignore its citizens' religions, but rather that it cannot favor any part icular religion; and that since the 77 Prior to the formal separation of church and state in 1890 under the first Brazilian Republic, the Cr own had maintained a relationship of open patronage wit h the Catholic Church. 208 Brazilian state favors Catholicism in practice, sep aration of religion and state does not truly exist in Brazil. I also make a third kind of argument in this chapte r. Situating the interactions between Afro-Brazilian religions and the Brazilian public health apparatus within a historical context, I argue that terreiro health ac tivists' political struggle represents more than a push for medical pluralism. Rather, these ac tivists seek symbolic reparation for the historical criminalization of these medical practic es and for the historical association of Afro-Brazilian religions with poor hygiene, contagi on, and charlatanism. 78 At the same time, activists carve out a unique Afro-Brazilian c ultural identity through references to a culturally specific body of knowledge concerning he alth and illness. In the process, they re-imagine the relationship of their traditional he aling practices to biomedicine, as well as the relationship of Afro-Brazilian religions to the nation itself. Partnerships between Terreiros and SUS: Rehabilitat ing History Since the late 1980s, members of Afro-Brazilian re ligions have actively sought out and organized formal and informal partnerships with SUS. These partnerships began as community-based efforts to promote awareness and prevention of HIV/AIDS within terreiros. Early educational campaigns promoted con dom use as well as \"biosecurity\" (bioseguran\u00e7a ), or making ritual practices safer (Mott & Cerquei ra 1998). From top- down initiatives that instilled public health educa tion within terreiro communities, however, partnerships slowly became more democratic as terreiro health activists began to assume the role of educators in regard to their own cultural and religious beliefs 78 See Johnson (2001) and Maggie (1992) for historica l accounts of the criminalization of Afro-Brazilian religions' healing practices. 209 concerning health, illness, life, and death (e.g., Silva & Guimar\u00e3es 2000). They began to organize internally around issues such as experienc ing prejudice in public clinics due to their religious and racial identities. Throughout my fieldwork in northeast and southeast Brazil, I followed the activities of the most elaborate partnership betwee n Afro-Brazilian religions and SUS to date: the National Network for Afro-Brazilian Religi ons and Health. A meta-social movement, the Network comprises terreiro members, bl ack movement activists, and public health workers in over 25 Brazilian cities w ho are interested in the official valorization of Afro-Brazilian ethno-religious iden tity and health knowledge. The Network is an outgrowth of an earlier terreiro healt h initiative called \"At\u00f3-Ire,\" which was funded by the Ford Foundation and based in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and Rio de Janeiro. At\u00f3-Ire trained members of Afro-Brazilian religions to be H IV-prevention educators in their own terreiros. When At\u00f3-Ire's funding ended in 2003, it s participants decided to create the Network in order to maintain the initiative's activi ties and expand them to a national level.79 The Network has smaller chapters called \"nuclei\" ( n\u00facleos ) that operate in seventeen Brazilian states, and each nucleus has bo th state- and city-level coordinators who organize political meetings and health educatio n events in their communities. Health education events take place in terreiros and usuall y take the form of health fairs, workshops, or lectures. Network activists also work with public health departments to create health education materials that incorporate concepts and symbols from Afro- Brazilian religions. Although their internal newsle tter became defunct following the end 79 For more information about At\u00f3-Ire, see Silva (2007 ). 210 of the At\u00f3-Ire project, Network activists have conti nued to circulate information among themselves through a collective blog. The Network's national coordinator, Jos\u00e9 Marmo da Silva, has also published articles in academic j ournals such as the Journal of Health Communication and Sa\u00fade e Sociedade (Health and Society) (Silva & Guimar\u00e3es 2000, Silva 2007). He is a public health dentist and a me mber of Candombl\u00e9 in Rio de Janeiro. The most salient topics raised in Network publicati ons and meetings are religious intolerance and institutional racism in the public health system, as well as the benefits of the traditional medicine practiced in terreiros. Li ke members of the black health epistemic community, terreiro health activists defi ne institutional racism as a form of racial discrimination that is so dispersed througho ut societal institutions that people practice it unconsciously. As I discussed in Chapte r 4, black health activists claim that health care providers discriminate against black pa tients and thus contribute to health disparities between racialized groups. Terreiro hea lth activists extend this claim to members of Afro-Brazilian religions, asserting that they are often mistreated for belonging to a marginalized religion, regardless of their race. In practice, the Network channels the conflict bet ween public health norms and Afro-Brazilian ritual practice into routinized publ ic dialogue. Its main goal is to promote \"knowledge exchange\" ( troca de saberes ) between SUS and terreiros. Many Network activists claim, however, that the intended exchang e continues to flow mostly from SUS to Afro-Brazilian religions. In other words, SUS di sseminates public health information to members of Afro-Brazilian religions and financia lly supports some of the Network's activities, but does not yet fully recognize tradit ional Afro-Brazilian medicine as a complementary healing practice. 211 Nevertheless, the proliferation of partnerships bet ween public health departments and terreiros is significant, given that the Brazil ian state once repressed Afro-Brazilian ritual practices through infamous public health cod es. At many points throughout Brazilian history, the figure of the black feiticeiro or curandeiro (witch doctor) has been imagined and appropriated in varying ways to serve both dominant and subaltern interests. In his study of religion and culture in Brazil and other Portuguese colonies up to the eighteenth century, Sweet (2003) observes that colonizers often associated African slaves' healing and divination practices with witch craft ( feiti\u00e7aria ). Indeed, as he states, \"race and culture became fused, as Africans became the receptacle for all things savage\" (187). Simultaneously, however, many colonizers wer e aware of their slaves' curative powers and sought ritual healing from them. From early on, the figure of the black healer/sorc erer encoded ambiguity and liminality between Christian notions of good and ev il. As enslaved Africans became aware of their masters' belief in their powers, the y began to derive economic benefit and greater agency by selling their healing services. H istorian Ubiratan Castro has observed that Afro-Brazilian ritual healing constituted an \" important currency with which blacks could insert themselves into the wider society.\" 80 That is, many African Brazilians appropriated the essentializing race-culture fusion created by their oppressors and transformed it into a source of power. Throughout much of Brazil's colonial period until the consolidation of Western medicine in the mid-1800s, African and Afro-Brazili an ritual healers provided primary 80 Conference presentation, Fifth National Seminar on Afro-Brazilian Religions and Health (Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Para\u00edba, Brazil, April 18-20, 2006). 212 health care to various sectors of the Brazilian pop ulation, including elites. 81 After the first public health department was instituted in 1850, pr oponents of the biomedical model expressed decreasing tolerance for alternative form s of healing. As abolition drew nearer, public opinion also turned against Afro-Brazilian h ealers and they were viewed with increasing distaste and suspicion. While slavery lasted, Afro-Brazilian religions wer e not systematically persecuted. Despite occasional police raids on terreiros, ensla ved Africans were considered the responsibility of slave-owners (Reis 1989). Althoug h existing terreiros were maintained by freed Africans, they were relatively few in numb er and were so carefully hidden that the state rarely bothered to persecute them. With a bolition in 1888 and the formation of the First Republic the next year, however, came a s hift in dominant society's perceptions of Afro-Brazilian culture. For the first time, all blacks were officially incorporated into the Brazilian citizenry. Influenced by themes of po sitivism and scientific racism, Brazilian intellectuals agonized over how to protec t civilized society against the supposedly degenerating, barbaric influence of Afro -Brazilian customs and people (Borges 1995). Johnson (2001) argues that public health codes con stituted the most powerful mode of state oppression of Afro-Brazilian religion s during the First Republic. In 1890, the new republican government created a Penal Code with three new articles that were used to persecute Afro-Brazilian healers, among oth ers: 156 (prohibiting the practice of illegal medicine such as homeopathy), 157 (prohibit ing magic and sorcery), and 158 (prohibiting \"curandeirismo\" or the practice of fal se or questionable ritual healing). These 81 See Sampaio (2001). 213 articles were instituted at a time when elites were troubled by Brazil's seemingly limited capacity for progress and its reputation among deve loped nations; after all, Brazil was a predominantly black nation whose population engaged in cultural practices viewed by many as backward and unsanitary. Given this context , Johnson argues that the articles introduced by the 1890 Penal Code allowed the state to continue controlling African Brazilians, who were now citizens rather than slave s. Persecution of Afro-Brazilian ritual healing throu gh the public health codes reached an apex in the early twentieth century but declined somewhat with the regime of populist dictator Get\u00falio Vargas. During the 1930s and 1940s, Vargas' populism elevated the status of Afro-Brazilian contributions to the n ational culture (Davis 1999). Johnson (2002) avers that during the Vargas regime, state p olicy toward Afro-Brazilian religions shifted from \"unpredictable house arrests and gener al harassment\" to \"accommodation (94). Umbanda became the most celebr ated Afro-Brazilian religion due to its combination of elements from Catholicism, Ameri ndian religions, and African religions. This religion fit well with Vargas' prom otion of mixed-race Brazilian nationality since it represented the amalgamation o f the three \"founding races\" of Brazil: Portuguese, indigenous, and African. Brown (1994) o bserves that the de-Africanized character of Umbanda made it acceptable for state p romotion at this time, whereas many other, more explicitly \"African,\" religions continu ed to be persecuted. Despite Vargas' promotion of Umbanda, in 1934 he passed a decree requiring Afro-Brazilian religious temples to register with t he recently created Pol\u00edcias de Jogos e Costumes (Police of Gaming and Customs) prior to en gaging in any public ritual activity. Registering with these police stations meant that A fro-Brazilian religions were not only 214 denied recognition as legitimate religious institut ions, but they were also placed on a legal par with casinos and brothels. In 1937, howev er, Vargas passed a presidential decree recognizing a few designated \"traditional\" C andombl\u00e9 terreiros as legitimate and protecting them from police disturbance of their ri tual practices or objects. Vargas' protection of those few terreiros represented more a strategic move to preserve the cultural patrimony of Brazil in a museum-like fashi on, than an actual recognition of their status as legitimate temples of worship (Johnson 20 02). During Brazil's military dictatorship (1964-1985), the regime continued to encourage Afro-Brazilian cultural manifestations as a way of justifying Brazil's connection to Africa (Santos 2005). As a result of this political stance and the regime's focus on economic modernization, state tourist boar ds began to promote Afro-Brazilian religions in advertisements for international trave l. This phenomenon was most visible in Salvador, traditionally deemed Brazil's \"Black Rome \" due to its high proportion of African descendants and practitioners of Afro-Brazi lian religions (Bastide 1978). State promotion of Afro-Brazilian culture continued upon Brazil's return to full democracy in 1985 and has increased ever since (Johnson 2002). S tate support for Afro-Brazilian culture reached an all-time high during the adminis tration of Lu\u00eds In\u00e1cio \"Lula\" that influenced the Braz ilian state's increasingly tolerant attitude toward Afro-Brazilian religion and culture include the UN's World Conference on Racism in 2001 and the World Health Organization 's campaign to promote popular medicine and healing knowledge, which intensified a round the same time.82 82 World Health Organization, 2002 (http://www.who.int /mediacentre/news/releases/release38/en/). Last accessed August 30, 2010. 215 Razor Blades and Comic Strips Despite the improving relationship between Afro-Br azilian religions and the Brazilian state, the practice of ritual cutting wit hin some Afro-Brazilian religions has remained a sticking point, so to speak, for SUS. Th is was especially true during the late 1980s, when the Ministry of Health identified membe rs of Afro-Brazilian religions as a risk group for HIV/AIDS due to this practice, as we ll as to the large proportion of homosexual terreiro members. To make matters worse, Brazilian media outlets picked up the story and broadcast it widely (Mesquita 2002, S ilva & Guimar\u00e3es 2000, Galv\u00e3o 1991). In response, terreiros and civil society organizat ions in Rio de Janeiro collaborated to create HIV prevention campaigns for local Candombl\u00e9 terreiros. In the early 1990s, the Institute for Religious Studies (I SER\u2014Instituto de Estudos da Religi\u00e3o) and local terreiro leaders launched an initiative t itled \"Od\u00f4-Y\u00e1\" (Galv\u00e3o 1991, Silva & Guimar\u00e3es 2000). \"Od\u00f4-Y\u00e1\" is the greeting called ou t by terreiro members when the orix\u00e1 Iemanj\u00e1 descends into someone's body. The sec tor of ISER that carried out the project was ARCA, or Apoio Religioso Contra a AIDS (Religious Support Against AIDS). Od\u00f4-Y\u00e1 received funding from several interna tional NGOs, including the World Health Organization. The Network's national coordina tor, Jos\u00e9 Marmo da Silva (\"Marmo\"), was actively involved in the project. In 1991, ARCA, in consultation with Marmo and a fe w other terreiro members, produced a manual titled Od\u00f4-Y\u00e1! The manual included three Candombl\u00e9 parables in comic strip form, and related them to HIV preventio n. It discussed the tradition of using the \"navalha da casa\" (a ritually blessed razor bel onging to a specific terreiro) on multiple 216 initiates, and recommended modifications such as us ing disposable razors or disinfecting them with bleach before using them on another perso n (1991:18). The Od\u00f4-Y\u00e1 project was followed by \"Aray\u00ea,\" a simi lar initiative carried out by the Interdisciplinary Brazilian AIDS Association (A ssocia\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira Interdisciplinar de AIDS, or ABIA). Like Od\u00f4-Y\u00e1, Aray\u00ea's goal was to produce culturally competent HIV prevention materials for terreiro members. Mesq uita (2002) observes, however, that Aray\u00ea went further than Od\u00f4-Y\u00e1 in \"superimposing n\u00e9gritude onto Candombl\u00e9\" (119). For instance, (black people) interchangeably, as if each term described the same population. This fusion of racial and ethnic identity would endure and grow stronger, cul minating in the National Health Policy for the Black Population. The Rio de Janeiro initiatives gave way to similar projects in Salvador and Recife. In Salvador, the Bahian Anti-AIDS Center (Centro Ba iano Anti-AIDS\u2014CBAA) promoted an HIV prevention campaign in the mid-1990 s by holding educational meetings and distributing public health literature in terreiros. Like Od\u00f4-Y\u00e1 and Aray\u00ea, the CBAA campaign called for ritual modifications such as disposable razors (or disinfection of a common razor) and the use of rubber gloves dur ing ceremonies. In Salvador, however, CBAA's campaign was met with outrage by Ca ndombl\u00e9 practitioners who did not wish to be labeled a high-risk population for H IV/AIDS.83 When I questioned pais- and m\u00e3es-de-santo in Salva dor, S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, and S\u00e3o Paulo about ritual cutting, all of them insisted that the y used individual, disposable razors on 83 Personal communication, D.R., SUS administrator; S alvador, 2006. 217 their initiates. However, the coordinator of the CB AA project, who is also a terreiro member, told me in 2006 that he continued to witnes s shared-razor ceremonies in many Salvador terreiros. Nonetheless, a large survey cond ucted by the CBAA in 1998 revealed that 87 percent of priests and priestesses approved of using disposable razors. As for the use of rubber gloves, however, nearly half the lead ers felt it would compromise the ritual (Mott & Cerqueira 1998: 18-21). In 2001, the Health Department of Pernambuco under took a similar campaign against ritual cutting by producing and distributin g a booklet titled Atot\u00f4 . As I mentioned in the last chapter, \"Atot\u00f4\" is the greeting called out to Obaluaiy\u00ea during Candombl\u00e9 rituals. The pamphlet was co-authored by a SUS admi nistrator and a Xang\u00f4 priest in Recife. It aimed to teach readers how to protect th emselves from contracting HIV through blood transfusions, sexual contact, and ritual cutt ing. The text of Atot\u00f4 enjoins ritual practitioners to use disposable razors during heali ng and initiation rites that require ritual incisions in multiple people. The booklet includes a comic-strip depiction of a religious parable involving Obaluaiy\u00ea, who is the divinity or orix\u00e1 of infectious diseases. Atot\u00f4 calls for a \"partnership\" between health profe ssionals\" religions.\" Healing practices in Afro-Bra zilian religion are depicted as complementary to official medicine with the followi ng phrases: \"When we are ill it is very important that we seek the protection of Obalu aiy\u00ea....However, we cannot neglect to seek out medical assistance, because the orix\u00e1s hel p with the suffering of the soul, but the medical professional is in charge of healing the wo unds of the body.\" White health care providers are portrayed using the trappings of mode rn medicine (e.g., a stethoscope and blood pressure equipment) in hospital settings, whi le black filhos-de-santo (initiates) are 218 drawn wearing African-style clothing and surrounded by foliage\u2014thus invoking a sharp difference between biomedical/scientific and tradit ional African religious spaces. Although Atot\u00f4 was conceived as a culturally sensitive tool for H IV prevention, it provoked a negative response among local practition ers who felt it reproduced stereotypes. 84 Many of them bristled at being characterized as po tential vectors for HIV transmission. ***** These stories of razor blades and comic strips reve al an enduring tension between terreiros and the state that is frequently obscured by official representations of Afro- Brazilian culture as an integral element of Brazili an nationhood. There is a fundamental conflict between the state's exaltation of Afro-Bra zilian tradition, on the one hand, and its desire to regulate ritual practices it deems danger ous or barbaric, on the other. This conflict illustrates Paul Christopher Johnson's arg ument (2005) that in many African diasporic religious contexts, the state endorses fr eedom of belief but not necessarily of practice. Discussing the Brazilian case, both Johnson (2001) and Yvonne Maggie (1992) have shown that the state relied historically upon public health codes to regulate Afro- Brazilian religious practices. I argue that althoug h these codes are rarely enforced nowadays, the regulation of \"risky\" practices such as ritual cutting and animal sacrifice continues more subtly through the application of pu blic health norms by new actors and coalitions. These norms are applied using new techn iques such as the language of health 84 Personal communication, various, Fifth National Se minar for Afro-Brazilian Religions and Health (Apri l 18-20, 2006, Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Brazil). 219 education. In the process, certain members of Afro- Brazilian religions receive the Ministry of Health's stamp of approval, but only on the condition that they modify their risky practices and cooperate with the public healt h apparatus. Terreiros are only recognized publicly as health-promoting institution s if they demonstrate their commitment to complying with public health norms, f or example, by inviting SUS health educators to deliver HIV-prevention lectures within their terreiros. This scenario is somewhat similar to the one Hale ( 2002) describes in his analysis of neoliberal multiculturalism in Guatemala. He arg ues that neoliberalism entails a cultural project in which the state extends cultura l rights and recognition to marginalized ethnic groups while simultaneously denying them sub stantive citizenship equality. This situation creates the \"\u00edndio permitido,\" often an e lite member of the marginalized group who performs cultural authenticity for the state in exchange for recognition and resources. Postero (2007) documents a similar proce ss that occurred within the context of neoliberal multiculturalism in Bolivia. She shows t hat, by engaging civil society organizations in the implementation of local projec ts with limited impact, the state was able to channel indigenous activists' energies away from demanding a more extensive redistribution of resources. In the case I describe here, practitioners of Afro- Brazilian religion who comply with the state's ideals of healthy religiosity rece ive recognition in the public sphere. According to Pai Cesar, this recognition comes at t he expense of systemic health care reform. The state keeps terreiro leaders happy, he said, by occasionally sponsoring seminars where they can orate about the value of th eir traditional medical practices. In this way, the state can avoid making more sweeping healthcare reforms, such as 220 implementing more health care services within terre iros' communities, or taking serious measures to counteract the discrimination faced by terreiro members in public clinics. For most terreiro health activists, however, a litt le recognition apparently goes a long way given the history of state persecution und er public health codes. For many of my informants, recognition was an end in itself, ra ther than a means to obtaining better public health services. I realized this only after many frustrating months of trying to ascertain the Network's ultimate goal. Repeatedly, t erreiro health activists would tell me that they wanted the state to \"recognize the terrei This phrase came to sound like a broken record as I interviewed more and more terreiro health activists and attended seemingly endless meetings. Indeed, most activists seemed content with the state's increasing sponsorship of their events, as well as its mention of Afro-Brazilian religions and their healing knowledge within state- and natio nal-level health policies. Given their tortured history with the state, it seemed, they we re content with gaining the human right to dignity. Other Sources of Conflict Although the razor-blade controversy is the most d ramatic example of conflict between Afro-Brazilian religions and public health norms, other examples abound. For instance, in 2003, practitioners of batuque (an Afro-Brazilian religion practiced widely in the state of Rio Grande do Sul) and black movement activists successfully lobbied the state legislature to get Afro-Brazilian religious w orship exempted from the Animal Protection Code. The event provoked impassioned rea ctions from both animal rights and human rights activists, the latter of who defended the right to full religious freedom. 221 Similar animal sacrifice/public health legal strugg les have been documented in other Afro-diasporic religious contexts, including santer\u00eda in Miami (Johnson 2005). Alongside these widely publicized controversies be tween Afro-Brazilian religions and public health are others that rarely make their way into the media. For instance, terreiro health activists in the four cities where I conducted fieldwork between 2005 and 2009 complained that community health workers routi nely avoided visiting their terreiros when making neighborhood rounds. Many primary care clinics send teams of community health workers, and sometimes also doctors and/or n urses, on household visits in the neighborhoods surrounding the clinics. These teams monitor pregnant women, the elderly, and patients with serious chronic and infe ctious diseases (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, leprosy, hepatitis). There are also s pecialized dengue fever workers who inspect people's homes for risk factors such as unc overed containers of water. Since terreiros in northeastern Brazil are often l ocated on relatively large land tracts with multiple family compounds, this means t hat many people living in the compounds, especially the elderly and disabled, may not receive primary health care if heath workers avoid terreiros. In Salvador, activis ts partnered with the city's health department to organize a project called \"Sa\u00fade nos Terreiros\" (Health in the Terreiros). The project was implemented with ease since the hea lth department had a special office for black health programs, and a Network member dire cted the office. The project consisted of public debates and community health fa irs held in terreiros all over the city. At these events, terreiro members and public health workers came together and discussed their areas of conflict. The goal was to find solut ions that would be acceptable to both 222 parties, such as placing anti-mosquito tablets in t he water of ritual preparations rather than requiring terreiro members to cover the contai ners. In S\u00e3o Paulo, by contrast, terreiros are often squ eezed into narrow, concrete urban dwellings or improvised from rented spaces within a large Umbanda Sanctuary (Santu\u00e1rio da Umbanda) located in the \"ABC\" periphe ry of the city. 85 Almost none of the pais- and m\u00e3es-de-santo who participated in the S\u00e3o Paulo city branch of the Network actually lived in their terreiros. They frequently spoke of the challenges involved in carrying out rituals and offerings that required ce rtain natural settings, such as waterfalls or forests, or certain key plant ingredients that w ere difficult to find in the city's concrete sprawl. The Umbanda Sanctuary therefore represents a practical solution for many terreiro leaders. When I visited a friend's rented terreiro there, soon after my arrival in S\u00e3o Paulo, I was astounded at its innovative organi zation. The Sanctuary is divided into sections devoted to each orix\u00e1; for instance, in the \"Oxum\" section, there is a waterfall and a large co lorful statue representing Oxum. The day I was there, Oxum's section bore the remnants o f multiple ritual offerings, such as burnt-out thick yellow candles resting on saucers, covered porcelain bowls, and clay pots (which, I assumed, contained preparations of Oxum's foods such as fish, eggs, and honey). Near the entrance of the Sanctuary, there i s a large store selling snacks as well as ritual objects and implements, such as incense, can dles, and statuettes of various orix\u00e1s. In my view, the Sanctuary's organization was remini scent of theme parks in the United States. My visit there came just after I had spent a year in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, where most terreiros 85 The ABC Santo Andr\u00e9, S\u00e3o Bernardo, S\u00e3o Caetano, and Diadema. These neighborhoods are mix of residences and indus trial complexes. 223 are situated in areas of abundant foliage. As such, I was struck by the creativity required to practice a nature-worshipping religion within th e physical constraints of a mega-city. Terreiro health activists attribute community heal th workers' avoidance of their terreiros to religious intolerance. According to th em, many of these workers are evangelical Christians and therefore believe Afro-B razilian religions are diabolical ( coisa a Network member in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, report ed that he returned to his terreiro one day to find a dengue inspector trying to destroy his statue of the orix\u00e1 (deity) Exu: My mother was in the terreiro. When I arrived, I fo und this scene unfolding. [The inspector was saying] that it was the devil, t hat it belonged to the devil, that it was Satan, and he wanted to take [the statu e] out of my house. Then, he wanted to evangelize us, so I got mad and threat ened him with four or five stones in my hand, I nearly threw them. I thought h e was out of line, since he was there to work and not to tell me what's right a nd wrong with my life. Following this incident, Pai Arnaldo went to the po lice and pressed charges against the dengue inspector. He even began to file a lawsuit, but dropped both the charges and the suit after the inspector apologized. Episodes like this one have prompted Network activi sts in many Brazilian cities to hold \"sensitivity training\" ( sensibiliza\u00e7\u00e3o ) sessions with public health care providers. Such activities took place within selected terreiro s every few months during my fieldwork in Salvador (2006), S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds (2007-08), a nd S\u00e3o Paulo (2008-09). Afro-Brazilian religions strived to \"demystify\" ( desmistificar) their religious beliefs and practices by teaching t he health professionals basic facts about orix\u00e1 worship and about how they treat spiritual an d physical health problems in the terreiro. They also encouraged health professionals to openly discuss their own fears and 224 prejudices concerning Afro-Brazilian religions duri ng the workshops. During a sensitivity training session in S\u00e3o Paulo in 2008, a mental hea lth employee admitted that she had furtively prayed three rosaries before entering the terreiro that day in order to seek spiritual protection from the demonic forces that s he was certain of encountering there. I heard many other such fears and fantasies about Afro-Brazilian religions from health professionals during fieldwork. Once, I was seated in a dingy but air-conditioned waiting room at S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds's Municipal Health Departm ent, waiting to obtain permission to conduct research at a local clinic. Having overh eard my conversation with the secretary, two white, middle-aged female employees approached me and asked about my research. When I told them I was studying Afro-Braz ilian religions and health, one woman nodded knowingly and said, \"Yeah, those peopl e don't like to get vaccines, and during their rituals they all use the same razor bl ade which can spread HIV. They do whatever the pai-de-santo commands them to do. Plus , they sacrifice animals.\" I kept quiet, hoping she would say more, but just then the secretary returned with my documents and the women went back to work. This kind of exchange was more common in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds than in S\u00e3o Paulo, where the public health employees I met seemed more conce rned with political correctness. Over the course of fieldwork, only one employee, Ro sana, expressed her own negative impressions of Afro-Brazilian religious practices d uring a taped interview. Even so, she kept asking me to stop the recording so she could t hink carefully about her responses to my questions before taping them. At the time, Rosan a was a 55-year-old project administrator at S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds' municipal STD/AIDS depar tment. She identified as white and was an evangelical Christian. I interviewed her at her family's home in the middle-class 225 neighborhood of S\u00e3o Francisco. When Rosana stated t hat the municipal HIV/AIDS Program had classified terreiro members as a vulner able group, I asked her why. She replied that the members' rituals, which she had he ard involved cutting, expose them to HIV. She added that members of these religions have no access to public health information regarding, for instance, how to avoid c ontracting HIV. Rosana's comments led us into a discussion about h er perception of the public health implications of other Afro-Brazilian religio us practices. She was dubious about the safety of the herbs, teas, and \"those mixtures\" tha t members ingest. \"Nobody's in the laboratory testing to see what products they use,\" she remarked. Rosana also echoed the employee at the municipal health department who had told me that terreiro members refused vaccines. Members believe that their rituals guarantee their own immunity. They have this idea. Therefore, they negate [public] health. They negate everything that's outside [the terreiro]. So when Public Healt h goes there...[health professionals] can't just show up and impose things , can they? They have to go peacefully, sensitively. It's like taking the In dian out of the woods where he lives...he has a whole lifestyle, customs, value s, that are totally different. Although Rosana was trying to emphasize the need f or public health employees to be mindful of terreiro members' cultural specificit ies, her comments revealed the extent to which she viewed terreiro members as fundamental ly \"other\" vis-\u00e0-vis the general Brazilian population. She also presented an image o f Afro-Brazilian religions as a kind of counter-culture, especially by opposing their belie fs about immunity to the germ theory of disease. By contrast, the terreiro health activi sts whose work I followed in various cities were adamant about the fact that the ritual healing practiced in terreiros is not a \"cure-all\" medicine; they claimed to advise members and clients ( clientes ) who sought 226 out the terreiro for healing to consult a medical d octor as well. During my own fieldwork in terreiros, I also witnessed m\u00e3es- and pais-de-sa nto counseling filhos and clients to go to a posto de sa\u00fade (SUS clinic) while they were undergoing ritual heal ing. Often, the m\u00e3e- or pai-de-santo would be \"incorporated\" ( incorporado/a ) at the time with a healing caboclo. Since caboclos use distinctive language ch aracteristic of rural populations, it is customary for them to refer to medical doctors as o homem de bata branca (the man in the white coat). On the three occasions that I soug ht ritual healing for a chronic pain condition, the m\u00e3e- or pai-de-santo told me to visi t a doctor because my problem was physical, not spiritual\u2014but they also gave me herba l concoctions to drink and, in one case, conducted an eb\u00f3 , or offering, to my orix\u00e1 (described in Chapter 5) . Of course, it is likely that the leaders of the te rreiros in which I conducted fieldwork were more careful to recommend simultaneo us biomedical treatment to clients, because the leaders were terreiro health activists. In addition, years of persecution as charlatans have presumably rendered terreiro member s more apt to characterize their healing as complementary to biomedicine, rather tha n as a substitute for it. It follows that my presence as an outsider also could have influenc ed terreiro members' behavior in this regard. Over roughly three years of fieldwork in terreiros , I met only one pai-de-santo who claimed to have cured a client of cancer throug h ritual healing. No one claimed to have cured HIV/AIDS. I met terreiro members who sai d they had been cured of leprosy and epilepsy, as well as a host of chronic pain and mental health disorders, through spiritual treatment and development in the terreiro . As for Rosana's idea that terreiro members believe their religion confers immunity, th ere is a concept of the \"corpo 227 fechado\" (closed body) within Afro-Brazilian religi ons. When a member's spiritual obligations are up to date, and/or when she undergo es a special ritual, her body is said to be \"closed\" to external threats. In some cases, the se threats might include illnesses that manifest physically. However, this belief generally does not preclude terreiro members from getting vaccines\u2014in fact, in most cities I vis ited, a few terreiros served periodically as community vaccination posts ( p\u00f3los de vacina ). At certain times of the year, members of the terreiro and its surrounding community would line up to receive various vaccines from SUS nurses. Furthermore, my observations and i nterviews with terreiro members indicated that they rarely, if ever, chose ritual h ealing in place of biomedical treatment. Finally, Rosana compared terreiro members to indig enous Brazilians, another population labeled \"vulnerable\" and targeted by HIV /AIDS programs throughout Brazil. Her comparison is useful to the present discussion. After all, both indigenous Brazilians and terreiro members have been targeted as objects of public health policy. Both have been constructed by the public health system as cul turally different and in need of culturally competent health practices. Unlike indig enous Brazilians, however, the public health apparatus has only recently begun to formall y recognize terreiro members as a culturally separate group. As terreiro members increasingly push the boundari es of their relationship to the public health apparatus, additional sources of conf lict appear\u2014particularly when terreiro members attempt to bring their practices into biome dical spaces. In S\u00e3o Paulo, terreiro health activists protested frequently that public h ospitals would not allow them to attend to their faithful. Most hospitals in Brazil offer c haplain services and routine patient visitation (called capelania or assist\u00eancia religiosa ) from Catholic, Protestant, and 228 Spiritist chaplains or lay members. At designated t imes throughout the week, lay members make bedside rounds, offering unsolicited p rayer to patients (many of whom are in no condition to protest). Chaplains call on patients by request to provide religious rites. However, members of Afro-Brazilian religions are not included in chaplaincy and lay visitation programs. Terreiro health activists frequently complain about their exclusion from patient visitation programs, as well as the fact that they are not allowed to conduct rites for their own ailing faithful in the hospital. In Orix\u00e1s da Metr\u00f3pole (Orix\u00e1s of the Metropolis ), Silva (1995) discusses the conflicts that ensue when m\u00e3es- and pais-de-santo a ttempt to conduct healing rituals for their members at public hospitals in S\u00e3o Paulo. He views these conflicts as symptomatic of fundamental differences in conceptions of health , illness, life, and death between Afro- Brazilian religions and medical science. He observe s that Christian rites do not produce conflict in the biomedical setting because they are \"aseptic\" and bring only words to patients, rather than herbs or ritual incisions (23 8). During fieldwork, however, I found a significant d isconnect between terreiro health activists' public and private claims of disc rimination during hospital visits to religious \"family\" members. M\u00e3e C\u00edntia, for example , a Candombl\u00e9 priestess in S\u00e3o Paulo, told me during an interview that although sacerdotes (priests) declare they do not have access to their hospitalized faithful, this is not true: they simply do not go to the hospitals dressed in their ritual clothing because they believe they will be barred from entering. Similarly, Pai Jos\u00e9 and M\u00e3e Denise, both Candombl\u00e9 leaders in S\u00e3o Paulo, gave firsthand reports of having visited their filhos in the hospital and conducted religious rites. In Pai Jos\u00e9's words, he simply used the good old \"jeitinho brasileiro\" (roughly, 229 \"Brazilian way\"). Brazilians often use this phrase to describe a situation in which the rules are bent. Pai Jos\u00e9 paid an attendant at the H eli\u00f3polis Hospital ten reais to ensure that he would not be disturbed while conducting fun ereal rites for his filho who had just expired from AIDS-related complications. When he to ld me this story, I assumed it must have been easier to get persuade hospital staff to let him conduct rites on a dead body than would be the case with a live patient. M\u00e3e Den ise's story, however, made me question my assumption. When her own pai-de-santo ended up in the Ibirapue ra State Employees' Hospital following a massive stroke, M\u00e3e Denise and some oth er members of his terreiro visited him regularly, unbeknownst to his disapproving fami ly. At first, they only dared to sing prayers to orix\u00e1s whenever they found themselves al one at his bedside. Eventually, however, the orix\u00e1 told them they needed to give hi m banhos (ritual herb baths), perform an eb\u00f3 (ritual offering to the orix\u00e1s), and feed him the r itual foods of his own orix\u00e1, Obaluaiy\u00ea\u2014coincidentally, the orix\u00e1 associated with health and illness. They decided to approach the nurses and explain the situation. To M \u00e3e Denise's surprise, the nurses did not say no. Instead, they sent in a psychologist an d a social worker to ask M\u00e3e Denise and her irm\u00e3os-de-santo exactly what would ensue, and to decide whether any of the rites could harm the patient. They settled on involving t he nurses in the whole process. The nurses administered the herbal baths to the patient using a sponge, spoon-fed him the herbal concoctions (after obtaining a list of the i ngredients and making sure they had been prepared with filtered water), and incorporate d his orix\u00e1's ritual foods into his hospital meals. 230 M\u00e3e Denise's experience, however, appears to be th e exception rather than the rule. Most of the terreiro health activists I inter viewed told me the more usual scenario is to conduct rituals in secret (\u00e0s escondidas ), or not to conduct them at all inside the hospital. They believe, however, that skipping the rituals jeopardizes the patient's health and relationship to his or her orix\u00e1. Meanwhile, de spite some individuals' success with negotiating hospital norms, terreiro health activis ts continue to be excluded from patient visitation programs in hospitals. ***** As the examples above show, the Brazilian public h ealth apparatus continues to regulate the bodily practices of members of Afro-Br azilian religions. Although some SUS employees are blatant in their attempts to normaliz e the terreiros' ritual space, like the dengue inspector in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, they are now the exce ption rather than the rule. Indeed, the state's new modus operandi is a rewards system that encourages terreiro pract itioners to regulate each other. The state can apply this techn ology seamlessly, since it corresponds so well to the value placed on citizen participatio n and \"social control\" ( controle social ) within SUS. The Brazilian public health system is a prime example of a contemporary biopolitics that engages citizens as \"active partic ipants in the drive for health\" (Rose 2001: 6). Terreiro members who agree to become heal th education disseminators (multiplicadores ) in their communities are rewarded with recognitio n in the public sphere. The state is thus able to rationalize Afro- Brazilian ritual practices and keep terreiro bodies docile without overstepping the bou nds of a new Brazilian multiculturalism that is endorsed by the internatio nal human rights community. 231 Although the new Brazilian multiculturalism emerge s in various legal domains such as land rights, public education, and cultural policy, I contend that nowhere is it more essentializing than in the domain of health po licy and health care. As a semantic field, health mixes claims to cultural difference w ith assertions of biological difference in a uniquely authoritative way due to the hegemonic s tatus of medical science. When multiculturalism enters the hospital or clinic, it translates activists' and healthcare administrators' political discourses on particular patient identities and needs into a set of cultural symbols which are then inserted into healt hcare practices. In the case of health activism and policymaking for the Brazilian black p opulation, Afro-Brazilian religious symbols become the diacritical markers of Afro-Braz ilian ethnic difference, writ large. They also become the main ingredients for sensitivi ty-training workshops and health education materials as part of a growing cultural c ompetence movement in Brazil. Cultural Competence and the Terreiro Although they rarely use the term \"cultural compet ence,\" terreiro health activists and SUS professionals employ the concept when they advocate for health care strategies that reflect the worldview and health/illness belie fs of Afro-Brazilian religions. Cultural competence in health care refers to the practice of \"tailoring health care services to the needs of particular populations whose difference is understood in cultural, ethnic, and sometimes biological terms\" (Shaw 2005:292). Cultur al competence aims to counteract the biomedical tendency to individualize patients b y reinserting them into a more familiar cultural context. The goal, typically, is to increa se marginalized groups' utilization of health care services and compliance with prescribed treatment. 232 Brazilian black health programs portray members of Afro-Brazilian religions not only as the custodians of ancestral healing knowled ge, but also as a cultural minority in need of special health care. The inclusion of provi sions for the terreiro population within the National Health Policy for the Black Population makes it seem as though the terreiro population is a subset of the black population, whe n in reality many terreiro members do not identify as black, and the majority of black Br azilians do not profess Afro-Brazilian religions. Activists' and policymakers' conflation of the two groups establishes a ambiguity between the semantic ambiguity, in turn, makes it possi ble to define the black population as a culturally dist inct part of the Brazilian population. The claim to cultural (and biological) distinctiveness is necessary in order to make the case that this population requires special resources and recognition. SUS-sponsored cultural competence initiatives for terreiro members consist of specialized health education materials and sensitiv ity training for public health professionals. Like educational materials for the b lack population more generally, health education for the terreiro population tend to featu re an \"African\" theme with illustrations of items such as cowry shells or West African drums . For instance, a pamphlet titled \"Where there's a terreiro, there's health!\" (\"Tem T erreiro, Tem Sa\u00fade!\"), produced by the S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds municipal health department, features cowry shells on the front and all along the borders, in addition to a photo of the woven st raw \"dish\" used during the jogo de b\u00fazios (a divining ritual that utilizes cowry shells). On the front of the pamphlet, there is also a photo of a ritual garment with strings of be ads ( guias ) hanging down from it. 233 Inside the pamphlet is printed information on vario us sexually transmitted diseases, as well as illustrated instructions on how to use a co ndom. The inside flap reads: We, members of Afro-Brazilian religions, believe th at the body is the dwelling of the gods and, therefore, must always be well taken care of...we are the inheritors of our ancestors' ax\u00e9 (vital force), and therefore we must have healthy and well-informed bodies and minds in order to fully experience our ancestrality. This language establishes an image of terreiro memb ers as a traditional population with culturally specific and holistic ways of understand ing the relationship between the body and spirituality. In both S\u00e3o Paulo and S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, I sa\u00fade da popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra . I described some of these in Chapter 2. In S\u00e3o Pa ulo, I attended another workshop series called \"Sa\u00fade com Cultura\" [Health (care) with Culture].86 The workshops were organized and financed by the S \u00e3o Paulo state health department, and were taught primarily by black anth ropologists and sociologists. They were organized as a lecture series that resembled a n introductory course on the anthropology of African peoples; the lecturers bega n by covering the \"out of Africa\" evolutionary model and proceeded to teach about dif ferent ethnic groups in Africa, focusing on their various religious and health-rela ted beliefs and practices. When I interviewed Leonardo, the SUS administrator who cre ated the workshops, he told me they were intended to give SUS providers an appreci ation for the richness of African culture. If they appreciated the cultural backgroun d of their black patients, he reasoned, perhaps they would be less likely to mistreat them. 86 Within SUS, the word \"sa\u00fade\" is used to refer both to healthcare, and to health more generally. 234 Cultural competence training also took place in mo re informal ways during routine interactions between terreiro health activi sts and SUS officials. For instance, I witnessed an impromptu lesson in cultural competenc e during a meeting of the Xir\u00ea Project (Projeto Xir\u00ea) at S\u00e3o Paulo's municipal AID S department in August 2008. The Project was a cooperative endeavor between municipa l HIV/AIDS officials and a group of terreiro leaders in S\u00e3o Paulo; it dispatched hea lth professionals to local terreiros for weekend workshops in which they and terreiro member s took turns educating one another about their respective health beliefs and norms. Th e team included Mar\u00edlia, Jana\u00edna, Pai Cesar, Simone, and middle-aged and self- described Catholic with copper-colored hair and blu e eyes. Jana\u00edna was a twenty-three year old policy analyst with olive skin, wild curly black hair, and horn-rimmed glasses. She had grown up in the periphery of S\u00e3o Paulo and identified as \u00e1rabe (Arab) due to her father's Syrian roots. Simone was the departmental secretary; she was also an Umbanda priestess in her mid-forties with medium brown skin and chemically straightened, shoulder-length black hair. M\u00e3e C\u00edntia was a forty- five year old Candombl\u00e9 priestess, and good friend of Pai Cesar, who identified as bla ck despite her olive skin tone. M\u00e3e C\u00edntia's filhos-de-santo were mostly white, middle-class paulistas . She was a permanent fixture at Network and Xir\u00ea Project meetings and eve nts, and always wore Candombl\u00e9- inspired clothing: long, billowy white skirts; whit e sweaters or long-sleeved blouses; and a white head wrap which covered her long, straight black hair. In accordance with Candombl\u00e9 mores, M\u00e3e C\u00edntia always wore or fio de her orix Because M\u00e3e C\u00edntia's main orix\u00e1 was Oxum, her beads were mainly yellow and gold. 235 The team was seated around a table in a meeting ro om at the HIV/AIDS department, rehashing the previous workshop when Ma r\u00edlia asked M\u00e3e C\u00edntia what the guia signified for members of Candombl\u00e9. In respons e, M\u00e3e C\u00edntia pulled her long string of yellow beads out from her sweater neck and expla ined that the guia transmits the orix\u00e1's positive energy and thus protects the weare r from malevolent forces. \"It's especially important for members to wear their guia s when they go to the hospital, because it strengthens the positive energy of their mind and spirit, which is vital to preserving equilibrium when the body's energy is we akened,\" she added. M\u00e3e C\u00edntia went on to explain that in clinics and hospitals, C andombl\u00e9 members are often told to remove their guias as well as their contra-eguns (straw ornaments worn on the upper arms for spiritual protection). Mar\u00edlia nodded, and then asked, \"Do doctors have the right to ask patients to remove their pano de cabe\u00e7a (head covering) for a clinical exam? And if the patient does not want to remove his guia, ca n the doctor push the beads aside to examine him?\" M\u00e3e C\u00edntia replied that it was all ri ght for doctors and nurses to touch the guia, but that they should not ask the patient to r emove it, or else he or she will become vulnerable in the absence of its protection. Finall y, Mar\u00edlia asked about the function of the pano de cabe\u00e7a, and M\u00e3e C\u00edntia explained that i t is for protecting the head, which in turn controls the person's equilibrium. This episode demonstrates the process of construct ing a health-related ethnic identity through didactic performances (Shaw 2010). During interactions between SUS administrators and terreiro members during the Xir\u00ea Project, terreiro members often assumed the role of cultural experts with the missi on of teaching the public health apparatus about the health-related culture of Afro- Brazilian religions. In so doing, this 236 elite group of terreiro members (most of them from Candombl\u00e9) with access to the state spoke for all members of Afro-Brazilian religions, despite the significant variations in beliefs and practices among them. Over time, these repeated didactic performances of ethnic identity often end up constructing fixed, st atic notions of particular cultures, which are then deployed to other members of the target po pulation through cultural competence programs (ibid). As Shaw (2005) and Santiago-Irizarry (1996, 2001) observe, cultural competence programs presuppose the existence of distinct cultu res that merit special consideration within public policy. Through the kind of interacti on described above, terreiro health activists reinforced their claim that members of Af ro-Brazilian religion were indeed a special-needs group, distinct from the general popu lation. The construction within the black health agenda of terreiro members\u2014and, by ext ension, black Brazilians\u2014as a cultural minority reflects the rise of multicultura lism in Brazil. Against an ideological backdrop that valorizes cultural assimilation, the language of cultural competence emerges as a counter-process of identity constructi on deployed by activists. As I discussed in Chapter 4, black health activists are seeking to replace the negative informal discrimination they already experience with positiv e, formalized \"discrimination.\" The same is true for terreiro health activists. De-Sacralizing the Terreiro Pai Cesar often remarks that ten years ago, coopera tion between the Brazilian public health system and terreiros would have been impossible in S\u00e3o Paulo due to widespread prejudice against Afro-Brazilian religio ns. He and a group of Candombl\u00e9 leaders spent seven years trying to convince the ci ty's STD/AIDS program to collaborate 237 with them on an HIV prevention project for S\u00e3o Paul o terreiros. According to Pai Cesar, the coordinator simply refused to meet with them. I n 2007, under mounting pressure to work with vulnerable populations, she finally accep ted the group's proposal, and the Xir\u00ea Project was born. 87 Employees from S\u00e3o Paulo's HIV/AIDS Program, howeve r, tell a different story. Jana\u00edna, an anthropologist who works at the Program (and Pai Cesar's coworker), informed me that the Program had worked with terrei ros in the early 2000s through agentes de preven\u00e7\u00e3o , or peer educators. As I stated earlier, STD/AIDS programs in Brazil often hire members of difficult-to-reach com munities, such as IV drug users and transvestites, to serve as peer educators. Although the Xir\u00ea Project took the SUS-terreiro relationship a step further by having terreiro memb ers educate SUS providers about their own health practices, the Program was reportedly op en to working with terreiros prior to 2007. Judging by subsequent circumstances, however, it is possible that the coordinator did not want to devote the kind of resources that t he Xir\u00ea Project required. I attempted to interview her, but she was never available. From the start, the Xir\u00ea Project encountered diffic ulty in obtaining funding and convincing SUS to pay providers overtime for attend ing weekend workshops. The workshops had to occur on weekends because the part icipating terreiros, like most terreiros in urban centers throughout Brazil, were located far from the city center. The gargantuan traffic jams of S\u00e3o Paulo made transit t o the impoverished zona leste (east zone) nearly impossible for SUS employees who worke d in the city center. 87 \"Xir\u00ea\" is the word for \"public ritual\" or \"festival \" within Candombl\u00e9. 238 Despite these logistical challenges, STD/AIDS Progr am administrators agreed to fund the workshops. They put their collective foot down, however, when Pai Cesar and M\u00e3e C\u00edntia asked them to produce STD-prevention mat erials that portrayed the orix\u00e1 Oxum. During a Xir\u00ea meeting that I attended at S\u00e3o Paulo's municipal health department in September 2008, Mar\u00edlia, the program administrat or who helped coordinate the Xir\u00ea Project, told Pai Cesar and M\u00e3e C\u00edntia that the Pro gram could not produce such materials because they would violate the separation of religi on and state. During an administrative meeting the previous day, her colleagues had called the proposed materials \"unconstitutional.\" They had argued further that if they made a booklet with Oxum on the cover, they would then have to make similar ones fe aturing Jesus, Muhammad, and Buddha in order not to offend any religious group. Mar\u00edlia said she would try to convince her colleagues to produce a small number of Oxum pr evention materials, just to hand out in terreiros. After that meeting, Pai Cesar complai ned bitterly to me that the administrators were hypocrites. How, he reasoned, c ould Brazil claim to be a \"lay state\" (estado l\u00e1ico ) when virtually every public building had a crucif ix on the wall? When I left S\u00e3o Paulo a year later, the Program had still not produced the materials. The issue of the estado l\u00e1ico came up many times during my fieldwork with terreiro health activists and SUS employees in S\u00e3o Paulo. I initially found this curious, considering the numerous financial partnerships bet ween the National STD/AIDS Program and Christian churches. For instance, the C atholic Church's AIDS pastoral initiative (Pastoral da AIDS) receives funds from t he Ministry of Health for HIV/AIDS prevention and patient services. Clearly, Brazil's National STD/AIDS Program makes 239 little to no distinction between religious institut ions and other types of civil society organizations when it funds community HIV preventio n projects (Terra 2010). In S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Recife, Piracicaba and many other cit ies where I conducted research, municipal and state health departments collaborated with terreiro health activists to create culturally competent health education materials. Th ey also sponsored workshops like the Xir\u00ea Project, in which terreiro practitioners taugh t SUS employees about their religious principles. Furthermore, in the National Health Poli cy for the Black Population, the Ministry of Health mandates public health departmen ts throughout Brazil to recognize terreiros as health-promoting institutions. Althoug h most Brazilian blacks identify as either Catholic or Protestant, no such mandate exis ts for other religious institutions or groups. In sum, SUS's myriad financial entanglement s with religious institutions reveal the estado l\u00e1ico's permeability to social and polit ical interests. Meanwhile, the discourse of the estado l\u00e1ico retain s considerable currency among SUS administrators, as shown by the episode from th e Xir\u00ea Project meeting. When I asked STD/AIDS administrators in S\u00e3o Paulo how they could collaborate with terreiros given the separation of church and state, they repl ied that they were dealing with terreiros not as religious institutions, but rather as cultur al or civil society organizations. Pamela, a coordinator at the STD/AIDS Program of S\u00e3o Paulo st ate, explained that when the Program partners with religious groups, it treats t hem merely as \"communities of citizens.\" She went on to redefine the concept of t he lay state: The separation of religion and state does not mean that I have to ignore people's religions. It means I have to respect peop le's religions and know how to work with them...any [religious collaboratio n] is part of the lay state because the state gives any religion the opportunit y to participate. 240 Pamela's solution to the problem of the lay state, then, is to ensure equal opportunity for all religions to collaborate with the state. In pra ctice, of course, this does not happen. As I discussed above, chaplain services in Brazilian pub lic hospitals include Catholic, Protestant, and even Kardecist members, but not ter reiro members. It is important to note, however, that Pamela's view of the estado l\u00e1ico is likely informed by her own religious affiliation; she is the m\u00e3e-de-santo of an Umbanda center. Pamela's view that the state treats religions as c ommunities of citizens, however, is bolstered by the fact that representatives of re ligious institutions are permitted to sit on participatory councils that allow citizens to co-co nstruct health policy. In Brazil, these are referred to simply as conselhos de sa\u00fade , or \"health councils.\" One-third of the councils' members are supposed to be citizens; the other two thirds consist of SUS providers and administrators, respectively. Citizens, however, mu st represent a civil society organization; they cannot sit on the councils as me re individuals. Similarly, religious groups must sit on the councils as nonprofit organi zations, rather than religious institutions per se .88 Up until recently, health councils included repres entation by Catholic, Protestant, and Kardecist organizations, but not terreiros. As more and more terreiros acquire nonprofit extensions, however, te rreiro leaders are increasingly joining health councils. One way in which the state negotia tes the restrictions of the estado l\u00e1ico, then, is to conceptualize terreiros, as well as oth er religious institutions, as NGOs rather than as religious institutions. I will call this st rategy the \"NGOization\" of terreiros. 88 The U.S. equivalent would be the concept of the fai th-based organization (FBO), which is associated with a religious institution but is a separate enti ty with 501(c) (3) status. Religious organizations that sit on health councils in Brazil are supposed to have a CN PJ (Cadastro Nacional de Pessoa Jur\u00eddica). The CNPJ is which confers legal personali ty (pessoa jur\u00eddica to the CPF which confers the status of pessoa f\u00edsica , or natural person (i.e., an individual citizen). 241 Another strategy is to classify terreiro members f irst and foremost as a vulnerable population that engages in risky practices, rather than members of a religious institution. When I asked STD/AIDS Program employees in S\u00e3o Paul o and S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds why their department had chosen to implement public health in terventions in terreiros, they often responded that the terreiro population ( popula\u00e7\u00e3o de terreiro ) is more \"vulnerable\" to HIV infection than is the average citizen. When I p ressed them on why terreiro members were more vulnerable, most employees cited the prac tice of ritual cutting, which they had heard often involved shared razors. Jana\u00edna, however, replied that terreiro members ar e more vulnerable to contracting HIV due to the discrimination they suff er. She stated that the persecution they experience, or anticipate experiencing, prevents th em from accessing health care. She added that community health workers, who often spea k to the families they visit about condom use, tend to avoid visiting households that also function as terreiros. Therefore, she felt that faith-based discrimination was keepin g terreiro members from receiving adequate information about how to prevent HIV. Seve ral other SUS administrators whom I interviewed echoed her comments. The second way, then, that SUS justifies its financial relationship with terreiros is through \"vulnerabili zation,\" or classifying terreiro members as a higher-risk group for HIV due to their risky p ractices and/or to their social marginalization. Either way, the focus is on member s' social suffering, rather than on their status as members of a religious institution. The third way in which SUS de-sacralizes Afro-Braz ilian religions is by conflating race with religious affiliation. SUS off icials and health professionals do this by accepting and re-affirming the identity claims orig inated by terreiro health activists. In 242 particular, they reaffirm the terreiro as a strateg ic place to deploy HIV prevention campaigns for blacks. C\u00e9lia, the coordinator of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds' STD/AIDS Program, explained that Program staff had first reached out to local t erreiros in 2005 because they believed they could access the black population through such a partnership. Their decision coincided with the National STD/AIDS Program's campa ign to reduce rates of HIV infection in blacks (see Fry 2005). Presumably, C\u00e9l ia and her colleagues could have accomplished their goal more directly by collaborat ing with one of several prominent black movement organizations in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds. Instead, however, they opted to approach the local branch of the National Network for Afro-Brazil ian Religions and Health. C\u00e9lia's explanation of the logic behind the Progra m-Network partnership conflates the health agenda of terreiro members wit h the black health agenda. In so doing, it equates Afro-Brazilian religion with blackness, and terreiro members with the black population. This conflating discourse was present t hroughout the universe of terreiro health activism that I came to know in Brazil. Alth ough I understood the discourse as a form of identity politics, it stood in sharp disson ance to the variety of phenotypes I saw whenever I attended religious ceremonies at terreir os in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and S\u00e3o Paulo. Although the proportion of phenotypically white mem bers was higher in the S\u00e3o Paulo terreiros I visited, the ones I attended in S\u00e3o Lu\u00ed s had a large share of whites as well. In S\u00e3o Paulo, likewise, terreiro health activist s and their SUS collaborators used the phrases \"sa\u00fade da popula\u00e7\u00e3o de terreiro\" (terre iro members' health) and da popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra\" (the black population's health) in terchangeably. During Network meetings and workshops in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and S\u00e3o Paulo, I rarely, if ever, heard anyone acknowledge that the terreiro community was not all black. Questions over the racial 243 makeup of terreiro members, however, did emerge dur ing Network meetings where only terreiro health activists were present. Within the context of the terreiro, this already complex discussion became further nuanced through t he introduction of a spiritual component of ethnicity. As I discuss in Chapter 7, phenotype is not the ultimate arbiter of black identity in the terreiro. Conclusion In this chapter, I have examined changes in the sta te's governance of Afro- Brazilian religions over time. I have shown that, a lthough the state has adopted a public discourse of celebrating Afro-Brazilian religions f or their cultural cache, the relationship between these religions and the state tends to brea k down over issues such as healing practices. The climate of political openness to, an d state support for, Afro-Brazilian culture reached an all-time high with the regime of Lu\u00eds In\u00e1cio \"Lula\" da Silva (2003- 2010). It is under his regime that the state was mo st responsive to efforts on the part of Afro-Brazilian religious practitioners to mobilize politically, as seen in the case of the National Network for Afro-Brazilian Religions and Hea lth. At the same time, however, the relationship between these religions and the st ate is still laden with the tension that prompts such mobilization in the first place. Drawi ng on historical memory, and availing themselves of the current sociopolitical conjunctur e, activists are attempting to rehabilitate the denigrated figure of the Afro-Braz ilian \"feiticeiro\" while at the same time employing its power to negotiate with dominant soci ety, as their ancestors did in the past. The historical \"fusion\" of race and culture noted b y Sweet (2003) has thus furnished the conditions of possibility for contemporary re-imagi nings of Afro-Brazilian ethnicity in the Brazilian political arena. 244 Chapter 7: Afro-Brazilian Religions and Ethnic Iden tity Politics in the Brazilian Public Health Arena The debate about health care within Afro-Brazilian religions raises ethnic/racial issues because it involves spiritual factors that are molded by African ancestrality. This is an ethnic/racial issu e...[The Afro-Brazilian priest] does not use academic or scientific knowled ge to promote health. He uses ancestral knowledge. He uses the instruments h e has gained through his relationship to the sacred. This is an ethnic/racia l issue. [Afro-Brazilian religions'] health care model, practices, and instr uments are all associated with a worldview that is neither Afro-Brazilian nor Japanese\u2014it's African . (Pai Cesar, S\u00e3o Paulo Municipal Health Department, May 2009) Pai Cesar, whom I introduced previously, is a prie st of Candombl\u00e9 in S\u00e3o Paulo who identifies as negro . When he is not presiding over his terreiro (temple) or working at the city's STD/AIDS Program, Pai Cesar lobbies the state to secure better health care for black Brazilians and members of Afro-Brazilian reli gions. With a liberal dose of what Brazilians call \"jogo de cintura\" (something like savoir-faire ), he manages to juggle the realms of Afro-Brazilian religion, public health po licymaking, and health activism simultaneously. Pai Cesar's comments in the above quote exemplify how he and other terreiro health activists construct a health-related identit y through claims to their own racial and ethnic difference\u2014and in particular, to their Afric an-based health beliefs and practices. In so doing, terreiro health activists challenge th e image of the Brazilian universal health care system as color-blind and equally accessible f or all citizens. They simultaneously criticize the system for treating all patients the same, arguing that this actually deepens existing inequalities. In essence, they question th e value of equal treatment upon which the health care system is based, while maintaining that equal access to quality health care (tailored to patients' particular needs) is an inal ienable citizen's right. Like black health 245 activists, terreiro health activists speak of indiv idual patients' particular needs, but in practice they concept of \"niche standardi zation\" (Epstein 2007: passim). Niche standardization is a way of segmenting the populati on and recommending strategies or solutions that apply neither to the whole populatio n nor to the individual, but rather to a particular subset of the population. As Epstein sho ws, within racialized medicine, all members of a chosen subset (e.g., the black populat ion) are assumed to have identical health issues and needs. Niche standardization simpl ifies the selection of target populations for policy and research, but it also ho mogenizes the internal diversity of these populations. Therefore, niche standardization ultim ately fails in its attempt to deliver health care that is responsive to patients' individ ual needs. Instead, it ends up replicating the shortcomings of universalized medicine at a lev el intermediate to the universal and individual levels. Like the black health activists described in Part I I, terreiro health activists represent an elite leadership rather than the rank- and-file membership of terreiros. Prominent terreiro health activists, like Pai Cesar , also belong to the black health epistemic community. That is, they have achieved th e status of experts on the provision of culturally competent health care for the povo-de-santo (members of Afro-Brazilian religions; literally, \"people of the saint\"). Withi n the black health agenda, terreiro members' status as experts of traditional medicine is rarely questioned. Whereas black health activists must cite epidemiological statisti cs and scientific evidence to bolster their claims of unequal treatment, terreiro health activi sts need only reference the centuries-old preservation of their traditional healing knowledge (although, as I show in this chapter, terreiro health activists often seek scientific leg itimacy as well). Terreiro health activists' 246 demands for culturally competent health measures ar e seldom singled out for criticism by those who oppose special health programs for black Brazilians. One exception is the critique leveled by Maio & Monteiro (2005), who obj ect to the black health agenda's emphasis on terreiro-based health practices because , they argue, it narrowly recasts Brazilian popular medicine as African cultural patr imony: The long tradition of cultural interaction develope d during centuries between the Portuguese, the Africans, and indigenous people s which generated a rich and diverse body of medical knowledge in Brazil\u2014ter med 'popular medicine'\u2014ends up reduced to the legacy of the blac k population. Popular knowledge is thus essentialized in order to affirm an 'authentic' black culture. (429) Here, the authors argue that members of the black h ealth epistemic community essentialize Brazilian cultural elements by associa ting them with Africanness in an exclusionary manner. Their argument highlights the fact that the identification of Afro- Brazilian ethnic symbols is contested terrain, rath er than a natural or self-evident process. In the pages that follow, I explore how terreiro h ealth activists deploy racial and ethnic identity politics within the Brazilian publi c health arena to gain recognition and respect for their beliefs and practices, as well as public health goods for their communities. Through discursive acts of identity co nstruction, these activists negotiate between their desire to be recognized as a special- needs group, on the one hand, and their reluctance to abandon the universal identity of Bra zilian citizen, on the other. I show that the resulting tension between particularism and uni versalism ultimately leads to a breakdown in the group's collective identity. The following analysis of the group dynamics of te rreiro health activists is useful for understanding the dynamics of universalism vers us particularism that pervade the 247 black health agenda more generally. In examining th e conflicts that arise through the process of negotiating racial and religious identit ies in relation to health, this chapter highlights the ideological work that goes into cons tructing Afro-Brazilian religion as an essential aspect of black identity (and vice-versa) in Brazil. Although the black health agenda naturalizes the association between Afro-Bra zilian religion and blackness, this link does not exist a priori ; it must be forged discursively. Terreiro Health Activists' Identity Politics Terreiro activists draw on images and language ric h in symbology from Afro- Brazilian religion in order to construct a collecti ve public identity, which then becomes a point of departure for making demands on the state. During events and meetings of the National Network for Afro-Brazilian Religions and Hea lth, religious symbols are put to work in various ways. They are used to affirm the s pecific, collective identity of the group not only as members of Afro-Brazilian religio ns, but also as Brazilian citizens. As I entered the room at the Network's national mee ting in 2006, which took place at a hotel on the beach in Jo\u00e3o Pessoa in nor theast Brazil, I was greeted by a number of large, full-color illustrations of orix\u00e1s with their names printed at the top. Other posters featured photos of Network members in ritual dress. In the front of the room was a large statue of Obaluaiy\u00ea, the orix\u00e1 of epidemic illnesses such as smallpox and, today, AIDS. In accordance with the orix\u00e1's ri tual dress, the statue was adorned with cowry shells and covered from head to toe by a long , thick sheet of raffia. Clay pots and vases decorated the front of the room; some overflo wed with popcorn, while others were decorated with fragrant green leaves that had been scattered all over the display. As I discussed in Chapter 5, popcorn is Obaluaiy\u00ea's ritu al food. It represents the smallpox 248 lesions covering his body, which are believed to be concealed by his raffia costume. During rituals that celebrate Obaluaiy\u00ea, the pai- o r m\u00e3e-de-santo (priest or priestess) often throws popcorn over the heads of terreiro mem bers and bystanders as a sort of good-health benediction. The green leaves and tall- necked vases completing the Network's makeshift altar represented the herbal med icines prepared by Ossain, the orix\u00e1 who guards the secrets of healing plants in the for est. This national meeting, like most other Network meet ings I have attended over the years, commenced with the singing of hymns to the o rix\u00e1s. On that day, the opening ceremony took place on the shore since it was to be followed by a ritual offering to Iemanj\u00e1, the orix\u00e1 of the sea. Men and women of var ious ages and ethnicities stood in a circle, dressed in African-inspired ritual garments . They took turns leading the sung prayers while the others in the circle either clapp ed softly with cupped hands or brushed one hand against another in a regular rhythm. After a few minutes of quiet singing, some Network members began to play atabaque drums. Immediately, the circle began to move, and the participants started to perform the prescri bed ritual gestures and rhythmic dance steps for each of the orix\u00e1s in sequence. Since thi s meeting was taking place in the state of Para\u00edba, there were several practitioners of jurema (a local Afro-Brazilian religion) dressed in black and red; most participants, howeve r, wore white or other light colors. After about half an hour of dancing around the circ le, several people received Iemanj\u00e1 into their bodies. At this point, the crowd greeted the orix\u00e1's arrival joyously, took turns embracing her and kissing her hands while she besto wed her blessings upon them, and finally sent her presents off in a small white boat that had been anchored nearby for this purpose. 249 For passersby witnessing the spectacle in the stre et, there was no mistaking that this was a group of worshippers from Afro-Brazilian religions. A small, barefoot girl standing next to me kept asking me if anyone else w as going to \"virar\" (i.e., receive a spiritual entity) and reported that her grandmother had fallen sick after a juremeiro (practitioner of jurema) had cast a \"catimb\u00f3\" (curs e) on her. She then eyed my long skirt and asked if I was a crente (evangelical Christian) before snickering that the man in the black turban leading the hymn was almost certainly a veado (homosexual). 89 Although many Network meetings are held in non-ter reiro spaces, including hotels, universities, and black movement headquarte rs, activists prepare these spaces by adorning them with religious symbols that mark them as \"Afro-religious.\" They also wear ritual clothing, and begin and end each daily session with orix\u00e1 hymns. In their public meeting narratives, Network activists also us e language strategically to construct a collective, health-related identity that is distinc t from the wider society. During a Network task force meeting on the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the northern Brazilian city of Bel\u00e9m, for instance, a local pai- de-santo spoke about the special kind of health care practiced in terreiros. Before his talk , however, he pronounced several phrases in Yoruba, which prompted the audience to respond r everently with the word \"ax\u00e9\" while clapping slowly several times with cupped hands. Af terward, the pai-de-santo referred praised the \"pre ventive and curative popular medicine\" practiced in terreiros. He then positione d the terreiro's medicine in contrast \"official, allopathic medicine\" and extolled rezadeiras, curadores, and raizeiros as 89 Ironically, her comments echoed those of many Braz ilian adults when I discussed my research with them; even when they did not belong to Afro-Brazili an religions, they tended to believe in members' ab ility to \"curse\" others. Many non-members also criticized the high number of homosexual men in the terreiros . 250 \"health agents for black people.\" 90 Finally, he characterized Candombl\u00e9 as \"tolerant\" and \"humanist,\" observing that it involves caring for p eople without regard to color, gender, or sexual orientation. He contrasted these characte ristics with SUS's alleged discrimination against black people and members of Afro-Brazilian religions. He ended his speech with a Yoruba myth about twin brothers ( ibeji ) who outsmart Death with a magic drum. In this example, the pai-de-santo constructed an i mage of the terreiro as an alternative ethnic and religious space where an oft en superior form of health care is delivered to the community. He not only prefaced hi s speech with phrases in a language that only \"insiders\" could understand, but also lik ened the terreiro to the quilombo, or Brazilian ( comunidades remanescentes de quilombos ) are often invoked by policymakers and black movem ent activists as areas where an \"authentic\" Afro-Brazilian culture has bee n preserved. 91 They claim that quilombos have managed to retain Afro-Brazilian cul ture due to their rural, isolated locations and to their status as alternative societ ies. In fact, terreiros and quilombos are the two \"traditional communities\" most often cited by black movement activists and policymakers as repositories of Afro-Brazilian cult ure. In his comments, the pai-de-santo from Bel\u00e9m drew strategically on this association b etween quilombos, terreiros, and authentic Afro-Brazilian culture. He then described specific healing services, including 90 A \"rezadeira\" or \"benzedeira\" is a traditional fem ale healer who treats illness through prayer. Altho ugh rezadeiras are often associated with popular Cathol icism, this does not preclude participation in Afro - Brazilian religions. In fact, many terreiro leaders whom I have interviewed over the years have report ed either being rezadeiras/benzedeiras themselves, or else having a family member (either ritual or biolo gical) in the terreiro who prayed over sick people. A \"cur ador\" is a traditional male healer. A \"raizeiro\" is a traditional healer who works specifically with root s and herbs. The term \"health agent\" ( agente de sa\u00fade ) refers to the community health workers who visit fa mily homes as part of SUS. 91 See French (2006) for an insightful analysis of id entity discourses related to quilombos. 251 herbal baths and medicines provided by ritual speci alists in the terreiro. Finally, he selected a story that portrays traditional figures from the Yoruba culture (the elected cultural and religious affiliation of most activist s at the meeting) \"beating the system,\" so to speak. These linguistic devices served to reaffi rm Network activists (and, by extension, all terreiro members) as members of a particular cu lture with its own health-related values and practices that differ from, and are in s ome ways opposed to, those of general Brazilian society. Network publications also contain many examples of claims to the terreiro population's unique medical model and culturally in fluenced health needs. In general, these publications are concerned primarily with por traying Afro-Brazilian religion as a health-promoting institution. This is a self-consci ous attempt to reverse the historically stigmatized image of terreiros as unhygienic places . For instance, an article titled \"Afro- Brazilian religions as a protective factor for ment al health\" argues the family following rural-to-urban mi gration (At\u00f3-Ire 2003). The article also refers to trance behavior, adepts' identificat ion with the divinities, and ritual practice as modalities that promote stress alleviation and o verall mental health. Various Network publications also praise Afro-Brazilian religious e xpertise in phytotherapy (herbal medicine) and psychosocial adjustment. As a corollary to emphasizing the health benefits of participation in Afro- Brazilian religions, Network publications also stri ve to demarcate practitioners of Afro- Brazilian religion as a medically specific populati on in its own right, and attribute the 252 religion's persistence to its followers' health exp ertise, as demonstrated in an excerpt from Tambores de Ax\u00e9 (Ax\u00e9 Drums): Devotees of the Afro-Brazilian tradition have a pec uliar way of understanding and caring for health....The principle and practice of caring for those who seek out the terreiro...is what makes t his religion resistant and active through the present day, representing one of the great manifestations of the culture and belief system of the Afro-descendan t population\" (National Network 2004:4). Here, the authors invoke an aura of absolute differ ence. They not only praise Afro- Brazilian religions' medical model, but also attrib ute the terreiros' practice of popular medicine to the religions' historical survival. In statements such as these, traditional health care becomes a primary metaphor for politica l and social survival. While they emphasize the authenticity of tradition al terreiro medicine, Network publications also reveal activists' preoccupation w ith establishing the scientific legitimacy of ritual healing practices. For example , as an article in At\u00f3-Ire Bulletin proclaims, \"After long years of the predominance of allopathic medicine and synthetic remedies of the laboratory, the world turns its att ention to natural medicines\" (At\u00f3-Ire 2003: 4). The article is written by a Tambor-de-Min a priest in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds who states that, for maranhenses (inhabitants of Maranh\u00e3o state), illnesses \"always \" have supernatural causes. His contribution is a striking example of h ow Network activists negotiate between discourses of \"universal\" scientific legiti macy and affirmations of local and regional models of illness causation and treatment. A similar example comes from an article titled \"Ca minhos da Cura\" (Paths of Healing) (At\u00f3-Ire 2002). Its author states that the \"relations between religion and health, which society viewed with disdain until recently, a re beginning to be recognized 253 scientifically today\" (6). He adds that laboratory research has proven the efficacy of herbal medicines used in the terreiros for both org anic and emotional illnesses. In a similar vein, an article written by a psychologist in At\u00f3-Ire Bulletin (Boletim At\u00f3-Ire ) asserts that the medicine practiced in terreiros is holistic and in line with the World Health Organization's stipulation that health is \"a state of complete well-being in physical, mental, and social terms, and not just th e absence of illness\" because terreiros offer \"cuidados\" (preventive care) as opposed to ju st \"tratamentos\" (treatments for existing illnesses) (At\u00f3-Ire 2003: 6). These articl es incorporate markers of scientific discourse, such as allusions to laboratories and me dical procedures, in a way that lends an aura of legitimacy to Afro-Brazilian ritual healing and herbal medicine. Rather than simply stressing the ancestral wisdom and tradition s present in these healing practices, these articles reveal a strategic engagement with b iomedicine as a means of claiming external legitimacy vis-\u00e0-vis the paradigm of globa l public health. At the same time, Network publications often presen t Afro-Brazilian religion as a key essence of black identity in Brazil. In the May 2002 issue of At\u00f3-Ire Bulletin , for example, physician and activist F\u00e1tima Oliveira cha racterizes terreiros as ideal spaces for black health education and promotion because they a re \"trusted by the black population\" (At\u00f3-Ire 2002: 5). In Oliveira's portrayal of Afro- Brazilian religious temples as normative cultural spaces for \"the black population ,\" she invokes the cultural competence principle of patient-provider resemblance; in other words, she assumes that black Brazilians will feel most comfortable receiving hea lthcare advice from a terreiro because its traditional practitioners and Afro-Brazilian cu ltural setting is most familiar to them. However, Oliveira glosses over the significant prop ortion of black Brazilians who do not 254 frequent Candombl\u00e9 terreiros, and in particular, th ose who belong to evangelical Christian denominations that vociferously condemn A fro-Brazilian religion\u2014thereby engendering a strong mis trust of terreiros. In their analyses of various postcolonial and reli gious contexts, scholars have identified ritual healing as a way of engaging mode rnity (e.g., Holston 1999) and confronting the sequelae of colonial and post-colon ial domination (e.g., Taussig 1985, Comaroff 1985). Csordas (1999) argues that ritual h ealing constitutes a complex form of identity politics, and should be treated as more th an just an \"opiate of the masses\" or a kind of symbolic \"subaltern resistance\" in anthropo logical evaluations. I agree with this assessment and have tried to follow suit with my an alysis of the politics of ritual healing discourses in Afro-Brazilian religions. ***** The Brazilian state's new biopolitical project has repercussions that go far beyond the realm of policy. In this section, I connect the re-racialization that is currently taking place within some sectors of Afro-Brazilian religio n to Brazil's burgeoning black health movement. By \"re-racialization,\" I mean a revival o f normative discourses about the kinds of bodies considered most authentic within Af ro-Brazilian religious spaces and practice. As more and more members of Afro-Brazilia n religions join the black health movement, its re-biologized discourses of race circ ulate into the terreiro (temple) and reinforce a racialized politics of religious authen ticity. Although enslaved Africans brought Afro-Brazilian religions to Brazil, increasing numbers of European Brazilians began to participate in them in the decades following abolition. This occurred above all in south and sou theast Brazil, where there is a high 255 concentration of Italian, German, and Portuguese de scendants. Reginaldo Prandi (1991) has observed that the influx of European descendant s into Candombl\u00e9 in S\u00e3o Paulo over the last several decades complicates the identifica tion of terreiros as ethnically \"African\" spaces. During the 1980s, the incursion of whites and Cath olic liturgical elements into Candombl\u00e9 spurred a \"re-Africanization\" movement am ong many prominent terreiros, especially in Salvador. The movement began official ly in 1983, during the II World Conference of the Orix\u00e1 Tradition and Culture in Sa lvador, when a group of famous priestesses issued a manifesto against syncretism w ithin Candombl\u00e9. In Jim Wafer's words, re-Africanization was \"based on the idea of throwing off white domination\" through an attempt to recover and reinstate ritual elements assumed to be purely African (1991:56). Although it was focused on syncretism, t he re-Africanization movement had the general effect of valorizing \"Africanness\" to t he detriment of \"Europeanness.\" Even during the height of the re-Africanization mo vement, however, white members were never prevented from participating, ri sing up through the hierarchical ranks of sacred leadership, or opening their own te rreiros. To do so would represent a rupture with the religions' universalist spiritual orientation, which ostensibly is colorblind. Within the context of Afro-Brazilian re ligion, African ethnicity is available to members of all skin tones. As Cruz (2008) has noted , phenotypically white terreiro members often make the discursive leap between clai ming spiritual \"Africanness\" and identifying as black. I also found this to be the c ase during two and a half years of fieldwork in Brazilian terreiros. As M\u00e3e C\u00edntia exp lained to me, even I would be considered \"negra\" if I were to become an initiate of Afro-Brazilian religion: 256 Because you would be joining a religion that comes from Africa...don't you believe in the spirit?...That's the big issue that people don't understand, that there's much more there than meets the eye. Your so ul definitely passed through Africa. If we look historically\u2014at your spi ritual history\u2014it must have. Otherwise, you would never choose a research project like this one. M\u00e3e C\u00edntia's comments indicate the connection membe rs make between participation in Afro-Brazilian religion and spiritual African-ness. Her last sentence also suggests the extent to which Afro-Brazilian religions are still marginalized in Brazil. The priestess assumed that no one would want to study them unless they had a direct spiritual connection to Africa. Regardless of white members' access to an African spiritual identity, the re- Africanization movement contributed to many whites' feeling marginalized within the religion based on their skin color. Since terreiros began to participate in black health activism during the late 1990s and early 2000s, whi te members' sense of exclusion has increased. This is the case, I argue, because the b lack health movement imposes a biologized conception of race by linking blackness to a variety of health concerns and physical tendencies. Furthermore, as I have establi shed, the black health movement naturalizes the symbolic connection between blackne ss and Afro-Brazilian religion. This is a symbolic and politically mediated choice, and does not reflect the reality that most black Brazilians are Catholics or Protestants. 92 The framing of Afro-Brazilian religion as a synecd oche for black culture is consistent with the Brazilian black movement's exal tation of it as the most tenaciously \"African\" cultural artifact in Brazil. This choice, however, produces palpable tension due 92 Here, I refer to 2000 Brazilian Census data by race /color and religion, reproduced in Prandi (2005). B y \"black,\" I refer to those Census respondents who se lf-identified as preto (black). 257 to the drastically different race ideologies embedd ed within black movements versus Afro-Brazilian religions. In the black health movem ent, race is \"skin deep.\" In Afro- Brazilian religions, by contrast, African ethnic id entity is based on the spirit inside. With the growing participation of members of Afro-Brazil ian religions in the black health movement, however, boundaries between these ideolog ies become increasingly blurred, and tensions skyrocket. During my fieldwork, I witnessed many examples of conflict between phenotypically white and black terreiro activists o ver issues of racial identity. Within the context of the black health agenda, white terreiro members' claims of ethnic \"African- ness,\" as well as Afro-Brazilian religions' ideal o f spiritual colorblindness, are called into question more than ever. During a 2008 convention o f the National Network for Afro- Brazilian Religions and Health in S\u00e3o Paulo, race/c olor tensions reached a flashpoint. It started when M\u00e3e Renata, a newcomer to the Network, complained to the group that she had been feeling excluded. M\u00e3e Dilma, a priestess w ith dark skin and African features, responded: \"Don't give up on the group. Your ancest ors need you, despite the fact that you have white skin.\" Her remark drew sharp critici sm from Pai Edson, a European Brazilian priest who complained that M\u00e3e Dilma was being racist. He added that the Network's focus on black health issues was exclusion ary. \"Creed has no ethnicity,\" he added. \"I came here to see ax\u00e9 [spiritual life force] in action, not to look at p eople's skin color!\" At that point, M\u00e3e Ver\u00f4nica, a phenotypically blac k priestess, attempted to revive the discourse of spiritual universalism. She pointe d out that \"the same orix\u00e1 that enters Pai Edson's head enters mine.\" She meant that she a nd Pai Edson receive the same spirit 258 entities into their bodies during religious ceremon ies. The issue was resolved temporarily when M\u00e3e Dilma apologized for her remark about M\u00e3e Renata's skin color. However, a similar episode occurred at another meeting a few m onths later and Pai Edson resigned from the Network in protest. In spite of the symbolic work done to create a sha red identity among activists from terreiros, there are moments, like the one rec ounted above, when this identity visibly splinters according to differences in racia l and even intra-religious identities. At these moments, the group's unified platform of iden tity narratives and political demands is threatened by a lack of frame resonance. 93 As Burdick (1998a) observes in his study of the Brazilian black movement and popular Catholicis m, \"every ideological position is, at once, an articulation and a marginalization\" (103). Thus, while some of the Network's identity frames resonate with all members, others f ail to do so. When this happens, the group's collective identity \"breaks down,\" so to sp eak, and conflict flourishes. The conflict I recounted above arose from a lack o f frame resonance among light- skinned Network members. In a process similar to wha t Snow et al. (1997) refer to as \"frame bridging,\" the Network combines the \"ideolog ically congruent but structurally unconnected frames\" of terreiro health and black health and includes both causes on its banner (238). Due to the historical association bet ween terreiros and African descendants in Brazil, and to black movements' support for the preservation of terreiros, these two causes are bridged within the Network. The result is , in some cases, member attrition. To put it simply, many Network members of European desc ent, like Pai Edson, identify 93 See Goffman (1974) on the concept of framing exper ience, Gamson (1997) and Snow et al. (1997) on frame alignment and resonance. For excellent discus sions on frame resonance between the Brazilian blac k movement and different religious groups, see Selka (2005), Burdick (1998a, 1998b), and Clarke (1993). 259 strongly with the Network's frame \"we are terreiro m embers\" but not with the frame, \"we are black.\" Even though Pai Edson identifies as negro due to his involvement in Candombl\u00e9, in his daily life outside the terreiro\u2014a nd within the domain of an increasingly racialized health care system\u2014he is co nsidered white. Up to this point, I have presented white members' perceived exclusion from a racialized politics of authenticity within Afro-Bra zilian religions. There is, of course, a range of perspectives regarding this issue. During my fieldwork in terreiros in southeast Brazil, many dark-skinned terreiro members describe d subtle, everyday patterns of racial discrimination against blacks within the terreiro. Pai Cesar, for instance, a black health activist and Candombl\u00e9 priest, recalled his own pai -de-santo's preferential treatment of white filhos-de-santo. According to him, it is stil l quite common in terreiros to see darker-skinned members washing dishes, cooking, and slaughtering animals for ritual sacrifice, while many white members come to the ter reiro only on the day of the xir\u00ea , or public ritual. (I also witnessed this pattern.) He also remarked that when pais- and m\u00e3es- de-santo (priestesses) terreiros' xir\u00eas, they often send white filhos. The same members who complained of racial discrimi nation within the terreiro, however, also expressed the idea that blacks have m ore spiritual capital in Candombl\u00e9. Pai Wilson, the Network coordinator for the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, offended some white members when he stated at a meeting that he would n ever allow a white priest or priestess to initiate him because \"blacks and white s have different ways of doing ax\u00e9.\" No one missed his implication that blacks are more s piritually authentic when it comes to Afro-Brazilian religion. 260 Consider, also, Pai Cesar's comments during an int erview: \"I don't know whether Ogum is stronger in blacks versus whites. What I ca n say is that I can visualize someone's orix\u00e1 much more easily if that person has black skin...So, I'm not racializing the divinity. For me, the divinity is black.\" In other words, Pai Cesar contemplated whether phenotypically black members of Afro-Brazil ian religions are somehow closer to the spirit entities they incorporate. He concluded that black members look more authentic when they receive their orix\u00e1s. In other words, the y present less cognitive distortion for him than a white member might when dancing as Ogum, the orix\u00e1 of steel, because Pai Cesar envisions the orix\u00e1s as black. It is useful to contrast Pai Cesar's comments with Pai Edson's remarks on the issue of racial politics within Candombl\u00e9. During a n interview at his terreiro in Piracicaba, Pai Edson said, \"I think that religion has no ethnicity, race, or color. God has no color...The moment I start to perceive differenc es, I am no longer any good as a religious leader.\" In essence, Pai Edson rejected t he idea that spirit entities \"look\" a certain way, and implied that religious leaders sho uld be colorblind. At the same time, he also implicitly rejected the differential distribut ion of spiritual capital according to phenotype. Contrary to academic assertions that the universal ist ethos of Afro-Brazilian religions minimizes members' recognition of racial differences among them (e.g., Segato 1995, 1998; Prandi 1991, 2005), my ethnographic dat a suggest that race is as alive within the sacred confines of the terreiro as it is in the profane world outside. In addition to everyday patterns of racial discrimination that acc ompany members into the terreiro, an inverse racial ideology accords greater spiritual c apital to darker-skinned members. It is 261 important to note, however, that race becomes an es pecially salient issue among the terreiro members involved in the black health movem ent. These members are exceptionally aware of racial dynamics within the t erreiro because they spend their days discussing racism and healthcare. The tendency of white Candombl\u00e9 members to identif y as black or African indicates that a racialized politics of authenticit y is not new to the terreiro. White members have long desired the greater spiritual cap ital assigned to blackness within Afro-Brazilian religions. What is new, however, is the intensification of biological authenticity based on the growing medicalization of race in Brazil. Hypertension is not just hypertension anymore; for many Brazilian healt h care providers, it is now an \"ethnic illness\" that affects black patients in specific wa ys due to their genetic characteristics. For terreiro members who participate in black heal th activism, the spiritual capital accorded to blacks thus gains a new layer of biolog ical capital; black members can embody the black health cause in a way that white m embers cannot, regardless of their immersion in spiritual African-ness. Whereas in the past, white terreiro members could achieve considerable public recognition by virtue o f their adopted ethnic identity, they are now pre-empted by phenotype from participating fully in the public sphere spawned by black health activism. Culture is expedient, as George Y\u00fadice (2000) argues, but only to a point. After that, re-biologized race, genomic discourses, and the influence of global health governance conspire to transform authenticit y into a commodity that is increasingly essentialized. ***** 262 In the case of the Network, racial identity was no t the only factor that challenged the group's collective identity; religious differen ces also came into play. Since most Network activists belonged to the Ketu \"nation\" or e thnic group of Candombl\u00e9, those activists who practiced Umbanda or another form of Candombl\u00e9 often complained of feeling excluded. For instance, a group of activist s from the \"Angola\" nation of Candombl\u00e9 argued with the rest of the group over th e language to be used in the 2009 theme. Every year, the S\u00e3o Paulo Network chose a the me around which to focus their activities. For 2009, they selected \"women's and fa mily health.\" Initially, the group had decided to include the Yoruba word \"ax\u00e9\" in the the me in order to emphasize its connection with Afro-Brazilian religions. This infl amed the \"Angola\" group, who wanted to use the Bantu word \"gunz\u00f3\" instead of \"ax\u00e9\" (a s ynonym). The episode prompted an in-depth discussion of how the Network tended to pri vilege Ketu/Yoruba references when creating public health materials and planning public events. M\u00e3e Renata, an Umbanda member, also complained that the Network did not actively recruit \"kardecistas.\" She was referring to members of Umba nda, but \"kardecista\" usually designates someone who belongs to Kardecist Spiriti sm. 94 Her comment prompted Pai Cesar to remind the group, \"The Network is a movemen t of Afro-Brazilian religions. Kardecism is not an Afro-Brazilian religion.\" In th is case, Pai Cesar interpreted M\u00e3e Renata's comment as a breach in the movement's coll ective identity frame and moved quickly to correct it. 94 A religion created by Allan Kardec in France durin g the late 19 th century. Like Afro-Brazilian religions, Kardecism is a mediumship religion with a strong em phasis on healing. 263 The preference accorded to Ketu/Nag\u00f4 cultures withi n the Network reflects a wider tendency among Afro-Brazilian religions all o ver Brazil. Commonly assumed to be the \"purest\" form of Candombl\u00e9, the Ketu/Nag\u00f4 model has long enjoyed a high level of prestige both among terreiro members and among acad emic researchers of terreiros. Beatriz G\u00f3is Dantas (1988) links this prestige to t he progressive transformation of terreiros over several decades from Umbanda to \"Ang ola\" to \"Nag\u00f4\" nations. Many of my informants told me they had followed this trajec tory in their own religious lives. In 2006-2008, there were no Network activists in S\u00e3 o Lu\u00eds from the Angola nation, but there the story took another interestin g turn. Candombl\u00e9 is rare in Maranh\u00e3o, and the principal Afro-Brazilian religion there is Tambor-de-Mina. Nevertheless, over the last decade, a handful of Candombl\u00e9 terreiros in th e Ketu/Nag\u00f4 model have appeared. All of these terreiros belong to filhos-de-santo of Cas a Fanti-Ashanti, a Tambor-de-Mina terreiro whose pai-de-santo was himself initiated i n Candombl\u00e9 during the 1980s. Although Candombl\u00e9 is still a minority religion on the Afro- maranhense religious scene, the most active members of the S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Network all practice Candombl\u00e9. This could be due to a lack of frame resonance among Mina members , since the activists from Rio who made the initial contact with S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds also belonge d to Candombl\u00e9. Although Mina terreiros were initially selected to participate in the At\u00f3-Ire project (which led to the creation of the Network), by the time I conducted fi eldwork in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, those terreiros were no longer active in the Network. The pai-de-san to of one of the original Mina terreiros recalled that At\u00f3-Ire had focused primari ly on HIV transmission through initiation and healing rites involving the use of r azors. He pointed out that this issue was not salient in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds because \"[in Tambor-de-Mina ] we don't shave or cut 264 [members]\u2014terreiros that do this transmit the virus through the blood.\" He added that in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, no one ever discusses this mode of transm ission; according to him, it is more relevant in states where Candombl\u00e9 is more common s uch as S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Pernambuco, and Bahia. As for the other Mina terrei ros, I was told that their elderly m\u00e3es-de-santo were uncomfortable with Ato-Ire's pro posal to distribute condoms and hold safer sex lectures within the terreiro. ***** Like black health activists, terreiro health activ ists' discourses often reveal a tension between universalism and particularism. In other words, they often alternate between identifying foremost as Brazilian citizens, on the one hand, and identifying primarily as a different, vulnerable group vis-\u00e0-vi s SUS and Brazilian society more generally, on the other. This tendency emerged in t he comments of Pai Cesar at a S\u00e3o Paulo Network meeting: Our goal is to discuss public health; this Network i s a specific Network, a Network that speaks of health from the point of view of Afro-Brazilian religions and the black population. So, although we discuss general questions like the waiting line in SUS, the privatization of services, the lack of doctors and medications, [we also discuss] more specific is sues such as religious intolerance and racism...we have codes and values a nd principles that aid greatly in health care within our Umbanda and Cando mbl\u00e9 temples. Obaluaiy\u00ea, Iemanj\u00e1, and Oxum, for example, are gods connected to various health issues. If we look to our mythology, our tea chings, we can find [references to] many issues\u2014mental health problems, skin diseases, things that show up often in our own health. In his comments, Pai Cesar drew a distinction betw een general issues that concern all Brazilians who use SUS, and specific issues tha t concern black Brazilians and terreiro members in particular. He conflated the two populat ions, as do many Network activists and publications. He also placed emphasis on the un ique \"codes, values, and principles\" 265 that structure the ways in which terreiro members r elate to health and illness. In so doing, he reaffirmed the existence of significant cultural difference between members of Afro- Brazilian religions and the Brazilian population at large. All of these linguistic devices served to mark the former as a culturally distinct population with culturally specific health beliefs and practices. At the same time, Network activists often utilize r eligious symbols to reinforce general SUS and citizenship values, such as \"social control\" ( controle social ), discussed above. During the S\u00e3o Paulo statewide meeting last November, the Network's national coordinator (an ogan and SUS dentist from Rio de Ja neiro) told the following story about the orix\u00e1 Oxum: Oxum was having some problems, so she decided to ma ke an offering to the king to improve her quality of life. When she arriv ed at the palace, however, she was startled to behold the king's excessive wea lth. She placed her offering in front of the palace gate and began to c riticize the king for having so much while his people had so little. Because of her actions, Oxum became the orix\u00e1 of wealth. The moral of the story is that Oxum won her cause by demanding, not asking for, her rights. We in societ y must do our part in order to secure our rights. In this example, the national coordinator used the religious story as a reference for terreiro members to model the behavior of active \"c itizen\" Oxum. At times, the call to uphold the universalist orie ntation of SUS appeared to be at odds with the goal of demanding recognition for the \"terreiro population's\" particular needs and characteristics. For example, M\u00e3e L\u00eddia s tood up at the Network's national meeting in 2006 and proclaimed, \"We don't want diff erences in healthcare...health is for everybody! [We want] healthcare for all, white peop le, black people, and colored people!\" I occasionally heard kind of \"universalist \" comment from Network activists, 266 although it was not nearly as common as the \"partic ularist\" comments discussed above. Sometimes, however, the same speaker would utter both types of comment, depending on the focus of the discussion. If the focus was on di scrimination against black people and terreiro members in SUS clinics, the first type of comment predominated. When the discussion turned to the need for SUS health profes sionals to respect terreiro members' \"special needs,\" such as religiously mandated dieta ry restrictions, the second type of comment predominated. When invoking the universalist argument, Network ac tivists often cited the Brazilian Constitution. After Pai Edson left the Ne twork, he began to participate increasingly in an inter-religious health movement in Piracicaba. He felt more comfortable with this group, which included SUS adm inistrators as well as health activists from various religions, because its membe rs did not discuss race. When telling me about his reasons for joining the inter-religiou s movement, Pai Edson said: The health care that an evangelical Christian needs is the same kind of health care that terreiro members need. Whites need the sa me healthcare as blacks!.. Health is health, period. Faith is faith, period. W e can't create these differences...in Article V of the Constitution, it says, \"Brazil is a lay state.\"...in other Constitutional articles, it says , \"We are all equal.\" In another Constitutional article, it says, \"We all have a rig ht to healthcare.\"...These are Constitutional articles. In the Constitution, black and white do not exist. In his commentary, Pai Edson rejected the tailoring of health care to patients' particular racial and religious groups. In so doing, he reaffi rmed the principle of equality-in-rights that is upheld by the Brazilian Constitution. Simil arly, M\u00e3e Cintia told me during our interview that the 1988 Constitution made a signifi cant difference in terreiro activists' ability to negotiate with the state: 267 [Now] we are able to speak to quals ( de igual para igual ), and some of our demands are already being approved by the state. One reason is that we now have this right [to negotiate ]. It is guaranteed by the Brazilian Constitution....Sometimes, though, I have to demand my rights (fazer valer meus direitos ). In order to do that, I have to know Article V of the Constitution. Like Pai Edson, M\u00e3e C\u00edntia cited Article V of the B razilian Constitution, which states: \"Everyone is equal before the law, without any mann er of distinction.\"95 In this excerpt, M\u00e3e C\u00edntia emphasized her status as a Brazilian cit izen with full equality of rights before the law. She articulated a changing relationship be tween citizens and the democratic state, a relationship in which citizens have the ri ght to demand their rights. At the same time, she acknowledged citizens' obligation to know the law and to be aware of their state-granted rights, which she implied are not aut omatically protected by the state. Rather, in her view, citizens are responsible for h olding the state to its promise of protecting citizens' full rights. M\u00e3e C\u00edntia brough t this up right after telling me about the discrimination she has faced when going to public c linics or hospitals dressed in her religious regalia (e.g., a head covering, \"African\" dress, and sacred beads). Many Network activists also told me, and expressed to eac h other during meetings, that citizens are responsible for ensuring that the state protect s their rights. They saw this \"watchdog\" role as the primary function of their activism, alt hough they perceived their rights to include not only equal treatment, but also the adju stment of health services to accommodate their special needs (equity). Most of the time, terreiro health activists' disco urses centered on a politics of difference. Occasionally, however, the discourse of citizenship equality reared its head. 95 Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o da Rep\u00fablica Federativa do Brasil de 1 988. Electronic document, available at: http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/c onstituicao.htm.Last accessed April 4, 2011. 268 During my fieldwork, this usually occurred when a p henotypically white or middle-class activist, like Pai Edson and M\u00e3e C\u00edntia, felt exclu ded from the group's collective black identity. At that point, the activist would reitera te the principle of citizenship equality, perhaps in an attempt to revive some semblance of a common purpose with his or her fellow activists. It is important to note that many terreiro health activists saw no contradiction between upholding the universalist, egalitarian mod el of SUS and tailoring public health services to reflect different populations' characte ristics and \"vulnerabilities.\" Activists and SUS administrators who argued that substantive equality can only be achieved through group-differentiated health care appeared t o discard the logical snafu that accompanies claims for \"equal but different\" treatm ent. They seemed to interpret equality not as uniformity of treatment, but rather as the e qual right to be recognized as different (see Taylor 1995). Pai Cesar's comments during an interview illustrat e this point well. First, he stated that institutional racism prevents black Bra zilians ( negros ) from receiving equal access to public health services. When I asked him to clarify, he explained that health services are often delivered in a substandard way t o blacks versus whites. For instance, the doctor might spend less time with black patient s, and consequently miss important diagnoses. His argument was similar to S\u00f4nia's, the black health activist from Chapter 4. Like S\u00f4nia, Pai Cesar's proposed solution was to in stitutionalize \"equity,\" which he defined as \"treating different people unequally...a nd giving more attention to those who need ( tratar this strategy to affirmative action quotas 269 in the university, describing it as a temporary mea sure to \"level the playing field\" (anivelar o campo ). This is the only way, he said, to achieve the goal of equal health for all Brazilians. There is a debate in Brazil between maintaining th e universalist-egalitarian model of SUS and creating health programs that take into account the particular characteristics of patient populations. This debate filters into th e discourses of Network activists, although much of the internal debate within the Net work concerns which specificities should take center stage (i.e., racial/ethnic versu s religious), as opposed to whether specificities should be recognized within health po licy to begin with. The latter question is largely taken for granted by activists. When fac ed with this question, they tend to voice the \"equity\" argument, as I discussed previously. Conclusion In this chapter, I have examined the ways in which terreiro health activists engage the debate on incorporating attention to racial and ethnic differences into the logic and practice of SUS. The debate rages on in Brazil rega rding the best strategy for eradicating black Brazilians' disadvantages in the labor market , the university, and the public hospital. While social movements like the Network ad vocate for the creation of health policies for specific population groups, many non-a ctivist Brazilians and the popular media denounce these strategies as racist and claim that universalist policies are the only effective way to address the consequences of racial inequality. 96 In the midst of this controversy, Network activists continue to wage their politics of difference alongside appeals for egalitarian inc lusion in public health services and 96 For example, see Veja (2006). 270 protection against religious intolerance and racism . The Network provides a fascinating context within which to observe terreiros members' negotiation of universalist and particularist claims because, as (1995, 1998 ) has noted, Afro-Brazilian religions' universal, expansionist ethos often does not accomm odate fixed, essential categories of gender and color, or even recognize the dichotomy b etween \"us\" and \"other,\" but rather blends and incorporates. She argues that Afro-Brazi lian religions' \"cultural codex...resists racialization because it perceives itself as bigger than race and aspires to universality\" (143). But what happens to this ethos when members leave the terreiro, so to speak, in order to participate in mundane public debate with SUS officials? This public sphere, located somewhere at the interstices of religion an d politics, takes on debates and schisms from the wider society. Terreiro members cease to b e \"religiosos\" above all and activate the political aspects of their identities. In this aspect, the Network provides an important counter-example to the image of terreiros as apolit ical, or \"close to magic, far from politics\" (Prandi & Pierucci 1996). However, in kee ping with Segato's characterization of the terreiro as \"encompassing the other,\" Networ k activists engage SUS officials in political debate on their own terms, insisting that their particular worldview and health practices in the terreiro be taken seriously. The problem of delimiting a population of policy b eneficiaries arises constantly within the Brazilian black health agenda. There is constant tension surrounding the definition of this population and its chief health concerns. As a case in point, the terreiro health agenda exists sometimes as part of, and some times separate from, the black health agenda. The phrases \"sa\u00fade da popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra\" (the black population's terreiro\" (the terreiro lation's health) are often used 271 interchangeably among terreiro health activists. Ho wever, there comes a point where they diverge from one another, since many terreiro membe rs are not black in appearance. Although phenotypically white terreiro members may consider themselves spiritually and ethnically African, and even though they may have p henotypically black parents or relatives, within the realm of black health activis m they are not considered black. Despite the geneticizing discourses embedded within the bla ck health agenda, and the spiritually- based African ethnicity that is available within th e terreiro, among themselves activists continue to invoke a racialized politics of authent icity that is decidedly skin-deep. 272 Chapter 8: Health in Black and White Throughout this dissertation, I have examined the tension between universalism and the politics of difference that pervades Brazil 's new biopolitical paradigm of formalizing citizens' racial and ethnic differences in order to promote health equity. I have attempted to convey the complexity of this pro cess, especially given SUS's rootedness in a paradigm of radical equality\u2014equal health care for all. Although black health activists and terreiro health activists main ly express a politics of difference, and an argument of equity, the principle of citizenship eq uality occasionally emerges and complicates their cause. Likewise, although many SU S administrators and providers are amenable to the equity argument, when it comes to i mplementing group-differentiated policies they tend to question their validity on sc ientific as well as legal bases. In Chapter 2, I discussed SUS providers' reluctance to collect patients' race data; in Chapter 6, I recounted how S\u00e3o Paulo's municipal HIV/AIDS depart ment invoked the principle of the lay state to express their opposition to creating h ealth education materials for members of Afro-Brazilian religions. In these ways, agents of the state quietly resist implementing key aspects of the black health agenda. I have argued that the black health agenda, for th e most part, constitutes a politics of recognition, rather than redistribution. Althoug h the Ministry of Health has re- allocated some funds for activists' conferences and for scientific research on black-white health differences, these are, in my assessment, ul timately legless demonstrations of the state's ideological commitment to multiculturalism. That is, its benefits have mostly remained confined to an elite group of activists an d researchers, rather than being distributed to black citizens outside these circles . At the heart of the story lies activists' 273 desire for official recognition of blacks' racial a nd ethnic specificity, and their attempts to institutionalize a more inclusive definition of the black population, rather than their struggle for systemic social change. Accordingly, t he state has obliged these activists' politics of difference but so far has done little t o address the systemic roots of sickness and suffering experienced disproportionately by the millions of pretos and pardos in Brazil. As I mentioned in Parts I and II, epidemiol ogical studies show that black Brazilians have a lower life expectancy than whites , and endure higher rates of myriad health problems including HIV/AIDS, hypertension, a nd infant and maternal mortality (Batista 2004, Barata et al. 2007). However, in the last decade the Brazilian state has substantially improved health care delivery in gene ral to disadvantaged neighborhoods. In her study of quilombo legislation in Brazil, Fr ench (2009) argues that law and social identities are mutually constitutive. Likewi se, in this dissertation I have examined the processes by which Brazil's new health policy f or black citizens has shaped, and been shaped by, activists' adoption and propagation of a black ( negro/a ) identity. Rather than a neutral term for \"black,\" negro has come to signify, within the black health agenda , a special kind of patient with particular health risk s. Concomitantly, the identity of terreiro member has come to signify a culturally distinct pa tient who practices traditional medicine and requires culturally sensitive health c are. In tracing the genealogy of how these once-foreign ideas rapidly became institutionalized within Brazil, I analyzed the bla ck health agenda's ideological ties to transnational entities such as the Pan-American Hea lth Organization and the UK Department for International Development. Through t heir early partnering with civil society organizations and the Ministry of Health, t hese international agencies helped to 274 introduce language and policy models for discussing and addressing health disparities by race into Brazil. Based on these ties, I argued tha t the black health agenda displays elements of transnational governance (e.g., Ferguso n & Gupta 2002). Through contact with transnational organizations and foundations, b lack health activists were able to import discourses concerning the \"vulnerability\" an d special health needs of blacks and of traditional healers from Afro-Brazilian religion s. Moreover, they were able to convince the state to implement policies recognizin g these groups as distinct from the general population, and defining race according to a bipolarized, \"black-white\" schema. Once the idea of separate racial and ethnic groups with special needs entered the logic and practice of SUS, it joined an already-existing debate over universalism and the politics of difference within Brazilian public heal th care. This debate crystallizes around the following question: to what extent should SUS, which is based on equality of access and health services for citizens, accommodate the p articular identities and claimed health needs of different citizen groups? It is important to understand what the tension bet ween the politics of equality and the politics of difference has produced in this cas e. What does it mean for Brazilian citizenship? Furthermore, what does the emergence o f the black health agenda in Brazil indicate about biopolitical governance? First, the Brazilian state's ratification of the black health agenda demonstrates its increasing permeabil ity and responsiveness to citizenship claims regarding racial and ethnic inequalities. I contend that the state's increasing willingness to entertain the demands of racial and ethnic minorities stems from its desire to promote a global image of Brazil as a tolerant, socially progressive, multicultural nation. My data also indicate that while special tr eatment for specific kinds of citizens 275 may be \"business as usual\" for the Brazilian state, it is not necessarily so when it comes to race. Health care providers' and patients' resis tance to new norms of racialized medicine substantiate this point. Brazilians' toler ance for special treatment seems to break down over race-based differentiation in a way that does not occur when elderly SUS patients are automatically moved to the front o f the line, or when women retire five years earlier than men with full social security be nefits. Thus far, Brazil's new mode of biopolitical gover nance has produced increased essentialism in the public sphere and increased str ife over the perceived divisiveness of affirmative action policies\u2014the latter is particula rly visible in SUS clinics and hospitals when patients resist racial classification. Amplifi ed racial and ethnic essentialism emerges in state publications about the special vul nerabilities and health needs of black Brazilians and members of Afro-Brazilian religions. Racial essentialism also pervades the discourses of black health activists, and it underl ies the recent surge in Brazilian biomedical research that presupposes the existence of genetic \"racial\" differences. The black health agenda has begun to alter Brazilian sc ientific research agendas by providing public incentives for studies that emphasize race a s an independent variable and classify research subjects by \"black\" ( negro ) and \"white\" ( branco ). This shift in scientific policy is demonstrated by, for instance, the Ministry of H ealth's increasing calls for sponsored research on issues pertaining to \"sa\u00fade da popula\u00e7\u00e3 o negra.\" Over time, this new mode of biopolitical governanc e will likely affect the way Brazilians understand and define race. 97 By propagating a bipolarized scheme of racial 97 See, for example, Evans' (1997) account of the Sout h African apartheid regime's (and specifically, the Department of Native Affairs') utilization of a ser ies of administrative and bureaucratic practices th at gradually normalized the idea of racial separation among the population. Evans shows how administrativ e 276 classification and endowing it with an aura of scie ntific authority, the black health agenda may encourage Brazilians to see racial differences in terms of black and white. To date, it has already produced subtle changes in the way many health care providers perceive their patients' identities and health care needs. This is particularly true for providers who have undergone cultural sensitivity training ( sensibiliza\u00e7\u00e3o ), but is not limited to them. For black health and terreiro health activists, Brazil' s new biopolitical paradigm has produced increased prestige and public recognition, not to m ention increased legitimacy in the public sphere, for the traditional healing knowledg e of practitioners from Afro-Brazilian religions. The black health agenda has also generat ed a new area of technocratic expertise that, in turn, has provided employment for some bla ck health activists\u2014although posts are often temporary and reportedly under-funded. Ac cording to several of my informants, the black health agenda has resulted in co-optation of black health activism by incorporating activists into the government, and th us neutralizing their ability to express opposition to the state. These activists report joi ning the state both for pragmatic reasons (i.e., to make a living) and based on their convict ion that they could bring about more change from the inside. All too often, however, the y have found that being part of the state machinery limits their power due to the entan glements of bureaucracy and the vicissitudes of state budgetary planning. For individuals engaged in black health activism, the black health agenda often provides the raw ideological material for construct ing an essentialized black identity. Black health activists (and perhaps other Brazilian citizens who are not activists but identify as negro ) develop new technologies of the self in relation to changes in technologies can convey ideas of governance that, t hrough repetition, eventually become accepted as routine and self-evident. 277 governmentality. Whereas in the past these citizens might have located black identity primarily in phenotype or in Afro-Brazilian cultura l expressions, they can now reference a biological layer of black identity that lies belo w the surface of the skin. By claiming recognition for specific health issues that affect the black population, especially sickle cell anemia, activists can invoke another source of specificity related to blackness in Brazil. As discussed in previous chapters, this has been a significant challenge for black movement activists in Brazil due to the primacy of mesti\u00e7agem ideology. While it is undeniably important to remedy health disparities arising from structural racism, the reinforcement of essential r acial differences may have unintended consequences. In this dissertation, I have examined these pitfalls and presented a number of arguments. First, I argued that the Brazilian bl ack health agenda is strongest where it proposes to correct health disparities caused by st ructural racism, and weakest where it applies a genetic model to explain morbidity patter ns among black Brazilians. Since many studies have demonstrated that the darker one' s skin, the worse his or her life chances in Brazil (e.g., Lovell & Wood 1998), it is not unreasonable to target brown- and black-skinned people for a health policy that propo ses to address the health effects of racism. When black health advocates introduce a gen etic model to connect race and illness, however, I argue that they commit the corr elation-causation fallacy. The net effect of employing a genetic model to explain high er rates of illnesses such as hypertension and diabetes among black Brazilians is to divert blame from social factors such as exclusion and to place it on a \"black\" geno type. Another potential consequence is to cast black Brazilians as inherently more vulnera ble to these illnesses when higher prevalence rates may reflect environmental stressor s related to racism. 278 The main problem I perceive with black health advo cates' geneticizing discourses, however, is the way they use race categ ories, including the mapping of U.S. \"black-white\" racial distinctions onto the Brazilia n population. Following Graves (2001), I suggest that the important question is not whethe r disease-related gene frequencies vary between clinal populations\u2014they obviously do\u2014but in stead \"whether genetic variation for disease incidence can map the socially defined categories of race\" (186). Graves concludes, as I have, that it cannot; the two are i ncommensurable. A comparative framework destabilizes claims about biological \"rac e\" and health outcomes even further. How can \"race\" be a robust independent variable whe n systems of racial classification vary substantially from one context to another? A related objection to the genetic approach is tha t black health activists' genetic discourses are incompatible with their reliance on self-declared phenotype to define who is black. Studies have shown a weak correlation bet ween phenotype and ancestry in Brazil, prompting Brazilian geneticist S\u00e9rgio Pena to deem the correlation \"practically non-existent\" (2005:341). It thus becomes difficult for activists and policymakers to specify how much African ancestry one must possess in order to be considered \"at risk\" for target illnesses. I have argued that activists' calculation of the black population (over fifty percent of the total population) may not adeq uately capture genetic markers for illnesses such as sickle cell anemia. This point lo ses significance, however, when one realizes that activists are not trying to be scient ifically accurate. As I stated in Chapter 4, activists are aware that there is no such thing as a \"black\" disease. Their classification of sickle cell anemia as a black health concern was a calculated political move. Although there are clear indicators that pretos and pardos have worse health outcomes in a number 279 of areas, it is much more difficult to pinpoint the cause. Thus, at least in the beginning of the black health movement, activists found it more expedient to claim sickle cell as a black disease. Politically speaking, genes tend to be less problematic than allegations of diffuse structural racism\u2014particularly in a nation that once prided itself for being a racial democracy. I also argued that cultural competence strategies within the black health agenda strategically reinforce the idea of essential cultu ral difference between blacks and non- blacks by imputing ownership of Afro-Brazilian reli gion to citizens who are phenotypically black. Cultural competence materials and projects for the black population end up distilling black culture to one m ain ingredient\u2014Afro-Brazilian religion. I suggested that the black health agenda' s emphasis on defining the parameters of Afro-Brazilian culture indicates a rejection of cultural assimilationism and an attempt to carve out a distinct cultural identity for the b lack population within public policy. This effort reflects the ideological orientation of the Brazilian black movement, whose cultural platforms have often celebrated Afro-Brazilian reli gion as an emblem for black identity in Brazil (Burdick 1998, Pagano 2002). Within the b lack health agenda, Afro-Brazilian religion becomes the metonym for a holistic, authen tic, and autonomous Afro-Brazilian culture, with its own medical knowledge that is com plementary in some ways (e.g., phytotherapy, or plant medicine) and superior in ot hers (e.g., its psychosocial component) to the dominant biomedical orientation of SUS. I have therefore identified several problems of th e black health agenda relating to bioreductionism or cultural reductionism. I view th e black health agenda as an example of strategic essentialism that aims to ameliorate h ealth disparities produced over time 280 through social stratification along racial lines. T he problem with strategic essentialism, however, is that it can backfire by reifying biolog ical and cultural differences among social groups (see Conklin 1997). Black health acti vists attempt to harness and transform existing patterns of racialization and exclusion. I n striving to define and delimit a black population whose needs and modes of suffering diffe r from the masses of impoverished Brazilians, they end up reinforcing the idea of ess ential racial difference. I do not mean to suggest that the state should tak e no political action to combat health inequalities between people from different r acialized groups. To the contrary, I believe that discrimination based on social race ca tegories can dramatically affect health outcomes, and that state policies are necessary to address them. What I am problematizing here are the possible unintended con sequences of Brazil's black health agenda, such as increased polarization between peop le identified as black ( negro/a ) versus white ( branco/a ). Although the black health agenda purports to app ly only to those who self-identify as negro/a , I have shown that many health care providers negl ect to give patients this choice. Consequently, patients i dentified as negro/a often have no freedom of association with, or exit from, the blac k health agenda. 98 Some aspects of the black health agenda, such as its focus on reducing unconscious racial discrimination in health care, are helping to reduce health dispariti es in Brazil. Others, as I have shown, tend to reduce the complex interaction in Brazil of racial identity, socioeconomic status, and biological processes to oversimplified accounts of health in black and white. 98 See Kymlicka (1995) on the importance of the freedo ms of association/exit for maintaining fundamental individual rights within the context of group-diffe rentiated policies. See Doppelt (1998) for an incis ive critique of these aspects of Kymlicka's theory. 281 Bibliography Agamben, Giorgio 1996 Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life.
