Investigation into the ethnohealth and ethnocaring practices of the northern Lakota Sioux bands has been lacking in nursing and anthropological research. Likewise, research about modern women in shamanistic training is limited to two studies, neither of which centers on healing practices. This study employed a blend of ethnonursing and phenomenological approaches to: (a) explore and explicate the cultural modes of health and caring among the Hunkpapa band of the Lakota Sioux who reside on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota and South Dakota and (b) to generate a description of medicine-woman apprenticeship. Data collection entailed participant observation, dialogal interviews, and semistructured interviews guided by orienting theory. The results produced an ethnonursing account of health and caring practices of this particular cultural group. Conceptual categories of ethnohealth and ethnocaring were constructed using indigenous terms. The researcher's encounters as an adoptive member of the Hunkpapa kinship network and as an apprentice medicine woman yielded a descriptive, experiential account of traditional healing ways as experienced by a nurse practitioner. An account and analysis of the nurse's endeavors to incorporate ethnohealth and ethnocaring practices into her professional practice concluded the study. It was determined that the use of ethnohealing interventions initiated by the nurse must take into consideration kinship ties, client expectations, and the professional scope of nursing practice. v To Joseph Flying Bye and the people of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe CONTENTS ABSTRACT . . . . . . iv .

Special thanks go to the reservation's Tribal Council and to Mr. Charles Murphy, Chairman, for their permission to pursue this study. Drs. Joyceen Boyle, Judith Maurin, Sharon Sims, . Patricia Albers, and Charles Hughes formed the author's dissertation committee and are commended for their invaluable guidance and support. Administrative support and personal encouragement was gratefully received from Mr. Christopher Jones and Mr. John Gobert, members of the Indian Health Service. The author is indebted to her husband, Mr. Lawrence Small, and her family for their interest, shared thoughts and experiences, and supportive presence. Lastly, a special word of thanks to Mr. Joseph Flying Bye, whose acceptance of the author into his family and his medicine ways touched her spirit and enabled her to explore the depths of the Lakota red road. As the author begins the retelling of her research, she echoes the sentiments of Mr. Flying Bye: \"I wish I was a worthy person that I could be talking good, using the word that was good to hear; but my language is kind of poor. At least I can teach somebody of the greater things that I know.\" Mitakuye oyasin. xi CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION Joe Sierra had tuberculosis real bad. The hospital said he was going to die. They gave him a lot of medicine and he had a vision. He was wandering off in some desert. Somebody told him to pray to his grandfather. At first, he thought of his natural grandfather. But the voice kept on repeating: \"Remember your grandfather.\" Then, he thought of his great grandfathers and other grandfathers in an Indian way. But, he kept on hearing the voice. Then, all of a sudden it dawned on him what the voice was saying and he prayed to Grandfather, the Great Spirit and he came out of it and got well. (Weasel Bear, 1984, p. 115) Lame Deer, a Lakota spiritual leader and medicine man, explained the importance of indigenous meanings in all parts of a Native American's life, including healing: We Indians live in a world of symbols and images where the spiritual and the commonplace are one. To you [the non-Indian] symbols are just words, spoken or written in a book. To us they are part of nature, part of ourse1ves--the earth, the sun, the wind and the rain, stones, trees, animals, even little insects like ants and grasshoppers. We try to understand them not with the head but with the heart, and we need no more than a hint to give us the meaning. (Lame Deer & Erdoes, 1976, pp. 96-97) For the American Indian, symbols are more than printed or spoken words, intellectually analyzed. Symbols hold culturally-relevant meanings that touch spiritual, psychological, social, and physical aspects of individuals or groups. The discovery of the meaning of the vision led to Joe Sierra's recovery from an illness deemed terminal by the white medical system. The meaning was more than personal; it was grounded in a prime cultural concept. Sierra's grasp of the meaning of \"grandfather\" as Great Spirit instead of a personal ancestor appears to have brought about healing on a physical--and possibly a holistic--level. Understanding the cultural meanings of health and illness and their symbols is essential to the provision of effective and culturally-sensitive caring (ethno- caring) practices to maintain personal and group 2 well-being (ethnohealth) (Leininger, 1985b). Although all cultures have evolved ways of preserving health and of coping with illness, a large gap in the knowledge of ethnohealth and ethnocaring practices exists (Leininger, 1978a; Ness & Wintrob, 1981). Rather than investigate the cultural interpretations of health and illness, much research has been aimed at fitting indigenous health care systems into a biomedical framework. Hammerschlag (1982) comments on the ethnomedical research conducted on American Indian cultures: This disenfranchised group, who have been epidem\u00ad iologically studied ad nauseum, has been judged to be ill and vulnerable. Having made this diag\u00ad nosis, we then attempt to treat their illnesses although we provide treatment based on a fla\u00ad grantly dysfunctional concept. (p. 32) Culturally-relevant knowledge of caring practices is of the utmost importance to nursing, which has as its primary aim the provision of care (Leininger, 1981b). According to Glittenberg (1978), \"the dimension of cultural beliefs is seen as one of the most powerful determinants of health behavior\" (p. 1291). Culturally- induced illnesses (e.g., susto, the magical fright of the Hispanic; and stress-induced cardiovascular impairments of the American) can be observed in every society (Glittenberg, 1978; Rubel, 1977). The role of the healer takes on varying levels of significance, scopes of practice, and responsibilities in each community (Glittenberg, 1978). Without knowledge about the health behaviors, illnesses, and healing roles of specific 3 cultural groups, nurses will find difficulty in achieving efficacious care for members of these groups. The research problem, then, lies in the lack of ethnocaring and ethnohealth knowledge in nursing science. The clinical problem stems directly from the research problem. If, as Leininger (1981b) states, every nursing act is rooted in ethnocaring (i.e., cultural caring patterns), a lack of ethnocaring knowledge prevents therapeutic nursing care. Effective nursing interventions are achieved through sensitivity to cultural values, beliefs, and traditions (Walker, 1978). Once a body of ethnocaring knowledge has been established, practical nursing interventions may be developed to meet the health needs of all clients. 4 What is needed in modern health care systems, in both developing and developed societies, is systematic recognition and treatment of psychosocial and cultural features of illness. That calls for a fundamental reconceptualization of clinical care and the restructuring of clinical practice (Kleinman & Sung, 1979). General Aims Only by understanding the cultural meanings of health and illness can the nurse provide appropriate care. The clinical problem involves ways to incorporate ethnocaring and ethnohealth knowledge into clinical practice. It may be that it is a nurse who suggests to Joe Sierra: \"Remember your grandfather.\" In response to the research problem, this study focuses on developing a knowledge base involving the ethnohealth and ethnocaring practices of a particular American Indian culture, the Lakota Sioux. The clinical problem involves using the knowledge base to develop culturally-sensitive caring behaviors to improve health care. The clinical focus of this study is aimed at directly experiencing ethnocaring practices as an apprentice practitioner of Lakota healing methods. The researcher anticipated that this experience and the knowledge resulting from it would enable her and other nurses to develop a core of ethnocaring practices applicable in the clinical setting. Purposes of the Study 5 The primary purpose of this study is to explicate ethnohealth and ethnocaring among the Lakota. This purpose was pursued throughout the researcher's apprenticeship as a Lakota medicine woman in the practice of Bear and Eagle medicine, two of the Lakota healing practices. Research Questions The two research questions are: 1. What are the ethnohealth and ethnocaring practices among the Lakota? 2. What is the experience of becoming a prac\u00ad titioner of Bear and Eagle medicine? Significance of the Study To date, only two studies of modern women in shamanistic training have been published: one by a doctoral student in anthropology in Venezuela (Donner, 1985) and a second by an art collector/dealer in Manitoba (Andrews, 1981). Donner became a spiritual medium; Andrews became an apprentice to a medicine woman and learned about the power of the spiritual warrior. Neither focused on healing. This study, in contrast, centers on the ethnocaring behavior of the Lakota Sioux healer as observed from the eyes of an apprentice. This study is the first in a series of inquiry that will proceed from the education of the aspiring healer (the becoming), to the clinical practice of the nurse-healer 6 as ethnocaring professional (the being), and finally to the education of other nurses in ethnocaring practice (the sharing). Becoming a Lakota Sioux healer is a highly personal, subjective experience and one that has heretofore not been available to nurses. The description of the experience of Sioux healing education facilitates explication of ethnohealth and ethnocaring practices and may generate insights into professional nursing care. CHAPTER II REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE The literature review begins with a conceptual framework of caring as the prime focus of professional nursing practice. Ethnocaring concepts extend the nurse's role to cultures other than his or her own and provide a foundation for efficacious and culturally\u00ad sensitive health care for all people (Leininger, 1978d). Next, ethnocaring apprenticeships are reviewed in an attempt to discover major similarities and differences in education, personal traits, and social qualifications of healers in different cultural groups. These similarities and differences establish a reference point for future comparison with Lakota healer apprenticeship. Leininger (1978d) states that in order to effectively care for an individual or group, it is necessary that the nurse be aware of \"how a local culture perceives, knows and practices caring or nursing care activities\" (p. 34; italics in the original). Influencing the perceptions, knowledge base, and caring practices of a society are its history and cultural traditions. Thus, a review of his\u00ad torical and cultural perspectiv0s of the Sioux nation is presented. This section conforms to Leininger's (1978e) Transcultural Health Model, Level I, which deals with a culture's social structure and includes political, social, and cultural domains for study and analysis. \"Ascertaining the dominant features of [these] systems is essential in order to determine their relationship to health care system features\" because \"all health care systems are nestled in and closely interrelated to the social structure of a society\" (p. 70). 8 Level II of Leininger's (1978e) Transcultural Health Model deals with cultural and health care values as domains of inquiry. An overview of traditional Lakota ethnocaring practices focuses on dominant cultural values guiding the ethnohealer's practice. A brief summary concludes the literature review. Conceptual Framework Caring Care is the fundamental expression of authentic being (Dasein) (Heidegger, 1982). For nurses, caring is the cardinal focus of the art and science of their profession (Leininger, 1978a,b,c,d; Watson, 1981). Leininger (1981b) defines caring as \"those assistive, supportive, or facilitative acts toward or for another individual or group with evident or anticipated needs to ameliorate or improve a human condition or lifeway\" (p. 9). Watson (1979) lists 10 carative factors involved in nursing science: 1. The formation of a humanistic-altruistic system of values. 9 2. The instillation of faith-hope. 3. The cultivation of sensitivity to one's self and to others. 4. The development of a helping-trust relation\u00adship. 5. The promotion and acceptance of the expression of positive and negative feelings. 6. The systematic use of the scientific problem\u00ad solving method for decision-making. 7. The promotion of interpersonal teaching-learn\u00ad ing. 8. The provision for a supportive, protective, and (or) corrective mental, physical, sociocultural, and spiritual environment. 9. Assistance with the gratification of human needs. 10. The allowance for existential-phenomenological forces. (pp. 9-10) These carative factors are deeply rooted in personal interactions, are derived from humanistic philosophy, and aid the client in maintaining or improving health or in achieving a peaceful, dignified death. Different theorists place different emphases on the primary focus of caring. For Leininger (1987d), care as a transcultural phenomenon is foremost, affecting individuals and communities within their cultural contexts. For Watson (1985), caring takes place most importantly at the level of the individual--ideally reflecting the I-Thou relationship described by Martin Buber (1958). Benner (1984) appears to combine the above views by asserting that \"caring is embedded in personal and cultural meanings and commitments\" (p. 171). For Benner, caring is the mark of the expert nurse and carries with it six types of power: transformative, 10 integrative, advocacy, healing, participative/affirma\u00ad tive, and problem solving. Transformative power refers to the nurse's ability to assist the client (or to engage oneself) in altering perspectives, attitudes, and beliefs about one's situation to promote understanding. Integra\u00ad tive power aids the client to adapt to the situation meaningfully, despite limitations imposed by illness, distress, and the like. Advocacy power underscores the role of the nurse as the interpreter/health facilitator between the client and the health care system. Healing power is the ability to promote hope, to discover meaning within a situation that is acceptable to the client, and to help the client to utilize available support systems. \"A healing relationship solicits the patient's internal and external resources and empowers the patient by bringing hope, confidence, and trust\" (p. 213). Participative/affirmative power involves mobilizing the nurse's own resources and sense of meaning to act compassionately. It requires involvement rather than detachment. Problem-solving power evolves from the creative use of perception and reasoning to arrive at a better understanding of the meaning of the situation. Throughout each of these perspectives is a dominant theme: interactive participation between nurse and client, whether that takes place at a transcultural or transpersonal level. Supporting this notion are Hames and Joseph (1986), who use the terms \"helping\" and \"caring\" interchangeably. Helping, defined as assisting 11 a person in need, involves interaction and the establish\u00ad ment of a relationship between helper and helpee. Nelson (1978) notes that noncaring involves insensitivity, immunity, and detachment; whereas, caring requires the risk of involvement, sensitivity to self and others, and openness. Ethnocaring Leininger (1978d) believes that this involvement, sensitivity, and openness can only be achieved through an understanding of the client's cultural context. Health-oriented behavior that reflects the caring patterns of a particular cultural group is termed ethnocaring. Such cultural care methods are used to maintain or improve individual or group well-being, or ethnohealth (Leininger, 1985b). Leininger (1978a) contends that ethnocentrism is a threat to efficacious health care which can only be countered by broadening the care provider's world view. Research into the lifeways and caring practices of others provides a method for paradigm-expansion and thus, for improved health care. Leininger (1981a,b) offers some basic assumptions for guiding ethnocaring research: 1. Caring is a transcultural phenomenon. 2. Each culture has its own modes of caring. 3. Caring behaviors are expressed through cultural institutions which function at individual and societal levels. 4. Curing cannot occur in the absence of caring. 5. No nursing action is bereft of ethnocare implications. 12 Ethnocaring constructs suggested for study are: comfort, compassion, concern, coping, empathy, enabling, facilitating, interest, involvement, health consultation, health instruction, health maintenance, helping, love, nurturance presence, protection, restoration, sharing, stimulation, stress alleviation, succorance, support, surveillance, tenderness, touching, and trust (Leininger, 1981b). An outline of the knowledge-generating phases involved in ethnocaring research is presented by Leininger (1985a). Phase 1 is the discovery phase, which sets the foundation for basic scientific development. Phase 2 is the application phase which has as its focus professional practice situations (see Figure 1). Leininger (1985a) further distinguishes research scopes and theory levels by three divisions. Macro-, middle-, and microscopes of research correspond with high, mid-, and low levels of theoretical abstraction, respectively. These distinctions aid the nurse in setting research goals which are best suited to his or her Phase 1 Phase 2 Discovering Substantive Applying the Knowledge Knowledge Practice Situations (Basic Science Focus) (Professional Focus) Focus is upon discovering basic Focus is ~on critical testing of or substantive knowledge to know phenomenon fully knowle ge for practical or applied uses Research goals include: Research goals include: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

Variety among research methods and theories is encouraged. \"Diver\u00ad sity ... is essential to discover the true nature and essence of nursing knowledge and practice\" (p. 44). 14 The \"Sunrise Model\" (Leininger, 1985a) incorporates the research phases and different theory levels into a model illustrating the multiple facets of ethnocaring research (see Figure 2). The model represents a dynamic pattern of cultural influences of health care and places nursing in the position of advocate between the folk and professional health systems. Summary of the Conceptual Framework In summary, caring is the dominant focus of nursing. All care practices are rooted in the cultural contexts of those involved, but lack of ethnocaring research has limited nursing's knowledge of culturally-based health and healing practices. As ethnocaring research serves to develop a scientific and humanistic body of knowledge specific to nursing, it is imperative that nurses explore the caring behaviors of diverse cultures in order to generate basic scientific and professionally applicable knowledge. Diversity in the scope of study and in the level of theory development are necessary for deepening nursing's understanding of human care--an understanding intrinsic to the improvement of health care for all people. l.t'VI'U of A~/rfl\u00a3fllJn & :\\ntJ(vm l.

Leininger (Ed.), Qualitative research methods in U1 16 The Education of Healers Caring, like many other human actions, is a set of learned behaviors. Just as nurses are educated in the practice of care, so too are the ethnohealers of other cultures (Leininger, 1978b; Taylor, 1982). This section reviews selected literature on ethnohealer apprenticeships throughout the world. Much of the research that has been conducted on the healing practices of other cultures has included descriptions--usually brief--of the healer's training. Taylor (1982) surveyed anthropological literature on 30 traditional practitioners from 22 societies in 18 countries. This researcher has reviewed ethnohealing research from an additional 10 societies, bringing the sample to a total of 32 societies studied. Table 1 lists these societies and their locations. Several important points may be gleaned from this review: (a) the education of healers is a cultural phenomenon; (b) the potential healer receives a \"call\" or is otherwise chosen for this vocation; (c) personal qualifications are essential for successful practice, while social qualifications are not important; (d) the structure of the training is highly variable. These points will be discussed in greater detail below.

These culturally-defined needs determine the definitions of health and illness within a society and affect the presence or absence of symptoms, the severity of the symptoms, the priorities assigned to them by the client and society, and the choice of caring methods, prac\u00ad titioners, and facilities (Wender & Klein, 1981). Murdock, Wilson, and Frederick (1978) developed four categories of illness-causation theory into which fall all culturally-defined illnesses: 18 1. Natural causation: illness due to physiological factors (e.g., infection, trauma); 2. Mystical causation: illness due to an impersonal agent acting in response to an act or experience of an individual or group (e.g., fate, premonitions, cosmic retribution); 3. Animistic causation: illness due to a personal supernatural agent (e.g., soul loss, spi~it possession); 4. Magical causation: illness due to the efforts of a person using magical power (e.g., sorcery, witchcraft). One or more of these theories may be adopted by a culture to explain physical or psychological impairments. Traditional healing focuses on providing care that is grounded in the cultural definitions of health and 19 illness. It is the task of the apprentice to become familiar with the theoretical framework of healing within the culture and the caring behaviors required for therapeutic interventions. The \"Call\" to Healing as a Profession An individual becomes aware of the possibility/ opportunity of becoming a healer usually through a dream or vision, through inheritance from a healer-kin, through the choice of an unrelated healer, or through self- initiated, voluntary enrollment into a training program. Following the \"call\" may be voluntary or involuntary, under the threat of divine punishment (Taylor, 1982). Personal and Social Qualifications The personal qualifications most frequently cited in the literature are \"superior intelligence, memory, and interest [in healing]\" (Taylor, 1982, p. 20), personal power, the intent to heal, charisma, and a strong moral character (Balzar, 1983; J. Flying Bye, personal communication, 1983; Glick, 1967; Katz, 1982; Spiro, 1967; Turner, 1977). Levi-Strauss initially believed that shamans and sorcerers were basically neurotic but later changed his opinion. In only one study (Geertz, 1977) did the author note a lack of outstanding character traits among ethnohea1ers: As to personality, nothing seems to set the leading [shamans] off from their neighbors. They show no unusual character traits and no obvious neurotic behaviors, nor are they considered peculiar by others. (p. 148) 20 With the exception of three societies, the gender of the healer was not a determining factor for success in practice. Only males can become healers in Ufipa, Tanzania, or exorcists in Upper Burma. Upper Burmese shamans, however, are predominantly female, with the minority of males described as \"homosexual (manifest or latent), transvestite, or effeminate (and sometimes all three)\" (Spiro, 1967, p. 220). Rogers and Evernham have (1983) mentioned a third group of healers, \"herb women\" among the Diegueno Indians of Southern California, who are, exclusively, elderly females practicing herbal medicine. Neither social nor marital status appears to be a consideration in apprenticeship or in healing practice (Taylor, 1982). However, sexual continence and adherence to social mores are sometimes mentioned as behaviors which establish the healer's role in society (Spiro, 1967; Turner, 1977). The Structure of the Training The education of the apprentice-healer is highly variable with regard to length of time, initiation rites, and content. 21 Time Apprenticeship may take a few months or may stretch to several years. Among the Kalahari Kung, apprentices learn the craft over a period of years, frequently beginning in childhood and continuing through adulthood (Katz, 1982). Among the Burmese, would-be exorcists may complete their training within 6 months if they reside with their teachers. Otherwise, the training period may be greatly extended (Spiro, 1967). Bergman's (1973) study of a formal education program for Navajo healers noted that apprentices who had entered the school in 1969 were still pursuing their education 4 years later. Morgan (1977) stated that Navajo singers may continue their training for 15 years, depending on their ability to commit to memory the many chants and healing practices required. Initiation Rites Some societies hold initiation rites for appren\u00ad tices. Fasting and entrance into a trancelike state in which the aspirant acquires spiritual power mark the initiation ritual among the Diegueno Indians (Rogers & Evernham, 1983). The ceremonial, symbolic death of the apprentice sometimes underlies the entrance into the healing society of the Siberian Khanty (Balzer, 1983). The Jivaro apprentice in Equador offers a gift to the teacher and then imbibes a hallucinogen (Harner, 1978). 22 Educational Content The content of healer education varies from society to society. First, knowledge may be obtained through a variety of means: from visions or dreams, from informa\u00ad tion handed down from healer to apprentice, and/or from books (Taylor, 1982). The types of knowledge needed for practice cover a vast range from dream interpretation to botany. As was mentioned earlier, the Navajo must learn many chants and practices verbatim (Bergman, 1973; Morgan, 1977). The Kalahari Kung learn the mastery of healing energy through \"an experiential passage, rather than an acquisition of information\" (Katz, 1982, p. 118). Of secondary importance is the mastery of ceremonial songs and their guidelines for composition and performance. The Siberian Khanty apprentice's education focuses on memorization of songs and formulas, care of seance paraphernalia, the use of hallucinogenic substances for inducing altered states of consciousness, physical exertion, dramatic story-telling techniques, diagnostic skills, prescription of culturally-therapeutic tasks, and conduction of a soul through the spiritual realm (Balzer, 1983). Among the Diegueno Indians, use of healing power and the proper conduction of healing rites are studied (Rogers & Evernham, 1983). Javanese apprentices, who learn their skills from an incumbent healer, study 23 diagnosis techniques (e.g., numerology, meditation, and symptom analysis) while increasing their healing energy (Geertz, 1977). The Burmese exorcist-apprentice not only studies tactics for expelling spirits, but also develops a moral character in accordance with Buddhist teachings (Spiro, 1967). Henry Rupert, a Washo Indian shaman between the late 1800s and early 1900s, developed his healing powers on his own from early childhood through dreams which conferred power for weather control. He later taught himself methods of hypnosis and hired a shaman who provided general guidelines for the use of his powers. Initially employing traditional Washo healing practices, Rupert evolved an eclectic practice by combining Hindu techniques, learned from an assistant, with Washo healing (Handelman, 1977). Finally, the Hehe of Tanzania learn symptom analysis, botany, divination, and ways to ensure spiritual protection from evil forces while pursuing their studies in ethnohealing (Edgerton, 1977). Despite the diversity in education content, the apprentice is prepared to function within her or his culture's health-illness paradigm to care for individuals and groups in a holistic fashion. Grossinger's (1980) study of the history of cultural caring reveals that in both stone-age tribes and countercultural clinics, 24 medicine is simultaneously an art, a philosophy, a science, and a craft; it deals with the human being as a single entity of mind and body in a biological and cultural circumstance from which he cannot be extricated (p. xiii). While holism remains the rule, some cultures employ specialists in diagnosis and treatment. The Navajo, for example, have three types of diagnosticians: hand- tremblers, stargazers, and listeners (Morgan, 1977). The Abron of the Ivory Coast have five types of healers (Alland, 1970). Among holistic practitioners, expertise in one area (e.g., herbal medicine or ceremonies) may supercede other practice areas, but the focus of the treatment is on the restoration or maintenance of health within the physical, spiritual, psychological, and social realms of the client (Cross, 1983; Kleinman & Sung, 1979; Martin, 1981). A discussion of healing practice among the Lakota will further emphasize the importance of holism in the health-illness paradigm of Plains culture. This discussion will follow a brief exploration of the history, social context, and spirituality of the Lakota people. Historical Perspective The culture of a society is rooted in its history. Whyte (1984) stated that \" ... any study of an organization or a community must be built on a firm historical base\" (p. 161). To understand the ethnohealth and ethnocaring 25 practices of the Lakota, a discussion of Sioux history is mandatory. \"History,\" as defined in Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (McKechnie, 1976), account of what has happened; narrative; story; tale\" (p. 863). Such accounts, written by human beings, are subject to interpretation and bias and reflect the standards, paradigms, and values of the historian's society. The history of America was largely written by Anglo-Americans and the flow of historical events reflects Anglo-American society. In contrast, the framework for this study will rely on the historical accounts that present another inter\u00ad pretation: that of the Lakota Sioux. Therefore, the sources most heavily relied upon are texts written by persons presenting a Lakota account of social develop\u00ad ment. Archambault (1974) explained the historical perspective of the Lakota from the days of oral tradi\u00ad tions to those of the \"winter counts,\" buffalo hide drawings marking the events of the year. Cadwa1ader and Deloria (1984) and Deloria (1985) have edited collections of writings on contemporary federal policies impacting Sioux tribes that express Lakota sentiment throughout. Matthiessen's (1983) controversial book, In the Spirit of Crazy Horse, is also included in this review because of the extensive interviews conducted among the Lakota people and the research into American Indian artifacts and federal documents. Other authors are cited whose writings add to the historical perspective of the Lakota Sioux. The Sioux 26 Before proceeding, it is important to point out that Sioux is a collective name for three linguistic and geographically-situated groups of American Indians. Linguistically, three dialects have been identified: Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota. Anglo-American convention divided these linguistic groups geographically, as follows: Lakota-speaking Sioux, the Teton, dwelt on the prairies west of the Missouri River in the territories now known as North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska; Dakota-speaking Sioux, the Santee, resided in Minnesota; and Nakota-speaking Sioux, the Yankton, lived in the central regions of Sioux territories, east of the Missouri River in North and South Dakota and western Minnesota (Gilroy, 1983). The Sioux, however, continue to divide the groups by dialect. Political organization will be discussed in greater detail in an ensuing section. In the Beginning Lakota history is a blend of spiritual and historical perspectives in the lives of the Sioux. The history is divided into three periods: Ehanni, Ehanni related stories of the Lakota \"before 27 the lives of our great-great-grandfathers\" (Archambault, 1974, p. 3). These stories establish social conduct among the Lakota. Ehanni wicowoyake is the closest example of modern historical accounts. These tales interpret the symbols in the winter counts, the history of the Lakota inscribed on buffalo hides during the winter of each year prior to white dominance. \"All of these stories are based upon historical facts with some intercession of the spirit world\" (Archambault, 1974, p. 4). According to Ehanni legends, the mythical origin of the Sioux took place at the Black Hills in South Dakota. The Pte People, servants of the Spirits and dwellers beneath the hills, eventually came to the earth's surface and occupied the surrounding lands (One Feather, 1974a). Gilroy (1983) and Utley (1984) present a different version of Sioux origins. Around 1200 A.D., parts of Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina were the home of the Sioux. The people gradually moved westward until, by the late 1800s, they were confined to reservations in the west central states--territories near the Black Hills. Ehanni wicowoyake tells of the gradual invasion of white settlers into Sioux territories. According to the winter counts, the presence of a United States flag in 28 Missouri was noted in 1791. Horseshoes on stolen horses (1802), the presence of fur trappers (1809), epidemics of infectious diseases resulting in many deaths (1819 and 1837), white trading posts (1822), a U.S.-backed attack on the Minnetaree tribe by combined Sioux and U.S. Infantry forces (1823), and the demise of the buffalo herds with pioneer travel along the Oregon Trail (1842) marked the increasing encroachment of whites upon Sioux land (Matthiessen, 1983). As more and more settlers arrived, vast changes in the Sioux environment were seen. Most important was the mass extinction of the buffalo. In the 1860s, millions of buffalo still grazed the Plains. Within a quarter of a century, the herds had been eliminated by commercially-motivated pioneers. The absence of the buffalo, the Sioux's major source of physical, social, and spiritual sustenance, as well as government policies, forced the Sioux onto reservations (Bowden, 1981; Utley, 1984). The Late Nineteenth century Gold was discovered by white prospectors in the Black Hills in the 1850s and fortune hunters flocked to the scene despite tribal protests. In 1868, a treaty signed at Fort Laramie, Wyoming, established Sioux reservations and guaranteed the inhabitants education, health care, subsistence, and the perpetual \"possession\" of the Black Hills. Eight years later, the Black Hills were wrenched 29 from Sioux hands by the federal government and given over to white ownership (Matthiessen, 1983). Treaties, which had at one time been drawn up between the u.S. government and tribes in sovereign nation status, were radically altered by the 1871 Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Treaty-making between Congress and tribes was terminated, relegating tribes to dependent status and eliminating the Indians' singular means of legal redress through negotiation (Deloria, 1984; Josephy, 1982). Assimilation--or, in the event of resistance, extinction--was promulgated by Congress with a \"trusty mix of bibles and bullets\" (Matthiessen, 1983, p. 8). Just as the physical well-being of the Sioux was threatened by the extinction of the buffalo and the forced confinement to reservation lands, so too the spiritual welfare of the Sioux was placed in jeopardy. The most sacred rite of Sioux spirituality, the Sun Dance, was outlawed in 1881 on the grounds that the ceremony promoted cruelty and sadism. Other ceremonies were also banned, including (a) vision quests; (b) purification rites (inipi); (c) the Ghost Dance, which enacted a prophecy that .envisioned the return of the Indian way of life prior to white intrusion; and (d) soul-keeping rituals, which missionaries believed denied the souls of the deceased access to the Christian deity's 30 justice (Brown, 1980; Matthiessen, 1983; O'Brien, 1985). Between 1882 and 1921, the Indian Religious Crimes statute was enforced, whereby engaging in Indian cere\u00ad monies was punished with a lO-day jail sentence or a 10-day denial of rations (O'Brien, 1985). Moreover, deliberate assaults on Lakota culture in the name of civilization resulted in the banning of native languages and tribal attire and the coercion of children into foster homes and boarding schools run by government agencies and religious institutions (Matthiessen, 1983). Further assimilation tactics surfaced with the Dawes Act of 1887, also known as the General Allotment Act. White concepts of land ownership and work ethics were promoted with the parcelling of reservation land in allotments of 40 to 160 acres for each Indian for purposes of farming or ranching. Any remaining land after the allotments (in total, two-thirds of tribal lands) was ceded to the government for which the tribe was reimbursed $.50 per acre, a price far below the then\u00ad current fee of $1.25 per acre. The effect was devastating on the Lakota tradition of communal caretaking of the land. Lack of experience in white economics and knowledge deficits in farming and ranching techniques brought poverty of a degree never before fathomed (Deloria, 1984; Johnston, 1948; Matthiessen, 1983; O'Brien, 1985). 31 The Twentieth Century World War I deepened poverty among the Sioux as pressure was put upon Indian ranchers to support the war effort by selling their livestock and leasing their lands to white ranchers. As the barter economy and ration system of the reservations became obsolete in the 1920s, government programs promoted dependency on u.S. economic systems (Matthiessen, 1983). In 1924, American Indians were granted citizenship rights at federal and state levels, as well as recognition of tribal citizenship. These rights, however, did not extend to matters at a tribal level. It was not until 1968, with the passage of the Indian Civil Rights Act, that individual rights under the U.S. Constitution were extended to tribal affairs (Chaudhuri, 1985). Under the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) of 1934, the Dawes Act was revoked and tribes were granted limited self-government. Those tribes that accepted the IRA were now ruled by elected governing bodies styled after business corporations, with constitutions subordinate to the U.S. Constitution. Actual political power lay in the hands of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The BIA, formerly the Indian Bureau, was established in 1832 under the direction of the War Department. In 1849, the Department of the Interior assumed responsibility for the BIA, which gradually employed more and more Indians to 32 carry out the federal government's decisions (Matthies\u00ad sen, 1983; Officer, 1984). The problem with the IRA was that self-government, as specified in the Act, was little improvement over prior arrangements. In the words of a Sioux, R. Roubideaux: \"Self-government by permission is no self-government at all\" (Josephy, 1982, p. 217). Dissent among the tribes increased when, in 1946, the Indian Claims Commission (ICC) was established to settle Indian land claims through financial arrangements. According to Matthiessen (1983), \"The chief beneficiaries of this commission were not the Indians but the Washing\u00ad ton law firms that represented them before the U.S. Court of Claims\" (p. 28). One result of the ICC was a further tactic in assimilation: federal relocation programs designed to move Indians who had lost their land into urban areas. Poverty continued for both the transferred Indians and those remaining on the reservation. In 1974, Congress passed the Indian Self-Determina\u00ad tion and Education Assistance Act that authorized tribes to manage reservation contracts and programs and which poured federal funds into education for Indians. Four years later, the Indian Religious Freedom Act granted Indians access to sacred grounds and permitted the possession and use of ceremonial paraphernalia in the expression of religious beliefs (Josephy, 1982; OtBrien, 1985) . 33 Summary of the Historical Perspective The history of the Lakota people has been rife with political maneuvers aimed at depriving them of land and culture under the guise of civilization. The historical perspective of the Sioux continues to be recorded in the Ehanni wicowoyake accounts of the lives of reservation and urban Indians as the 21st century approaches. Cultural Perspective The historical review provides a backdrop for the cultural stage. A review of traditional culture--its general social system and spirituality--is necessary in order to elucidate specific concepts related to eth\u00ad nohealth and ethnocaring among the Lakota. Social System Unlike other American Indian groups, clan systems among the Sioux were absent. Although patrilineal affiliation was emphasized, familial ties with both parents were considered important (Bowden, 1981). Individuality was valued among the Sioux. Accolades were awarded on the basis of individual accomplishments, especially in the areas of courage, wisdom, and gener\u00ad osity (Amiotte, 1982; Bowden, 1981). At the same time, to one's people--one's tiospaye--was esteemed. Tiospaye, literally \"a band; a clan; a party under one chief\" (Buechel, 1983, p. 489), was a kinship group of 10 34 to 20 families (Hagen & Schaw, 1960). Within this band, the social structure was one of a large family, with kinship terms and behaviors assigned by status within the family unit. Calling someone by name was considered disrespectful. Instead, one's kinship title was used. A man did not speak directly to his sister and a woman did not speak directly to her father-in-law (Standing Bear, 1978). The division of labor was based on gender, although some males were permitted to perform women's duties. Males hunted for game, provided for the security of their band, and engaged in war parties, which were more of a proof of manhood than territorial expansion or material acquisition tactics. Females were responsible for the selection and erection of the tipi, food preparation and storage, sewing, preparation of sewing material, washing, housecleaning, and household management. The care and education of children was shared within the extended family (Hagen & Schaw, 1960; Standing Bear, 1978). Hagen and Schaw (1960) speculate that each tiospaye honored a particular totem, acknowledged as a helper spirit of the local shaman. This may explain why the shamans of one band are mostly Yuwipi healers, deriving their powers from the stone spirits, while other bands focus on the buffalo, bear, or eagle as central to healing rituals. 35 Groups gradually came to be known by their dialect. The ilL\" dialect, which is spoken by the Lakota or Teton Sioux; the \"0\" dialect, spoken by the Dakota or Santee Sioux; and the \"N\" dialect, spoken by the Nakota or Yankton Sioux. Members of all three groups recognized each other as relatives despite the language differences. As the population grew, groups of families dispersed for newer hunting grounds. Eventually, tiospayes were distinguished not only by dialect but by their place of residence. Local history has it that an argument between two brothers resulted in the first division among the Teton. The brother and his family who left the campsite became known as Oglala or \"Scatter Their Own\" (One Feather, 1974c). As others sought other campsites, the groups divided further, producing several bands within each dialectic group. Table 2 illustrates the current political organization of the Sioux. Within each band, authority was spread among the elders, medicine men and women, family heads, and those who excelled in the traditional virtues of courage, gen\u00ad erosity, wisdom, and respect. Gilroy (1983) noted that differences in leadership selection existed among the linguistic groups. Leadership among the Dakota was generally hereditary and confirmed by a council of elders. Among the Lakota and Nakota, the council chose a leader on the basis of diplomatic ability as well as 36 Table 2 Political Organization of the Sioux Division Lakota (Teton) Nakota (Yankton) (Translation) Hunkpapa (End of (Blackfeet) Oohenonpa (Two Kettles) Itazipacodan or Sans Arc (Without Bows) Mininconjou (Planters by the Stream) Oglala (Scatter Their Own) Sicagu or Brule (Burnt Thighs) Ihanktonwana or Yankton (Camp at the End) Ihanktonwanna or Yanktonais (Little Camp at the End) Assiniboin (Cook with Stones) Location Standing Rock Reservation, ND, SD Standing Rock Reservation, ND, SD Cheyenne River Reservation, SD Cheyenne River Reservation, SD Cheyenne River Reservation, SD Cheyenne River Reservation, SD Pine Ridge Reservation, SD Rosebud Reservation, SD Standing Rock Reservation, ND, SD Devil's Lake Reservation, ND Crow Creek Reservation, SD Fort Peck Reservation, MT Fort Peck Reservation, MT Fort Belnap Reservation, MT and Canada Division Dakota (Santee) Table 2 cont.

Adapted from Buechel, 1983; One Feather, 1974c. 38 military accomplishments (Gilroy, 1983). The chief of a Lakota band was called wicasa itancan and was a virtuous man selected by the community. Although he was viewed as a representative of his people, band decisions were made through consensus of the elders, shamans, and warriors (Hagen & Schaw, 1960). His authority lay in personal charisma and in his ability to persuade others. He could serve in this position, conducting secular affairs, for several years or for life. Religious affairs were the domain of the shaman. An advisory council, called the wakiconza, was appointed by the wicasa itancan to aid in the chief's decisions. Responsible to the council was a soldier society, or akicita, which enforced the rules of social conduct through ridicule, shaming, or excluding the offender from the group. In times of war, a military leadership prevailed (One Feather, 1974b). Reservation life altered the traditional political organization. Frequently, bands were combined into federally recognized \"tribes\" that shared the same land allotment. For example, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe was created in 1873 with the placement of two groups of Sioux, the Yanktonais of the Nakota and the Hunkpapa of the Lakota, on the same reservation (Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, undated). In 1934, the Indian Reorganization Act allowed tribes to develop constitutions and to elect individuals to serve as members of a governing body_ At 39 present, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is governed by a Tribal Council, whose members are elected by popular vote of adult tribal enrollees. The Council is coordinated by the Tribal Chairperson, who appoints Council members to ,the three Tribal Council committees: Judicial, Eco\u00ad nomic, and Health-Education-and-Welfare. Tribal government is subject to the U.S. Constitution and to the Department of the Interior (Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, undated). Tribal political organization was not the only change associated with reservation life. The constraints of imprisonment on a continually-diminishing land base brought an insidious dependence on an economic system that promoted nuclear family organization, private ownership of goods, and linear-time orientation. Changes in family organization are presently reflected in the easing of traditional communication rules among relatives (LeBeau, 1980; Maynard & Twiss, 1970) and in the emergence of women in roles of the primary financial provider (Medicine, 1969). Despite the many changes brought by the reservation system, Lakota spirituality continues to provide a pervading influence on the lives of the people (hence\u00ad forth, the word \"spirituality\" will refer to the beliefs and behaviors that promote a sense of inner harmony). The following discussion presents Lakota spiritual concepts and touches on the historical influences affecting that spirituality today. Spirituality 40 A pervading spirituality, rather than a formal, structured religion, marked the life of the traditional Sioux. Esoteric knowledge was born of mystic experiences and individuals could choose if, when, and to whom they would reveal their knowledge. Shared revelations were oral. Since a written language has been developed only within the past 100 years, primary written sources of data are scarce (DeMallie & Jahner, 1982). The sources most heavily relied on in this section will be the oral reports of Lakota Sioux, translated and transcribed by Anglo-American authors. Translation and interpretation pose problems in some cases. For instance, James R. Walker, a white physician who lived with the Oglala Sioux tribe at the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota from 1896 to 1914, transcribed into English a wide range of oral accounts of Lakota traditions. However, DeMallie and Jahner (1982) have charged that Walker's ideals of organization and categorization \"and his feeling that there should be a single consensus account reconstruc\u00ad tible for all aspects of culture\" (p. 26) led Walker to misinterpret the meaning of traditions and ceremonies. Also, Walker's assumption that the Lakota language was inferior to English with regard to IIprecision of expres-41 sion\" (p. 22) restricted his appreciation and apprehension of nuance and the subtle, symbolic meanings behind much of what was told to him. Brown (1980) and Neihardt (1972) appear to have achieved better results in interpreting the Sioux leader Black Elk's narratives on Lakota ceremonies and his own spiritual quest. A collection of Lakota myths (One Feather, 1974a,b,c), narrated and transcribed by contem- porary Sioux, also grasps in writing the essence of oral traditions that have been passed on through many generations. That the works of Brown, Neihardt, and One Feather have received informal approval by key Lakota tribal members supports the validity of the renditions (Amiotte, 1982; J. Flying Bye, personal communication, 1983). Spiritual Concepts of Primary Importance The life force and benevolent power of the universe is Wakan Tanka, a name sometimes translated as \"the Great Spirit.\" It is Wakan Tanka, as Father and Grandfather, that unites all humans (the two-leggeds), all animals (the four-leggeds, the creeping people, and the winged people), and all minerals (the stone people) (Bowden, 1981; J. Flying Bye, personal communication, 1982). The most important kind of serenity, says Black Elk, comes within the souls of men when they realize their 42 relationship, their oneness, with the universe and all its Powers, and when they realize that at the center of the universe dwells Wakan-Tanka, and that this center is really everywhere, it is within each of us. (Brown, 1980, p. 115) The Earth is respected as both Mother and Grandmother (Brown, 1980). The four directions, or Winds, hold spiritual power and play important parts in human affairs. North is the symbol of purity; south, of life or creation. East is where the Sun, another respected entity, rises. West is the dwelling place of the fierce Thunderbeings who bring storms and bad omens, and is sometimes referred to as the residence of the souls of the deceased, as is the Milky Way (Bowden, 1981; Brown, 1980; Gilroy, 1983). Belief in heaven and hell is not part of Sioux spirituality. Persons continue an existence after death similar to their former lives and are joined by ancestors and loved ones in the spirit world. The disposition of one's enemies has been disputed. Walker's (1980) informants Good Seat, Short Feather, No Flesh, and Red Rabbit expressed belief that some deceased become the servants of those who killed them, while other spirits wander the earth. Others hold that those who have committed serious crimes during their lifetimes enter the same spirit world, but their campfires are in different areas physically removed from those who would be offended or troubled by their presence (J. Flying Bye, personal 43 communication, 1983). Of the winged people, the Spotted Eagle \"is regarded as Wakan-Tanka under certain aspects\" (Brown, 1980, p. 6). The eagle feather, worn by Sioux during ceremonies, is considered to be the presence of Wakan Tanka--similar to the Roman Catholic concept of the Eucharist as the \"Real Presence\" of Christ (Brown, 1980). The most important of the four-legged beings is the buffalo, the source of food, shelter, and clothing. \"Because the buffalo contained all these things within himself .. he was a natural symbol of the universe, the totality of all manifested forms\" (Brown, 1980, p. 6). It is likely that the buffalo was chosen, on the basis of this symbolism, as a vehicle for delivering to the Sioux the most powerful symbol of their spirituality, the sacred pipe. Black Elk (Brown, 1980; Neihardt, 1972) tells the story of a holy woman who appeared to the Sioux community, gave the chief the sacred pipe, instructed the people in its use, and predicted the revelation of the seven sacred rites that would form the foundation of Sioux spirituality. As the woman departed, she turned into a white buffalo calf, then a black buffalo, and then \"after bowing to each of the four quarters of the universe, disappeared over the hill\" (Brown, 1980, p. 9). 44 The Seven Sacred Rites The spiritual ceremonies that were later revealed by visions are still practiced today. They are: 1. The Keeping of the Soul; 2. The Rite of Purification; 3. Crying for a Vision; 4. The Sun Dance; 5. The Making of Relatives; 6. Preparing a Girl for Womanhood; and 7. The Throwing of the Ball (Brown, 1980). Each of these will be briefly discussed. The Keeping of the Soul. This memorial rite for the deceased consisted of two parts: the \"keeping\" of the soul and its release. Black Elk explained: By keeping a soul according to the proper rites .. one so purifies it that it and the Spirit become one, and it is thus able to return to the \"place\" where it was born--Wakan-Tanka--and need not wander the earth. (Brown, 1980, p. 11) A selected person, usually a family member, \"keeps\" the soul for a specified period of time, after which the soul is \"released\" amid much rejoicing to journey to its final destination. The Rite of Purification. Purification is sought by and individual prior to engaging in ceremonies or activities in which purity or strength are required. In this rite, the participants enter a sweat lodge, inipi, a squat, rounded edifice made of branches. Within the lodge, burning coals or heated rocks are sprinkled with water or herbal solutions to generate steam that induces the purifying sweat of the participants amid prayers and songs (Brown, 1980; Walker, 1980). Crying for a Vision. Also known as a \"vision 45 quest,\" this rite begins after the advice and encourage\u00ad ment from a medicine man. An inipi ceremony is performed to purify the searcher who then spends the next I to 4 days fasting and praying in sleepless solitude on a hill. Visions that occur during this time are interpreted by the medicine man or elders. Visions are sought for guidance and direction in one's life (Brown, 1980; Walker, 1980). The Sun Dance. A ceremony of primary importance, the Sun Dance is usually held during the summer. Parti\u00ad cipants, purified in the sweat lodge, gather around a sacred pole and pray for personal and communal welfare. Singing, dancing, whistle-blowing, and fasting continue for several days, with rest periods occurring at irregular intervals. Visions are sought and some participants undergo a voluntary flesh-rending rite (Brown, 1980; Walker, 1980). The Making of Relatives. Spiritual harmony with all things involves the recognition of everything and everyone as relatives. The most common and shortest prayer among the Lakota is \"Mitakuye oyasin\": \"For all my relatives\" (Amiotte, 1982). The formal acceptance of 46 a nontribal member as kin takes place during a Hunkapi ceremony. This rite renews a sense of oneness with the universe and with humankind. Black Elk speaks of this oneness, the concept that underlies the Hunkapi ceremony, as a prerequisite for world peace: \" ... there can never be peace between nations until there is first known that true peace which ... is within the souls of men\" (Brown, 1980, p. 115). Preparing a Girl for Womanhood. Performed at menarche, this puberty rite serves as a time of social and spiritual reification for the rest of the community. \"They [the rites] have been a source of much holiness, not only for our women, but for the whole nation\" (Brown, 1980, p. 126). This rite is important in that it emphasizes a female's resemblance to Mother Earth in her reproductive capacity and the power of menstrual blood, which is considered to be more potent than the power of a medicine man. The rite itself consists of prayers of purification and consecration of the young woman. She is admonished to raise her offspring in the ways of her people and to practice mercy, generosity, and humility. A celebration concludes the rite (Brown, 1980). The Throwing of the Ball. This rite, in the form of a game, is filled with symbolism. The game itself symbolizes life. The ball is the meaning of life, Wakan 47 Tanka, the universe. The purpose of the game is to acquire the ball; the purpose of life is to acquire meaning. Black Elk comments: Of all the created things or beings in the universe, it is the two-legged men alone who, if they purify and humiliate themselves, may become one with--or may know--Wakan-Tanka. (Brown, 1980, p. 138) The above discussion focused on traditional Lakota spirituality. These concepts have been influenced by the introduction of Christianity to the Lakota. The ensuing section examines the historical and spiritual impact of Christianity on the reservation. Christianity and Lakota Spirituality Since the days of white colonization, American Indians were viewed as threats, not so much because they were \"savages,\" but because they occupied land that was coveted by the white \"civilized\" society. Because the Indians' communal use of the land was in direct contrast to the foundational concept of European economy (i.e., absolute individual possession), friction arose. \"Civilized\" people did not overtly steal; thus, treaties were used to transfer land titles from Indian to white. Fortified by the biblical injunction to subdue the earth, the \"civilized\" creators of treaties believed in their right to identify and claim their chosen land. The introduction of Christianity as a governmental mandate was an effort aimed at solidifying the govern-48 ment's hold on Indian territory by converting its residents to a set of beliefs that supported the national economic system. Initially, concepts of Christianity were brought sporadically to the American Indians by French and Spanish traders (who were predominantly Catholic), and by white pioneers and explorers (whose Christian sects varied). Not until the post-Civil War period did the government become involved in the propagation of Christianity as a method of assimilating the Indian masses into civilization. Under Grant's Peace Policy, begun in 1869, major Christian denominations vied for positions as agents of the Indian Bureau. Seventy-three agencies were headed by appointees of religious groups to elevate the Indians, in [U.S. Indian] Commis\u00ad sioner [Ely] Parker's words, \"toward that healthy Christian civilization in which are embraced the elements of material wealth and intellectual and moral development.\" (Utley, 1984, p. 133) Rather than unite their flocks under the mantle of civilized Christian behavior, the agents and their churches engaged in territorial disputes with other churches. The Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions, which had been assigned only two of the Sioux agencies, lobbied for a greater share of administrative responsibility, citing the unalienable right of freedom of religion (i.e., the right of the Indian to choose any Christian religion) as its goal (Hoover, 1984). \"In Protestant 49 eyes, no less than Catholic, liberty of conscience did not extend to the old Indian religion\" (Utley, 1984, p. 154) . The Indian Bureau's agent for the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation was a Catholic, James McLaughlin, and his influence was probably sufficient to outdistance the other Christian denominations in numbers of conversions. Elsewhere, Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians counted the highest numbers of converts (Utley, 1984). The conversion process was enhanced when, in 1883, the Indian Bureau issued the \"List of Indian Offenses,\" as part of the Indian Religious Crimes statute. Among the offenses, which were punishable by fines, imprisonment, or both, were the practice of traditional healing rites, spiritual counsel by a medicine person, and participation in cultural ceremonies (utley, 1984; O'Brien, 1985). Although enforcement of the Indian Religious Crimes statute was terminated in 1921, public opinion was able to press the continuation of civilization-through-conversion policies until the mid- 1930s. As late as the 1920s, awareness that Indian spiri\u00ad tual systems still existed set off another wave of hysteria among assimilationists, in and out of government, against \"obscene\" Indian religions. Missionaries redoubled their efforts, and churches, Gospel missions, and Bible societies multiplied on the reservations, the old es\u00ad tablished denominations being forced to compete with such new arrivals as the Holiness Church, the Assembly of God, the Church of the Nazarene, the 50 Brethren in Christ, and the Mennonites. 1982, p. 86) (Josephy, The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 granted American Indian tribes religious freedom and the right to practice their cultural beliefs. Why did a great many of the Sioux accept Christian beliefs? Utley (1984) suggests that the laws prohibiting traditional rituals left a void that was readily bridged by Christian missionaries. They [the missionaries] were kind, they conducted rituals that the Sioux liked, and their churches were about the only place where Indians actually experienced the Christian precept that all people, even Indians, stood equal in the eyes of God. But the main explanation for the spread of Chris\u00ad tianity lay in the nature of the Indian spiritual belief, which did not bar the new from living comfortable next to the old--so long as the Christian holy men did not demand too insistently that the old be cast aside. The Indian spiritual life centered on a quest for personal power. The white man quite visibly possessed power. There\u00ad fore, his God might also be petitioned for power along with all the traditional Sioux deities. (Utley, 1984, p. 243) Today, the influence of Christianity remains strong among the Sioux. Although many people do not adhere to any Christian religion, many follow an eclectic blend of Christianity and traditional Lakota spirituality. Similarities between the two belief systems are recog- nized, while the origins of those beliefs are held as unimportant. Some of the similarities include: (a) Christ's fasting and meditations and the Sioux tradition of fasting and vision quests; (b) the sacrifices made for 51 the community by Christ on the cross and by the Sioux at the Sun Dance pole; (c) the belief in an afterlife; and (d) the concepts of selflessness and charitable giving. Sunday church attendance is not deemed mandatory for a viable spiritual life because one's spirituality is to be practiced every day. Turosak (1981) noted that it is not uncommon for an American Indian to read and quote the Bible and to pray to the Great Spirit, the Four Winds, and Grandmother Earth, an observation that supports utley's (1984) views. A collection of Lakota poems (Steinmetz, 1984) yields some poignant examples of the Lakota-Christian blend of spiritual beliefs. The poet Edgar Red Cloud equates the White Buffalo Calf Woman with the Virgin Mary and the Sacred Pipe with Christ. Richard Moves Camp equates the Christian concept of sin with IIbreaking one's commitment to the Pipe\" (p. 131). Lame Deer (1984) compares Moses, the \"Holy White Stone Man,\" to a Lakota man on a vision quest. He journeys alone to a mountain top; God speaks to him through the fiery bush; and Moses returns carrying stone tablets with things scratched on them, he would have made a good Indian medicine man. (p. 130) Fulfilling traditional duties toward the Spirits may take new forms under Christianity, as in Two Bulls's (in Steinmetz, 1984) poem about his grandfather, who dreamed of a Thunderbeing. Such dreams sometimes carried with them the task of becoming an Heyoka, a Contrary, a term used to describe a person selected by the Spirit of the West to give honor to the Spirit and to the community by performing everyday acts backwards. He dreamt of the Thunder. But he was a Christian man. So, whenever it thundered, he took out his Bible and read it to fulfill his Lakota dream. (Two Bulls, in Steinmetz, 1984, p. 131) Benjamin Black Elk, whose father was the Lakota spiritual leader Black Elk and a Christian convert, described his troubled thoughts concerning traditional spirituality and Christianity: During most of my life I was in doubt about the relation between the Pipe and Christ. When I believed in the Pipe, was I betraying myself as a Christian? What was the meaning in my life of interpreting my father's life to John Neihardt and Joseph Brown? But now that I see that the Pipe and Christ are really one, the doubts of conscience of many years are ended and I have a deep spiritual peace in my soul. 52 (Benjamin Black Elk, in Steinmetz, 1984, p. 142; Reprinted with permission of Bear and Company, Inc. Steinmetz, P. [1984]. Meditations with Native Americans --Lakota spirituality. Santa Fe: Bear and Company) The above passages point to the blend of Christian and traditional beliefs to which many Lakota adhere. Even the mentor medicine man who will be quoted in this study, professed his faith in both theologies. \"We Father. Ate Wakan Tanka is Jesus Christ. It is important to know these things\" (J. Flying Bye, personal communication, January 10, 1986). He made a distinction, however, at another time between the sources of healing power. Asked if Christian ministers could heal the ill with their interventions, the medicine man replied, \"No. They do not have the power. Only those who believe in the Great Spirit have the help of the Mahto oyate [the Bear people] or the buffalo\" (personal communication, J. Flying Bye, June 24, 1988). Summary The amount of knowledge about traditional or Christian beliefs and the degree to which a Lakota person identifies with those beliefs are individual. Individuals ~ make up communities, which form the fabric of society. For the Lakota, who have survived the intrusion of European ways into their economic and spiritual tradi- tions, culture and spirituality continue to provide guidance for the society. Respect for the individual is balanced by respect for the community and environment. This respect is reflected in ceremonies which foster individual and communal well-being and harmony with nature. Individualism, communal welfare, and harmony are integral to the ethnohealth and ethnocaring concepts 54 which will be examined in greater detail. Lakota Health and Caring Concepts Healers Concepts of health and caring among the Lakota are deeply embedded in Lakota spirituality. The role of the medicine man/woman has a mythical origin that sanctions the skill and power of the practitioner. One Feather (1974a) relates the story of the beginning of Lakota healers and alludes to the sources of physical illness (Mini Watutkala, a term which may refer to an early understanding of bacteria) and psychological disorders (evil spirits). Unk [a disagreeable Spirit] was angry because the creatures that lived on land took food from the waters. She complained to her sons, Iya and Gnaski. Gnaski, the demon, gave her some advice and she created the Mini Watutkala. They are very small creatures that live in the waters and are easily swallowed. When they get into the body, they eat the flesh, causing pains, and drink the blood, causing fevers ... The Lakota had lived a long time, and had multiplied rapidly, because there were neither disease nor deaths among them. When the Mini Watutkala were in the waters, the people swallowed them when they drank the water. They were afflicted with pains and fevers, and many people died. The people were in terror and didn't know what to do. Tokahe [a Holy Man] sought a vision. In the vision, Tatanka [the Buffalo Spirit] showed him roots and herbs and taught him songs and ceremonies to be done. The men did as Tokahe taught them and the people were cured of the disease that afflicted them. In this way, a line of Medicine Men among the Lakota was begun, and they continued to teach others their wisdom. Ever since then, Medicine Men have been among the descendants of the Ikce [Lakota]. 55 There were now dead spirits wandering over the world in search of the entrance to the spirit trail. Tate [the Wind] had hidden the entrance to the spirit trail from them until they should free themselves of guilt by doing good deeds. Some of these spirits were evil and delighted in causing suffering. They could enter into any creature that breathed, causing that creature to be crazy or delirious. Gnaski, the demon, was familiar with such spirits. He persuaded them to enter into any of the Lakota who were weakened by disease or otherwise. When one of mankind had an evil spirit, the Medicine Men could not cure him with their herb medicines. But the Holy Man, Tokahe, with his superhuman powers, could drive the evil spirits from the body. Then, the medicine of the Medicine Man could be effective. Ever since that time, when a person is delirious or crazy, a Holy Man is called to drive the evil spirit from the body. Then, the Medicine Man uses his herbs to cure the sickness (One Feather, 1974a, pp. 107-108. Reprinted with permission of Red Cloud Indian School, Inc. One Feather, V. [Ed.] [1974a]. Ehanni ohunkakan. Pine Ridge, SD: Red Cloud Indian School). Today, the spiritual leaders (holy men and women) and herbalists practice among the Lakota. In many cases, the roles are combined so that the term medicine man or woman frequently refers to a healer who cares for those with physical and spiritual ailments. According to Phyllis Old Dog Cross (1983), a Lakota nurse, a person is called to the role of healer by the Spirits, possesses \"special powers,\" and becomes aware of the calling by the Spirits, by another healer, or by oneself. Following the call is a deliberate choice and involves self-discipline, high moral character, and self- sacrifice. The spirituality of the caring professional 56 does not necessitate belief in a specific Indian religion. Rather, healing practices are grounded in a spirituality which focuses on a belief in a higher power or universal power [called Wakan Tanka by the Lakota] and the requirement for good living [which] entails taking care of one's body, living a healthy life, not using drugs or alcohol, and not indulging in anger and resentment. (Cross, 1983, p. 1) Belief in a higher power involves the recognition of the brotherhood/sisterhood of all things. This relation- ship devalues attempts to control the environment or to perceive oneself as an entity separate from the universe. In this relationship of siblings, one \"regards all things as having life, having honor, and requiring respect\" (Cross, 1983, p. 1). Another concept central to caring practices among the Lakota is the cyclic nature of life. The circle, frequently used in healing ceremonies, symbolizes Wakan Tanka, the life force, and wholeness, as well as reciprocity (Brown, 1980; Cross, 1983). The Sioux believe that people who think or act with unkindness will experience the same. Ill-will begets illness. It disrupts inner harmony, the key to well-being (Cross, 1983; Mason, 1980). Martin (1981) interviewed a traditional Colville healer of the Pacific northwest who described key issues in the caring practices of American Indians: 1. Well-being is based on a harmony or equi-librium of forces, including the social and psychological. 2. Healer and patient share a system of beliefs about the nature of the world and the nature of disease. 57 3. The patient's sickness places a responsibility on patient and family to participate in healing rites. 4. The healer involves patient, family, and others. 5. The healer focuses on illness rather than on disease, i.e., his attention is on the reaction of patient, family, and others to disease, rather than just on disease. 6. The healer enlists participation of others via ceremonies, rituals, songs, and dances. 7. The healer gives more than a pill; he gives both a remedy and a ritual. 8. The healer surrounds himself with helpers who support ceremony and patient. 9. The helpers assess the patient's belief in the healer. 10. The helpers welcome the patient, give him time, listen, answer questions, and explain, before the ceremony and afterwards (p. 141). These issues will be referred to in more detail in an examination of the diagnostic and therapeutic practices of the medicine person. Diagnosis Diagnosis focuses on identifying sources of dis- harmony_ The history-taking process, which frequently involves the family, inquires into the client's interper- sonal relationships with family and other community members, the client's social behavior, adherence to traditional customs, physical symptoms, emotional state, and moral character (Martin, 1981; Mason, 1980). Also assessed is the client's belief in the efficacy of the therapy and in the power of the healer. The emotional 58 reactions of others to the client's illness are ascer- tained and their willingness to participate in the healing process is noted (Martin, 1981). A great deal of importance is placed on the client's wish to be healed: Healing will take place only if the person wishes to be healed, is fully engaged in the healing process and is constantly making decisions to seek out healing .... the medicine man is only the conduit for healing [which] takes place within the individual when he restores the harmony within himself and in his environment. (Cross, 1983, p. 2 ) Therapy Watson (1979) emphasized as a basic assumption in the philosophy and science of caring that caring is an interpersonal phenomenon. The traditional caring practices of the Lakota medicine person support this assumption. As Martin's (1981) informant pointed out, healing involves more than the prescription of a pill. The medicine man or woman's care revolves around three major tasks: (a) to stabilize psychological stresses within the client, the family, and the community through assessment of the illness and explanation of that illness in terms of personal and sociocultural meanings; (b) to solidify group action by reinforcing cultural traditions; and (c) to innovate caring practices at a Sociocultural level when appropriate (Kleinman & Sung, 1979; Schultz, undated). A therapeutic ritual is the prime source of healing. 59 The ceremony, coordinated by the medicine man or woman, involves the client and significant others and procures for all participants \"a sense of purpose and mastery\" (Ness & Wintrob, 1981, p. 1480). In addition, communal carative and altruistic behaviors serve to increase group cohesiveness and affect the participants' self-esteem positively (Frank, 1974; Ness & Wintrob, 1981). The ultimate result is restoration of inner harmony and solidarity with the cosmos (Cross, 1983; Frank, 1974; Martin, 1981). The ethnohea1er works within the cultural framework using symbols that communicate healing power and a sense of caring to the client. Such symbols may be colors, scents, and sounds that touch the roots of traditional spirituality. Colors representing the Wind Spirits remind the participants of the cosmic dimension in all things. Songs and prayers voiced by family and community members unite the vocalists in a common, caring purpose. The enveloping smoke of burning sage or other prairie grasses purifies and protects the participants from ill forces. Healing energy is drawn from the community and from the environment for the benefit of the client (Cross, 1983). Assistants to the healer are sometimes procured to act as a liaison between the healer and the community in order to interpret the ritual's symbolism and the healer's actions and, if needed, to provide translations of the traditional language to participants unfamiliar with the native tongue (Martin, 1981). 60 Healing may occur at the time of the ritual or may proceed gradually for some time, depending on the readiness of the client to accept the healing energy with body and soul (Cross, 1983; Primeaux, 1977). A ceremony demonstrating the client's gratitude for family, community, and cosmic help is initiated by the client when the results of the treatment are satisfactory (Cross, 1983). Restoration of harmony is a cause for celebration and the gratitude expressed further soli\u00ad difies the community and reinforces traditional beliefs. Commentary Despite a long history of non-Indian intervention in social, cultural, and religious affairs, the Sioux have maintained a sense of tradition and cultural integrity in their lives. Ethnohealth and ethnocaring practices reflect traditional spiritual values and aim at res\u00ad toring/maintaining harmony in oneself with the physical, social, and spiritual environments. Healing centers on determining the \"personal and social meaning for the experience of being ill in a particular cultural setting\" (Kleinman & Sung, 1979, p. 23) and on harnessing community involvement in a demonstration of concerted caring behaviors. 61 Ethnocaring practices for the professional nurse appear to have much in common with the traditional Lakota healer. Assessment of the meaning of illness for the client and significant others is of prime importance in determining diagnoses, client priorities, and severity of illness. Use of culturally-appropriate techniques is necessary if holistic healing is to occur (Leininger, 1978c, 1981b). Research into the ethnohealth and ethnocaring practices of other cultures is a mandate for professional nurses (Leininger, 1978c). By studying the phenomenon of an evolving nurse-healer within a Lakota community, the researcher can explore the link between ethnocaring theory and experience in a field setting and provide practical applications for clinical nursing practice for better health care for all. CHAPTER III DESIGN AND METHODS A descriptive, experiential design blending ethnonursing and phenomenological procedures was chosen to generate a description of a human experience as it is lived and to relate it to ethnonursing practice. Ethnonursing refers to the systematic study and classification of nursing Care beliefs, values, and practices as cognitively perceived by a designated culture through their local language, experiences, beliefs, and value system. (Leininger, 1978c, p. 15) Ethnonursing, as a companion of ethnomedicine, centers on cultural caring behaviors, rather than curing practices (Leininger, 1978c). As a research approach, five steps are identified: 1. identification of the phenomenon to be researched; 2. preparation of a literature review relevant to the study; 3. acquisition of necessary approvals and research tools, and formulation of research strategies; 4. identification of the research sample; 5. implementation of multimodal research methods (Leininger, 1985a). 63 Each of these steps will be discussed as it relates to this study. Rationale for the design and methods will follow the discussion. Ethnonursing Research Steps The Phenomena The phenomena in this study are (a) the apprenticeship of the ethnohealer among the Lakota Sioux and (b) Lakota ethnohealth and ethnocaring practices. The Literature Review The literature review, frequently omitted in phenomenological studies, provides an historical perspective of the population with which the researcher interacts; likewise, it describes the cultural context in which the research occurs. The literature review establishes a conceptual framework for ethnohealth and ethnocaring practices, and explores the training of cultural healers, focusing particularly on Lakota caring practices. Approvals, Research Tools, and strategies Approvals from the mentor medicine man and from the Tribal Council Chairman were secured. The setting for the research was the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North and South Dakota. The researcher was the major research tOOl. The use of a tape recorder will be discussed in the 64 context of field notes. This manuscript represents the strategic component of this step in ethnonursing research. The Research Sample The research sample included key and general in\u00ad formants. Key informants were selected on the basis of their knowledge about the domain of inquiry (i.e., Lakota health and caring practices, ethnohealer apprenticeship). General informants were those who provided general information about related or peripheral matters which aided in understanding the whole picture. The number of key and general informants was limited in order to acquire an in-depth perspective of the studied phenomenon (Lei\u00ad ninger, 1985a). Key informants for this study included the mentor medicine man, other ethnohealers within the Lakota community, spiritual leaders, community elders, and past and present clients of the healers. Informants were added to the study until the research questions were sufficiently answered. The advantage of using key informants is that they provide access to information that may not otherwise be available. The major danger lies in forgetting that the data \"represent perceptions, not truths\" (Patton, 1980, p. 183). Patton suggests that all data derived from key informants be labeled as such. Sampling bias may be introduced if the selected informants are not representa\u00ad tive of the larger group (in this case, ethnohealers). 65 The researcher tried to avoid this situation by including as many ethnohealers (admittedly a small group to begin with) as possible. Finally, although the Standing Rock Sioux reservation is the home of several bands of Sioux, informants included in this study were primarily of the Hunkpapa band of Lakota. Multimodal Research Methods Data collection entailed several research methods: 1. participant observation, 2. dialogal/informal conversational interviews, and 3. semistructured interviews. Guiding the data collection was Whyte's (1984) orienting theory. This theory is aimed at focusing the researcher's attention on types of actors, relationships, and events that could be studied. It provides a general direction, rather than a carefully-detailed map of the research odyssey. Orienting theory differs from Glaser and Strauss's (1967) grounded theory, which has as its goal the generation of hypotheses, and formal theory, which attempts to generalize the hypotheses to other popu\u00ad lations or situations. Whyte (1984) suggests two categories for orienting theory: actors and relationships, and events. The following is an outline of the orienting theory for this study. I. Actors/relationships A. Is a person chosen or does the person choose to be a healer? B. If a person is chosen, who chooses? By what criteria is the choice made? 66 c. If the person chooses her-or himself, how does she or he reach that decision? D. What are the personal qualities or talents that are essential for a healer? E. Who trains the apprentice? F. What types of clients seek healing? G. What are the apprentice's relationships with and responsibility toward the mentor? the community? II. Events A. How long does the apprenticeship last? B. What tasks must be fulfilled? C. What concepts, values, or skills must be learned? D. What assessment does the healer make? E. What interventions does the healer implement? F. Where does healing take place? G. What is Bear medicine? Eagle medicine? H. What are the essential components of healing? I. What are the extrinsic components? J. Other ethnohealth and ethnocaring concepts or practices? 67 Data collection methods were guided by the suggested orienting theory, which itself evolved as new actors, relationships, and events presented themselves in the field setting. Data collection methods are discussed below. Participant Observation Participant observation is defined by Leininger (1985a) as \"essential to ethnonursing research process\" (p. 52). It is a method of data collection that varies in the degree of researcher participation at any given time during the field research. Spradley (1980) differen\u00ad tiates between the ordinary participant and the par\u00ad ticipant observer. The ordinary participant is one who participates in events, whereas the participant observer is one who not only participates, but also observes, records, and analyzes the details of that participation. Leininger (1985a) distinguishes four phases of participant observation: (a) primarily observation, (b) primarily observation with some participation, (c) primarily participation with some observation, and (d) reflective observations of impact. The first three phases are self\u00ad explanatory. The fourth, reflective observations of 68 impact, refers to the mental reexamination of the previous observations in an attempt to understand more fully the events, relationships, and persons involved in the research. In this study, the researcher collected data and formulated interpretations using all four phases of participant observation. Situations in the field determined the researcher's degree of participation. Dialogal Interview Also known as informal conversational interview, dialogal interview is a highly flexible, verbal interac\u00ad tion in which questions are generated in the immediate context of the interviewing situation (Colaizzi, 1978; Patton, 1980). The questions are not predetermined, as in a questionnaire or survey; rather, they flow from the interaction. In addition to dialogal interviewing, semistructured interviews were employed. Semistructured Interviews Semistructured interviews were used when the research required data on specific areas of interest. Such interviews employed both open-ended and closed questions, the type and extent of which were dictated by the situation. Language. The researcher did not encounter problems due to a language barrier. Like the medicine man, most of the adult population of the Standing Rock Reservation are 69 bilingual, speaking English and Lakota or Nakota, Sioux dialects. The majority of minors speak only English. The researcher was able to recognize key questions, phrases, and words in Lakota, and was actively enlarging her vocabulary in independent study during the data collection period, using two Lakota dictionaries and their accompany\u00ad ing grammar guides as resources. In addition, ceremonies conducted in Lakota usually included an assistant to the medicine man who translated Lakota into English so that all attendants could participate in the rites. Record-Keeping Procedures Field Notes Field notes were made during the interactions or shortly thereafter, whichever was most appropriate. Patton (1980) suggests that field notes include descrip\u00ad tive, detailed, and concrete information about events, people, settings, interactions, and the like; quotations of research participants; the researcher's feelings, reactions, and reflections; and developing insights, interpretations, preliminary analyses, and working hypotheses, without imposing preconceived notions on the ongoing experience. The researcher took rough notes at the setting, then elaborated on and transcribed the field notes within 24 hours. Although the mentor medicine man agreed to have his songs taped and transcribed, the researcher's experience with the Lakota people led her to 70 believe that a tape recorder in the research setting would hinder the type and amount of data obtained and would be viewed more as an intrusion into someone's life than an aid to the researcher. Personal Journal The researcher also kept a personal journal, noting perceived conflicts and congruencies between her clinical nursing practice and her role as an apprentice medicine woman. The data collected generated insights into the role of the ethnocaring nurse by tracing the personal evolution of the caregiver and major and minor changes in her nursing practice. Rationale for Design and Methods Design Nursing, among other disciplines, is concerned with the puzzle of human existence: its quality, it vul\u00ad nerabilities, its aspirations, its limitations, its potentials. Nursing's philosophy is humanistic, holistic, and individualistic. Being, free will, self-determina\u00ad tion, autonomy, and potential are key philosophical values and beliefs found in humanism and in nursing (Munhall, 1982). The holistic philosophy identifies the person as a whole, neither fragmented nor reducible, entity, which interacts with the environment in a relationship of emerging, evolution, and growth. Individualism ack-nowledges the person's uniqueness in spiritual, psycho\u00ad logical, emotional, physical, and intellectual domains. 71 While the scientific/quantitative approach to nursing research poses and answers some quantifiable questions about human life, it cannot respond to inquiries about its quality--a prime area of interest to nursing, given nursing's philosophy. Qualitative methods, on the other hand, seek to answer questions about individual and shared experiences of health and illness. Phenomenology, in particular, attempts to touch base with some of the most elusive and untapped sources of human knowledge: the experience of being human with multiple variations of that experience tagging along. Ethnonursing focuses that experience within an intercultural nursing domain: caring. Modifying Keen's (1975) list of fundamental types of research problems in psychology, the nurse employing phenomenological techniques finds these areas open to inquiry: (a) the investigation of a single, unique experience; (b) the investigation of a single, unique individual; and (c) the investigation of a general or repetitive process of interest to nursing (e.g., healing, touch, caring, wellness). The research questions central to the study touched the categories of a single, unique experience (that of a nurse as an apprentice medicine woman) and of a process of interest to nursing (ethno-72 caring). Given the lack of nursing research on the experience of becoming a medicine woman and the fact that the researcher was to be the first nurse to become a Lakota practitioner of Bear and Eagle medicine, the choice of a descriptive, experiential design seemed appropriate. The research questions required a holistic approach to the experience and to the persons with whom the re\u00ad searcher came in contact. They also required interaction between the researcher and participating others, rather than independence. That the researcher's experiences were also included in the study is crucial to the understanding of the experience of medicine woman training: it is a highly subjective experience involving not only the healer's relationship with her clients and mentors, but also her state of consciousness, intent, personal capabilities, and talents. Duplication of events would be highly unlikely and undesirable. Few nurses will have the opportunity to become Lakota medicine women or men and of those that do, their experiences would probably not replicate the researcher's, given the subjective nature of the ex\u00ad perience. The setting is uncontrolled and natural - another factor reducing the chances of replicability. While the qualitative method of grounded theory has as its goal the generation of theory, the phenomenological approach aims instead to produce an accurate description of a phenomenon. Development of a transcultural healing theory would be, at this point of the research, beyond the scope of the study. Theory development would be a goal for further research. Parse (1981) attests to phenomenology as a stepping stone in the eventual development of nursing theory and as a guide for nursing practice. Methods 73 Leininger (1978b) states that the goal of trans\u00ad cultural nursing is to increase the knowledge base of caring practices as they relate to the health care of diverse cultures. A combination of ethnonursing and phenomenological approaches is encouraged \"because of the need to understand client life experiences, subjective feelings, intuitions, and meanings\" (Leininger, 1985a, p. 59) in terms of cultural contexts. Field studies are also encouraged to provide \"dynamic, realistic, and meaningful experiences\" (Lei\u00ad ninger, 1978b, p. 467) for the purpose of developing improved care to people of varying cultural traditions and \"to determine universal and nonuniversal aspects of cultural care\" (p. 466). Such field studies could explore \"diverse paradigms about caring\" to \"revolutionize and to help evolve nursing\" (Leininger, 1981b, p. 6). This study examined a caring paradigm in a field setting and explored the benefits of that paradigm to professional nursing 74 care. The use of orienting theory as a minimally-structured guide in field research follows Whyte's (1984) justifica- tion of its employment: The student does not embark upon field work with a tight research design, and can make major changes in the direction of the study as new problems and opportunities present themselves. (p. 141) Major changes, however, were to be approved by the re- searcher's dissertation committee. The goals of participant observation are to gather data and to aid in constructing meaning from that data (Polit & Hungler, 1978). Leininger (1981b) asserts that \"human caring has nonverbal forms of expression which are extremely important to the care of peop1e--perhaps more important than verbal expressions\" (p. 137). Treece and Treece (1982) advocate participant observation as an effective tool for data collection in health care. It is especially recommended for exploratory research and for naturalistic inquiry where there is no attempt to control or manipulate variables (Patton, 1980; Polit & Hungler, 1978). A major objection to participant observation is observer bias, which would limit objectivity (Polit & Hungler, 1978). The phenomenological researcher, however, recognizes personal bias, attempts to \"bracket\" or control it, and consciously incorporates both the bias and the bracketing attempts into the description of the pheno- menon. Recognition of its presence may limit the effect 75 of bias on the research more than denial of its existence. Another objection to participant observation is that some situations may not permit observation (Treece & Treece, 1982). This is a realistic objection. Attempts to obtain such information could be made through interviews. The dia10gal or informal conversation interview has the advantage of increasing researcher responsiveness to differences among informants and among situations. Personal, in-depth communication is facilitated and the relevancy of the questions and responses enhanced. This type of interview works best when combined with par\u00ad ticipant observation over a relatively long period of time. The disadvantages include a lengthy time frame, since a series of interviews is frequently needed to obtain relevant data. Data are sometimes difficult to synthesize and analyze in terms of response patterns. A myriad of personal perspectives and responses in the subjects' own words avoids response bias but complicates identification of themes (Patton, 1980). The subject's awareness of being observed in both participant observa\u00ad tion and interviews may provide a threat to validity. It was anticipated that this threat would decrease in intensity over the course of the time while the research was being conducted. Semistructured interviews, also called the interview guide approach, are characterized by outlining areas of 76 interest in advance and arranging their sequence and phrasing during the interview. Advantages include the ability to gain comprehensive data in a partially systematic scheme and the flexibility of a situationally\u00ad based, conversational interchange between researcher and participant. A major disadvantage is the possibility of omitting important topics because of the situational shifting required (Patton, 1980). Data Analysis Data analysis involved \"thick description\" of the phenomenon, a term used by Geertz (1973) to denote exhaustive description of a social context to provide an appropriate data base for anyone wishing to understand the research findings. In addition to \"thick description,\" data analysis involved identification of themes by noting regularities in the data (Miles, 1983); construction of interpretive, conceptual categories based on themes, without which \"one is simply recording, and recording is not enough to produce understanding\" (Lynch-Sauer, 1985, p. 97); comparison and contrasting of cultural categories in Lakota and professional nursing practices; and clarification of the results with informants. This led to a description of the experience of becoming a medicine woman and categorization of ethnohealth and ethnocare practices. 77 Validity and Reliability As explained in the section on design and method ra\u00ad tionale, the goals and objectives of qualitative research differ from those of quantitative research. For that reason, qualitative methods require tests of rigor other than those used to establish reliability and validity in quantitative designs (See Table 3). Keat and Urry (1982) suggested that \"different forms of understanding may have their own criteria of validity\" (p. 174). For Lincoln and Guba (1985), establishing trustworthiness determines the validity and reliability of qualitative research. Trust\u00ad worthiness is established in four criterion areas: (a) truth value, (b) applicability, (c) consistency, and (d) neutrality. Truth Value Do the research findings reflect the consensus reality of the informants? Each culture has its own set of truths, called a \"consensus reality\" (Lewis & Pucelik, 1982). Credibility is achieved if the informants are able to recognize themselves, their situations, their \"con\u00ad sensus reality,\" in the data. Credibility is enhanced through \"prolonged engagement, persistent observation, and triangulation\" (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Prolonged engagement refers to an unspecified period of time necessary \"to learn the context, to minimize distortions, and to build trust\" (Lincoln & Guba, 1985, p. 78 Table 3 A Comparison of Qualitative and Quantitative Designs Goal Approach PhiloSO\u00ad phical Basis Method Data Base Setting Data Collection Data Analysis Trust\u00ad worthiness Criteria Qualitative Exploration, description, discovery, explanation, generation, and develop\u00ad ment of theory, or extension of theory Inductive Humanism Holism Descriptive Empirical and subjective sources Natural setting Researcher's role varies on a dependent-interdepen\u00ad dent-independent continuum Uses all data; objective and subjective Credibility Transferability Dependability Confirmability Quantitative Determination of a cause-effect relationship between the independent and dependent variables Deductive Realism Logical posi\u00ad tivism Reductionism Experimental Empirical sources Laboratory/con\u00ad trolled environ\u00ad ment Researcher has independent role Uses objective data Internal validity External validity Reliability Objectivity 79 307). Learning the social and cultural contexts of the research setting aids in decreasing intentional dis\u00ad tortions (deceptions) and unintentional distortions (misinterpretations). Building trust requires sufficient time to establish trusting relationships with the research participants. The major threat in prolonged engagement is the phenomenon of \"going native.\" The research perspective is distorted by an overidentification with the participants, which may obscure perception of phenomena otherwise visible to one who combines the perspectives of both the informants and oneself. Two views of reality-\u00ad like two heads--are better than one. Persistent observation enables the researcher to sort through a multitude of details and to identify the salient features of the study. Premature closure poses the major threat here in that the research may be con\u00ad cluded before all of the important factors have been identified. Triangulation is encouraged through the use of different data sources, different methods, and possibly different researchers to validate the data through cross\u00ad checking (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). In determining truth value in this study, checks on the respondents' information were performed in several ways. During the interviews, respondents were questioned and asked to clarify information. The researcher 80 rephrased responses and asked, \"So what you're saying is ... ?\" or \"When you say that, do you mean ... ?11 Par\u00ad ticipants were willing to guide the researcher's inter\u00ad pretations of their cultural reality. At other times, informants were asked for their opinion of previously gathered material. \"Someone said (or wrote) that such-and-such is done when a person is ill,\" the researcher would remark. \"Have you known that to be the case?\" Participants could then provide a cross-check on the information given by other sources of data. In yet another attempt at data validation, the mentor medicine man was shown the typewritten transcripts of his taped songs and conversations. The material that was approved for inclusion in this study is presented in this paper. Material that was deemed too sensitive for sharing with others was deleted. The medicine man believed that some of the details of \"bad medicine\" practices, if widely publicized, would be harmful to the Lakota community. Confidential matters were discussed in advance with the researcher's dissertation committee, who agreed that the medicine man's request to exclude certain data from the final report should be honored. Such ethical dilemmas have been discussed in anthro\u00ad pological literature. Agar (1980) admits that ethical issues in ethnographic research raise many questions that 81 remain unanswered and that engender discussions that produce \"more heat than light\" (p. 187). He advocates the use of the researcher's sense of ethical responsibility. Bernard (1988) is in agreement and adds that there is no ethical imperative in anthropology more important than seeing to it that you do not harm innocent informants who have provided you with information in good faith. (p. 216) Punch (1986) comments that we should be conscious that observational studies can have a predatory character and can invade sensitive areas. As a consequence, we should be aware of the moral and institutional force of academic convention in demanding that we do not lie, cheat, steal, or break promises to the subjects. (p. 83) In this study, the researcher promised that the research participants had the right to confidentiality and a part in the editing of the material. In the end, the decision to delete sensitive material from the report reflected the researcher's personal sense of ethics and the consensus of those involved. Credibility was enhanced through prolonged engage- ment. The research period, if one allows for notes taken during the researcher's original tenure as a nurse at the research site, apprenticeship training on and off the reservation, and correspondence from a number of key and general informants, spans 8 years. Persistent observation was achieved by residence in the communities in which the researcher worked and gathered data, as well as by attendance at social gatherings, pow wows, celebrations, Sun Dances, and other community gatherings. 82 Triangulation was achieved through participant observation, semistructured and dialogal interviews, and cross-checking data with other informants. The data col\u00ad lection period was terminated when: (a) no new data were being added to the cultural health and caring themes; and (b) a particular phase of the ethnohealing apprenticeship had been completed. Applicability Do the research findings apply to contexts other than the one studied? The key term is transferability: the ability to transfer research findings from one context to another. The responsibility of the researcher is to provide enough thick description of the context to enable other researchers to apply the findings to other contexts (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Applicability is not generalizability, and it is not the purpose of this paper to describe the health and caring practices of any group other than the one studied. The research describes one particular band of Lakota, the Hunkpapa, and is not generalizable to other Lakota bands. Also, the findings of this research may not be generaliz\u00ad able to the same Lakota group over time. Cultures are not static entities. Traditions change. Modes of communica\u00ad tion and interaction undergo slow, but persistent, 83 transformations. For example, changes in the social and economic structure of reservation life have altered the traditional patrilineal affiliation of Sioux society to an increasingly matrilineal structure (Medicine, 1969). Communication patterns among relatives, once strictly enforced, have changed within the past 30 years (LeBeau, 1980; Maynard & Twiss, 1970). This research furnishes the reader with a detailed description of the consensus reality of a particular culture at this point in time. It may provide a cultural and historical stepping stone for future health care providers seeking to understand this society's health and caring practices as they now exist. Some of the con\u00ad clusions may be helpful in providing health care to other populations, but further research with those populations is required before transferability may occur. Consistency Would the research findings be supported by a similar inquiry employing similar informants in a similar context? The dependability of the findings rests on their credi\u00ad bility, as well as on their auditability. The research findings are audited with regard to research process and research product; that is, how the researcher collected the data, how he or she arrived at interpretations, and how conclusions were reached should be clearly described to allow the reader to trace the decision-making process involved. Consistent repetition of the research process should produce similar results (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). 84 The concept of consistency with regard to repetition of the research process is limited to the ethnonursing aspect of this study_ Because of the nature of the phenomenological method employed in this paper, it is not possible for the reader to ascertain the validity of the apprenticeship experience with its dreams, psychological impact, or emotional expressions. Exact repetition of the phenomenological research process is neither appropriate nor desirable. However, future inquirers into the same matter must conduct their research \"in their own autono\u00ad mous and idiosyncratic way. They will see it better through their own constructs than through the constructs of others\" (Heron, 1988, p. 58). Neutrality Do the research findings reflect the context or the interests, preconceptions, and prejudices of the research\u00ad er? Confirmability is determined when dependability, transferability, and credibility are established, indicating that the findings present an unbiased account of the data (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). The phenomenological method requires researchers to \"bracket\" or to psychologically and intellectually check their biases, tendencies toward ethnocentrism, and other preconceptions. While it is difficult for the reader to 85 ascertain the extent to which neutrality was achieved, the assertion that the researcher was able to experience cultural healing first hand may indicate that her Anglo\u00ad American preconceptions were kept in check long enough to allow this healing to occur (see Chapter V). Ethical Considerations Whyte (1984) suggests several guidelines for ethical conduct in field research. Of the five he lists, the following apply to this study: 1. \"Integrating ethical considerations into the planning process\" (p. 219; italics in the original). Informed consent was required of all participants. Specifically, the participants were informed (in English or Lakota) of: (a) the purpose of the study; (b) their right to refuse to participate at any time without adverse ramifications; and (c) their guaranteed confidentiality. Since written consents were considered culturally inappropriate to the Lakota, the researcher obtained verbal consents from the informants, noted the date of the consent, and assigned a code to the in\u00ad formant's data. A copy of the \"Guidelines for Obtaining a Verbal Consent\" was placed in the tribal office building and in the community health representative's office of each district where research participants resided. A copy of the guidelines appears in the appendix. 2. \"Obligations in publication\" and \"Balancing (Whyte, 1984, pp. 219, 220; italics in the original). The research was subjected to the participants' scrutiny through discussion of the re\u00ad searcher's perceptions, of her field notes, or of transcripts of tape-recorded interviews. Participants were advised of their right to revise their responses or to withdraw their recorded involvement entirely. In addition to the validity checks already mentioned, a copy of the first draft of this paper was sent to the Tribal Council for its comments. 3. \"Passive subjects or active cOllaborators?\" (Whyte, 1984, p. 221; italics in the original). Research feedback is necessary not only to achieve a balance between academic freedom to write and publish one's data and the researcher's obligations to her coparticipants; Whyte suggests that the more active the informants are in the research process, the more they share in solving the ethical problems that may arise. Feedback \"can strengthen the scientific basis of our research\" (p. 221) by increasing awareness of factual errors and by aiding in the interpretations of data. Participants in this study were encouraged to take an active role in guiding the research as it progressed. Foremost in this process was the mentor medicine man who created opportunities for the researcher to learn traditional healing ways. The next chapters describe the active collaborative efforts of the researcher and participants in a study of Lakota health and caring practices. Style of Presentation 87 The narratives that follow provide ethnonursing and phenomenological accounts of cultural health and caring experiences. Because of the intimate nature of the data, the research is presented in the first person. Format changes (i.e., indentation and single spacing) were necessary to separate certain types of data from the body of the text. Data subjected to format changes were accounts of visions and dreams, songs, poems, and some memories. The changes were inserted to emphasize ideas and experiences outside the realms of Anglo-American perceptions of time and space. CHAPTER IV HEALTH AND CARING PRACTICES AMONG THE LAKOTA Now comes a time of sorrow for my loved ones and for myself for the emptiness i feel, and i open myself up to and pray to the god force for relief and guidance and support and love. Here i come to Tiospaye [the community of relatives], a gathering of peoples from many places who come here to know caring and humankind. i believe i am in the right place to bear my sorrow and to be healed. (Reprinted with permission of M. Kirchhoff. Kirchhoff, M. [1988, Summer]. Now comes. The Extended Family (Tiospaye) Network Voice, 14). The daily bearing of humanness takes place within the community. For the Lakota Sioux, this community includes not only the ties that bind kin to each other, but the traditional and spiritual sinew that links the past with the present, the land with the people. The healing of sorrow, pain, and illness takes place within this community. The introduction of Anglo-American culture brought 89 with it medicine that did not rely on kinship ties or traditional Lakota values. The pluralistic society that developed as a result of white and Indian interaction presents a plethora of health care beliefs and practices. The health care choices of the Lakota are presented here. The quotes that follow are based on interview data gathered through dialogal and semistructured interviews, recorded in field notes taken during the interviews where appropriate, or reconstructed through recollection shortly after the interview. Only the songs and a portion of the medicine man's comments were tape-recorded at his instructions. The names of the participants are fic- titious, but have been styled to resemble Lakota surnames. The medicine man is referred to by his title of kinship to the researcher: Ate, or Father. Introductory Field Notes The monotony of flat plains is abruptly broken by the sharp rise of a butte. Country roads--tar, gravel, or dirt-paved--curve over gentle hills or drop in steep inclines. The winters are long and bitterly cold; the summers hot and arid. Flowering cacti hug the ground; wild blossoms dot the roadside greenery. Legions of sunflowers face east in the midsummer sun. Trees are scarce and can be seen clumped in the draws at the feet of hills where moisture collects, or spreading linearly across fields as windbreaks, shielding the topsoil from 90 winds that fall short of hurricane strength. Hawks and eagles soar the heights; pheasants and grouse stay closer to the earth. Rattlesnakes hiss and sun themselves on flat rocks, as buffalo roam in fields adjacent to cattle ranges. Coyotes scavenge the prairies. Grasshoppers infest the wheat and rye crops. The river runs blue and sends its narrow streams branching through the land, but the water turns shallow in the season of drought. The Lakota classify themselves as full-bloods or \"breeds,\" the products of interracial unions. The people are deeply brown or lightly tan, with midnight black hair and piercing eyes the color of chestnuts. They live in government houses the pastel hues of Easter eggs or in privately-owned homes of wood and plaster. The official tally of residents per dwelling is five to eight (Sher\u00ad wood, 1988), a count that fails to reckon the sums of transient relatives that move from place to place, reservation to reservation, or the destitute who live in abandoned cars parked in shaded areas. Beside a number of houses is a structure called a \"squaw cooler.\" Four wooden poles supporting a roof of tree boughs provide the coolness of shade during hot summer days. In the lots beside or behind some dwellings cluster broken-down cars and trucks, salvaged for the functional parts they contain. To the newcomer, there appears to be 91 an inordinately large number of olive-green cars in use. Some of these, along with vehicles of other shades, are known as \"rez cars,\" identified by the sputtering rumbles of faulty mufflers and crusty carburetors, the transposed fragments of cars that sit in lots. In the absence of public transportation, it is the \"rez car\" that conveys travelers between the eight distant communities that make up the reservation, a parcel of land that spans 2.5 million acres and absorbs some 6000 Sioux. Poverty is obvious, from the ramshackle dwellings of overcrowded tenants to the roadways dotted with hitchhik\u00ad ers too poor to own even a \"rez car.\" Unemployment is estimated at 80% (Hendrickson, 1981). Federal jobs with the Indian Health Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs largely account for the remaining 20%. School lunch programs, commodities, and food stamps and vouchers supplement the diets of many. General assistance, veterans' benefits, and social security checks provide meager incomes for most. Social Structure Community populations range from 219 to 1,961 (Sherwood, 1988). Each community is largely made up of several groups of relatives. It is not unusual for children to be raised by members of the extended family living in the same or in a distant community. The tradition of extended families, as well as the family 92 disruption brought about by widespread poverty and alcoholism, favors this childrearing practice. In many households, it is the eldest woman who assumes the family caretaking role and is often the family's sole support. A high teenage pregnancy rate may transform a mother into a grandmother at the age of 30. Thus, a woman may raise as many as four generations of children in her lifetime. Foster parents or grandparents are nonfamily members who care for children whose extended families are unable to assume that responsibility. These foster families become relatives of the children and of the children's blood families by virtue of their caring roles. Persons adopted through the Hunkapi ceremony are also counted among the relatives and assume their designated places and respon\u00ad sibilities in their adoptive families. Thus, the roles of mother and father extend beyond bloodlines and include grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, foster parents and grandparents, and others. A person may refer to many women as \"mother\" or \"grand\u00ad mother,\" and to many men as \"father\" or \"grandfather.\" This practice of identifying others as part of the nuclear family reflects the traditions of pre-Anglicized com\u00ad munities, when the father and the father's brother were called \"ate\" (i.e., \"father\") and the mother and the mother's sister were called \"ina\" (i.e., \"mother\"). Terms for \"cousin\" were nonexistent, supplanted with 93 11 brother II or \"sister.\" Life here is slow-paced, if compared with the bustle of cities. The traditional Sioux awakes and turns to the east in gratitude for another day. The patterns of family life--the preparation and sharing of meals, the care of children on their way to the community school, the housework, the time for recreation--are revived each day. The setting sun is noted with thanks as Night Woman spreads her starry blanket over the earth. It is here, beneath the starquilt of a Lakota night, that my research begins. The Present Health Care System With the confinement of Indians to reservations came the provision of federally-regulated health care. The Division of Indian Health, renamed the Indian Health Service (IHS), was established as a branch of the United states Public Health Service in the mid-1950s to provide free health care services to the reservation populations. In the research setting, there are three field clinics with limited facilities that operate one day each week; a satellite clinic with expanded facilities, such as laboratory and x-ray services and an acute-care hospital. The service area is beset with federal budget cuts and limited monies for contract care services (e.g., consulta\u00ad tions, surgeries, diagnostic tests, and other services that cannot be performed at the IHS hospital). Clients 94 frequently wait for hours before seeing a physician. The high turnover in staff hinders continuity of care, especially for those afflicted with chronic illnesses. Prominent chronic illnesses include diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, and cardiac disease. Alcoholism accounts for the majority of accidental injuries and injuries purposefully inflicted by others. Acute illnesses account for the majority of clinic visits and are overwhelmingly environment-related: gastroenteritis, ectoparasitic infestations, otitis media, impetigo, pneumonia, and influenza (Sherwood, 1988). Limited and overcrowded housing, inadequate plumbing and heating, and the absence of a public transportation system add to the contagion and severity of disease. Lack of running water makes handwashing improbable; wood-burning stoves or the absence of fuel makes winter warmth impossible. A recent surge in tuberculosis has consumed the time and resources of the two community health nurses here. One medicine man and several spiritual leaders attend to the spiritual and physical needs of those who seek traditional answers to their problems. Healing ceremonies are conducted on an \"as needed\" basis. One to three Sun Dances are held each summer for the health of the community. Health and Illness Causation Many of the Lakota with whom I spoke asserted their conviction that health is brought about by following the Lakota traditional code of life, or the red road. The practice of generosity, respect, courage, and wisdom creates a sense of harmony with one's family, community, environment, spiritual ancestors, and self. Health was also perceived to relate to personal cleanliness, exercise, attitude, diet, and heredity_ 95 Alton Grey Dog, a 45-year-old maintenance engineer commented, \"Some people don't keep their houses clean and then they bring their kids in to clinic whenever they get a snotty nose. I'd tell them to clean up their houses and their kids wouldn't get sick.\" Exercise is also con\u00ad sidered essential for maintaining health. \"I walk to work every day, about 5 blocks each way. I go hunting and fishing. It's good exercise and relaxation,\" he added. Health as related to accepting family responsibili\u00ad ties was expressed by Rose Big Catch, a 47-year-old grandmother: \"Taking care of kids keeps you young and healthy. My youngest is 4 and I take care of my 2-year\u00ad old grandson.\" Psychological health is thought to be brought about by a healthy attitude. \"I'm a firm believer in the fact that if you don't think you're sick, you won't get sick,\" said Greg Hollow Reed, a middle-aged government employee. \"Maybe that's because I have a hypochondriac in 96 the family. This guy watches the soaps and the next week, he comes down with whatever the leading character has. One of my sons doesn't like school, so he gets sick too.\" \"I try to eat well--vegetables, less fried foods,\" said 70-year-old Stella Makes Plenty, echoing the sentiments of many other informants. Good eating practices were cited by most respondents as relating to good health. Illness occurs to those who follow the black road, who fail to practice the traditional Lakota values and who shirk responsibilities for the family and community. Illness can also be brought about by \"bad medicine\" (i.e., object intrusion, curses, and Spirit interventions). Actions that disrupt communal harmony hinder personal and community health. \"There are two major reasons for discontent on the reservation these days,\" remarked John Eagle, a 39-year\u00ad old professional, \"sorcery and gossip. In the past, gossip was used to keep people in line. There were no police to arrest anybody; so if someone did something wrong, people gossiped about it. Since nobody likes to be the subject of bad talk, people straightened up. Now, gossiping is a way of life.\" Poor diet is a source of health problems, as seen by these two middle-aged women: \"You get diseases if you're overweight and don't care about your eating, although a lot is hereditary.\" \"The commodities we get from the government are poor. We get 97 lard and canned meat that's packed in a thick layer of grease. This isn't good for the people. Many people have heart problems.\" Several informants cited heredity, as did the former respondent, as a component in developing illness. \"I try to watch my weight because a lot of people in my family have diabetes,\" said a 27-year-old woman, Jeannette waters. On the other hand, the absence of family members with potentially-hereditary diseases was seen as an indisputable safeguard against the development of health problems. \"I won't get sugar diabetes,\" stated Steve Chases Crow, a 58-year-old overweight man. \"Nobody in my family ever got it.\" Psychological factors are seen as potential threats to health. \"I think stress is the biggest problem on the reservation,\" remarked Gene Black Tail Fox, a Lakota health care worker in his mid- 30s. \"I keep myself busy so I don't sit and brood and get depressed. There's a lot of depression on the reserva\u00ad tion, feelings of being left out by those who have jobs; jealousy between those who have jobs and those who don't.t! Lack of employment opportunities, according to this informant, creates long-term anxiety which, in turn, interferes with self-respect and self-care. IIWhen you lose those, your whole family suffers. It's a cycle of stress and depression.\" Anxiety at horne also brings people to the clinics in search of physical answers to psychological stress. \"Most of the problems you see at 98 clinic are emotional. Something happens at home and the people escape to the clinic,\" reported Molly Yellow Necklace, a clinic employee. A mother of three came to my office one Friday, requesting me to examine her children. \"What seems to be the problem?\" I scanned the group of youngsters. \"I just want you to see if they're all right. It's a long weekend,\" Mrs. Bear Claw said, referring to the upcoming holiday on Monday, \"and my husband will get mad at me if the kids come down with a cOld.\" The children were healthy, I assured her after the examinations, then reinforced some preventive health practices that would not only maintain their health but that would also give her some sense of control. Personal Health Practices Traditional and Nontraditional Health Services None of the persons with whom I spoke, including Ate, practiced solely traditional methods of health care. A few sought care only at the Indian Health Service facilities, but these--with the exception of one-- acknowledged their respect for traditional ways. \"I don't practice the old ways myself,\" said Gene Black Tail Fox, \"because I was never brought up that way. But I have respect for those who do and for what they're doing.\" 99 The one exception to this view was steve Chases Crow who had extensive cardiac surgery in the past 3 years. Speaking of traditional health practices, he said, \"I don't believe in those things. I go to pow wows [communal dance fests] and sing honor songs for people, but I don't believe in that other stuff. I think taking my pills and watching what I eat are what count.\" Despite his denial of belief in traditional healing methods, he did ac\u00ad knowledge his participation in the Lakota caring practice of singing honor songs, a practice that will be discussed later. Most Lakota practice an eclectic mixture of tradi\u00ad tional and modern medicine. The following narratives and interviews reflect the typical health care practices of the majority of people here. Ate was sitting on a wooden chair in the sweltering sun of a June day. \"Sometimes my legs don't feel so good,\" he said, stretching his feet. \"I was dancing at a pow wow one time and a piece of gum got stuck to the bottom of my moccasin. I went to see a medicine man because I was getting bad cramps in my feet and my legs were weak. He said that someone put bad medicine [in essence, a curse] in that gum and that's why I was feeling those things. He told me to get rid of those moccasins, so I did. Now I don't feel like dancing anymore. I went to the wasicu [white] doctors and they gave me these 100 pills.\" He showed me his bottles of quinine sulfate, frequently used to relieve leg cramping, and ibuprofen, an analgesic. \"Sometimes these help, but not all the time.\" Consultation with traditional healers and non\u00ad traditional physicians occurs frequently and depends on the efficacy of treatment from each. For some, tradition\u00ad al care is sought for nonemergency conditions, while emergency treatment is sought at the IHS hospital. Stella Makes Plenty, now a 70-year-old great\u00ad grandmother and starquilter, described her health care practices: \"I had a kidney infection 8 years ago. I was lying in the basement with a bad fever, back pain, and trouble when I passed urine. I lay there for days. I didn't want to eat or drink anything. I was too sick. \"I asked my daughter to sew clothes for the medicine man as payment if he'd help me. That's what she did. The medicine man brought me a quart jar of tea he made and told me to drink it all that day. After that, I got my appetite back and my fever went away. \"I used to have bad gall bladder attacks, so I cut out greasy foods. I don't believe in surgery. I want to go back to the Earth the way I came into it, with all my parts the way they are. Many people feel this way, II she noted, nodding her head with conviction. I saw bruises around her left eye and on her forehead, and asked what had happened. 101 \"Two days ago, I got hit in the face with a garden hose. The grandkids were playing and swinging the hose around. I got hit in the eye. The ambulance took me to the emergency room at the hospital. They did x-rays to see if I was all right. Nothing broken. I just keep a cold pack on this eye like they said.\" The perceived severity of the illness also affects the decision to seek traditional or nontraditional care. For instance, Tom Shoots Far, a 67-year-old Christian lay minister and former policeman, has had a cardiac bypass and monitors his diabetes with a home glucometer. \"I take eight different pills a day and try to keep up with them,\" he said. Mr. Shoots Far also recounted another experience. \"I woke up one day with a numb face. Maybe I had a stroke. One side of my face was numb. My mouth drooped so much that I couldn't drink water without it dribbling out the side. I had one eye that was drooping too. \"I called your Ate over to help me. He made some kind of powder and put it on my face every day for 3 days.\" He massaged the left side of his face as Ate had done during the treatments. \"In 3 days, the numbness was gone and my face was back to normal.\" I could see from where I sat across the table that there was no residual paralysis. I later asked about this episode. He said he can make a powder from the Bear medicine root that appears to help rid a person of facial paralysis. \"Is that numbness from a stroke or from Bell's palsy?\" I wondered aloud, referring to the differential diagnoses of facial paralysis. 102 \"I don't know what these things are that you say. I don't know what causes this numb feeling, but I have used this medicine with four or five other people and they all got well in 3, or maybe 5, days,\" said Ate, elaborating on the use of Bear medicine. Roy Fools Them, a Lakota physician assistant employed off-reservation, noted similar effects in several clients who had cerebral vascular accidents (CVA). \"I recommend my CVA patients to the medicine man. I've seen impressive results: the residual paresis and paralysis are cleared up in a short time,\" he told me in his office one day. \"The medicine men insist on seeing the patient within a few days after the stroke in order to be effective.\" He added, \"I also recommend patients who have social problems to seek counseling with the medicine men. About 60% of the people I see have some trouble with their families, or with drinking. The spiritual leaders can sometimes straighten them out better than our social workers can.\" Others blend traditional and nontraditional health practices in a different way, as in the following example combining preventive health services with a Lakota healing rite: \"Two women came to the emergency room one day for a 103 physical exam before going to an inipi to see if they were healthy enough,1I recalled Mr. Fools Them. \"In the past, if you wanted to go to a sweat, you did so whether you were healthy or not. If you were sick, the sweat helped cure you.\" Diet Attention to diet is a personal health practice that is deeply rooted in the past. Molly Yellow Necklace, a middle-aged clerical worker, recounted the dietary practices of her childhood. \"In my younger days, my family had to supplement the meat commodities we got from the government. The meat at the store was usually two weeks old, so my father would hunt game. I remember eating rabbit--jack and white tail, beaver, squirrel, turtle, pheasant, and game birds. We had prairie dog, too, but I could never bring myself to eat it.\" She made a sour face, similar to the one I thought I would make if confronted with a plateful of prairie dog meat. \"My unCle,\" Mrs. Yellow Necklace continued, \"used to bring skunk oil for us. My mother gave us a spoonful of skunk oil every day to keep colds away. I -think she put sugar in it to make it taste better. She also gave us cod liver oil to prevent colds. To this day, I can't stand the thought of swallowing oil.\" She gave another look of distaste with which I heartily sympathized. A slim woman of medium height, Mrs. Yellow Necklace 104 said that she tried to stay healthy by regulating her diet. \"We don't eat bacon and eggs like we used to, only once in a while,\" she said of her family. \"We used to have a big brunch every weekend with lots of eggs, bacon, and fatty foods. We stopped that because we want to stay healthy.\" Ella Looks Around, a nurse in her late 50s, lost 20 pounds over the past 3 years in a effort to improve her health. \"I try to follow a diet and keep my weight down. We used to fry everything, but now we cut the fat off our meat and eat vegetables. We exercise too. \" Exercise and stress Reduction Exercise is another personal health practice. Molly Yellow Necklace stated that she spends her lunch break doing aerobic exercises with a television program every day. \"It helps keep my weight down now that I quit smoking.\" Exercise is considered healthy because it helps relieve stress, as well. Alton Grey Dog, a maintenance engineer who exercises by walking and engaging in outdoor sports, said he does so for stress reduction. Gene Black Tail Fox, a health care worker, commented, \"I try to eat right, get as much exercise as I can, and try to decrease the strain, the stress. I try to relax. There's a lot of stress on the people. There's 85-to-90% unemployment on the reservation. People say, 'I have four 105 kids in school. Where will I get their clothes?' Other people also have to have money for clothes for ceremonies, money for giveaways, pow wows, memorial services.\" \"I go home and try to forget about the job. I go fishing, hunting, gardening. I do things for the family. I keep myself busy so I don't sit around and brood and get depressed.\" Like diet, exercise--especially in the form of productive activity--is a health care practice rooted in the past. \"I used to chop vlood when I was younger.\" Wilma Good Bird smiled, delving into the memories of her 98-year lifespan. Her smile added a few more wrinkles to the rugged, crinkled pattern of her face. \"I had a small axe and I'd chop up the wood for my grandmother. She'd carry the wood on her back. I used to go horseback riding too.\" She held a finely crocheted yard of pillow lace in her gnarled hands. \"I'm not young enough to do all that these days, but I sew and crochet,\" she said. \"I still see all right, but I don't get around too well anymore.\" Partial cataracts clouded her vision and she walked with a shuffling gait. Most of her time was spent sitting in a wheelchair in the two-bedroom house where she raised three grandsons and one great-grandson until they moved away last year. \"I still make pies and jam from the choke\u00ad cherries and buffalo berries the kids bring me. I bake my own bread too.\" Before I left, Mrs. Good Bird asked if I could get her a pair of sunglasses because the sun's bright glare bothered her eyes. I bought her a pair of \"shades\" at the store that weekend. The Inipi Ceremony A health practice that attends to both the psycho\u00ad logical and physical well-being of the person is the 106 or sweat lodge, ceremony. Alex Hail Cloud, a 29- year-old father of four, believes the inipi is important for his health. \"The heat from the burning stones opens my pores and gets rid of the toxins in my body. It makes me feel good, and it keeps me humble, too.\" Sweat lodges are sometimes seen a slight distance from an individual's house and are squat, domelike structures with bent branches supplying the tightly-woven frame. A circle of heated rocks, or coal, is located in the center of the lodge. From time to time, water is poured on the rocks to create a sauna-like effect for the participants. There are \"men sweats\" and \"women sweats,\" each gender having the same rite but separated. The participants may be naked, or may wear a breach cloth or towel. Objects, such as eyeglasses and jewelry, are not worn, so as not to give offense to the Spirits. \"With these shiny things, you 'show-off' to the Spirits,\" explained Ate. \"You can't do that. You must be humble.\" \"What about someone like me, who wears braces?\" I asked. At the time, I had orthodontic work. paused a moment, then looked me in the eye. \"Keep your mouth shut,\" he said as a laugh rumbled over his lips. 107 In the heat of the sweat lodge, the participants sing and pray for help in purifying their lives. Sweat drips down their flesh in a soul-cleansing bath. They leave the inipi renewed. Self-Reliance One last health care practice, as exemplified by Mrs. Good Bird, is self-reliance. Self-care, in the forms of diet, exercise, and stress reduction, is highly valued and finds its roots in traditional Lakota practices. \"In the past, there were only one or two medicine men on the reservation,\" said the physician's assistant, Roy Fools Them. \"Some people went only for important things, not for colds. They took care of themselves and had more respect for the medicine men,\" he added, contrasting the use of health services then and now. \"Then the government said, 'You don't have to take care of yourself. We'll take care of you.' And since then, people have forgotten how to deal with simple problems, like colds and diarrhea, and they come to clinic with every little ache and pain. They should learn to take care of themselves and teach their children to do the same.\" From the comments about personal health care practices I have gathered, it seems as if many of the people of the reservation are already practicing Mr. Fools Them's advice. Caring Practices Personal health practices overlap with caring practices, because it is believed that, in caring for others, one is caring for oneself. The practice of the 108 traditional Lakota values of generosity, respect, courage, and wisdom involve caring for another. Tending to one's relationships is at the crux of the red road. The following interviews illustrate that point. Generosity As with personal health practices, caring frequently revolves around the provision of food. Richard and Cecilia Red otter, an elderly couple in their 70s, frequently serve meals to visitors who have no one else to care for them. A man was eating a sandwich when I entered the Red otter's house. \"You remember our old field nurse, don't you, Carl?\" asked Mr. Red otter, who was seated on the sofa with his legs propped up on a chair. Mr. Hunting Wolf looked up from his sandwich. His face was ruddy and he reeked of alcohol. \"I don't know,\" he said with a slow, slurred speech. He stood and extended his hand when I introduced myself, then held my hand in a vise-like grip. \"Let go, Carl!\" I said when he failed to loosen his 109 grip. \"Let go, Carl!\" I repeated. He took his other arm and gripped me around the neck in a half nelson. \"Let me go, Carl!\" I commanded, trying to sound calm but forceful. He dropped breadcrumbs onto my head as he slurred something incoherent. Mr. Red otter watched him cautiously, unable to move from his seat because his legs were weak. His wife tried to draw Mr. Hunting Wolf's attention to his sandwich without success. I managed to wrench free. He stood a moment before thumping back into his chair and sat there as I found a seat on the sofa. He resumed his lunch. \"Carl comes over from time to time when his drinking money runs out,\" explained Mr. Red otter. \"He'd probably starve if we didn't feed him.\" Mr. Hunting Wolf looked like a tall, lean wolf who had not been very successful in hunting. I asked Mrs. Red Otter how she keeps her family healthy. \"I try to keep the children clean and make them eat balanced meals as much as they can. I tell them to lay off the junk food and I give them vegetables.\" Until this past year, Mr. Red otter had a large vegetable garden behind his house. Mr. Hunting Wolf finished his sandwich and gazed uneasily about. \"Why don't you go outside, Carl, and 110 sleep under a tree? It'll be cool there,\" Mrs. Red otter suggested. After a few minutes of indecision, the visitor staggered out of the house and across the street to another's yard. As we watched him go, Mrs. Red otter said to me, \"Why don't you come for Sunday dinner sometime?\" The provision of food to the needy was the focus of caring practices for two other community members. Bert Eagle Calf, a 30-year-old volunteer firefighter, recounted his activities. \"I'm a hunter. Last year, I took down 16 bucks. I skinned them and I gave them to the people. I'm a protector. I'm a warrior. I would have liked to have lived in the old days.\" Carol Takes the Lead looks to the future. \"I keep myself busy and try to do something constructive. I help out the CHR [Community Health Representative] and work with the elderly. During the winter months, some of the elderly who get lease money get cut off from government checks, like VA [Veterans' Assistance] or SSI [Supple- mental Social Security Income]. I'd like to start a food pantry in town for the elderly,\" said the 35-year\u00ad old woman. Generosity is also shown in providing family support for relatives. This is most frequently seen in the extended family system that thrives on the reservation. Throughout her seventh, eighth, and ninth decades of life, 111 Wilma Good Bird clothed, sheltered, fed, and raised a number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. stella Makes Plenty took on the responsibility for her grandson's childrearing when she was 58 years old. \"My youngest daughter was 16 when she got pregnant--too young to take care of herself and a baby. So I brought him up. Now he's 12. Kids keep you going,\" she chuckled. The Slow Hawks, Jack and Phyllis, were a young couple with two toddlers who also looked after their aging parents. Phyllis's father, beset with chronic illness and frequent memory loss, lived with the Slow Hawks, while Jack's widowed mother resided next door. The younger people cared for the needs of their elders with patience and openhandedness. \"We don't want our folks to go to the nursing home,\" said Mrs. Slow Hawk. \"That's not how we do things here.\" Only those elderly who have severely debilitating illnesses that cannot be managed in the home are sent to the nursing home, located 30 miles off the reservation, according to a community health nurse. Generosity is exhibited as a caring practice in the traditional giveaway ceremonies, in which a person shows gratitude to the Great Spirit by \"giving away\" goods to community members. The giveaway was banned by the federal government in 1883 by officials who misinterpreted the ceremony as the senseless disposal of personal goods by people who had very little to begin with (DeMallie & Jahner, 1980). 112 It resurfaced in the 20th century and is frequently associated with naming ceremonies, wake services, and pow wows. Finely-woven woolen blankets and starquilts are the most common giveaway items, valued for both their beauty and their warmth. Other items include linens, towels, and material for clothing. Intermarriage with other American Indian tribal members introduces other ceremonial ways of sharing. Francis White Bonnet, a Sioux, married a Crow Indian. The Crow Medicine Bundle ceremony became part of their caring practice in the reservation home here. Mrs. White Bonnet explained the ceremony as a demonstration of one's generosity with time and personal possessions. \"This is a ceremony that people do for the health of their relatives. It's a Crow ceremony. We had one a few weeks ago in our basement after a sweat.\" \"A buffalo robe was placed on the floor. Everybody brought his own medicine bundle [a pouch containing the ceremonial paraphernalia of the participant] and about 10 cigarettes. Everybody had an ashtray nearby. The people sat around the robe. One man would pass a cigarette to another man and say, 'I want you to pray for my Aunt Mary.' Someone else would pass a cigarette to another person and say, 'I want you to pray for my sick uncle.' They do this until all the cigarettes have been passed out. Everybody is holding cigarettes; you have to have a 113 good memory because you have to remember which request goes with which cigarette. Then everybody smokes, one cigarette at a time, praying for whomever they were asked to pray. They take Eagle bone whistles from their medicine bundles and blow on them and sing prayers. If a person that they're praying for is there--for example, we brought my aunt downstairs in a wheelchair--they take an Eagle fan and fan the space around the person they're praying for.\" She added, \"If you're in a ceremony and you wear someone else's plume [Eagle feather] or pray with someone's cigarettes, you're also praying for that person.\" Taking someone as a relative is a sign of caring that reflects generosity and respect. \"I do the Hunkapi ceremony because that is what the Great Spirit teaches me,\" said Ate during one of our discussions. \"It is one of the seven sacred rites, brought to the Lakota people by the Buffalo nation. I make relatives so I can share the teachings of the Great Spirit with others, Indian and other people. It is important that I do these things.\" The ideas of family and generOSity are deeply intertwined roots of the past. John Blunt Horn, a Sioux quoted in Walker's (1980) account of Lakota rituals, explained the rationale for ceremonial adoption. After the yearly hunt, he said, the people gathered in the winter camp. Some had plenty of meat and robes and skins. Some had but little of these things. If a man had plenty and his friend's child pleased him, he would say, \"I will take this child as my 114 own.\" ... If a man's heart was good towards an old man, he would say to that old man, \"I will take you for my father.\" And he would give a feast ... And he would give away all he had. He would keep this old man as his father and everyone would say that he was a good man and they would give him things to eat and to wear and they would give to this old man also. (p. 203) Walker (1980) also emphasized the link between generosity, courage, and kinship. If one becomes a Hunkaya [adopted family member], he cannot voluntarily withdraw from his relation\u00ad ship, but if he is stingy or guilty of cowardice, the Hunkayapi [adoptive family] may refuse to recognize him as one of their number. (p. 239) In the Hunkapi ceremony, a man or woman may \"adopt\" another person as a son or a daughter, a brother or a sister, or any such blood relationship. Both parties assume familial obligations toward each other. In a ceremony that will be described later, I was adopted as the medicine man's daughter. He became my \"ate\" or \"father,\" and the rest of the family became my family. Lakota adoption, in my case, meant being available for ceremonies, lending assistance in transportation and financial matters, and participating in family get- togethers. Reciprocally, I was welcomed at family events and was privy to information reserved for family members only. When Ate's wife and my adoptive mother, Ina, was in the hospital dying of cancer, Ate phoned me with a request for help in paying the cost of a hotel room and meals. Most of the family members who traveled to the off-reservation hospital spent their nights sleeping on the floor of the visitors' lounge. A struggling doctoral student in a distant state, I sent Ate my last $50. 115 Ina's obituary appeared in the local press. Of the many people that Ate and Ina had adopted through Hunkapi ceremonies, only two of us--an Oklahoma Indian and myself --were listed among the surviving relatives. The newspaper column validated our places in the family. The traditional Lakota value of courage is best exemplified in the communal caring practices associated with the Sun Dance, the most sacred ritual of this cultural group. According to Ate, participants in the Sun Dance offer their dancing and fasting for the good of another. \"They sacrifice themselves in place of someone else. They leave the food and water. They blow the Eagle whistle and pray to the Great Spirit: 'I am dancing for my relative who is sick and can't get around. So I am praying for him' or 'I am dancing so the people here could be healed.'\" Frances White Bonnet reiterated Ate's comments. \"Some people go to the Sun Dance to pray for the health of their relatives or for some blessing for themselves or their family or community. \"I went to a Sun Dance last year to pray for a special intention for my brother. I gave flesh offerings at the Sun Dance. I had two Eagle feathers attached to my skin. The medicine man took a needle and some sinew and sewed a feather in each of my arms.\" She showed me the residual scars on her upper arms. 116 \"I danced all day, then went to the sacred pole where the medicine man tore them off. I was led back to my place by one of the helpers. The blood was dripping down my arms.\" \"I committed myself for 4 years. So this year, I'll have two feathers put in each arm. Next year, I'll have three feathers; and the year after that, four.\" Other modes of flesh offerings include (a) slicing the skin of the upper arm with a blade (for women); (b) piercing the upper back, attaching ropes to the skin that are tied to a buffalo skull, and dragging the skull along the ground (for men); and (c) piercing the upper chest, inserting small sticks attached to ropes joining the Sun Dance pole, and tearing the flesh off the chest by a final plunge backwards (for men). It should be noted that fasting and dancing, without flesh offerings, are acceptable and praiseworthy endeavors on the parts of the participants. Courage is also shown by the many community members who serve, or who have served, in the Armed Forces. Such service is considered an outstanding contribution to the welfare of the entire American community, and is seen as source of community pride. Pow wows are held every year 117 in honor of veterans. Pictures of family members in uniform decorated the walls of many living rooms I visited. Ate showed me the ribbon and medals he had won as a World War II infantryman. \"They gave me two stars. I must have done something brave,\" he said, innerly recalling his war wounds. \"If you are afraid to do some good thing, but you do it anyway, then you have courage. The Great Spirit will be pleased.\" Respect One of the caring practices that illustrates respect for one's relatives is the act of visiting the sick, the mourning, and the housebound. Tom Shoots Far, a lay minister who believes that \"Jesus loves people of all denominations and conditions,\" shared his singing talents with those in need of a sympathetic boost. \"I heard about a young boy who was run over on [another] reservation. I went down there to help comfort the family. I sang church hymns in Lakota and English for them. It's my way of showing that I care.\" Mr. Shoots Far also made trips to the hospital and to the off-reservation nursing home to sing for the infirmed. \"The people like these songs, especially when I take English songs and sing Lakota words. Not many people can do that.\" Several others told me that they always visit their relatives when they are ill. \"Hospitals can be very lonely places,\" said Carol Takes the Lead, who recently 118 traveled 30 miles to see her ailing grandmother. Gene Black Tail Fox stressed the need for hospital staff to comprehend the importance of visiting the sick. \"Nurses have to understand the family relationships here-\u00ad that if Aunt So-and-so is sick, everybody is there. Everybody is concerned from cousins on. It's a close relationship and there are a lot of relatives. They need to understand that half of the reservation people are your grandmas.\" Practicing the Lakota value of respect requires attention to the obligations of the extended family. Frequently, that obligation involves being physically present when relatives are in need. Memorial services for the deceased are held annually and are another way of showing respect for one's relatives. Ate's wife, my Ina or adoptive mother, died in the winter of 1985. Each January, Ate holds a memorial ceremony in her honor. I was present when Ate, Mitchell One Horse--a medicine man from another reservation--and my husband met to honor their deceased relatives. Mr. One Horse spread a scarlet cloth on the floor, and placed upon it the pipe, a swath of braided sweetgrass, and an ashtray. Lighting the tip of the sweetgrass with a match, he scattered its smoke along the bowl and stem of the beaded pipe, then spread the smoke in the air around each of us as we sat in chairs near him. The purifica\u00ad tion completed, he took the canunpa in his hands and 119 stood facing east. Lifting the pipe toward the ceiling, he prayed in Lakota to Tunkasila Wakan Tanka, explaining the purpose of the gathering and asking assistance in making worthy prayers. He lowered the pipe to midlevel, and prayed to the Spirit of the East, then turned south and prayed. To the Spirits of the West and North he prayed in similar fashion. Finally, he invoked Grand- mother Earth, lowering the pipe to the ground. Silence followed as Ate assisted Mr. One Horse in filling the pipe with a mixture of durham and kinnikinnik. Once lighted, the pipe was passed to each of us and we spent several minutes sending smoke-lined prayers to our relatives \"on the other side, beyond the stars,\" as Ate phrased it. After the passing of the pipe, the ceremony was concluded and we spent the next hour remini- scing about our departed relatives. The memories ended on a happy note and we retired for the night. A Lakota nursing student expressed her feelings about the death of her father in a poem written after a memorial service. \"It's been over a year and a half since my father walked on the wind,\" she wrote. I heard the whistle blow in the four directions. I heard you, heart, beat the sound of the drum. I heard the cry of the pain, as the eagle had lifted you up. I stood there, listening and praying that he wouldn't take you home. I smelled the scent of sweetgrass inside the room. Still, I didn't understand why the whistle blew; why, the smell of sweetgrass; why, the cry of the pain. I cried as I was told the shocking news. Now I understand why the whistle blew. Now I understand why the cry of pain. Now I understand the smell of sweetgrass ... My father ... has gone home. 120 (Reprinted with permission of E. west. West, E. (1987). I heard the whistle blow ... [untitled poem]. In unpublished manuscript). The memorial service provides a time for reflection, for the gathering of insight, and for healing. It is a potent and demonstrative form of caring. Respect is also shown through concern for the elderly. In one reservation community, the state funds for the Nutrition-for-the-Elderly program had been discontinued, due to a clerical error in the paperwork. To continue to provide warm meals for persons aged 55 and up, the population had to devise some form of fund- raising. In a community whose members' incomes fell well below the poverty level, the younger residents organized bingo nights. The proceeds were enough to supply lunch time meals for about 50 people for several weeks until state funds were again available. \"I show respect for people by giving them a hand- shake,\" explained Alex Hail Cloud. \"Touching people, putting your arms around them, shows that you care,\" said Cecilia Red otter, expanding on Mr. Hail Cloud's comment. I observed that people hugged or, more frequently, shook the hands of others at wake services, funerals, 121 giveaways, pow wows, and other ceremonies. For instance, it is customary that the individual receiving a gift at a giveaway shake the hands of the announcer who called his or her name, the gift-giver, and the relative of the gift\u00ad giver who assists in handing out the gifts. No words need be spoken at the time. The handshake is sufficient in demonstrating respect and gratitude. Respect is shown by participation in honor songs. The pow wow announcer spoke into the microphone. \"Now the Red Antelope Singers will sing an honor song in honor of Gilbert High Star who just returned from 6 weeks of basic training at Fort Bragg. II Everyone under the bowers of the circular pow wow ground stood, their hats at their sides or on the benches behind them. Cloth-covered drumsticks beat out a loud, quick rhythm on the hide drums, as Steve Chases Crow began the song. The other drummers echoed the leader's opening verse as the honored individual was joined by his family in a circle dance. The song continued as more and more community members, also wishing to honor this young soldier, stepped into the circle and joined the dance. \"Let's have a big round of applause for Private First Class Gilbert High Star and the Red Antelope Singers!\" shouted the emcee at the conclusion of the song. The crowd burst into applause as the dancers took their seats. \"Honoring songs are important because they show you 122 have respect for someone or for something that someone did,1I Mr. Chases Crow explained. \"The people who get up and dance are showing support for that person.\" Community support contributes to the well-being of the person and to the cohesiveness of that community. It is an exercise in community health, Lakota-style. Wisdom From my sessions with Ate, I have gathered that the Lakota practice of wisdom entails an ongoing openness to the will of the Great Spirit; acts of respect, generosity, and courage; and a willingness to teach others in their respective journeys along the red road. Learned and accomplished medicine men and women continue to seek spiritual knowledge through fasting, visions, dreams, and ceremonies. They strive to set examples to others of upright lives and to refrain from alcohol, drugs, and extramarital encounters. Instruction in Lakota beliefs and traditions is generally aimed at Lakota youth; but it is sometimes given to non-Indians, such as myself. \"Some people won't speak of these things to the wasicu,\" said during one of our sessions at his house. \"These people don't understand that we have to teach our young people these things, or they will be lost. You carne here to learn Indian ways. That is good. I'm teaching you these things because I know you are trying to live a good life.\" He explained further the importance of 123 teaching. \"The tongue is the most sacred part of the body. When you die, your spirit--your breath--touches your tongue when it leaves for the last time. When you talk to somebody, your words spillover your tongue. When you teach somebody about the Great Spirit, he puts words in your spirit and you breathe them out over your tongue. The tongue is very important.\" Other informants stressed the obligation of parents to teach their children Lakota values. Said Molly Yellow Necklace, \"Parents should spend more time with their kids. People don't care anymore. They're apathetic or depressed. People don't live clean lives anymore. They don't have respect for anybody. They don't take care of old people. They just live for today; they don't care about the future. They don't teach their kids anything. \"I don't see kids doing anything except shacking up and making babies. They don't get discipline and moral teaching from home. They pick up a lot from TV. When I was younger, we would be ashamed if we weren't doing anything, like looking for a job, working. Parents shoUld teach their kids about values.\" \"The important thing is education,\" explained Ron War Fire, 56, an ex-Marine who returned to the reservation to care for his ailing mother. \"Parents must want more for their children than what they have for themselves. Their health must be better. Their education must be better. A 124 person has to grow up with a role model. There aren't many role models here, so kids drop out of school, get hooked on alcohol and drugs, and wind up on the government dole for the rest of their lives.\" Mr. War Fire then recounted his experiences as a shop instructor at an Indian boarding school. \"We'd get kids from families who didn't have the means to give them the kind of education they wanted. These were kids who'd never been off the reservation. We taught them how to take a bus, how to get around in a city, how to apply for a job--you know how difficult those forms can be. We tried to develop their skillS so that someday they could get a job if they wanted to leave the reservation--or maybe they could set up their own business on the reservation. We taught survival skills.\" \"In the old days, people took care of themselves. They took pride in what they could do and in who they were. You asked me what I thought caring was. Well, that's it: instilling pride and confidence through education.\" Analysis of Lakota Health and Caring Data \"Cultural behavior should always be studied and categorized in terms of the inside view--the actors' definition--of human events\" (Pelto & Pelto, 1978, p. 54). The themes that surfaced throughout the interviews 125 reflected the four traditional Lakota values. Inductive analysis prompts the use of indigenous terms to categorize ethnocaring practices: (a) caring as generosity, (b) caring as courage, (c) caring as respect, and (d) caring as wisdom. (Figure 3 illustrates these categories. Note that the categories overlap.) Caring as generosity involves providing food and shelter to the needy; support to family members, especially to children and to the elderly; communal sharing of goods as demonstrated by the giveaway and ceremonies adopted from other tribes; and the Hunkapi ceremony. Caring as courage is linked to communal welfare and is seen in participation in the Sun Dance and in voluntary service to the national community in the Armed Forces. Caring as respect is exhibited in visiting the sick, the mourning, and the housebound; in holding memorial services for the deceased; in actions on behalf of the elderly; in touching another in an embrace or handshake; and in singing or dancing to honor songs. Personal health care practices reflect respect for oneself through the maintenance of a healthy diet, exercise in terms of productive and leisure activities, the inipi ceremony, and self-care behaviors, which include making decisions concerning the use of both traditional and nontraditional health services.

I-' N 0\\ 127 cUlminates in the development of wisdom. Seeking to discern the will of the Great Spirit through fasts, visions, dreams, and ceremonies is evidence of spiritual openness, a form of wisdom and a component of spiritual health/harmony. Other practices that demonstrate caring as wisdom include teaching others, especially children, the traditional values; being a role model; educating others in self-care; and developing personal skills and self-pride. How these health and caring categories are inter- preted by those receiving nontraditional health care is examined next. Lakota Perceptions of Caring Among Nontraditional Health Care Providers In my interviews with the Lakota people, I explained the need for health care providers to understand the health and caring practices of this cultural group in order to give more sensitive care. The responses to my inquiries were flooded with references to encounters between the respondents and health professionals. Traditional versus Nontraditional Health Care One area of concern dealt with the interplay of traditional and nontraditional health care. An assistant to the community health representative in one of the communities recalled an incident pitting old and modern 128 medicine ways. \"One time, a long time ago--it was in the '60s--a person went to a doctor and told him he used Indian medicine. The doctor wanted to know where he got the medicine. 'You shouldn't use that,' he said. 'Indian medicine could kill you.' The doctor got real mad. He didn't understand how important the medicine was to that man. II Ella Looks Around, a nurse who staffed the reservation clinics for years, confirmed this story and added, \"If somebody is taking Indian medicine and it's helping him, that's all right. They can keep on doing that. Now if they're seriously ill, then you should try to convince them to take the medicine that they get from the doctor; but they can still go to the medicine man. I know some doctors get really mad when they do this.\" Another suggestion for an intertwining of the two health care traditions, Lakota and non-Indian, was voiced by another health care provider, Gene Black Tail Fox. \"They [the Indian Health Service] should get the medicine people together and have them draw up a list of medicines that they use, then keep the list in a book. If somebody comes in to clinic who's using an herb, check it out in the book. If it interferes with other medicines, advise the patient to keep his care ceremonial to respect his spirituality. Work with the medicine man. When people come in and say they want to pray for a person, do some chants, or burn a little sweetgrass, that should be 129 permitted. You can work the situation around the hospital care.\" A plea for understanding of health care choices and priorities carne from several community members. \"Sometimes people will go to the medicine man first, if they think their problem can be taken care of with traditional ways,\" said Frances White Bonnet. \"I know of a man who had a bad rash on his hands and arms. He went to a healer who did a ceremony and put some grease on the man's rash. After that, the man said it didn't itch at all and was beginning to fade.\" Other people, she related, seek nontraditional medical help first, then use the services of a traditional healer in tandem with their medical therapy. Greg Hollow Reed emphasized concern for an in- dividual's priorities in seeking medical help. \"What I perceive as an emergency, the medical staff doesn't think it's important. People come in when they think it's important; otherwise, they wouldn't take the time to come in. They are left to sit for hours without being told anything\" about their conditions or about how long it will be before they see a health care provider. \"Maybe it's an attitude thing,\" he added. \"Because the services are free, the doctors don't treat people well.\" Other informants expressed their perceptions of nontraditional health care services in recalling their past experiences with hospital stays. 130 Tom Shoots Far lay in the intensive care unit of an off-reservation hospital. A cardiac arrest precipitated his admission; poorly-controlled diabetes complicated his prognosis. \"The nurses took very good care of me. They took my temperature, blood pressure, and pulse and watched my [heart] monitor and oxygen machine. They came in and out all day to check up on me.\" A week later, he was transferred to another hospital and recuperated on the medical floor. \"The nurses there weren't very good,\" he said. \"They take care of you when you come in sick, then they leave you alone. You ask them for something or ask them to tell the doctor something, and they come back later and say they forgot.\" Caring, to Mr. Shoots Far, entailed watchfulness and efficiency, as exhibited in the monitoring of vital signs and machinery. Another informant related his experiences with hospital and clinic care. \"I was in intensive care for 3 days,\" recalled Richard Red otter, who had suffered a cardiac arrest. \"Now, those nurses were good. They kept me alive after my ticker stopped. They had to be good. They knew what they were doing and they told me what they were doing too. They explained all the pills and machines and the treatments.\" He went on to describe some of the nursing care that he thought was exceptional. \"They washed my hair! The nurse came in with a wheelchair and took me down the hall and stuck my hair in water! Then, 131 one day out of the blue, a nurse comes in and gives me a malted milk!\" The nurses also involved his wife, Cecilia, in his care. \"My wife takes care of me now. She gives me my insulin shots,\" said the 77-year-old gentleman, who has diabetes. \"She watches my diet too. She talked to a dietitian in the hospital who told her I could eat anything I didn't like. [Cecilia]'s an old eagle eye; she watches me and what I eat.\" He protested Cecilia's claim that \"He's ornery!\" saying, \"With all her faults, she loves me still.\" Going the Extra Mile Mr. Red otter protested the rigidity of the health care system. \"Nurses here are better than the doctors because they really want to help you. It was cold and icy one day, and my legs weren't too good. I couldn't get out because I was feeling pretty sick, so I called the clinic [in town] and asked if the doctor could drop by. It's just on his way home. He has to pass here every day.\" The Red otters' house is located a few blocks from the clinic and is on the main road through town. \"The doctor said he couldn't stop--it was against the rules.\" \"The nurses are pretty nice. They'd bend over backwards for me, without making much to-do about it. That's what caring is: going out of your way for someone and making it look like it's part of your job. People know when someone is going that extra mile. That's 132 caring.\" \"Going that extra mile\" for one nurse meant driving 10 extra miles to take a client horne after her evening shift at the hospital. Stella Makes Plenty, who suffered multiple contusions after being hit in the face with a garden hose, had no way horne from the hospital after her examination in the emergency room. The nurse, who was about to drive the 30 miles to her horne, offered to give Mrs. Makes Plenty a ride to the village 10 miles south of the nurse's town. This act prompted Mrs. Makes Plenty to say, \"Now that's a person who cares!\" Physical Hygiene Like Mr. Red otter's experiences, the hospital encounters of two elderly women were most memorable in terms of physical nursing care. Wilma Good Bird was hospitalized with pneumonia 2 years ago. \"The nurses treated me good,\" recalled the 98-year-old crocheter. \"They gave me a bath, greased me up [with lotion], and let me rest.\" Because of arthritic pain, Mrs. Good Bird has difficulty ambulating, which makes getting in and out of a bathtub impossible at home; thus, the physical care was a special treat. Laura Swift Thunder, Mrs. Good Bird's daughter, aged 70, sat in the bedroom on a sunken mattress. One leg had been amputated years ago. She kept the other leg extended onto the seat of a wheelchair. She was partially blind and very obese from the hips up. 133 Mrs. Swift Thunder was hospitalized 2 years ago for uncontrolled diabetes. The nurses, she said, had always been kind and helpful to her in her many hospital admissions through the years. What, to her, demonstrated caring best? \"They gave me a bath and combed my hair. II To Mrs. Swift Thunder, like many other reservation residents, running water is a luxury. The elderly Swift Thunder couple use an outhouse or a slop bucket as a toilet and water is obtained from a pump outside. It is not difficult to understand how attention to a client's hygiene could be interpreted as the epitome of hospital care. Interpersonal Relationships Gene Black Tail Fox focused on the interpersonal dimensions of care during his stay at a hospital 3 years ago. \"I was in bad shape with diabetes,\" said the 34- year-old male. \"The nurses and the doctors treated me very well. They greeted me when I came in. They were very cordial. They told me the time frame when things were going to happen. The nurse would say, 'The doctor will be with you in 15 or 20 minutes.' And when he didn't show up, the nurse would come in again and tell me that the doctor would be late. Then, when the doctor came, he'd apologize.\" \"They explained the full information and the test results. The nurse told me that she knew what I was in 134 the hospital for, explained who was going to corne and see me, what their names and their specialties were. They had a plan of action. When the doctor carne to see me, the nurse was there too to understand what the plan of action would be. Later, the nurse would explain whatever else would be needed. 'Personable' is the word I'd use.\" Last year, Mr. Black Tail Fox had a much different experience with the health care staff. \"My son was in the hospital with appendicitis. The nurses were very good, but they seemed too concerned about charting. 'You're just here for a routine operation' was their attitude. 'There's no problem, and I'm just worried about getting my charting done or somebody will corne down hard on me.'\" He paused to reflect a moment, and then continued. \"The Indian coming from the reservation might not understand the hospital system with all its paperwork requirements, but what he does understand is the interpersonal aspect. Some people will say that nursing has advanced to a very technological field. But if that's the case, then hire some robots. People look forward to the nurse's personal touch. How do you combine the two? I don't have the answer to that, but I'll tell you this: you have to be personable and develop the attitude 'I wouldn't treat you any way I wouldn't be treated.' You treat that child as if he were your own.\" Molly Yellow Necklace echoed Mr. Black Tail Fox's 135 sentiments. \"Nurses sometimes have a no-care attitude. Patients are sometimes abandoned, like the time [Cliff, her husband] was in the hospital. The phone at the nurses' station was ringing and ringing. This was late at night, and there wasn't anyone around to answer the phone. Finally, [Cliff] answered it. \"Nurses should see to the patient's needs, even if he's a complainer. That's your job. You keep on doing for people even if you think it's a hopeless case. Caring is when the nurse knows the details on her patients. If a visitor asks how a patient is, she [the nurse] can tell you how he ate, who came to visit. Things get done. \"When I was in the hospital, the nurses were efficient and caring. Things were clean. They saw to your needs. You can tell when they walk into the room that they know what they're doing. It's not like this anymore. It might be due to the nursing shortage.\" Attitude was the subject of yet another individual's comments. \"Nurses are in a caring position,\" said Ron War Fire, \"and they have to care for a person, no matter what kind of personality he has. That's their career!\" A caring attitude, he continued, involves intuition and rapport. \"Our area is used only as a stepping stone for doctors. I know people need to go and further their careers, but I wish something could be done to keep them 136 here. Doctors should develop that feeling--an intuitive caring--for the people. They have a stake in the people and in the patients. If they're here for 6 months or a year, that's not enough time to develop a relationship with the people or a sense of what they need.\" structuring her history-taking and health education activities around informal dialogue with others is how clinic nurse Ella Looks Around develops a helping rapport with her clients. \"Caring means talking to patients. Some of it is a kind of joking around about their problems or their eating--an informal visit. For example, somebody will say, 'I was at a feast' or 'I was eating cake,' and we'll laugh about it. They know they're not supposed to do that, especially if they're diabetic. So I'll remind them of their diet without being judgmental.\" \"Caring is empathy. It's saying, 'I know what it's like to take a pill four times a day.' Caring is giving instructions, too, on medications: what symptoms to watch for, what these symptoms mean, what to do when you get sick. You have to teach them so that they can make their own decisions about their health care.\" She related a recent incident about how her instructions to one person helped in the care of another. \"Emma's daughter Ann had a baby who was given some antibiotics for an infection. Emma told her daughter to stop giving the baby the medicine after a few days because the baby looked better. 137 The nurse had told Ann's sister, Sheila, in the past that it was important to build up a blood level of certain medicines, so that the illness will be taken care of once and for all. Sheila told this to her sister, so Ann took the baby down to the basement of their house to give it the antibiotic until the 10 days were over. Ella saw the baby afterward and said, 'See? I told you the baby would be better without the rest of the medicine.' The sisters didn't say anything because they didn't want to offend their mother.\" \"The people really appreciate it when you take their vital signs,\" Mrs. Looks Around continued. \"Sometimes I get so busy and somebody comes in wanting a blood pressure check. So I'll try to fit people in whenever I can because I know it's important to them. \"Even just saying 'Hello' when you pass by in the hall or the waiting room is important. Otherwise, they'll say that you don't even care that they're there. They'll say to me, 'You take time to talk to us. Some people just slap the [blood pressure] cuff on you and tell you to go.' People also like me to give them their insulin injections when they come in for diabetic clinic. They'll say, 'That's the one day I don't have to give myself a shot.' They look forward to it. I give the injection quickly so it doesn't hurt too much. They'll say, 'I didn't feel a thing! ' \" 138 A helping rapport between the nurse and the client sometimes involves playing the part of client-advocate as Mrs. Looks Around has done through the many years of federal budget cuts. \"Caring is fighting for the patient if it's important. If the hospital administrator says we have no money for a patient's treatment or meds or surgery, then something needs to be done. up for them.\" I go and talk Some of Mrs. Looks Around's comments were repeated by Alton Grey Dog, who hasn't been hospitalized for 20 years and whose clinic visits involve only the physical examination required annually by his employer. \"Nurses should develop a positive attitude when talking to people. They should show respect for the person and try to understand what the patient can and can't do. They should sit down and talk with their patients, try to get to know them. Now, with the nursing shortage, everybody's in a hurry.\" Health care workers who did not have time to greet their clients in the clinic hallways were the subjects of Steve Chases Crow's comment on noncaring behavior. \"Some doctors keep their eyes in the air,\" he said, lifting his chin and gazing at the ceiling. \"They know who you are, but they don't say 'Hi'.\" Health care providers who did take time with their clients were most frequently cited as community health 139 nurses. \"Nurses, especially community health nurses, are more into preventive things than doctors. They look at correctible conditions in the environment and have a more rounded approach to the people. They deal with the things that the people are concerned about,\" said Greg Hollow Horn. \"We need nurses in the schools. Kids have a lot of questions and parents don't explain things about growing up,\" Molly Yellow Necklace commented. \"I really give the community health nurse a lot of credit. She visits with the kids, learns about their problems, praises them, gives them confidence.\" A dentist also garnered praise from his clientele and workers. \"The dentist is really well\u00ad liked by the people,\" said a dental assistant. \"One man came in with a very infected tooth: one side of his face and his neck to his chest were all swollen. The dentist sent him to [an off-reservation] hospital and then he called there every day to see how he was doing. He even visited him in the hospital twice. He's really nice to the patients. He'll explain things to them--what he's going to do, what the medicine is for, how they should take care of themselves. They like that. Then they'll go and tell other people how to take care of themselves. He talks to people and jokes with them. He's great to work with.\" Teaching, conversing with, and visiting clients were viewed as signs of caring. 140 Summary and Analysis These comments illustrate the caring behaviors on the part of nurses and other health professionals as perceived by the Lakota people they serve. These behaviors include: 1. respect for traditional medicine practices; 2. consideration for the client's health care choices and priorities; 3. attention to the client's physical hygiene; 4. watchfulness; 5. performance of health care duties in an efficient and timely fashion; 6. health education; 7. efforts above and beyond one's usual duties; 8. demonstration of a positive attitude; 9. formulation of a plan of care that involves the client and the health care team; 10. attentiveness to detail; 11. development of intuitive caring; 12. establishment of a caring relationship with the community through physical presence in that community over an extended period of time (i.e., greater than 1 year); 13. informal dialogue with clients; 14. empathy; 15. verbal acknowledgement of a client's presence; 16. advocacy. What is the connection between these caring behaviors 141 and the health and caring practices of the Lakota? It must be remembered that caring takes place within the cultural context. Caring behaviors, for the Lakota, occur within the framework of traditional values and are usually performed within a kinship society. Caring and health care are personal, social, and holistic activities that fulfill the cultural roles of relatives. The modern health care structure revolves around a different set of values grounded in the Anglo-American culture and is not based on a kinship network. The biomedical paradigm is impersonal. The majority of professional health care providers do not share the culture of their clients. Yet, as many respondents observed, there are a number of nursing behaviors that are perceived as caring. What forms the bridge that links these two diverse modes of health care practice? Within the community of relatives, attendance to the physical needs of oneself and others is central to cultural caring practices. Similarly, within the modern health care system, attention to the client's physical requirements is perceived as caring behavior. Hence, the provision of food, the monitoring of vital signs, back rubs, bathing, and hair washing--those activities which many care providers take for granted--are deemed essential in the demonstration of care. Meeting one's physical needs can a~so fulfill 142 psychosocial needs. For example, meal time is an oppor\u00ad tunity for socialization and familiar food can be a comfort to one far away from home. The manner in which it is served can demonstrate respect for the elderly client or consolation for the young child. Within the community, psychosocial and spiritual needs are met by visiting relatives, respecting one's elders, participating in spiritual and social ceremonies (e.g., giveaways, healing rites, honor songs), embracing or shaking hands with another, and educating others in traditional values and self-care. Caring behaviors that parallel these actions within the context of professional health care include attention to the client's social activity (e.g., the nurse takes note of the client's visitors--if any--and is able to report this information to relatives upon request); respect for elderly clients; encouragement of or participation in cultural rituals where permitted; generosity with one's time, skills, or transportation; the use of touch; and client teaching and enabling. In short, caring can be demonstrated by placing oneself in the position of relative in a kinship group which emphasizes traditional values of generosity, courage, respect, and wisdom. Examples of caring behavior, based on the above data, include: showing deference to the elderly, treating the pediatric client \"as if he were your own,\" persevering in attendance to the 143 needs of the difficult client, going that extra mile for a client whose needs are not met by the conventional biomedical approach, assisting the client and family in determining the type and extent of care, and respecting those decisions. Such a relationship enhances the practice of professional nursing by rooting it in cultural sensitivity. Figure 4 presents a summary of the ethnohealth and ethnocaring data discussed in this chapter and illustrates the conceptual relationship that exists among traditional Lakota values, ethnocaring practices, and nontraditional caring practices. It should be noted that, although health and caring behaviors and their conceptual categor\u00ad ies overlap in many cases (e.g., empathy could be a sign of respect as well as courage; where does generosity end and wisdom begin?), decisions were made arbitrarily for the sake of simplicity. The next chapter will describe how one nurse became a member of the kinship network and how that network and its traditional values influenced the practice of professional nursing.

Gust-driven ice blasted the trees outside. Inside, the scents of sage and sweetgrass drifted toward the ceiling. The Hunkapi ceremony--the making of relatives-- was taking place amid the bare walls and high ceiling of the school gym. I stood near the altar, an area marked by a buffalo skull and by cloths in the colors of the Four Winds. After purifying me with prayers to Tunkasila Wakan Tanka, Grandmother Earth, and the Winds, and with the smoke of sweetgrass that permeated my clothing, the man whom I would henceforth know as Ate--Father--took an Eagle wing and brushed the air around me. Then, before the assembled people, he adopted me. Sarah Elk Horn, an elderly Lakota woman, fastened an Eagle feather in my hair 147 and told me my Lakota name, II Win. \" Ate, the tribe's medicine man, explained earlier his reasons for wanting to adopt me as his daughter. \"I had a vision that there was a flame above your head. I know from the Spirits that I am to welcome those persons into the tribe who have that sign. I see that you care for the people too,\" he said. The ceremony concluded. Back at the bleachers, I asked the women the meaning of my name. \"Win is woman,\" said one. \"Waonsila Win,\" another said as she concentrated on the translation. \"Oh, yeah! Pitiful woman!\" \"What?!\" I was surprised. She laughed. \"No, no! I mean pitying, merciful. More than that--more like mercy with love and kindness, like compassion.\" Waonsila Win: Compassionate Woman. I had arrived at the reservation the preceding summer. My initial billet read, \"Community Health Nurse,\" but it was expanded to include my training as a family nurse practitioner. What had I done that set me off as one who cares for the people? I was told by my supervisor when I took the job: \"If you don't do it, it doesn't get done.\" With that as my guiding motto, I staffed the newly reopened field clinics; delivered health care in homes and schools; developed educational programs for preteens, community members, and nurses; and cared for 148 people of all ages and occasionally, their pets. I sutured lacerations, prescribed medications, assessed injuries and illnesses, and instructed in prevention. I washed the hair of children with head lice and scrubbed the matted blood from the heads of beaten clients. I counseled battered women, put bandaids on cut fingers, immunized babies, and tracked down tuberculosis cases in alleys and fields. I placed peanut butter sandwiches in the hands of people who could find no help at the local churches. I washed floors and made the beds of clients who could not do these things themselves, clipped toenails and soaked feet, touched the hearts of a few people and was touched by many more. Extraordinary? Not in the least. It was part of my job. I am a nurse. \"Waonsila Win: this was my grandmother's name,\" Ate mentioned as we finished the postceremonial meal of fry bread, a plum pudding called wojapi, and sunka wohampi-- the traditional Sioux delicacy, \"puppy soup.\" \"I gave you this name, a Lakota name, so that when you die, the Spirits will recognize you and take you into paradise.\" Seasons pass. It is the time of gold and copper-colored grasses, of red-winged blackbirds who flit through the air, of sunflower harvests, and of the elderlies who sit beneath squaw-coolers and tell stories of the autumns past. \"I want to teach you something, Daughter,\" Ate said 149 one day. \"I have sons and daughters, but I don't know if they will be medicine people. They must follow the old ways. Right now, there is nobody who is interested in learning these things, so I want to teach you. You can help the people this way.\" Several miles out of town, we climbed to the top of a butte. \"This is where the Stone People live,\" instructed Ate. At our feet lay three large, flat rocks, pockmarked and windworn. Without explanation, Ate stretched a string of tobacco ties, small tobacco-filled pouches, along the grass near the rocks and advised me to lay the red cloth offerings that I brought on the ground beside him. Ate prayed aloud in Lakota, beseeching the help of Tunkasila, Grandmother Earth, and the Four Winds. \"Now we will see what the Stone Persons will show us,\" Ate continued in English. We walked to the largest rock. The wind blew fiercely around us, a hot, dry breath that baked the land and coaxed the rattlesnakes from their holes. \"The tobacco ties will keep the Creeping People away,\" counseled the medicine man. Taking a jar of red powder from his pocket, he sprinkled it onto the rock. Images engraved in the stone became visible. A face with 16 rays extending from its head indicated that I was to have 16 generations. The date 1888 appeared on another portion of the rock. \"The writings change on these stones whenever I come here. 150 Sometimes this date is over on the other side; sometimes it's not even here. Always, it's different,\" Ate explained. We examined the horse and buffalo hoofprints etched in the other rocks. \"What kind of animals could leave such tracks in the stones?\" Ate asked. \"These were sacred people--Four-Ieggeds--who were running by here. They wanted us to know they were here. The wasicu (white people) think that human beings are the smartest people on earth,\" he continued. \"That's not so. We're on the lowest level. The Great Spirit sent us the Winged People --the birds, the Creeping People, the Stone People, and the Four-Ieggeds--other animals, to teach us Two-Ieggeds how to live. Otherwise, we wouldn't know anything. We must learn from these other sacred people.\" The wind blew some of the red powder away and portions of the slabs became grey once again. After a period of silence, Ate spoke. til want to teach you the ways of the Grandfathers. I want to make you a pupil.\" He took the remaining red powder and smeared it in the part in my hair as I knelt in the grass. From his pouch, he took out a feather tied to a small medicine wheel--a cross within a circle--made of flattened porcupine quills dyed yellow. In the center of the wheel was a small shell. \"This is an Eagle feather, part of the Great Spirit. Inside this shell is part of an Eagle heart. 151 This will make you strong and will be a Spirit Helper to you when you doctor people. I want you to learn these things so you can help the people--Lakota and wasicu.\" With that, he tied the feather in my hair. Leaving the tobacco and cloth offerings beside the rocks, we strode down the hill--the medicine man and his apprentice. The Making of a Medicine Person: Two Accounts The call to medicine ways is unique to each potential apprentice. In my case, the invitation carne from a healer within my adoptive kinship structure. For others, the call may occur during a dream or vision or may be self-initiated. Two accounts of Lakota ethnohealer apprenticeship follow. Joseph's story Lightning seared the blackened sky and lit the western horizon in an eerie glow. Deafening thunder crashed through the pummeling sounds of hail. The wind uprooted trees and threatened to rip the buttes from the earth. The little boy woke with a scream. For weeks afterward, Joseph feared thunderstorms, feared the dark, feared to sleep lest dreams of Thunderbeings rage through his thoughts. A holy man was called upon to perform a ceremony for the 8-year-old child. As a thunderstorm approached, Joseph's family gathered outside on a hill and held the boy's arms. In his terror, he tried to pull away, but they held him firmly. Everyone faced west 152 where the thunderstorm arose. The holy man, dressed in black, his hair braided and pulled to the front of his scalp, prayed. On his cloak were circles of polished metal that reflected the storm. Jagged patterns of electricity flashed to the pounding beat of the thunder drums. When the storm finally rumbled away, the rain- drenched party descended the hill--the little boy healed of his fright and of the bad spell put on him by the thunder dream. In years to come, he would wear round mirrors on his costume when he danced, in honor of the Thunderbeings. Joseph learned the old ways from his grandparents; and through them, he learned the teachings of his great- grandparents. Three of his grandfathers and one grandmother were medicine people. Each had the gift of healing, and each performed the ceremonies that were taught to them in their dreams and vision quests. The day came when Joseph, now a young man, sought out his own life's direction in a vision quest. After an inipi ceremony, Joseph climbed to the summit of the butte that overlooked his village. There he fasted and prayed. His mouth dry, his stomach empty, his body weary in the vigil, his vision began. A gentle breeze bent the tall grass in homage before him. Standing, he watched as two Spirit messengers in the form of swallow flew toward him from the east, then turned south. Crossing him, they winged their way north. One final curve and they disappeared into the west. From the ground 153 at his feet arose the visage of an old woman. \"Your Grandfathers need you,\" she told him before she descended into the Earth. He was to be a medicine man among his people. This was the message the Grandfathers, Mother Earth, and the Spirits imparted. In the decades that have passed since that vision, Joseph has felt the presence of the Grandfathers in his practice of traditional healing rites among the residents of his and other communities. His knowledge of herbal medicines and ceremonies was given to him by the Great Spirit and by his ancestors, and he shares his healing gifts with others that the old ways may be continued. This gentle, but powerful, healer is my Ate. Jim's Story Phil Standing Deer was Jim's brother and a man in search of a calling. He spent his time working with the medicine man and learned the ways of the Grandfathers. Jim was a rancher who spent years developing his herd. \"Phil tried to tell me that I should follow the old ways, but I didn't listen. I never had the time to learn or to teach these things. 'Besides,' I thought, 'who'd listen to a cowboy?'\" When spring came, Phil decided to go on a vision quest, Hanbleca, to help him discern his calling to the life of a medicine man. A myocardial infarction took his life the following winter. Shortly thereafter, Jim considered Phil's advice. The medicine man took Jim as his brother, as he had once taken Phil. 154 Presently, Jim is learning the old ways and assists the medicine man in Lakota ceremonies. \"I can interpret for him and it comes naturally. I can counsel young people and people of all ages. I didn't think I was worthy to do that, but he [the medicine man] teaches me as he goes along and I'm still learning. He says that first you have to understand the Seven Sacred Rites so you can explain them to others. You can't just jump into things and be a healer right away. That's not the way. You go on learning from there. I should have listened to Phil from the beginning. I figure he gave up his life for me to see the value of the old ways.\" Jim perceived Phil's death as the ultimate act of generosity: the giving of one's life for another. In this case, that generosity led to Jim's soul-searching and eventual apprenticeship in the healing ways. There is a saying among the Lakota: \"When a good Indian dies, a strong wind blows.\" On the night of Phil's wake, a winter storm moved across the prairie. By the next morning, 18 inches of snow had fallen. Summary Ethnohealing among the Hunkpapa Lakota is rooted in the kinship structure. Ate carne from a family of medicine people. Phil, Jim, and I were adopted into the kinship system through the Hunkapi ceremony by the man who would be our mentor in traditional healing practices. 155 Ethnohealer apprenticeship begins with a spiritual call, an invitation from another healer, or self-initiated inquiry. Apprenticeship entails learning the healing ways of one's ancestors, seeking healing power through traditionally approved conduits of knowledge (e.g., dreams, visions, Spirits) and assisting the mentor in ceremonies. Prolonged engagement lasting many years appears to be necessary for the apprentice, who becomes a medicine person when a spiritual encounter results in the receipt of medicine from the Spirits. \"You go on a vision quest,\" explained Ate. \"When you come down [from the hill], if you have a medicine with you, then you are a medicine person.\" The next section deals with the methods and content of ethnohealer apprenticeship under Ate. Ethnohealer Apprenticeship: Methods and Content Lessons in Health and Illness In the time since my investiture as an apprentice medicine woman, I have been instructed in the Lakota traditional healing practices as interpreted by Ate, who follows the Bear and Eagle medicine ways. There are other healing traditions, such as Buffalo medicine and Yuwipi, but Ate's power lies in Bear and Eagle arts. My first lessons in Lakota healing came not from a book, but from the night sky. \"Look at the Big Dipper,\" 156 Ate directed. \"You see seven stars. Each star stands for one of the sacred rites that were taught to the Lakota people by White Buffalo Calf Woman.\" He explained the rites as he had learned them, and advised me to read the words of Black Elk, the Lakota spiritual leader \"who told a wasicu these things so everybody--all people the colors of the Four Winds: black, white, red, and yellow-- could understand and have respect for all the relatives.\" I learned the Lakota prayer, \"Mitakuye oyasin\" (\"For all my relatives\") and practiced the tradition of facing the morning and evening suns with thanksgiving. The lessons were sporadic and frequently unexpected. Ate would appear at my door and inform me that he wanted to teach me something. Once, he gave me a small, white, leather pouch which contained minute portions of the 28 roots and herbs proper to Bear and Eagle medicine traditions, along with \"the dead carcasses of seven ants, Insect people who carry the medicines on their backs.\" Ate explained that this pouch would be a Spirit Helper in my healing practice. On another occasion, Ate counseled me in personal conduct. Living the life of a \"worthy person,\" he explained, means practicing the traditional Lakota values of generosity, courage, wisdom, and respect. I was to take White Buffalo Calf Woman as my role model. The song that she sang as she approached the Sioux camp, bringing 157 with her the sacred pipe and the knowledge of the seven sacred rites, was to aid me in my quest for worthiness and in my healing practice: With visible breath I am walking. A voice I am sending as I walk. In a sacred manner I am walking. With visible tracks I am walking. In a sacred manner I walk. (Neihardt, 1959, pp. 3-4) Failure to live in a worthy manner could bring on illness, according to Ate. People could become sick if they act uncharitably toward others, or if they do not fulfill their responsibilities to their families or community. Ate told me of a woman who drank a good deal of alcohol, abused her relatives, and did not respect the elderly. She lost her two legs to diabetes. \"It's like a grasshopper. You pull its legs off. You pull one leg off and let it go. Or if you really don't like it, you pull two legs off and its wings and let it go. Wakan Tanka does the same to people who don't follow the good ways. \"There are two roads in life. Think of the Sun Dance pole, or the cross--they're both the same. The long pole is the red road. It is the narrow path that people follow who try to lead good lives, try to help other people who come to them.\" \"The other pole is the black road. It is wider, shorter, and easier to follow. This is for people who don't respect their relatives, don't help anybody out. You should walk the red road. Then you will be a worthy 158 person. \" Illness could also be brought on by \"bad medicine.\" In addition to knowing traditional healing practices, medicine persons learn--but do not necessarily practice-\u00ad traditions designed to inhibit the health of others. One form of bad medicine resembles the object intrusion of other cultures. Bad medicine is sometimes made by combining powdered rattlesnake tail, certain powdered herbs and roots, and other sundry ingredients. Small portions of this or other concoctions are placed in a reed, a porcupine quill, or some such object that has a hollow middle. This object is then thrown at the intended victim. This person may then become acutely ill, or may acquire a chronic illness such as diabetes or cancer. \"These are [the prankster Spirit] Iktomi's ways,\" explained Ate. \"Those who follow the black road practice these things.\" Ate related two cases in which he was instrumental in healing people afflicted with bad medicine. A Canadian medicine man was running for a tribal council seat in his community. Someone threw bad medicine on him without his knowing ito He complained of feeling weak for some time when he saw Ate. Ate performed a Bear medicine ceremony for him. A week later, the man returned with a porcupine quill, the part of the bad medicine that was thrown at him and caused his illness. Ate burned the quill to destroy 159 it and the man returned home. A few months later, however, the man died. \"I think there was still some bad medicine in him,\" explained Ate. \"There was another porcupine quill that worked its way to his heart.\" Another man whose wife was desired by a Crow medicine man became ill. During a pow wow, the Crow threw bad medicine at the other man and it lodged in his throat. The man developed a persistent cough and was unable to sing. \"He went to the doctors who took x-rays and couldn't find anything. He even went to another medicine man who couldn't help him,\" Ate said. Eventually, the man sought Ate for assistance. Ate performed a Bear medicine ceremony, blowing the smoke of the Bear medicine root into the man's throat and admonishing the bad medicine Spirit to leave the sick man's body. \"While the man was driving back home, he coughed up a blade of grass with bad medicine in its shaft,\" said Ate. again. \" \"He didn't get sick Verbal curses can also carry the Spirit of bad medicine to cause illness, according to another source. \"An Indian woman cursed a man in fron.t of others. The man didn't know about it until someone told him: 'You're going to have a heart attack because she put a curse on you.' The next day, he had a heart attack.\" Prayers and offerings to Iktomi can bring trouble to others, ranging from mild annoyance to severe accidents. 160 One who practices bad medicine can send Iktomi' mes\u00ad sengers, spiders, to spy on people or to create mischief. \"Sometimes you'll be looking and looking for something that's not where you left it. The spiders have moved it,\" explained another informant. In other cases, the trauma is more palpable. I was told about someone who put cloth offerings to Iktomi on a tree growing beside a sharply\u00ad curving road in the hope that cars would swerve and fall off the embankment. \"I know about these things,\" Ate confided. \"I even have a couple of rattles that spark when you hit the ground with them, but I don't want to use the ways of darkness. I do not want to follow the black road. \"Follow the red road and you will be healthy.\" Lakota Healing Practices During the course of my apprenticeship, Ate shared his knowledge of medicine ways with me, unfolding the complex patterns of songs and herbal usage as one would unfold a starquilt: slowly, with respect for the designer and awe at the multicolored, intricate weave. \"We had medicine women in the past, but we don't have hardly any nowadays,\" Ate began one day. \"In wasicu (white people's) ways, the nurse is like a medicine woman: wayazna wawanyeka.\" He took the paper I handed him and spelled out the word for \"nurse.\" Ate sat on his bed in the cramped, three-room house 161 on the outskirts of town. Green, faded paint peeled from the walls. A white cloth was stuffed into a crack to keep the wind out. Behind Ate hung an Eagle fan, unframed snapshots of his family, and a picture of past Lakota chiefs. A large white bucket sat on a table and held the drinking water for the inhabitants. Beside the bucket lay a small metal pot that served as a dipper and cup. \"I want to teach you, Daughter, some of the things that I learned from my Grandparents: the medicine and the songs that are to be learned with the medicine. II \"I wish I was a worthy person that I could be talking good, using the word that was good to hear; but my language is kind of poor. At least I can teach somebody of the greater things that I know.\" Over the next weeks, Ate described the different healing practices with which he was familiar. Descrip\u00ad tions of Eagle, Bear, stone, and herbal healing traditions follow. Eagle Medicine Wanbli pejuta, or Eagle medicine, is a type of healing practice that is frequently used with canunpa, or sacred pipe, ceremonies. \"Eagle medicine is most helpful for persons who have lesser illnesses,\" Ate mentioned, although it can be very powerful in the right hands. \"The canunpa came from heaven. If you have no medicine, but you have the canunpa, and you pray for the person and mean 162 the words, the sick will come back to life--even if they are on the other side.\" Healing customs in Eagle medicine consist of singing songs, praying with the sacred pipe, and fasting. There are many variations in the ceremonies, depending on the healer's past spiritual experiences and skills. Regarding the latter, Ate is renowned for his ability to compose beautiful and touching healing songs during ceremonies. The Lakota healer's power, noted Ate, is invested in sacred beings (e.g., animals, birds, reptiles, stones) and in the healer him-or herself. \"When a medicine man dies, his power goes back to the Great Spirit. He cannot die with the power,\" Ate said. Taking a hide-covered drum in his left hand, Ate closed his eyes and began beating out the rhythm of the Eagle medicine song with the cloth-draped drumstick in his other hand. He sang in Lakota, then translated the words into English: Eagle Medicine Song From above I have come as a holy people. The sacred pipe was brought to you. Look at it and don't fool me. My words are sacred and don't fool me. Please do not fool me. From above I have come as a holy people. I bring you the medicine that you can help your people. Please do not fool me. 163 My words are sacred. [The above two verses are then repeated.] \"The song was about this: a lonely Eagle was flying above, in between heaven and earth, flying over something that's sacred. 'You have to honor these things that I fly over,' the Eagle says. 'Don't fool me. What I fly over is all sacred.'\" \"Sometimes this is sung with the pipe ceremony. The pipe was filled [with a mixture of tobacco and kinni- kinnik, red dogwood or red alder bark (Brown, 1980)]. Prayers were said, and then this song was sung in front of the people so that nobody would be lying. If someone made a vow, he had to live up to it.\" The song reminded the community of its commitments. Ate paused a moment and watched a fly dance in the sunbeams, the insect's shadow playing across the barren floor. He adjusted his braided hair, then went on: \"The Spotted Eagle, Wanbli Gleska, is the most sacred Eagle person--higher than the Bald Eagle. There is a medicine song that cries out to the Spotted Eagle. Whoever wants to learn the sacred ways of Eagle medicine should learn this song: Spotted Eagle Song Spotted Eagle, come and visit me. Great Spirit, Tunkasila, come in the form of the Spotted Eagle and visit me. Spotted Eagle, Tunkasila, come and visit me. This is the way he created you. Beyond heaven, he created you. This is the way he created you. Corne and visit me. Spotted Eagle, corne and visit me. Tunkasila Wakan Tanka, corne in the form of the Spotted Eagle and visit me in what I'm trying to do. Spotted Eagle, corne and visit me. Beyond heaven, this is the way he created you. Beyond heaven, you were created this way. Beyond heaven, you were created this way. Corne and visit me. 164 \"Another song that is used with Eagle medicine,\" Ate continued, \"is the Fasting Song. It was sometimes sung on a hilltop, sometimes near the sacred things where the Spotted Eagle appeared. A man was fasting on a hill and the Great Spirit came and used these words to teach him how to doctor the people. This is about Wakan Tanka.\" He put the drum on the floor saying, \"You don't use the drum with this song,\" and began to sing. Fasting Song It is I, it is me. It is me-- you have prayed to me. I will listen to you. It is me, your Father. I will listen to you, whatever you have to say to me in prayers. You people, Earth people, look at me. My hand is sacred. Somebody has said so and it happened. You Earth people, look at me. My hand is sacred. Somebody has said so and it happened. You people have said, \"There is no sacred thing here in the world.\" So I have come from above, from heaven. You must tell each other that you may live again. You people have said, \"There is no sacred thing here in the world.\" So I have come from above. You must tell each other that you may live again. Ate looked up. \"Many people don't respect the 165 teachings of their Grandparents. Sometimes they get sick because they're looking for other things to make them happy. This song tells them to seek out the sacred things. Then they will be well.\" \"I told you that Eagle medicine is used most of the time for illnesses that are not too bad. But it can help even people who are dying. When a person is about to die and an Eagle medicine person happens to be around, a doctoring ceremony is done. Just when this half-dead person is about to give up his breath--his spirit--the doctoring song begins.\" Again, Ate lowered his head, closed his eyes, and intoned a haunting Lakota melody: Doctoring Song Friend, please return. Friend, please return. Return to this temple that you may live the animal and bird ways. Please return to this temple. 166 \"The person gets well and up and around,\" commented the medicine man. \"It is a good song.\" Bear Medicine A traveler crossed the river, intending to camp by a large tree that grew there. Suddenly, a Bear appeared and lunged at him. With a few claw scratches on his arm, the man ran to the tree. The Bear pursued him with outstretched claws as the man drew a blade from his cloak. Around and around the tree they ran, swiping at each other with claw or knife, till three-quarters of the day had passed. Glancing skyward, the Bear noted the setting sun. \"Friend,\" said the Bear, IIlet's quit fighting. I'll go my way and you'll go your way.\" They took each other as relatives and became friends. \"That's how we have Bear medicine people,\" Ate concluded. \"The Bear people--Mahto oyate--became friends and relatives of the Lakota a long, long time ago. They taught us powerful medicine ways. The Mahto pejuta [Bear medicine] is powerful and is best for very sick people.\" Unwrapping a red cloth, Ate handed me several short segments of a woody, mildly pungent root. The root, he said, grows in the Custer area of the Black Hills of South Dakota and can be used as a tea or a \"smoke.\" If used as a tea, the root can be immersed in water for 2 days, or it can be boiled shortly before the healing ceremony. If used as a \"smoke,\" the tip of the root lit and the sick person is anointed with the smoke. On occasion, both smoke and tea may be used, depending on the healer's preferences. 167 \"The first thing you do before starting any medicine ceremony is look at the person--at his eyes, at his breathing. This will tell you how sick he is. If an Indian person is very sick, he won't talk to you,\" instructed Ate. \"Touching is used for healing too. Put your hands on the sick person's pulse first, without prayers.\" He touched his radial pulse. \"Then see if the skin is hot or cold. Remember this, because when you touch the person later, after the ceremony, the skin will feel different.\" \"You can touch the person's back, close to the heart,\" he continued, pressing his fingertips to the left upper portion of my back. \"Touch the chest, the sides of the head, the neck, the sides of the forehead above the eyes, and the lips. These are the ways my Grandmother told me. \"Some people don't need to touch the sick person that much. I know a man who could stand about 4 feet away from the person, raise his hand toward that person, and bring the illness out. When you do this, you have to chew the Bear medicine root and act like a Bear. You must make sounds and walk like a Bear. \"The Bear medicine song is sung when you use the 168 root.\" Ate intoned two songs, explaining that one or both could be employed in the rite. Bear Medicine Song #1 Father Bear, come and help me. I'm going to doctor a person lying down that I may bring him back up. Mother Bear, come and help me doctor this person to make him over. I'll make him over. Bear Medicine Song #2 Father, come and help me. A man is lying down sick. I will make him over. Father, help me. Mother, come and help me. My relative is sick in bed. I will make him over. Please help me. Mother, come and help me. My relative is sick in bed. I will make him over. Please help me. \"If you are using the smoke,\" Ate remarked, \"use it first. The smoke is used allover the body with prayers. Then have the person drink the tea.\" When the medicine person touches the ill one again, the skin temperature will have changed and the illness will be gone. Ate added, \"There's no payment, unless the person is able and willing to make some offering of anything that's valuable; or if they're poor--why, they don't need to offer anything. The offering is to the Mahto oyate, the Bear nation, and when they receive any offering, they are 169 happy. \" \"So these are the preachings of our Grandfathers of yesterday, when they were here in the world. But they are all gone now. They are not here. But we are young. We try to teach people with these medicines. The Bear medicine is one of the most powerful medicines that Indian people have--and we have it!\" Stone Medicine Called Inyan pejuta in Lakota, Stone medicine is used by healers in a limited fashion, usually in conjunction with other medicine practices. In the past, Yuwipi healers drew their power from the stone people. flThere are no true Yuwipi men now,\" said Ate. \"All died and they didn't leave their teachings for the young.\" Ate reached into his suitcase and pulled out a heavy object wrapped in red cotton. It was a polished rock in the shape of a half-moon. The outer surface was tan in color and sandy in texture, with a 3-inch diameter. The flat top had been buffed to a high shine. Near the perimeter of the rock was a jagged hole. Ate related this story: A woman traveled from Florida to seek the help of a medicine man in the area for her personal problems. After consulting several healers, she was still beset with troubles and returneq home. There, she found the rock described above. One night, she had a dream. She was wandering about on the glazed surface of the stone. She slipped, fell into the hole in the rock, and was 170 unable to crawl out. A man appeared atop the rock, reached down into the hole, and pulled her out. It was Ate. When she returned to the reservation, she told him of her dream, acknowledging that she had gone to the wrong people in the past. Her problems, after that dream, resolved. She came to thank Ate and planned to dance and to make a vow at the summer Sun Dance. Before she left, she gave Ate the rock. \"I keep this stone with some others I have. I might use it one day in a medicine ceremony,\" added He pulled out something from around his neck. It was a black stone with a face carved on its surface. \"This is for protection,\" he said, not wishing to elaborate on it further. \"I have 19 other stones that I use with medicine sometimes. When you are looking for medicine stones, use rocks that have moss growing around their base. Be sure to put four tobacco ties by the stone before taking it. This shows respect for the Stone person. Herbal Medicine In addition to the Bear medicine root, Ate gave me several other plants, or parts of plants, that are used in healing rites. Bitter root is a medicinal root named for its bitter taste. It can be chewed for the relief of toothaches, or boiled in a tea and drunk for diabetes, eye diseases, and cramping extremities. An 81-year-old ex-rodeo rider and a former client of mine boiled bitter root, drank the tea for leg cramps, and attested to its efficacy. 171 Sweetgrass is a prairie grass that grows in the Custer region of South Dakota. After being dried and braided, it is burned as incense in prayer and purifica\u00ad tion rites. Sage is a common herb that can be boiled and drunk as a tea for any type of illness. It is also used in purification rites. An unnamed medicine is a stubby, woody root that is boiled as a tea and drunk for fever, tetanus, kidney and gastrointestinal disorders, and for easing childbirth. Medicine pumpkin is a member of the squash family and is used in the treatment of gall bladder disease. The meat is boiled and drunk as a tea. When collecting plants, it is necessary to tell the Spirit of the plant of one's intentions and to ask its forgiveness for taking the plant's life. Tobacco is frequently left at the site as an offering to the Spirit. \"If you pick medicine roots,\" said another informant, \"go to an area where not many people have been. There's less of a chance that a menstruating woman passed by.\" Her power would rob the root of its potency. Responsibilities of the Medicine Woman Although both men and women have been accepted as ethnohealers within the Lakota culture, there are specific responsibilities placed upon menstruating women. Beliefs about the interaction of menstrual power and spiritual 172 power were cited by Powers (1984) in a description of Lakota ceremony: Women having their menstrual period were forbidden to enter the Yuwipi because they offended the spirits. One woman told how someone having her period once went into a Yuwipi. The meeting started, but soon all the covers on the windows were ripped off. The Yuwipi man told the people that there was a woman among them who was having her menses, so the spirits became frightened and returned to their homes. (p. 39) I was present when a Lakota man in his 80s admonished a group of female health care providers to avoid giving care to the ill when the providers were menstruating. \"If you take care of a person when you're on your moon [menstruating], that person can get worse. If you're operating on a person at that time, that person could die!\" I questioned Ate about the effects of menstruation on medicine. \"What that man said is not true,\" he commented. \"The power of a woman on her moon is not bad--it's just different. It is more powerful than the power of a medicine man or a medicine. If you have a medicine and you come across a woman on her moon, the medicine won't work. What the hospital does is different medicine. It doesn't matter if you're at that time [menstruating] or not. \" Ate impressed upon me that the duties of the medicine woman to her community involve the responsible use of power, whatever its source. Whether that power is 173 potentially helpful or destructive, knowledge of power is a gift from the Spirits. It is the use of that power that sets the ethnohealer on the path of her or his choice: the red road or the black road. My apprenticeship in Lakota healing progressed sporadically over the following year as I tried to learn the Bear and Eagle medicine songs and practices. It was not until a sequence of dreams over a 6-month period that the direction of my apprenticeship became manifest. A Dreamer of Coyotes A woman walked alone in the snow-covered woods. Suddenly, a coyote appeared and the chase was on. The woman ran through the snow, her strides shorter and slower than the sungmanitu that fOllowed her. Then, she stopped and whirled about. Before the coyote could spring, the woman's fingers plunged into the scruff of its neck and, with the blade in her hand, she slit its throat. Another coyote appeared in the distance. Again, the woman raced through the snow, then pivoted and, clutching the second animal's fur, sliced its throat. Blood painted the white snow, and the four-legged dropped to the ground. \"I think it is an important thing that you dreamt of coyotes,\" Ate commented, his face lit with the morning light pouring through the blue-curtained pane. \"This was the second dream you had. Tell me the first one again.\" I paused a moment, recalling the vividness and nagging repetition of my first coyote dream. Another winter scene. I was standing outside, scraping snow off my car. A coyote's howl shocked the still air. I walked to the street and 174 peered into the prairie that stretched behind the housing. It was then that I saw the coyote at the outskirts of the field--and it saw me. As it leapt toward me, ran to my house, dashing up the stairs and through the door just as it caught up with me. Slamming the door on its nose, I hit the coyote's snout with the car brush a couple of times. Then the dream repeated itself, but I was by a different house. While scraping off my car, I heard a coyote in the distance. We spotted each other. The coyote charged. I ran into the house, slamming the door on the animal's nose. After several whacks on its snout with the brush, the coyote was gone and the details of the first scene repeated themselves. Ate listened with his eyes focused on the floor. He nodded. \"Today, before you came, the dogs outside were barking. They were responding to the coyote's call. They knew a dreamer of coyotes was coming.\" \"You say they were trying to teach you something over and over. My Great-Grandfather came from some place far away. He carried with him poles and hides. He had many dreams on the way. He was a medicine man and you will be a medicine woman. It is good that you have dreams.\" I asked him what the dreams meant. \"There is no coyote medicine man to tell you nowadays 0 They are all dead. They died long before tape recorders and people who write down their songs. \"The coyotes are part of the Sunka oyate, the Dog nation. Dogs, foxes, wolves, coyotes, prairie dogs-- these are all relatives in the Sunka oyate. They were the 175 last of the sacred people who carne to the world. These dreams are important.\" \"You must get a coyote hide. Hang it on a wall and put tobacco offerings on a tree. Then the Coyote Spirit will bring you dreams so you will understand.\" \"I have a coyote hide. It was given to me in a ceremony_ It's the whole thing. It has a head and a long tail that hangs way down. I'll give it to you,\" he offered. The hide was scented with tobacco and sage and was kept in a trunk with some of Ate's other ceremonial paraphernalia. I made 36 tobacco ties--one for each year of my life--of durham wrapped in scarlet cloth and strung together with strong quilting thread. On a wall in my room, I placed the coyote hide and awaited the dreams. In the darkened room, a man robed in brown lay on the floor. Restless, but immobile with fear, he watched the silver coyote enter the room. He was briefly conscious of his racing pulse as the sungmanitu leapt in the air, landed on his chest, and disappeared into his body. The early morning hours were spent in a fitful sleep. I was aware that I was dreaming but unable to wake. Sunlight slowly filtered through the windows and touched the mattress on the floor where I lay. I awoke drained, but aware of a change. The irregular pulse that had plagued me for 2 years since my bout with a viral disorder, and for which I was taking beta-blockers daily, had converted to a regUlar, steady beat. I discontinued 176 the medications, cautiously awaiting the return of the erratic beats. They did not return. A week later, I recounted the dream to Ate. Nodding his approval, he said, \"This is a good dream. The Coyote people are trying to teach you something. You are taking steps in the direction towards them. You should make a wopila. Do you know what this means?\" I recalled the giveaway that followed my naming ceremony a year later at the pow wow grounds. The wopila is an act of generosity to the people and thanksgiving to the Spirits. \"You must do things as they corne to you and as you see fit,\" said Ate. \"You must live in a generous and thankful manner.\" The makings of a Coyote medicine woman had begun. The Apprentice Medicine Woman as Nurse During the writing phase of this paper, I have been employed as a family nurse practitioner on another Lakota reservation. As a nurse practitioner, I care for the needs of several communities in \"field clinics,\" com- munity-based health care facilities that offer the services of a primary care provider, a registered nurse, and occasionally, a pharmacist. Blood, urine, and other specimens may be collected for diagnostic tests, but these are sent to the IHS hospital for analysis. A microscope 177 is available for the staff, the use of which is based on the staff's skills and experience with microbiology. Consultation with a physician is done by phone. Clients requiring x-rays, further consultation, and other services are directed to the hospital clinic or emergency room. In addition to field clinic service, I also staff the emergency room on rotating weekends. My scope of practice includes physical, psychosocial, and environmental assessment; data collection; prescription of treatments, diagnostic tests, and medications, excluding narcotics; performance of minor surgical procedures; counseling; health education; preventive services; and care of acute and chronic illnesses. Since my first exposure to Lakota culture, I have attempted to incorporate some of the traditional values and caring practices into my nursing care. I have divided the following discussion into the areas of social awareness, informal dialogue, traditional medicine, touching, advocacy, and Lakota values. Social Awareness In my clinic dealings, I try to establish a working relationship with the clients and the clinic staff. This involves being on time for clinics, taking time with clients to listen to their complaints and to explain what I am doing during the physical exam. I also explain my findings and correlate them with the client's presenting 178 symptoms. I explore various treatment plans with the client to determine which plan is the most practical, given the client's home situation. For example, treatment of second degree burns on a client with no plumbing at home may require daily visits to the clinic for dressing changes, or the procurement of a basin and cleansing solution, with a workable plan for accessing water through a neighbor. The client whose condition requires further consultation with a physician frequently needs transporta\u00ad tion, and I or another member of the clinic staff arrange the ride to the hospital. Teamwork with the hospital staff is necessary when the social situation of a client outweighs his or her physical problems. Sally, an 8-year-old girl with an infected leg laceration, lived with her grandparents who were overwhelmed with the care of several other small children. Sally's condition worsened to a cellulitis after a family member misplaced her antibiotic. Her dressings were not changed and the laceration was not cleansed for days at a time. While her condition would not normally have required hospitalization, the social circumstances necessitated her admission. The pedia\u00ad trician agreed with this plan, the grandparents expressed relief, and the girl improved with the daily care given to her by the hospitpl nursing staff. 179 Informal Dialogue An important component of my care is the communica\u00ad tion style that I employ with my clients. A pleasant greeting ushers the client into my office. Saying the client's name may seem a trivial point; but my attempts to pronounce lengthy Lakota names, such as \"Tatoye Najinwin\" (i.e., \"She Who Stands in the Four Winds\"), have brought nods of approval from the waiting room crowd. One child's mother was very pleased at my faltering efforts and noted that \"most of the doctors won't even bother to pronounce her name\" and told me the meaning of the name when I inquired. History-taking requires time, especially with a client whose English is as poor as my Lakota. Wishing to inquire if an elderly woman had noted drainage from her enlarged and painful thumb, I found that I was unable to communicate the word \"pus.\" After several attempts at rephrasing the question, I returned to the waiting room and asked the staff and clientele if anyone knew the Lakota word for \"pus.\" After a bit of headscratching and conferring, one woman said, \" in a very nasalized voice. I returned to the exam room and repeated the question: had she noted any \"tuntl? My client answered, tlTun. Oh--pus! No.\" An informal communication style involves time to develop a working, congenial rapport between the client and myself. As basic as this may sound, it is a point sometimes given little credence by other professionals. \"I don't talk to patients, II said one physician. just want to get their meds and go. II II They 180 Talking with clients--bantering, cajoling, sympathiz ing, delving into further health problems--yields the rich data that form the basis of physical, psychosocial, and spiritual assessments. Limiting the history-taking to a biomedical review of systems may uncover the physical problem, but may detract from its cause. A mother whose three children are brought to the clinic with frequent complaints of respiratory congestion may need to be asked questions concerning the number of people residing in the same household (contagion), the source of heat for the house (decreased humidity from electric and propane sources; increased risk of lung problems with woodburning stoves), the number of people who smoke in the home (increased risk of respiratory ailments from second-hand smoke). With or without these inquiries, the diagnosis of bronchitis is the same, but exploration into the pre\u00ad cipitating factors yields data necessary for a health\u00ad education plan. In such a case as this, I would explore with the mother the preventive steps that could be taken in the care of the children. Bringing other family members into the development of a health care plan is a time-consuming endeavor, but one necessary for compliance. 181 Another technique I employ is that of conversing with a client, taking on the role of a family member. This practice is based on the observation that those who are accepted into the Lakota community are treated as family members. Part of this acceptance is shown in the style of communication currently used among relatives. I use the word \"currently\" because traditional communication patterns have changed over the years. LeBeau (1980), a registered nurse among the Cheyenne River Sioux, noted that verbal exchanges between family members no longer reflect the taboos that were once strictly enforced. Traditionally, men did not speak with their mothers-in- law; brothers could tease sisters-in-law, but could not speak to sisters. These rules of interaction no longer hold widespread acceptance among the present generation. The behavior patterns between sisters and brothers have changed radically with a joking relationship often taking the place of the once reserved behavior required in interaction between these relatives. (Maynard & Twiss, 1970, p. 119) The elderly, however, continue to command respect, and it is considered impolite to interrupt or to express disagreement with one's elder in public. Thus, I treat elderly clients as grandparents. Referring to an elderly client as \"tunkasila\" (i.e., \"grandfather\") or \"unci\" (i.e., grandmother), or as \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\" is a sign of respect, according to several of my clients. Women and men around my age are treated as sisters or brothers. The 182 sharing of experiences with such women enhances the rapport and elicits information not otherwise available. Taking on the role of a sister to a male involves a more outspoken, joking rapport. Teasing is now an acceptable mode of communication used by Lakota siblings. I find that once I have established a rapport with my client, this teasing can be enormously effective in assuring compliance and follow-up. The following example will illustrate this point. Clarence Roadboy, age 45, came to the clinic with a request for a refill of his blood pressure medications. The pharmacist noted that Mr. Roadboy has not had a refill of his medications for 3 months and has not seen a primary care provider for 4 months. She informed the client that he had to see the nurse practitioner before she could refill his prescription. Mr. Roadboy was clearly not pleased, but allowed the nurse's aide to take his weight and blood pressure. Nurse practitioner (NP): \"What can I do for you, Mr. Road Boy?\" Mr. Roadboy (R): pressure pills.\" \"I need a refill my blood NP (looking at the client's chart): \"Your blood pressure is pretty high: your pills?\" \"Yeah.\" 170/100. Did NP: \"Do you ever of breath?\" Mr. R: \"No. \" NP: \"Do your feet up?\" Mr. R: \"No. I always feel fine\" (Laughs). 183 By now, the mood had begun to shift from a potential\u00ad ly-authoritative, one-sided tirade on the part of the nurse practitioner on why Mr. Roadboy should have been in sooner, gotten his refills, etc., to one of professional, yet personal, concern for the client's health. This was conveyed by a mixture of body language, facial expression, tone of voice, and eye contact--all those nuances of the language that can only be properly studied through video\u00ad taping. The above are the basic questions I ask regarding hypertension; intuition guides whether I probe more deeply into physical or psychosocial factors, like stress, the use of alcohol, and the like. Frequently, the client will tell me these things later, after the physical examina\u00ad tion. 184 I performed a physical exam, telling Mr. Roadboy what I was going to do before I did it, asking questions along the way as indicated. Once the physical was completed, we sat down by my desk, and I reviewed the physical's findings. NP: \"Your heart sounds very good. Your lungs are clear. You seem to be pretty healthy ... \" Mr. R: \"What did I tell ya?\" NP: ... \"Yeah, well ... \" NP: \"No, I mean it. Your blood pressure is way too high. Normal is a lot lower.

Geez--women!\" .Mr. Roadboy returned the next week. His blood pressure was significantly improved. We maintained our bantering rapport, and Mr. Roadboy became a fairly model client. For the most part, this communication style is selected when the rapport seems to be a brother-sister one. There is more of a grandfather/grandmother-adult grandchild approach with the elderly client. Sister\u00ad sister rapport seems to work with women close to my age or slightly older, with more sharing of personal experiences during the sessions. Traditional Medicine Informal dialogue provides the groundwork for the sharing of personal care practices, as well. One young woman told me of her experience with Buffalo medicine. As I was examining her for cold symptoms, she told me how, as a young girl, Buffalo medicine was used to clear up \"spots\" on her lungs. A medicine man took the horns of a buffalo skull and placed them on her back. The problem with her lungs resolved afterwards. Another client showed me a length of bitterroot that he used for the relief of leg cramps. His blood work indicated normal levels of 187 potassium, calcium, and magnesium, alterations of which can produce claudication. Using bitterroot, he did not require prescriptive medications. I reinforced his use of the root and instructed him to see me if his cramps became worse. Clients who state that they utilize traditional medicine in their health practices are encouraged to continue and advised to see a nontraditional care provider if additional service is needed. At this stage of my medicine-woman apprenticeship, it is not appropriate for me to perform ceremonies. I can, however, recommend the use of various herbs and roots, and I do so in a col\u00ad laborative effort with the client who uses traditional medicines. Typically, I will ask if the client is familiar with a particular root (e.g., bitterroot). If not, I will describe the root, its preparation, and its healing properties, as told to me by Ate. I will also explain how I came by this knowledge, that I am studying Bear and Eagle medicine under the tutelage of a particular medicine man, and whether or not I have used the root or herb myselfo To date, I have found that clients are pleased with this information; but I do not know if they have tried the traditional medicine we had discussed. The professional and legal implications of combining in\u00ad digenous and professional nursing practice will be further discussed in Chapter VI. 188 Touching Touching is an integral part of my practice. Physical assessment techniques require palpation and percussion. Handshaking at the beginning or end of the visit sets a personable and respectful attitude. Touching children is very important. A mother of a 2-year-old boy came to the clinic to tell me that her son's rash had not improved and had, instead, become worse. car. Do you want to see him?\" \"He's in the She explained that she had given Jimmy about 7 days of the antibiotic I'd prescribed 2 weeks before. When there was no improvement, she took him to the hospital. \"The doctor didn't even look at him!\" she complained. \"All he did was give him some more of the same medicine!\" I examined the child, observing his widespread rash and palpating the lesions. It was obvious that the boy had impetigo with a secondary infection and had developed a case of scabies, as well. I sat down then, about 3 or 4 feet away from the child to talk more with the mother and to make some notes in the child's chart. \"That's as close as the doctor came,\" the mother said, referring to our seating arrangement. \"He looked at Jimmy from there!\" It occurred to me then that the element that constituted \"caring\" to this mother was not the health provider's observational or prescriptive activities, but his or her use of touch. My act of 189 palpating Jimmy's lesions was interpreted as a sign of acceptance of the child as a person (i.e., he was not an \"untouchable\"); demonstration that I was examining the child which, for my benefit, enabled me to determine the type and extent of the lesions; and legitimacy of the mother's concerns. I switched the medications to another antibiotic, added an antiparasitic lotion, and explained my reasons for doing so. The mother accepted the explanations and medications, and the child improved as expected. Advocacy Writing letters on behalf of clients in order to elicit help with finances, housing, or community services is a frequent part of my practice. With the other clinic staff, I wrote to the commodities' director to request food for breakfasts on diabetic clinic days. Most of our diabetic clients are elderly. They arrive at the clinic early in the morning for their glucose tests, having fasted since the night before. While waiting for their visit with the nurse practitioner, the clients get hungry. Thus, the staff was able, through our letter-writing activities, to procure fruit, cheese, crackers, and coffee for the clients. Having eaten, they are more receptive to health-educational efforts, conducted in the waiting room. 190 Lakota Values Generosity Generosity is demonstrated in spending time with clients in order to delve into their concerns, seek solutions with them, and share experiences. Providing transportation to clinics or to the hospital, donating to local causes (e.g., church raffles, pow wows), purchasing groceries for a struggling young couple, bringing food for potluck get-togethers, and being available for after- hours emergencies are other signs of generosity. The practice of generosity is not without its rewards, as the following except from my field notes illustrates: En route to a picnic, I stopped to pick up an elderly fellow who introduced himself as Wilbur Moccasin. In his hand, he carried a circular piece of metal he had found on the road. \"There was a car wreck last night. I found this near the spot where the car overturned,\" he said. I peered at the object more closely. \"It's a gas cap,\" he informed me. A gas cap. He could probably get about a dollar for it in town, if he could find someone in need of such an item. \"Where are you headed?\" I inquired. He indicated that he was going to a town on my route. As we traveled, we talked of the accident, his family, and the pow wow that would be held that weekend. \"Just drop me off over there.\" Mr. Moccasin pointed to an intersection in town. \"Thanks for the ride. Here,\" he said, extending his hand. \"You can keep this.\" Smiling, I took the gas cap, an unexpected gift. 191 Respect is shown by involving the client and others in their health care; by acknowledging the legitimacy of clients' concerns, priorities, and health and caring practices; by using touch in a culturally appropriate manner; by maintaining an appropriate rapport with clients, especially with the elderly; by being active in the client-advocacy role, as discussed earlier; and by participating in community activities, such as honoring ceremonies. Courage I see courage as empathy in motion. It is putting oneself physically or psychologically on the line for another. The following is an excerpt from my field notes, an entry that was written shortly after the 2-week period in which nine reservation children died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. August, 1987. A phone call to my house alerts me to the emergency: a car has hit a school bus about 30 miles from the hospital. All I know is what the man told me: \"It's bad.\" I had just changed my clothes after returning from work; now I slap on my name tag and sneakers and limp with a painful shin splint to the hospital. More information is given: six children and four adults, packed in a car, hit a school bus head-on. Bus driver and bus passengers are all right. Pas\u00ad sengers of the other vehicle are not as lucky. One child, 18 months old, is dead, the top of its skull sliced off. One 2-year-old appears okay but is sleepy; another younger child needs examining and might have been hit in the head. The driver suffered a probable fractured femur; another adult has scalp lacerations. The remainder are bruised or bleeding. 192 The emergency room (ER) staff and I await the ambulance in the brisk evening air. \"ETA [estimated time of arrival] is 3 minutes,\" the security guard tells us. Three minutes pass like 3 hours; I've generated enough adrenalin to cure 30 asthmatics and have enough to bottle and use for 30 more. I tell this to another nurse and we laugh nervously. Sirens herald the ambulance's approach. We snatch five children at its doors, while two adults are wheeled on stretchers up the ER ramp. A sixth child, wrapped in a baby blanket, is carried by the EMT [emergency medical technician] and followed by two other adults brought in the police car. I examine Jerry, the 2-year-old, trying to calm him in this frightening place. Is this ear drainage cerebral spinal fluid, or merely the result of an ongoing ear infection? The mixture of blood and pus distorts the color on the glucose dipstick. Where are the parents? I quickly find out: both are in the same ER, being treated for injuries. All the adults are intoxicated. I tell my findings to the pediatrician. He admits Jerry to the peds [pediatric] unit: probable concussion. Another child has a fractured skull, the nurse informs me. Would I examine the parents of the dead child? I walk down the hall to the x-ray room where they are sitting. A psychiatric nurse has been listening, comforting them. They are splattered with blood, their own and their child's. They allow me to clean their physical wounds, empathize with their wounded hearts. Yes, they can go home; their baby is with the coroner right now; of course, they can see her shortly. I leave them in the hands of the psych[iatric] nurse and return to the ER. I assist with the other patients who have arrived after the accident victims. I complete my charting. The nursing and medical staff exchange supportive comments. I walk home with my husband, the psych nurse. We talk. I sigh and pace until I'm numb and lying on Wisdom my pillow. I close my eyes and dream of body bags. 193 The practice of wisdom, I am finding, is learning how to empathize without adopting the role of surrogate sufferer; how to set limits on what I expect of myself. Wisdom also involves educating clients, families, and entire communities about relevant health care topics. The development of intuitive caring takes time and stems from a caring relationship with the community. It is a self- project worth investing in. commentary on the Apprenticeship Experience The preceding discussion presented a phenomenological account of two experiences: (a) the \"becoming\" of an apprentice medicine woman and (b) the \"being\" of that apprentice as a nurse. At this stage of my medicine-woman apprenticeship, I try to incorporate traditional Lakota values and some of the health and caring practices this research has uncovered into my nursing practice. It is my belief that these practices have increased my ability to give culturally-sensitive, therapeutic care to my Lakota clients. It is my hope that the sharing of these experiences will enhance the care given by other nurses for the future benefit of the Lakota people. 194 In Chapter VI, I will examine more closely the questions raised by the apprenticeship experience and will attempt to address key issues in nursing practice and research. CHAPTER VI CHOICES AND CONSEQUENCES The researcher's path, like the proverbial road to hell, is paved with value-laden intentions. Intentions become decisions. Actions are decisions given movement; and actions generate consequences. At the end of the road, the traveller-researcher takes account of--and is accountable for--the choices made along the way. In this chapter, some of the researcher's choices, their subse- quent consequences, and related questions will be examined. The Nurse as Ethnohealer: Cultural Sensitivity or Professional Malpractice? The medicine man's decision to adopt me into his family and my acceptance established kinship ties with members of the community. My consent to apprenticeship in Bear and Eagle medicine opened up opportunities to better understand the health and caring practices of this cultural group_ It also presented a myriad of choices which would impact my nursing practice. To what extent could I reasonably insert indigenous healing practices into my professional care? In Chapter V, I outlined the 196 ways in which I attempted to incorporate Lakota health and caring methods into clinical care. Could I have done more? The answer lies in several areas: professional scope of practice, client expectations, and kinship ties. Professional Scope of Nursing Practice I entered the research setting not as a doctoral student seeking data, but as a community health nurse and family nurse practitioner assigned by the federal government to give professional nursing care to the people of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. My identity was thereby established, and those whom I saw in the com- munities or in the clinics expected me to perform my duties as a nurse. My scope of practice was determined by the Board of Nursing in the state that issued my nursing license and by the regulations imposed by the U.S. Public Health Service. In addition, my conduct was held accountable by the Code for Nurses (American Nurses' Association, 1976), which provides guidelines for nursing responsibilities and ethical obligations. Those ethical obligations include adherence to the nursing process in nurse-client interactions. Hence, while ethnocaring knowledge colors my actions and enables me to treat clients with more cultural sensitivity than I would have had previously, I still follow the route of data collection, assessment, planning, intervention, and 197 evaluation. Neither my nursing license nor malpractice insurance permits me to provide ethnohealing in lieu of professional nursing care. An example of what I have done to combine both ethnocaring and nursing care traditions follows. Melvin Hawk, a 54-year-old Lakota man, presented to the emergency room complaining of a long history of dysphagia and a recent episode of sleep apnea. During the previous night, his wife heard him snoring when he suddenly gasped for air and was unable to regain con\u00ad sciousness despite Mrs. Hawk's attempts to wake him. After she performed a Heimlich maneuver, Mr. Hawk began breathing again without orally discharging any foreign body. The physical findings upon examination were negative. Mr. Hawk's medical chart revealed multiple clinic visits for dysphagia over the past 10 years, again without physical finding to support the complaint. Mr. and Mrs. Hawk and I reviewed the chart together. I asked them what they thought was causing the swallowing d~scomfort. Mr. Hawk hesitated; it was Mrs. Hawk who answered. \"It might be cancer,\" she said, \"or maybe something else.\" It was the \"something else\" that prompted me to include \"bad medicine\" among the differential diagnoses. We discussed the possibilities: (a) sleep apnea (Mr. Hawk's obesity could contribute to the problem; also, he 198 only experienced the presenting symptoms when he was lying on his back); (b) choking (he had eaten prior to going to bed and the Heimlich maneuver apparently helped); (c) malignant or benign polyps or growth in the upper airway; (d) bad medicine. I prefaced this last category with an explanation of my role in the medicine man's family and followed with a brief account of Ate' treatment of persons having similar symptoms. I concluded with a question, asking if bad medicine could account for the dysphagia. \"I heard of these things,\" said Mr. Hawk, \"and I was wondering if that could happen to me.\" In light of the discussion, we decided that Mr. Hawk required an appointment with the ear-nose-and-throat (ENT) specialist and a visit to a local medicine man. Mrs. Hawk wanted to know what she could do for her husband if last night's episode repeated itself. I taught her the airway and breathing management components of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and reviewed with her the Heimlich maneuver. Mr. Hawk assisted by allowing us to practice on him. \"Does this help at all?\" I asked, unsure if I was perceiving the problem correctly. Mr. and Mrs. Hawk assured me that the information they received \"explained a lot\" and was very helpful. They appeared relieved as they left the ER. My charting reflected the subjective and objective data; my assess-199 ment, which included a reference to IIsociocultural factors\" along with a list of other \"rule-outs\"; and the nurse-client plan. Had I diagnosed the problem as a cultural or spiritual one and sent the client to a medicine person, the peer review board that monitors my clinical therapeu\u00ad tics would have cited me for poor biomedical and nursing care. Also, had it turned out that the client had an obstructive growth in his upper airway and I had failed to properly diagnose and treat or refer, the client and the community would have ample reason to sue me for malprac\u00ad tice. One such incident occurred in the recent past when a physician at a nearby reservation treated abdominal ailments by stuffing clients' navels with cotton balls dipped in mineral oil or in an herbal solution. He did not remain long within the tribal boundaries. Furthermore, had I perceived the complaint as a purely biomedical one, compartmentalizing the client's symptoms as an ENT problem, I would have missed Mrs. Hawk's sense of helplessness. My nursing background gave me the tools I needed to help alleviate some of that stress by teaching her airway management. Lastly, had I omitted the cultural implications, I might have presented a cure for the ailment, failing to see the need for a culturally-acceptable way to heal the whole person. 200 The above incident illustrates the priorities, as well as the dilemmas, associated with straddling two paradigms of health care. For the professional nurse who is employed as such, adherence to the standards of care mandated by the nursing culture must take priority in caregiving behaviors. Transcultural behaviors are acceptable when framed within the structure of nursing practice. This, in itself, is a noteworthy and laudable achievement in the progress of the profession. Client Expectations What do clients expect of their nurse? In my own case, I was \"on-call\" 24 hours a day. I could not remove the mantle of nursing care at the end of an a-hour shift, and feedback from my clients supported that notion. At pow wows, I was expected to handle any medical emergency that occurred. People could approach me at restaurants or community gatherings for health care advice, the content of which followed nursing protocols, unless I was specifically asked for information or help with cul\u00ad turospiritual concerns. Client expectations reflected the desire for care that was sensitive to the unique cultural, socioeconomic, spiritual, emotional needs of the reserva\u00ad tion population, but which, nonetheless, fit within the scope of professional nursing care. 201 Kinship Ties Implementation of ethnohealing practice appears to be further limited by the social boundaries of kinship ties. Kinship provides an umbrella that shelters the relative and helps to create an environment of acceptance within the larger community. This acceptance is limited in scope, because reservations are made up of several kinship groups that are sometimes at odds with each other. Hagen and Schaw (1960), noted the advantages and disadvantages of such groups: The extended kinship group as it survives today provides the individual Sioux with a haven of protection and support ... But this protection is provided only at the expense of dividing the reservation into hostile and exclusive groups unable to find a communal purpose that would ameliorate the precarious existence that makes group belonging both very important and self\u00ad defeating. (p. 10-5) My search for knowledge about traditional healing practices was not perceived as a threat to other members of my adoptive kinship group. Although one nonkin member of the reservation expressed dismay at the fact that a non-Indian was adopted into the kinship structure, most of the other people residing at the research setting did not voice concern about the racial differences. This was not the case, however, when I moved to another Lakota reservation. Teaching a course for nursing students about Native American health and healing practices, I was aware of a growing resistance on the part of a couple of 202 students who felt that only another Native American was qualified to teach this subject. I further alienated them by prefacing my lectures with a statement that my mentor medicine man had approved the content of the talks for sharing with others. This led to such comments as: \"He's not really a medicine man\" because Yuwipi healing methods are the standards for indigenous care at this other site, rather than Bear and Eagle medicine (Maynard & Twiss, 1970; Powers, 1982); \"He [the medicine man] is not really Lakota\" because he did not belong to the same Lakota band as the student; \"You shouldn't be talking about such things; nobody is supposed to know about those herbs,\" even when the source of the data was available in the school bookstore; and \"A woman shouldn't talk about the sacred things because she or the other women might be menstruating\" and this would rob the power from the herbs. In short, I did not have the community standing or support that I enjoyed as a member of a kinship group at the Standing Rock reservation. I eventually spoke with Ate about what had occurred. He said, \"They [the members of a particular group] are like this .. \" He held up his hand and turned his palm to the left and to the right several times, as if to say that their thoughts and actions change directions like the wind. Then he shrugged. I did likewise. What Hagen and Schaw (1960) observed about individual 203 reservations appears to be true about reservations in general, even those whose people share a common language and heritage: liThe reservations are geographic and political units but remain empty of a social cohesiveness that could make them emotional realities\" (p. 10-8). Kinship ties seem to be an essential factor in the delivery of ethnohealing care, especially for the beginning practitioner. Going Native: Is It Really That Bad? Membership roles in research have long been disputed by those engaged in fieldwork. If fieldwork membership goals were put on a continuum, peripheral involvement would be at one extreme, with \"going native\" at the other. The degree of insider affiliation sought, although not necessarily achieved, is a conscious decision on the part of the researcher. That decision is based partly on the researcher's philosophy and partly his or her assessment of the research situation. For some, peripheral member- ship in the studied group is preferred as a means to control objective data collection and analysis. Whyte (1984) illustrated the problem of losing one's sense of control by quoting sociologist Robert Johnson: \"I began as a nonparticipating observer and ended up as a nonob- serving participant\" (pp. 28-29). According to Hammersley and Atkinson (1983), detachment in researcher-participant 204 interaction is necessary for maintaining professional distance. For it is in the \"space\" created by this distance that the analytic work of the ethnographer gets done. Without that distance, without that analytic space, the ethnography can be little more than the autobiographical account of a personal conversion (p. 102). Such distance can also be a practical tool for the researcher whose move from the periphery to the center of the membership circle would create havoc with his or her personal life. For example, a Jewish sociologist exploring the dimensions of a fundamentalist Christian society chose to remain on the periphery of the church. More active involvement would have required baptism into the society's religion (Peshkin, 1984). Horowitz's (1983) refusal to take on a more involved role in the Chicano gang she was studying protected her from the sexual harassment visited upon other females in the teen group. Active membership within the studied group is sought by those who believe that it is intersubjectivity, not professional distance, that allows the data to more accurately reflect the group's consensus reality. Active membership requires the permission of the research participants. Adler and Adler (1987) describe an extreme form of active participation which they call \"complete membership,\" or \"going native.\" The term, \"going native,\" is usually defined as overinvolvement to the point of losing all sense of research objectivity. It conjures up 205 ideas of academic irresponsibility, for the subjects' biases and perspectives may then become the researchers'. The emotional impact of \"going native\" could \"result in their transferring of identity and loyalty to the setting, totally abandoning the task of analysis and failing to return from the field\" (Adler & Adler, 1987, p. 17). In addition, overfamiliarity with the research participants may lead researchers lito assume the self-deceptions of the members\" (Adler & Adler, 1987, p.23). In short, \"going native\" is frequently viewed as being as unprofitable from the standpoint of fieldwork as staying at the airport or hotel and making up stories about the natives; in neither case is there any possibility of a meaningful relation (and invention) of cultures\" (Wagner, 1975, p. 9). Adler and Adler (1987) define \"going native\" not as irresponsible overinvolvement, but the intense emotional and intellectual involvement of the researcher with the group being studied. They promote the idea of extreme involvement in ethnological research because of the richness of data that is available to the researcher. Harner's (1982) decision to cross the boundaries between peripheral observer and complete member of a Jivaro shamanistic group involved drinking a conscious-altering drug. His subsequent writings reflect a deep understand- ing of the traditional healing practices of that cultural group. Watson's (1985) account of her involvement with Australian Aborigines is an excellent example of \"going 206 native\" (i.e., intense emotional and spiritual involve- ment) and then returning to the academic site to write a stirring, poetic, thick description of loss and grief among the research participants. My decision to become as active as possible among the participants in this study was facilitated by prior community acceptance of my clinical role, by adoption into the kinship structure of the tribe, and by Ate's ongoing efforts in teaching me traditional healing practices. The change in role from clinician to researcher was met with some uneasiness. Apprehension about the role of the researcher, based on previous experiences, no doubt accounted for some of the hesitancy among potential informants. One Lakota gentleman commented, Many people have come here. They took a lot of notes and wrote long reports. Then they gave the reports to the government. The government made policies based on those reports, and we're all worse off for it. Nevertheless, the approval of the Tribal Council and the backing of my adoptive kinship group helped establish a groundwork of trust and aided in my data-gathering efforts. I did not totally shed my clinician role, although I made it clear that, during the data-collection phase, I was there to write my dissertation. People requested blood pressure checks and health information. I was asked by the Sun Dance committee to provide emergency health care as needed during the summer's Sun Dance. Even Ate sought my assessment of a gastrointestinal ailment. 207 Hence, my relationship with the community mirrored the mutual exchange among family members, each person \"helping out\" the other with whatever that other requires. Active membership in a society provides the re\u00ad searcher with access to that society's consensus reality. \"Going native,\" according to Adler and Adler (1987), necessitates intense emotional and intellectual involve ment with the researched group. Two questions arise with respect to this membership concept: Does \"going native\" entail acceptance of that group's consensus reality as one's own? Can the researcher who accepts another group's consensus reality also retain his or her own culture's reality? Acceptance of another culture's sense of truth can be a deliberate decision or a slow, gradual, barely percep\u00ad tible process. Analysis of the experiences presented in this study indicates that the incorporation of the Lakota cultural reality proceeded at an almost insidious pace. I was cognizant of my continuing acceptance of my own cultural (Anglo-American and professional nursing) realities. I was aware that I was open to the possibility of different truths, aware that I accepted that others-\u00ad like Ate--held a vision of spiritual reality different than, but not in opposition to, other cultural realities, 208 such as my own. However, I did not fathom the depth of internalization that had taken place within myself until I experienced traditional healing first hand. Such internalization, according to Heron (1988), is an integral part of the phenomenological method. Making the experiential test involves them [the researchers] in a change of being. They become different. The idea is no longer just grasped by them intellectually--they have lived through it, they know it connaturally, as the philosophers say (p. 51). For the researcher, experiencing a \"change of being\" adds depth to the field of inquiry, but is itself the subject of interpretation. The phenomenological method requires the researcher's awareness of dual realities and the ability to analyze the impact of both on the research and on oneself. Heron (1988) continues: The inquirers need to believe in an idea enough to get experientially involved in it, and at the same time they need to be unattached to it, watchful for shortcomings, noticing more than belief in it entails, and holding alternative ideas available in the mind at the ready. (p. 51) Heron's instructions point to the need to periodical- ly shift one's intellectual and emotional focus from one consensus reality to another. One cannot and should not deny what one has experienced. One can and should question the interpretation of that experience. In light of the preceding discussion and of my personal heali~g experience, the question arises: To what extent must one accept the consensus reality of a group 209 for cultural healing to occur? It appears that an open, respectful, \"anything is possible\" attitude was sufficient to engage what Dossey and Keegan (1988) call lithe healer who resides within\" (p. 13). Cousins (1979), on whose work Dossey and Keegan rely, attests to the value of this inner healer, or placebo. Although these authors and others, most notably Frank (1974) in Persuasion and Healing, speak of the intense power of the placebo, none address the degree to which the health-seeker must intellectually and/or psychologically acknowledge its reality. This study merely raises the question. It would be of immense benefit to the nursing community to further study this question. Returning to the original question, \"Going native: is it really that bad?,\" I would have to answer in the negative. For the purposes of this study, where active membership was essential in addressing the research questions and where this degree of research involvement was permitted by the study's participants, \"going native\" was a practical approach. It led to insights and experiences not otherwise available to the less active participant. The extent to which I was able to \"shift focus\" between the consensus realities of the Lakota and professional nursing will determine the accuracy of my analysis and the justification of intense research participation. The Clinical Perspective: Perceptual Challenge or Bias of Choice? The perspective with which one enters the research 210 setting shapes the content and the interpretation of the data. Is the perspective of the nurse researcher different from that of other researchers? What are the decisions the nurse researcher makes with regard to deliberate bias in data collection and analysis? In his monograph, The Clinical Perspective in Fieldwork (1987), Schein contrasts the roles of the clinician and the ethnographer. The clinician is defined as a professional trained in the art and science of helping, and may be a psychologist, health care provider, teacher, or a practitioner of applied anthropology or sociology. Arguing against the \"tendency ... to lump clinical and ethnographic methods together under the broader label of qualitative research\" (p. 12; italics in the original), Schein points to two distinctions in research methods which are summarized up below. Process of Inquiry In the clinical method, it is the client who seeks out and chooses the clinician. Likewise, it is the client who sets the limits and tone of the client-clinician relationship. The client initiates the request for help and, as a result, the clinician is in a situation of high visibility within the community. The clinician structures 211 interventions around the client's expressed needs and can observe and gain access to information about the setting, the community, and its members within the limits of the helping relationship and the clinician's own ethnographic skills. The clinician is allied with the client. Allegiance, for the ethnographer, is primarily with the academic community. The ethnographer is to produce a scholarly study on a particular society for the benefit of another society (e.g., the academic community). In the ethnographic method, the ethnographer seeks out and chooses the subject. The researcher is the one who structures the ethnographic relationship and determines the research site. Access to information about the group can be achieved by unobtrusive observation of the setting. Often, however, as the researcher engages in more active research collaboration with the studied group, he or she is asked to help (i.e., take on a clinical role) within the society. According to Schein (1987), role conflict may result when the researcher engages in helping activities that would change the research setting. Research Goal Establishing a helping relationship is the major aim of the clinician. Helping necessitates intervention and intervention promotes change. \"One cannot understand a human system,\" says Schein (1987), \"without trying to change it\" (p. 29). Intervention includes asking clients 212 questions eliciting situational assessment, data inter- pretation, suggestions, and prescriptions. The ethnographer's goal is to observe, interpret, and reveal the underlying structure of that which is under investigation without disturbing the present course of events. Clinicians assume that they are supposed to change the system, and opportunities to change it provide critical diagnostic data. Ethnographers assume that they are not supposed to change the system, but they must perturb it a bit at times in order to elicit a response to be observed or interpreted. (Schein, 1987, p. 31; italics in the original) Like clinicians, ethnographers ask questions and participate in affairs, but both groups differ in their priorities of observation and in their interpretation of data. As the clinician's prime focus is on helping the client according to the client's perceived needs, the clinician will first observe those events, persons, and things which impact the client's well-being. This narrows the focus and can provide increased depth of understanding the inner functions of a group. Although the clinician may attempt to be totally open and neutral with respect to the kind of data that will be listened for and observed, the clinician will always be screening and filtering those data in terms of the client's initial formulation of the problem, and will use data diagnostically to get a better sense of what may be going on with respect to the client and his organization. (Schein, 1987, p. 40) Hence, clinical bias is introduced at an early stage in clinical research, because of the clinician's helping 213 relationship with the client. Breadth is limited because of the requirement to adhere only to those things that are relevant to the client's problem. The ethnographer's prime focus is on his or her research goals and is guided more by the total context of the research situation than by specific theories or by the informants' agendas. The ethnographer strives for a thorough description of the social context that is broad in its scope of detail, but may be limited in depth because knowledge of the motives and intentions of the subjects is not as accessible to the ethnographer as it is to the clinician. Schein (1987) concludes that, given the value of both methods of research, \"clinicians and ethnographers [should] begin to pool their insights\" or \"clin\u00ad ician/scholars\" should be \"trained in both sets of roles and skills\" (p. 44). Leininger's (1985a) ethnonursing approach appears to provide that link between clinician and ethnographic research methods. Nurses are clinicians whose interven\u00ad tions are client-centered, client-directed, and are aimed at establishing a helping/caring relationship. They work with people of all age groups and diversified cultures in many environments. Nurses, with ethnographic training, could conceivably combine the roles of clinician and researcher in varied cultural settings. The clinician-as-researcher role is filled with decisions. She or he is dealing with two sets of perspectives: that of the clinician whose actions are structured by the client's needs; and that of the researcher whose decisions are guided by the research 214 problem. Two sets of goals are sought: (a) helping the client and thereby promoting change in the research environment and (b) describing the research situation without necessarily changing it. The challenge to the clinician-researcher is to combine the perspectives and goals in order to produce a product that is both helpful to the client and satisfactory to the research community. The nurse who accepts this challenge must be able to move between the roles of clinician and researcher as the situation dictates. Her or his \"bias of choice\" at any given point along the research road should be guided by professional nursing and research ethics. These ethics are spelled out by the academic setting's human rights board and by the American Nurses' Association's Code for Nursing (1976) and social policy statement (1980). In addition, certain ground rules should be established at the beginning of the research phase with the cooperation and understanding of the research participants. These ground rules should indicate client expectations, nurse expectations, the purpose of the study, and professional and academic obligations. 215 In this study, the conceptual framework outlined the nursing perspective of caring as a prime focus. The participants in this study were informed of the purposes of the research and of the role the nurse-researcher played at that point in time in the community. Although I had once been employed in a clinical role on the reserva\u00ad tion, my role as researcher was emphasized in my initial comments to potential informants. During the actual data collecting phase, it was necessary to shift focus between the clinical perspective and the research perspective. Situations arose where the use of my skills as a nurse overrode the need for research management, as when I was asked to attend the summer Sun Dance to provide clinical care as needed. The challenge of shifting perspectives, of selecting the bias of choice, was met daily. Only a triad involving the clients, the academic institution, and myself can determine the correctness of these daily decisions. In summary, the clinician-researcher must be aware of the varying roles she or he plays in the research setting, and must define those roles for the research participants at the beginning of the research study. The clinician does enter the field with a mindset different from the nonclinician. The clinician-as-researcher in another culture combines two sets of perspectives and goals and attempts to make them complementary, not oppositional 216 components of the study. What matters is recognizing the different forms of bias in each mindset and abiding by the ethical standards inherent in the clinical conduct of research. Awareness of the role the researcher plays at each moment will aid in understanding and interpreting the data. Summary: Choices and Consequences This chapter was titled \"Choices and Consequences,\" rather than the traditional \"Limitations,\" for philo\u00ad sophical reasons. Every choice in a research project shapes the study in some way and produces consequences that limit the availability of future choices. This is much like walking down a road and choosing which trail to take when the path forks. The decisions made along this particular research path and the consequences they engendered have been examined in terms of the practical application of transcultural nursing knowledge, membership roles in fieldwork, and clinician-researcher perspectives and goals. Different choices in conceptual framework, method, data collection and analysis, and intended audience would have yielded different consequences, and the resulting report would have reflected those changes. There are several recommendations for future choices in research and practice: 1. Further study of the role of the nurse as ethnohealer is needed to advance the understanding of both 217 the theoretical and the practical aspects of transcultural health care. 2. Further research is needed on the health and caring practices of other Lakota bands (e.g., Sihasapa and Miniconjou). The analysis of the different health and caring ways is essential for the development of grounded theory_ Likewise, study of the Dakota and Nakota bands would network with the Lakota research to enhance transcultural caring concepts of the Sioux nation. 3. Extended examination of the practical aspects of transcultural knowledge is required if nurses are to engage in therapeutic, culturally-sensitive interventions with their clients. This could be done by collecting accounts of nursing interventions that demonstrate the blend of ethnocaring and professional nurSing practice. 4. Examination of the placebo effect of ethnohealing practices is suggested to determine the extent to which a client must accept the consensus reality of the eth\u00ad nohealer's culture. The data generated by such a study would yield important information about alternative healing methods, the source of healing potential for both the healer and the client, and the impact of transcultural healing wayso There are many roads in transcultural research yet to be traveled, many choices to make, and many consequences to bear. This study has been an account of one nurse's journey toward culturally sensitive health care. 218 Mitakuye APPENDIX VERBAL CONSENT FOR RESEARCH PARTICIPATION 220 (The following form was placed in the Tribal Council Building and in the Community Health Representative's of\u00ad fice in each of the districts where informants were inter\u00ad viewed.)
