Many people choose to take supplements with the goal of increasing energy levels or improving mental or physical performance. Supplementation for physical performance and energy may be especially common among athletes or very active people, but supplements may be used by a wide variety of the population. Some ingredients in energy supplements have established benefits for many people, but most ingredients are still being studied for their potential role as energy-boosters. As research is ongoing into the possible benefits of many substances for energy levels, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider if you are interested in using energy supplements. They may provide information around your specific needs, and they may recommend dietary or lifestyle modifications that could also improve energy levels. Caffeine One of the most common stimulants for energy is caffeine, a substance found naturally in many plants such as coffee beans, tea leaves, and cacao pods. It can also be made synthetically, and this form of caffeine is often added to various energy products. Caffeine works by stimulating the central nervous system, which can lead to increased energy and feelings of alertness that may last between four and six hours. Caffeine is safe for most people in amounts up 400 milligrams (mg) per day, but too much caffeine can cause sleep problems, headaches, rapid heart rate, anxiety, and dizziness. Always check the label on your caffeine supplement to ensure you are not exceeding the recommended amount per day. B vitamins Many energy-boosting supplements contain some B vitamins. These include vitamin B3, also known as niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B1 (thiamin), and vitamin B6. Many B vitamins play an important role in converting food into energy for the body. Deficiency in these vitamins can lead to weakness, confusion, and low cognitive function. People who are deficient in certain B vitamins such as vitamin B12 may experience increased energy with supplementation. However, more evidence is needed to determine if B vitamin supplementation can improve energy for most people who are not deficient. Other supplements containing B vitamins include niacinamide, a form of niacin, and bee pollen, which naturally contains many vitamins including vitamins B1, B2, and B6. Herbs Energy supplements may also contain various herbs and plants associated with improvements in mental and physical performance. These may include ashwagandha, rhodiola, ginseng, and goji berry extract. References - Research suggests ashwagandha plays a role in normalizing cortisol levels in humans, which may help manage stress and improve immune function, memory, and feelings of anxiety. - Rhodiola and ginseng have been used by many cultures to improve mental and physical performance and help reduce feelings of fatigue and weakness, but more research is needed to learn exactly what role these herbs may play in energy function. - Goji berries and goji extract may provide benefits such as improvements in immune function and protection against aging and oxidative stress through the antioxidant properties of these berries. When it comes to energy levels, more research is needed to learn how goji berries may help. There are a wide variety of other ingredients that may be added to energy supplements from sources such as plants, herbs, and vitamins. Many energy supplements may combine multiple ingredients to help people reach their energy goals, and there are many options to choose from online or in stores at Walgreens. Some ingredients may interact with certain medications, and some should not be consumed by children, pregnant women, or breastfeeding women. It's important to speak with your healthcare provider before starting new supplements. Your healthcare provider can help you determine which energy supplements may be beneficial for you, and which form is best to meet your needs. "}
