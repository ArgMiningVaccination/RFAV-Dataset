From above, it is a city of buildings and poplar trees sandwiching the Elbow and Bow rivers. But as far as cities go, our Cowtown is still in an infant state. Only a touch over a century ago, this area we call home was a far cry from an urban space. The Bow-Elbow confluence, or what is now known as downtown Calgary, was Blackfoot territory for thousands of years. \"We arrived roughly 800 years ago,\" says Kevin Littlelight, Nation administrator for the Tsuu T'ina Nation, of the Dene group of First Nations people \u2014 many of whom now live on Tsuu T'ina Nation land, bordering the most southwestern point of the city. \"But the Blackfoot were always here,\" he smiles. Back then the area's landscape was primarily grassland. \"Go to the Calgary Tower and it looks like one big forest,\" Littlelight says. \"But that wasn't the case 150 years ago, it was pure bald plains, right up to the Foothills.\" In his 1974 book, \"Calgary: a Not so Solemn Look at Calgary's First 100 years,\" historian Bob Shiels catalogued excerpts from journals written by the first groups of RCMP officers to come through Southern Alberta. All seem to have been struck by the beauty of where the Elbow met the Bow. \"The view amazed us,\" wrote officer Cecil Denny in 1875. \"Before us lay a lovely valley, flanked on the south by rolling hills. Thick woods bordered the banks of both streams. To the west towered mountains with their snowy peaks.\" Shiels wrote that other officers \"told of 'silvery waters, rolling uplands, and to the east the bare loneliness of the plains where countless bison wandered in undisturbed procession.'\" Buffalo are mentioned everywhere when looking into the history of what is now Calgary. And along with the Blackfoot and Dene people, buffalo called the area home. A 1906 article written in an early Calgary newspaper, The Daily Herald, wrote \"at certain times the buffalo gathered in countless thousands, darkening the earth as far as the eye could reach when at rest.\" The article goes on to describe the sight and sound of a moving herd as \"filling the earth with dust and with the thunder notes of their galloping hoofs.\" In spite of what some might imagine with the vast buffalo herds, several accounts describe the air over the valley as being perfumed by the fragrant grass that, as pioneer Mrs. Charles Lynch-Staunton wrote, \"grew so high and thick that it swept the horses' sides as the horseman for the first time rode across the open country.\" Speaking of the long, sweet grass, Littlelight says it was frequently utilized by the Blackfoot people who \"were notorious with fire.\" He says that the Blackfoot would light the grass on fire when needed to strategically trap or chase away enemies. \"So doing this all the time caused the Blackfoot to walk through the soot and that's why Cree call them black feet.\" Today, if one looks from the very top of North Hill, they will be able to see nearly all of the city laid out before them, and if one feels so inclined, they might wish to imagine what University of Alberta historian Lawrence H. Bussard wrote in his 1935 thesis about the earliest days of Calgary that included a description of \"what the Mounties saw from their vantage point of North Hill.\" \"Before them was a spacious valley through which two good sized rivers wound their way... the site of the present city was covered with long grass and the numerous small lakes were literally swarming with wild fowl... a colony of beavers had built a large dam across the Elbow and it had flooded much of the land south of the present C.P.R,\" or what would now be downtown Calgary. The buffalo, birds, long grass and Blackfoot campsites kept this area as their home for centuries, managing to leave it all but untouched by the time the R.C.M.P. came to chase away the whisky traders in the late 1800s. A century and a bit later, it is a radically different landscape. Still, some of the original traits of the space remain. \"This place was always an economic hotspot,\" says Littlelight. \"Way before European arrival this spot was sought out by other tribes. Where the two rivers meet has been a symbolic place on the trade route.\" \"I think people are attracted by energy. And the area has always had good vibes.\"When buffalo were king A brief look back on pre-European contact landscape in Calgary Meliss A Molloy | mmolloy@cjournal.ca by: Melissa Molloy Tsuu Nation administrator, Kevin Littlelight, says that the Calgary 'was always an economic hotspot.' \"Where the two rivers meet has always been a significant spot on the trade route.\" \u2014 Kevin Littlelight August 2012 | calgaryjournal.ca 4 On a sunny Saturday morning, a steady stream of children make their way to a playground in the southwest community of Glenbrook. There is cheerful chaos as friends are greeted, shin pads strapped on and shoe laces tightened up. After everybody has their equipment sorted out, the older kids stretch and run laps around an adjacent field. Later they will clean garbage and debris off the field before engaging in soccer drills and a scrimmage game. Occasionally they have to clean up broken bottles. Off to the side a small group of three and four-year-olds energetically chase balls around tiny pylons, their jerseys hanging down to their knees. The Saturday Morning Soccer Club is in session. Focused on neighbourhood's needs Founded two years ago by Jean-Claude Munyezamu, the club is open to any child who wants to play, but has a special focus on those from lower-income families who are new to Canada. The club plays in a park that is surrounded by a large complex of subsidized townhouses. Many are home to refugees and new immigrants. Munyezamu says that families who are new to Canada often face a number of challenges when it comes to putting their children in organized sports \u2014 ranging from cost, transportation issues, language barriers and social isolation. Munyezamu, who moved to Canada from his native Rwanda in 1998, also understands many of the struggles these families face, such as coping with social isolation and loneliness. He wanted to do something to help. By all accounts, the club has been a resounding success. There are currently 65 children from 14 different countries involved with the club. They range in age from teenagers to toddlers. A unique partnership with the Christian Life Assembly church and Youth Unlimited Calgary, an outreach group, has allowed Munyezamu to grow the club and expand its impact on the neighbourhood. He now has his sights set on a new goal: obtaining a proper field for the team to play on. n ew Field Will Ferguson, whose 11-year-old son Alistair plays with the club, first met Munyezamu though the Calgary Minor Soccer Association. He has been helping with Munyezamu's efforts to get a proper field in place. In addition to the lack of goal posts, Ferguson says other landscaping issues mean the club can't invite other teams to play on their field. \"They are not asking for something special or anything out of the ordinary,\" Ferguson says. \"They are just asking for what other neighbourhoods take for granted \u2014 a proper playing field.\" Munyezamu recently invited Ward Six Alderman Richard Pootmans to spend a Saturday morning with the club. In addition to running sprints with the players and joining in on a game, Pootmans was afforded the opportunity to examine the field. Without committing to anything, Pootmans said he was interested in helping the club in its quest for a proper field. \"I can certainly start the process with the parks department and find out what the status of this field is, what the plans are, and what has to happen,\" Pootmans said. \"My guess is that there is no budget to do anything this year, but what we can do is consider it for next year.\" A te A m F or every pl A yer While most of the club's players live in the Glenbrook neighbourhood, the club welcomes all who are interested. The club also has players of all abilities. For those with no soccer experience, drills are set up to help them learn the basics. \"My goal is for every kid to have a soccer club that they can join,\" Munyezamu says. A certified coach with the Calgary Minor Soccer Association, Munyezamu set up the club with a holistic mindset. There is an emphasis on sportsmanship, teamwork and building confidence. \"Soccer is not just about kicking the ball. There is leadership and responsibility as well as sharing,\" Munyezamu says. \"I want them to experience all that.\" \"Having a water bottle, a uniform and a soccer ball is a type of identity,\" he says. \"When a kid puts on a uniform, you can just see what it means to them. You can feel it.\" Ferguson says Munyezamu's grassroots approach allows the players to develop soccer skills in a supportive environment. \"He wants to get these kids integrated into the Calgary Minor Soccer Association,\" Ferguson says. \"But you can't just drop them into organized sport.\" \"They get to know what practices and drills are like. He helps them get to the necessary skill level.\" Munyezamu's approach is working: several of the club's players are now also playing with competitive league teams. Munyezamu often helps them arrange rides to games and practices. He is currently making arrangements to place more of his players on league Saturday Soccer Club seeks field of their own Grassroots club has positive impact on families and neighbourhood KARRY TAYLOR | ktaylor@cjournal.ca Photo by: Karry Taylor Never too young: One of the youngest members of the Saturday Soccer Club runs through a series of drills designed to teach him how to kick the ball.

To that end he encourages parents to attend the Saturday morning practices to help out on the field or just to watch. His aim is to have them establish a connection with other parents and club volunteers. In addition to the social element, Munyezamu says volunteering within the community provides the parents a valuable opportunity to adjust and contribute to their new country. \"It's easy for the parents to volunteer here because they are not required to drive since it's their own neighbourhood,\" Munyezamu says. \"They are new Canadians, this is a good way to introduce them to volunteerism.\" In keeping with Munyezamu's aim of family involvement, the club also has a secondary goal of establishing a mini-field so very young players can participate and learn the basics of the game. \"Jean-Claude doesn't turn anybody away,\" Ferguson says. \"Even if three-year-olds show up, he has them play.\" Andrew Bitcon, owner of the city's two Bubbles Car Wash & Detail Centres, is among those who have supported Munyezamu's efforts. Munyezamu first met Bitcon when he was learning English. The two have volunteered together at a variety of Calgary organizations, including The Mustard Seed Calgary and Inn from the Cold. Bitcon and his wife have provided financial and moral support for the club. He is now helping Munyezamu set up a registered charity\u2014 a process that will help make it easier for the club to accept donations. Bitcon says Munyezamu has a strong sense of compassion that is accompanied by practicality. \"Jean-Claude is one of those people that can look out and see a problem,\" Bitcon says. \"He's already working on the solution before anybody else has figured out that there even is a problem.\" Bitcon says it's the \"extra things\" about the club that make it so special, and such a valuable resource. \"There are so many kids here who are new Canadians and feel isolated and like they don't fit in,\" Bitcon says. \"But soccer is a common thing that gets everybody together.\" \"There is a much bigger need for this than I thought there was.\" c hurch o FF ers its support The partnership with Christian Life Assembly has allowed Munyezamu to expand the scope of the club. Police-screened volunteers from the church attend each Saturday to provide snacks, help out on the field, and visit with the parents. The church has also provided financial support for the club to rent gym space to play in during the winter, and to obtain equipment and uniforms for those players who can't afford it. Beyond the field, parents have been able to connect to various outreach services offered by the church, such as free ESL classes for adults. Munyezamu says the partnership has allowed the church to direct its resources to families who can benefit in many ways. \"There are many good-hearted people in the church,\" Munyezamu says, \"But sometimes they aren't sure of the best way to help. \"This is a way for them to connect in a very positive way with families in this neighbourhood.\" Wendy Aston, a pastor with Christian Life Assembly, says the club has an \"inviting and including\" approach. Children do not have to be members of the church's congregation to join the club. No one is turned away. \"We are always careful with any mention of faith, as we have kids from very diverse backgrounds and don't want to make anyone uncomfortable,\" Aston says. The partnership has been mutually beneficial. Aston says that members of the congregation have been enthusiastic to support the soccer club any way they can. \"It is now attracting people who, in the past, might not have considered helping with such a program,\" Aston says. \"Churches are a wonderful resource with a built-in community of volunteers looking for somewhere to serve. \"It's affordable, it's local, it's well supervised and parents feel safe sending their kids to it,\" Aston says. \"It is gaining a wonderful reputation in the community and parents are sending increasingly younger kids out.\" While his immediate concern is to have a proper soccer field set up where the club currently plays, Munyezamu has his sights firmly set on expanding beyond his neighbourhood. Once permanent goal posts are obtained and installed on the field, his next goal will be to get some portable posts. \"I want to be able to move the posts to another neighbourhood and set up a similar club,\" Munyezamu says. He also has plans to compile a training manual for future clubs. Aston says Munyezamu is a \"visionary.\"\"He continues to find ways of benefiting those around him.\" Munyezamu and Christian Life Assembly will be holding a soccer camp from August 20-24. He is hoping the camp will attract new players and their families.

Nina Vaughan, commander of Public Safety Communications, says the aim of the pilot project is to help emergency personal respond more quickly when medical and other emergencies occur along Calgary's pathways. \"Since Calgary has more than 700 kilometers of pathways, it's not always easy to articulate where you are on our extensive pathway network when you need help,\" Vaughn says. Touted as the first of its kind in Canada, the pilot project involves 175 markers placed along 200 km of pathways. Markers have been placed along the Bow River and Elbow River pathways, as well as in Fish Creek Park. \"We picked high traffic areas that had a variety of different users and that are traditionally areas where we haven't had very good cell reception,\" Vaughan says.Placed approximately one km apart, each marker has a unique code - a combination of two letters and four numbers. The letters identify the exact pathway, while the numbers identify a particular location along the path. In the event of an emergency, callers can provide the location code to 911 operators. Calgary Fire Department deputy chief of operations and technical teams, Len MacCharles, calls the markers \"another key component\" of public safety in Calgary. \"These signs, placed where they are will help individuals identify where they are so emergency responders \u2014 police, EMS, fire, whatever is needed at that time \u2014 can figure out exactly where you are and provide service in a quick and efficient manner,\" MacCharles says. Vaughan says the signs help address the fact that it can often be very difficult to pinpoint a location when a 911 call is made from a cell phone. \"There is a bit of a misconception because of what people see on TV,\" Vaughn says. \"They think that when they call 911 on their cell phone, we can pinpoint exactly what their location is. That is not the case.\" \"We do get coordinates from the cell phone call, but they are not accurate or specific enough in an urban environment for us to be able to determine where people are.\" Adam Loria, Calgary EMS spokesperson, says that the markers will be particularly helpful in the case of more quickly assisting visitors to the city who may experience an emergency while using city pathways. \"They go for a walk and, unfortunately, if a medical condition does happen they just don't know where they are,\" Loria says. \"If that 911 call can be made and one of these signs can be visualized, hopefully that will decrease the EMS to patient time.\" In order to reduce the costs of the pilot project, the markers were placed on existing sign posts. Vaughan says it remains to be seen if the current one km distance between markers will be effective. \"Part of the pilot project will be to determine if they are far enough apart, if they need to be closer together and how many we need,\" Vaughan says.

No longer are nerds tucked away in the backs of Internet cafes or left to sit around basement coffee tables playing Dungeons and Dragons. Club N3rd has brought the nerds together to relish in all things geek: Magic the Gathering tournaments, cosplay (nerd speak for fantasy costume wearing, or \"costume play\"), anime, Dixit \u2014you name it, Club N3rd caters to it. \"It's a place where people that are into anything geek-culture can join forces and not feel judged,\" says Dara Defreitas, the blue-eyed president and creator of the club. \"It's all of us just sharing our passion for things like video games and comic books \u2014anything under that umbrella term, \"popular geek culture.\" Defreitas started Club N3rd as a Mount Royal University Student's Association club, and was pleasantly surprised to watch it take off like Starfleet starship, growing to over 400 members in only a year. Every Thursday evening, the group congregates a Mount Royal University's Wykham House for an evening of Magic the Gathering \u2014a fantasy based strategy card game that many of the members compare to poker. Tonight, there is a group of 20 or so that come in spite of the summer heat wave that has infiltrated the heavy humid outside air into the building. And though there are mumbling complaints about the uncomfortable warmth, these folks are ready for a Magic tournament, complete with drinks and pizza that will carry on deep into the sweaty night. Graham Coomb and Will Kwong are already set up at a table that is covered with what look like placemats that have elaborately (and erotically) painted fantasy warrior women on them. Both Coomb and Kwong seem at home in the nerdy haven, and are more than happy to be called members of the club. \"This is a great place to meet friends,\" says Kwong. \"There are not a lot of places in Calgary where you can meet a lot of people and have fun playing classic board games like Risk or Magic.\" For Kwong, the term \"nerd\" is one he is not ashamed to identify with. \"It's someone that respects what they are doing and puts time into it,\" he explains. Kwong describes his pleasure in having the patience for his side-project, Gundam modeling \u2014a hobby that entails meticulously putting together \"kit(s) of a a couple thousand pieces that have to be sanded down and painted\" before being placed into dioramas. \"A lot of people don't have the patience for that, but I do,\" he says with pride. Coombs agrees. He says that being a \"nerd\" means simply \"someone who is committed to their craft.\" \"I look at it as a group of people that aren't afraid to be who they are,\" Coombs says. \"We do things that a lot of other people wouldn't have the courage to do in public. A lot of people wouldn't be out playing games like Magic the Gathering together in a group with people screaming and having a fun time. \"But we are comfortable with that. So, I think it's a bunch of people that are committed to what they like to do.\" One of Club N3rds earliest members, Adam Holloway, says that the group has been enlightening for someone like himself that prior to joining did not identify with geek culture in anyway. \"To be honest, before Club N3rd, I wasn't that nerdy,\" he laughs. \"But when I gave myself a chance to see what (nerd life) is all about, I realized it is so fun. \"Magic the Gathering is so fun, I'm so addicted. It's terrible!\" Both Holloway and Defreitas say that Club N3rd strives to cater to the \"spectrum of nerds.\" Holloway lists off other N3rd activities that include: themed-movies nights, pub parties, cosplay nights, costume tutorials, tabletop gaming and video gaming to name only a few. \"There's a flavour for everyone. I've gained 30 plus friends here which is unbelievable,\" says the young man, who looks more like he might have fit in with the jocks during high school. Defreitas says that she is determined to keep Club N3rd moving forward into a future that may surpass the confines of being a university club. \"I'm interested in seeing the club keep growing and expanding,\" she says. \"We already have people that have graduated from school but keep showing up, and anyone is welcome to join.\" As the night carries on and Club N3rd members become immersed in the evening's tournament, it is easy to see why one joins such community. The room is filled with laughter and heckling, and every kind of nerd represented appears to have found common ground within the club. Maybe it is hip to be square afterall.

Carrick, who has been writing about business and economics for nearly 20 years, is currently a personal finance columnist for The Globe and Mail. He recently released a new book called \"How to Not Move Back in With Your Parents: The Young Person's Guide to Financial Empowerment.\" The impetus for the book \u2014 Carrick's third \u2014 grew from his belief that young adults lack access to financial advice. \"There are all kinds of financial advice out there for established adults and senior citizens. There is nothing for the young adult,\" Carrick says. But while the book is geared at young adults, Carrick says that gaining financial empowerment is an ongoing activity. \"Very few people figure it out. But I think if you read a book like mine and find out what some of the basic principles are, then you will save yourself a lot of grief because so many people learn about money by making mistakes,\" Carrick says. Who should read this book? My target audience is those aged 18 to 35 years old. I would like people to read it as they are going into university, and after they have graduated from university. It's a guide that people could use for a 10 or 15 year period. What sort of challenges do you believe young people face today When it comes to obtaining financial security? One challenge is that the cost of a college or university education is soaring. As a result, students are graduating with high debt. When you graduate, it's a very tough job market out there. It's hard to find a first job. And once you do, you've got your student loans to pay off. You want to get into the housing market? Houses are super- expensive right now. You want to buy a car? Gasoline is also super-expensive right now. These are some of the challenges that young people face. Where Would you suggest that a person should start if they have little or no experience With money management? Priority one when managing money is to eliminate debt. Or, at the very least, it's to get yourself on a track to repaying your debt. Then start putting an eye on retirement. I go for a hand-in-hand approach, where you make a priority of student loan reduction but you also get into retirement savings as well. So tackle debt first, and then ease into the retirement savings. Then you can start to think about putting away money for a car or a down payment on a house. You can decide which to emphasize and which to de-emphasize. You have to make judgments, but that's really what it is all about. in the book you use the phrase \"saving intelligently.\"What do you mean by that? Saving intelligently is about figuring out, given your personal cash flow situation, how much you need to live on and how much you can devote to savings. You don't want to cripple yourself by saving too much. But on the other hand, you don't want to get yourself in a situation where you say, \"I can't afford to save anything, so I won't.\" It's very easy to stay on that track for a long time. But the next thing you know, you have missed out on 10 years of saving. you say, \" the less skilled you are at saving, the less independent you are.\" What do you mean by that? What I mean is that the usual outcome of not saving money is being in debt. If you are in debt, its like putting handcuffs on. It means you can't move on with your life. do you have any strategies for the best Way to budget? I am not a huge believer in budgeting. What I suggest is that whenever you get paid, money is automatically diverted through electronic banking to various saving accounts. You never see the money \u2014 and you have covered your obligations. What's the biggest financial mistake a young person can make? Getting overloaded with debt. We are part of a society that owes way too much compared to how much money we make. It's the gateway problem that wrecks your financial future. But it's hard because everywhere you go; the message is \"buy this, buy that.\" Editor's note: Interview questions and answers have been edited for length.KArry TAylor | ktaylor@cjournal.ca Photo by: 401(K) 2012/ flickr Globe and Mail writer, Rob Carrick, offers financial advice for young folks.\"You don't want to cripple yourself by saving too much.\" \u2014 rob carrick August 2012 | calgaryjournal.ca 9A real Western view of Toronto Contrary to what many westerners believe the \"Centre of Canada\" isn't a horrible place As I descended the dank and narrow stairwell, two things ran through my mind, \"If this is the end, I guess I had a good run.\" And, \"Am I ever glad I'm thin, or I would have been stuck five steps ago.\" After reaching the bottom, I was glad to find it was indeed the underground clothing store I was led to believe and not the drug den of my nightmares. What I just described was one of many journeys into downtown Toronto. I spent just over two months living and working in and around \"The Big Smoke.\" As I am sure you are aware, the city is just massive. Coming from Calgary, I had an idea as to what to expect, but like most experiences my expectations were nowhere near reality. This past February, I was lucky enough to receive an internship working for the TV show Daily Planet on Discovery Channel. Naturally, I was shaking with joy upon reading the email I received. I would not only be able to knock off the internship requirement of my degree program at university, but I would also be doing it in Toronto working for a recognized program. When I would excitedly tell people about my internship and that I was moving to Toronto for two months, I got some positive reactions, \"Hey that's amazing! Congrats!\" Some mediocre, \"Hey that's cool.\" But I received a surprisingly large amount of negative ones: \"Oh man, that sucks that you have to move to Toronto,\" \"Hey don't die on the 401,\" \"It's too bad you couldn't get a internship here.\" Having lived in the west my entire life, I have grown accustomed to people knocking Toronto and its citizens. Calling them arrogant, rude assholes or just describing the city itself as filthy, over-populated and filled with nothing but backstabbers trying to climb the corporate ladder. There were a couple of incidents in Toronto's Chinatown where I am pretty sure I was cursed out in Chinese for no good reason. But shortly after on that same day , I came across feeble homeless woman who asked me nicely if I could open her bottle of water. She was sitting in her wheelchair on the street corner covered in ratty blankets even though it was over 20 degrees out. I agreed to help her and she then began her attempt to slowly pass the bottle to me. I immediately could see in her pruned, sunburnt face and struggling eyes that handing me the bottle would be an impossible task. So I reached down and grabbed the bottle before her arm snapped from the weight of it. After opening it and handing it back, she gave me one of the most sincere \"Thank you's\" I have ever received. As I walked away, I wondered where she must have gotten that fresh bottle from in the first place. My answer then appeared down the street in the form of a caring citizen that was passing out water to all the homeless people on the street. I believe it was one of the \"Real Life Superheros\" that patrol major cities because the individual had their hood up like they were trying to hide their identity. Before leaving Calgary, I had always heard that Toronto as a whole thinks of itself as New York; huge, important, influential and fast-paced. Based on my experience, this appeared to be true. Everyday I would see people yelling in their cars out of frustration, or bike messengers narrowly missing my car because they had to deliver something right away. I have witnessed those occurrences in Calgary, but I noticed them much more frequently out east. Every city has a particular vibe about it that stems from the combination of its people, landscape, and economy. The feeling that Toronto gives off is one of relentless work, and it has a go-go-go attitude. Whether I was driving to work or walking around the city, I kept thinking, \"Why doesn't everyone just calm down a bit?\" Compared to Calgary, Toronto has a more high- paced feeling to it. It appeared as though the people there only lived for work. One of the contributing factors to that was the fact that many people commute over two hours a day, which leaves very little time to have a social life. Even though there can be long commutes in Calgary, the feeling here is much more relaxed. We may live hectic lives here, but the city exudes a much more Zen feel where we actually live for something other than work. An interesting aspect to this is that only the people in Toronto that have lived somewhere else actually notice the high-paced attitude in the city. It is almost as though everyone else there is so engulfed by it, it is impossible for them to recognize it. I would try to explain these differences to people at my internship, and the majority of people would look at me like I was speaking gibberish. Every city in the world is going to have a different feel to it. Through my experiences in Toronto I learned that some stereotypes of the city may be true. But more importantly I discovered that I prefer to live in a place that fosters a much more relaxed atmosphere. At the end of the day I do really like Toronto as a city to visit, not one to live in. It was a great relief to come back to Calgary. I felt like I could finally exhale after holding my breath for two whole months. cl A yton Goodwin | cgoodwin@cjournal.ca Photo by: Melissa Molloy Calgary journalist investigates some myths, misconceptions and searches for the truth about Toronto.August 2012 | calgaryjournal.ca 10 Earlier this year while visiting city hall for the first time I found myself intrigued by the large mural of Calgary Bay that hangs in the building's public foyer. As I looked at the mural's wide sandy beach and lush rolling hills, I wondered where \u2014 and what \u2014 Calgary Bay was. Colonel James m a Cl eod and the Calgary Conne C tion The mural, it turns out, pays homage to the city of Calgary's namesake \u2014 Calgary Bay, Scotland. The bay itself is on Mull \u2014 an island located off the west coast of Scotland. There are slight discrepancies in accounts of how Colonel James Macleod of the North West Mounted Police came up with the name Fort Calgary in 1875. Some sources state he had ancestral connections to Mull. Others claim Macleod visited Calgary Bay in 1875 and was inspired by its beauty. Whatever the connection was, the name of Calgary stuck, even after the \"Fort\" portion was dropped. Beyond the historical minutiae concerning MacLeod, I was somewhat disappointed that there wasn't much information to be found about the bay, nor about the nearby village of Calgary. Situated along the remote and sparsely populated west coast of Mull, it seemed as if time had stood still in Calgary, Scotland. In the meantime, Calgary, Alberta grew to a metropolis of over one million people. For some reason, this fascinated me. I wanted to know more about this place in Scotland. o pportunity for an adventure Learning about the connection with Macleod might have been the end of my interest in Calgary Bay except for the fact that, by chance, I was in the process of planning a trip to Great Britain. Although my initial travel plans went nowhere near Scotland, I decided I would make my way to Calgary Bay\u2014 for no other reason than I was curious to see what it looked like. It would be an adventure, I told myself. g etting to m ull The most common way to get to Mull is to take a ferry from the Scottish port town of Oban. The first leg of my journey, a train ride from Glasgow to Oban, was a three-hour, jaw-dropping journey through the Scottish Highlands. Having never been to Scotland before, I marvelled at the vast moors, tiny villages and mysterious lochs along the route. The view from the ferry to Mull was equally enchanting, dotted with tiny islets, castles, and lighthouses visible from the deck. As I disembarked the ferry at the tiny village of Craignure, I was full of purpose and drive. I couldn't wait to see Calgary Bay. My first order of business was to stop at the local tourist office to get a map and bus schedule. It was here, however, that it first started to dawn on me that Mull was not quite the small, quaint island I had envisioned it to be. Distances on maps might be further than they appear As I studied the map I bought at the tourist office, I realized that they have a funny way of making distances look much smaller than they actually are. While online maps of Mull had made the island look relatively small, a sidebar on the map in my hand helpfully told me that with an area of 875 square kilometres Mull is the fourth largest island in Great Britain. Getting to Calgary Bay would take a bit more planning than I anticipated. Fortunately, with an economy that is largely dependent on tourism, Mull has a small, but comfortable, public bus system. After sorting the particulars out, I managed to get myself on a bus to Calgary. I was the only passenger. K A rry T A ylor | ktaylor@cjournal.ca In search of Calgary... Scotland A Calgary Journal reporter seeks out our city's namesakeAll photos by: Karry TaylorCalgary is a quiet village tucked up on one side of Calgary Bay. August 2012 | calgaryjournal.ca 11 Calgary, sCotland I got off the bus in Calgary \u2014 the end of its route. It briefly occurred t o me that it might be a good idea to ask the driver when the bus would return. But then I remembered I had a bus schedule in my knapsack. I wasn't worried. I would watch the time and make it back for the next bus. Calgary Bay itself turned out to be as beautiful as the mural in City Hall suggested. The low, green hills of Mull roll down to a broad meadow of machair \u2014 a unique type of grass that grows on sand. The machair eventually gives way a wide, white sandy beach. Impulsively, I took off my shoes and wandered down coastline of the bay, delighting as a child might while my bare feet sunk down into the deep sand. As I looked out at hazy and pale tones of the Atlantic Ocean, I understood why it is said Macleod fell in love with this view. Public facilities at Calgary Bay are limited to a small parking lot, an outhouse and a wilderness camping area set back from the beach. Although it was a sunny summer Saturday, there were only a handful of people around \u2014 along with hundreds of free roaming sheep grazing on the grasslands beyond the machair. The sheep, it would seem, far outnumber people. Beyond the bay, Calgary, Mull consists mainly of a few houses and a hotel scattered on one side of the bay. On the opposite side, there is a teashop and art gallery. Perched in the hills above, Calgary Castle \u2014 a gothic-looking structure built in 1817 \u2014 seems to lord over the bay. Some historical accounts have MacLeod visiting the Castle and naming Fort Calgary for it, rather than the bay. I had been told by a few locals that while Calgary was a very beautiful part of Mull, I wouldn't find much to see or do there. That was true\u2014but also not true. There is, perhaps, something serendipitous about the fact that the mural in Calgary's city hall caught my attention that day. I had never heard of Mull before. All told, I spent five days on the island: biking, pony trekking and camping \u2014 five wonderful days. I can't wait to go back. Shared space: the majority of roads on Mull are single-track lanes with periodic passing places. Vehicles often have to share wit h the island's resident sheep. The name comes Calgary comes from the Gaelic \"Cala ghearraidh\" which means \"beach of the meadow.\" The word \"Cala\" refers specifically to a hard, sandy beach.August 2012 | calgaryjournal.ca 12 The last time I had a beer was in late November, the year 2000. I was about halfway through my 18th year, and suffice to say, the night ended\u2014and begun for that matter\u2014badly. Now before the mood becomes too morose, I will let you know that this is not going to be some tabloid-esque piece about all the terrible things about alcohol. I bear no hard feelings toward the drink, and in fact, quite like the sensations produced by alcohol. The lighthearted and headedness, the laughter, the easiness of conversation \u2014 the list of positives could go on ad infinitum. But, alas, I do not drink a drop of the stuff. Never. And I quite like the not drinking part too. So I'm writing a letter, if you will, for all of us soberites in the city, to let the majority of drinkers (social and otherwise) know just what we folks do with ourselves sans booze. When one doesn't drink it becomes unmistakably evident just how prominent the ritual of liquor consumption is in our culture. People often have beers with lunch. Wine with dinner. \"Wanna go out for a drink?\" is a common phrase. Barbeques, camping, parties, and dancing seem to revolve around the bottle. Without it, one begins to suspect that fun is an impossibility. For the non-drinker, at first, this is all very alienating. Not being able to participate in the sort of social intimacy that radiates from tipsy bodies can feel extremely isolating, but as the tipsiness lends itself to drunkenness, the feelings of forced aloofness dissipate and are replaced by a fabulous sensation of amusement. The first thing we sober folks do for fun, is listen to you drunk folks converse with each other. It's hysterical! I especially enjoy speaking with people who are intoxicated just enough to be drunk, but alert enough to realize that they are talking to me, a sober person. They inevitably feel a pressing need to remind me periodically: \"You do know that I'm drunk right now, right?\" To which I reply, \"Yes, I realize that.\" Watching drunk people navigate a room and each other is pretty fun. Watching really drunk people try to pretend they are not really drunk is hilarious. Watching over-the-top drunk people start to slur and sway, as they inevitably will, is not fun at all. So that is the next thing we sober people do for fun: leave the party before it starts to suck. We get to say goodbye with a smile and all of our clothes on and drive home without any fear of flashing lights in the rearview mirror. The third thing us soberites do is wake up hangover-free, even on Saturday mornings, and especially on Monday morning. We get up well before noon to a world of endless possibilities...well, aside from getting hammered that is. I must say that I get a very strong jolt of satisfaction from being amongst the hungover. Especially as folks around me get older and their hangovers become even more unbearable. It's not that I love seeing people in pain, it's just that the hungover serve as lighthouses for me. They seem to be calling out to me from across the way: \"Keep up the good work, Melissa! You don't want to be like this, do you?\" On the worst of days, when I really miss the instant gratification that swells warmly inside my chest after a couple of drinks, it is the hungover that reign me back in from the edge, and I love them for it. I suppose I've dwelt too long on what sober folks do in a response to drinking people, as if to say that our only options are to surround ourselves with people at parties or bars. This isn't the case. So, you might ask, especially if new to the sober game yourself: \"So, does everything you sober people do include around drunk people?!\" The answer to this is complicated. For me, many of my nearest and dearest are drinkers and in a sense, their engagement with alcohol and my commitment to sobriety do collide. But it's all in the perception of an event. For example, if I go to a concert or the Stampede, or even out for dinner I go for the music, the rides, or the food even if other people around me might choose to get hammered. On the other hand, I do have a whole host of non-drinking friends, and for fun we pretty much do anything under the sun aside from drinking. Whether it be sober campouts with upwards of 50 people or debating over endless rounds of Boston Pizza coffee, being sober in the city of beer-guzzling cowboys isn't so rough after all. Meliss A Molloy | mmolloy@cjournal.ca Photo by: johnny_automatic/Open ClipArt Library What is there to do in this city besides getting wasted on the weekends? This writer tells her sober tale. August 2012 | calgaryjournal.ca 13 I'm scheduled for a mammogram, I have an appointment with a cardiologist and apparently I have high cholesterol. Why? Because I had my tarot cards read at Stampede. I'll backtrack. My girlfriend has a Stampede tradition where every year she makes her way into the exhibition hall and has her tarot cards read. Celebrating this year's centennial with her, I was coerced into having my cards read as well. Why not? I thought. Sure, I read my horoscope daily and I'll wish on a star here or there but do not for a moment think I go to psychics to diagnosis my medical conditions. All of that said, we pay $25 each for a 15-minute card reading. The booth is tucked at the farthest end of the BMO centre and has tables with little square timers on them, folding chairs so you don't get too comfortable, and silk tapestries line the pseudo-walls for effect I suppose. Our names are taken down as we pay and we are brought to Amy. Amy looks like a weathered psychic from the movies - bangles clang with each gesture, around her neck hangs some \"healing stone,\" her dress is Indian-inspired, her skin says she smokes and her fingertips are elaborately done with rhinestones encrusted into her pinky finger nails. \"When is your birthday Christine?\" she begins, flicking on the little timer. I tell her. \"You're a Scorpio,\" she says.Yes, woman - I know this. Remember - I read my horoscope daily. I have read the bestselling guide to astrological signs, Linda Goodman's Sun Signs, and I know all about me. Tell me about the future! I don't say this out loud. \"What do you want to know about?\" she asks while shuffling the tarot deck. \"My health and a boy,\" I reply. \"O.K. we'll begin with your health then.\" She asks me to cut the deck as many times as I'd like. I cut it in three. Apparently, this means I crave control and I enjoy consistency. This is true. The first card that drops is \"The Devil.\" I'm terrified. The card has a horned creature with clawed feet sitting above a male and female demon pair who are chained to his pedestal. He's got a pentagram on his head and black and grey smoke are the background, amidst flames of course. \"Do you get headaches?\" she asks. I don't. She begins lying down the rest of the cards and constructing a pyramid. The spread consists of scenes straight out of Dante's Inferno. Every card she lays down appears to have some character crouched in agony or completing some arduous task. She tells me I need to request an MRI from my doctor. I may need a minor surgery. I will definitely have to see specialists she says as she flips a card that pictures men in gowns consulting over a tomb. You bet I got the Death card too. She begins to flip the cards frantically in a straight line as though she wants to give me a better answer and: she does, whatever it is that's going on with my body will be dealt with in two months time. She'd love to see me in three months to see what happened, she says as she finishes while she looks at the clock. We've gone over the 15 minutes. I look at my girlfriend, who's sitting next to me, and her mouth is open. It's her turn now. She gets her cards read but I don't really listen. My mind is consumed with thoughts of dying. As we're leaving, making our way out of the BMO centre, my girlfriend and I don't say much to each other. We're both contemplating what Amy has said to us. Later, when we're going to eat my girlfriend says to me, \"I'm sorry if I downplayed your reading. That was terrible. Just make sure you get checked out.\" Later that day, I call another friend to tell her how awful my tarot card reading was and how scared I am as a result of it. Instead of comfort from her, she says, \"That's strange, I had a dream you died last night. Don't worry, it wasn't medical, you just got into a car accident. I have to go, I'm dropping off the boys.\" She hangs up. I cried. I laughed. I Googled a doctor and had an appointment the next day. I did not tell the doctor about the psychic. I did tell the receptionist though. I've had a full physical, I've gotten blood work done and like I said, I am going to see specialists for my heart and make sure there's nothing cancerous growing in my chest. Why? Because I had my tarot cards read.

Marking a period of fasting, as well as charity and generosity towards others, Ramadan is a time of prayer and personal introspection. Importance of famIly and communIty Imam Fayaz Tilly, an Islamic chaplain with the University of Calgary, Mount Royal University and Alberta Health Services, says Ramadan is a time to strengthen family and community ties. \"Ramadan is a blessed time,\" says Tilly. \"It's a time for Muslims to get together, both locally and internationally. Many families sit down and eat suhoor \u2014 the pre- fast meal held just before dawn \u2014 together. \"It allows for the sharing of good times and is an opportunity to connect with your family members,\" Tilly says. Muhammed Mosim, a student at the University of Lethbridge, says the support of his family and friends \u2014 both Muslim and non-Muslims \u2014 helps him to keep his fast each day. \"It is the hardest for the first few days and then your body starts to physically adjust,\" Mosim says. \"Their encouragement definitely helps me to get through the days that are not easy.\" On the weekends, communal openings of the fast are held in mosques around the city to allow hundreds of people to begin their fasts at the same time. Calgary is home to a number of mosques, including Baitun Nur \u2014 the largest mosque in Canada \u2014 located in the northeast community of Castleridge. Contemplating upon one's role within relationships is another important aspect of Ramadan. \"It's a time to reflect on what you have done over the past year to enhance the environment in your home, for example, in being an affectionate and caring person in whatever role you are in \u2014 whether you are a friend, a father, a mother or a daughter,\" Tilly says. a tIme of generosIty and charIty Tilly says the notion of mercy and of showing compassion towards others is stressed during during Ramadan. In addition to observing the practice of Zakt - the act of donating 2.5 percent of one's annual income to charity \u2014 Muslims are encouraged to volunteer and contribute in other ways during Ramadan. Tilly says this could be anything from contributing to food drives to raising awareness and funds for social causes to donating to hospitals. \"It's a month where we are obliged to ponder and reflect upon billions of human beings throughout the world who don't have enough food to eat or who don't have medication to take and whatnot,\" Tilly says. fastIng only for those who are able While fasting is perhaps Ramadan's most well known aspect, Tilly says it is important to acknowledge that only adults who are physically able to fast safely are required to abstain from food and drink from dawn to dusk. \"People who are ill, people who are travelling and women who are expecting or nursing a child aren't obliged to fast,\" Tilly says. The end of Ramadan is marked by the holiday of Eid-ul-Fitr, a day of prayer and celebration. Tilly says that during Eid-ul-Fitr, 25,000 to 30,000 members of Calgary's Muslim community will gather at the BMO Centre. \"They will all pray, asking God to accept their fast and to accept their charity,\" Tilly says. \"They will also pray to give unity within one's family and one's community.\" Calgary's Muslim community observes Ramadan Family life an important part of Islamic holy month KArry TAylor | ktaylor@cjournal.ca FACTS ABOUT RAMADAN ramadan begins: July 20, 2012ramadan ends: August 18, 2012 Ramadan is 29 or 30 days long, dependent upon the sighting of a new moon. It represents the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. Although it is the same date each year on the Islamic calendar, the start date shifts about 10 days each year on the Gregorian calendar. This is because the Islamic calendar is lunar-based, rather than solar-based. suhoor: the pre-fast meal that is eaten before dawn Iftar: the meal that is eaten just after sunset to break the fast eid-ul-fitr: a day of prayer and celebration that marks the end of Ramadan Photo courtesy of: Creative Commons/ABC Open Riverland A key component of Ramadan is to reflect on one's role within the family. August 2012 | calgaryjournal.ca 15Corb Lund's a Calgary man Alberta-bred star talks cows and cabin fever Meliss A Molloy | mmolloy@cjournal.ca Corb Lund and his band, The Hurtin' Albertans have became a folk and country Canadian staple after their 2005 release of the album, \"Hair in My Eyes Like a Highland Steer\" which featured fan favourites like, \"Truck Got Stuck\" and \"All I Wanna Do Is Play Cards.\" Lund has become known for his old-school storytelling lyrics and the many regional tunes that talk about the picturesque Rocky Mountains or affordable-living in the Saskatchewan prairies. He is not afraid to talk about Alberta's big business oil sands and depletion of wildlife as well as land quality, and has somehow found the perfect straddling point between city slicker and rural rancher. On Aug. 15 Lund and his band will release their latest full-length album, \"Cabin Fever,\" in which a press release says the Alberta cowboy \"wrote most of the twelve track album whilst hunkered down in a remote cabin an hour outside Edmonton.\" The Calgary Journal spoke with Mr. Lund over the phone to talk about the latest album and Lund's Calgary connection. Editor's note: some answers have been edited for length. Writing songs in this isolated cabin, Was it intentional to go there explicitly to W rite a record, or did you just happen to be in this isolated place W hen the W ords came to you? It just happened. I went through a really rough breakup and we had some pretty bad health problems in my family, so I had a rough couple of years. I was spending a lot of time out there just dealing with things. That's what (the title Cabin Fever) is about \u2014holing up in a place by yourself. c abin Fever F eatures a song called \" c o W s a round\" that talks about the do W nside to having bovine in a really F unny W ay, W hat's the story behind this F un tune? The story is about any of us that have dads or western guys, cowboys or whatever that just cannot bear to not have cows around. It's a pain in the butt to have them, and you lose money on them but you just got to have them around. It's kind of a joke among cow people. I mean, really, they're called cowboys for a reason. The whole western culture is based on cattle, and any of us country kids know dads or uncles that probably should have gotten rid of the cows years ago but just like to have a few around. i s the cabin still around? Yep. Me and an uncle of mine, (whose one of my favourite relatives who passed away a couple of years ago); he and I and my ex girlfriend put it together. He was a log builder. It's quite beautiful. Where have you been living lately? I live in Edmonton and my family lives in Taber. I'm actually going to move to Calgary pretty quick here because my folks are getting older and I want to be closer to them. What are your thoughts on c algary? d o you have any special connection to the city? Oh yeah, sure. Stampede is completely wrapped up with my family. We've always come up here and it was the highlight of the summer. My grandfather and my mom were both Stampede rodeo champs. My dad and both of my uncles competed and I actually did too, years ago when I was a kid. It's funny to me that Toronto and Calgary have being yipping at each other for years \u2014 we're sort of viewed as the backward cousins, and we elect a really progressive, young, ethnic mayor and they elect that redneck, Ford! Every time I go to Toronto I gloat about that. I really like Calgary. The whole point of moving here is to be close to the action. I love Edmonton, I've been there for 20 years but it's like a big small-town. iF this next album W ere to take over the planet and you became the biggest country star in the W orld, W ould you relocate to the s tates? No, I'd build a mansion on Scotsman's Hill. Both sides of my family have been in Alberta for over a hundred years raising cattle. I can see myself having a place in Austin for a few months in the winter, but I would never completely leave Alberta. It's too tied up in my family. h o W important is it F or you to stay connected W ith your F ans? It's pretty important. The biggest connection I feel is with an audience when I'm playing a show. A lot of people make a record and then tour to support the record, but for me, my whole life I've been making records so that I could tour. My whole reason for getting into music has been so that I could play live. The communication that goes on between you and an audience when you are playing is quite cool. I feel bad for (other kinds of artists) painters, or poets because they don't really get to have that (audience connection). The best they can hope for is glowing reviews or heartfelt letters that people send them, or occasionally they can do a reading. But I get to do my art in real-time and I get an hour and a half's worth of feedback every time. It's great. I've also been doing a lot more social networking. I've been tweeting and I do a blog every week, so that helps too. I use Facebook and Twitter a lot, and I try to reply to people but I don't have a lot of time to do a whole lot of interaction. It's mostly a one-way communication. What's your F avourite setting to play sho W s in? Hmm. 400 people in a 300 seat bar. Bars are awesome. I like it when people are crammed in and four feet away from you. Playing for (tens of thousands) of people is fun in its own way, and theatres are nice because you can hear all the words and people have comfortable seating, but for sheer on-the-ice fun, crowded, sweaty beer-joints are the best. My old band, The Smalls, used to play the Republic bar (in Calgary) all the time. That was a great bar. What is your biggest hope F or c abin Fever? Well, we've been chipping away in the States for quite awhile. We have regional followings in Texas, Montana and Wyoming. But we need to expand our (following). I hope for international (success) because I love touring other countries. I'd like our American stuff to pick up. We do quite well in England and Australia, and I'd like to tour Europe more.

The Calgarian says that although her immigrant parents were less than pleased when she first left the lucrative profession to pursue the dance she fell in love with, both her mother and father have become supportive of her dream job, and her mother makes many of her elaborately sewn floor length skirts and dresses. Terracciano and The Calgary Journal joined forces in a creative photo shoot to spotlight the attitude, the beauty, and the passion that is: Flamenco.

Aside form the welcoming d\u00e9cor, private tables, and great lighting, you'll also notice the friendliness of the staff and the welcoming atmosphere. \"I hire more on character and personality then I do based on experience. Experience is nice, but I can teach anyone the technical side of being a waiter, but I can't teach empathy, how to read people, and how to genuinely care about people,\" says Brava Bistro's managing partner Dewey Noordhof. Brava's staff interacts with their guests from the time the walk through the door, until the time they leave. They offer to help them with little things like hanging their coat up and offering purse hooks for the tables. Noordhof hopes the courteous staff make Brava more than just a restaurant to their guests. \"There's a quote from the poet Maya Angelou, that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel,\" Noordhof says of his vision for Brava. \"What I want us to be recognized for is providing a consistent, welcome environment. I want people to consider this place almost like a second home.\" Noordhof says that because of his hiring philosophy the restaurant doesn't have much turnover with its staff. Combined, sous chef Eben Brummitt, server Heather Franks, and server/bartender Paul Mitschke have over 20 years experience at Brava alone. \"A good way to describe us is family,\" Mitschke says. \"We all have each other's backs. I trust everyone who works here.\" Franks says trust among the staff is crucial to Brava's customer service. \"It starts from the top, because Dewey gives us so much freedom to do things. We all respect each other and I think that shows.\" Franks added, \"We need to all respect each other so the restaurant has a flow to it. We're a tight machine from accounting to the kitchen. You can't take one person out or it won't work.\" \"We want to come to work and we laugh all the time.\" Manager Noordhof says his restaurant's atmosphere depends first of all on the staff. \"I consider my staff to be more important then the customers. And what I mean by that is you can't even start to preach about customer service unless you have a culture where the staff treats each other well, and if the staff is comfortable and happy the customer service happens after that.\" \"My position isn't more important then theirs. If anything theirs is more important then mine. For example, if the toilet backs up tonight, I'm getting my gloves on. It's more important for my staff to do their jobs.\" Sous chef Brummit says he hopes that people take away that the staff at Brava really care about the food they serve and the time that customers have when dining at the restaurant. \"I'd describe our food as comfort food with a professional twist to it.\" Brava was voted Calgary's best all around restaurant by Avenue Magazine this past spring. \"When I'm done with the restaurant business, I'd be totally ok if the only reason they remember this restaurant is because of how welcome they feel here.\" A lot of the customers that frequent Brava will say that Dewey is Brava, and Brava is Dewey disagrees with that statement. \"Brava wouldn't be Brava without the people who come here.\" Brava is located at 723 17th Avenue S.W.

She published her first novel in 2006 \"The Birth House.\" Winner of several prestigious awards, the book became a number one bestseller in Canada and was featured on CBC Radio One's \"Canada Reads.\" McKay's latest bestselling novel, \"The Virgin Cure,\" has also received critical acclaim. The novel introduces readers to Moth \u2014 a young girl sold as a servant to a wealthy woman by her poverty-stricken family and forced to fend for herself on the streets of 19th century New York City. McKay drew inspiration for the novel from her family history: her great-great-grandmother was a pioneer in women's medicine in the time and place of the novel's setting, and worked to help many girls like Moth. McKay spoke to the Calgary Journal about \"The Virgin Cure\" and how she found literary inspiration in her family history. Editor's note: some answers have been edited for length. Where did the character of Moth co Me fro M? It all started with me exploring my family history and deciding to base the character of Dr. Sadie on my great-great-grandmother. I had tried to write from her point of view only, but it wasn't working. I couldn't capture it enough to carry the weight of the whole story. But as I found out more about her and the work she had done with these young women, I started writing about her relationships with them. One character kept stealing scenes. That was Moth. She jumped out of the narrative that I was already writing and said 'pay attention to me.' I was putting together other pieces of case histories of the time and found it was very common for poor families to sell their children or try to get them placed as servants in wealthy homes. I wanted to explore that, and what it would mean to her. Your first book received a lot of attention. h o W different of a process W as it to W rite Y our second novel? There was so much freedom with \"The Birth House\" that when I was writing it, I didn't even know that I was writing a novel. And when I came to terms with that, I kept thinking 'who is going to publish a story about a midwife in Nova Scotia in World War I?' I really was just writing it for myself. When so many readers kept embracing it and talking about it and passing it from hand to hand, I almost didn't believe it. A writer can't really ask for anything more than that. It was very gratifying, and I love my readers. With this book though, I had to clear my head of all that. Otherwise I (would) put a lot of pressure on myself because I didn't want to disappoint my readers. \"The Virgin Cure\" has a different setting and tackles different ideas. Some of the issues were tougher for me to write about. I started wondering if they would be tougher for the reader as well, and if they would feel a connection to the characters. But ultimately, I had to write the book that I wanted to read. You hope that your readers will respond to it. So far, it seems they are embracing Moth as much as they did Dora in \"The Birth House.\" It's hard for a novelist to finish that first novel and say goodbye to those characters knowing you have to find a new character for the next book. When Moth presented herself and I realized she was who this book would be about, I knew I had something. And then I couldn't wait to get back to the desk every day. What did Y ou kno W about Y our great- great-grand M other before Y ou W rote this book? What did Y ou find about her during Y our research? I knew some (things) about her from my grandmother and my mother. I had always been told that she was a lady doctor. When I was younger, that just flew by my awareness because there were female doctors in my community while I was growing up. I didn't think anything of it, or what the implications were. But when I was looking for something to write about for a second novel, I learned a bit about women in medicine at that time and how difficult it had been for them. That was when those two worlds collided. She treated women and children at an infirmary on the Lower East Side, but a lot of her work was also done on the streets. It was referred to as street medicine and the female doctors went out to tenements and street corners trying to help people. I found out that there were 30,000 kids under the age of 15 living on the streets at that time. Many were girls and most of the work that they could get was in prostitution. h o W rare W ere fe M ale doctors in her ti M e?She was a rebel. Her family actually had fairly high social standing. From everything that I have read about the history of the time, I am sure it was just assumed that she would marry someone of high social stature and become a wife and member of high society and that would be enough for her. But for some reason, and nobody in my family history knows why, she said no to all that. Two sisters, Emily and Mary Blackwell, opened their own medical college for women. My great-great-grandmother was in the first class. There were only nine women in (total). It was considered socially unacceptable for women to be doctors. If you had medical knowledge, then all your femininity went away and you were considered a freak. What is next for Y ou in ter M s of W riting? When I finished \"The Virgin Cure,\" I knew that I was done with that part of the story. But I felt I had done so much research \u2014 and that my head was still in New York City\u2014 that there would be another New York novel. It will be called \"The Witches of New York.\" Photo by: Ian McKayAugust 2012 | calgaryjournal.ca 23In 2006 Noah Epp rode his bicycle from Calgary to Edmonton. Although that is an impressive feat on its own, two things underlined Epp's achievement: his ride raised over $30,000 for cancer research, and he was all of nine-years-old at the time. His father Brent Epp says Noah came up with the idea to use his bike to raise money for cancer research entirely on his own. \"He had learned about Terry Fox in school and that was a real inspiration for him. He had also spent some time at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre visiting a family friend who was battling cancer,\" Brent says. \"Initially his idea was to go from Calgary to Vancouver on his bike. But we thought that was a bit too ambitious for a nine-year-old.\" Now 15, Noah is ready to do Vancouver with his parents' blessing. Brent says that instead of going out and having fun with his friends as other 15-year-old boys do, Noah has devoted himself completely to preparing for the ride. \"I see that it has cost him something to do this,\" he says. \"He has to get on the bike and discipline himself. I think it shows that there has been recognition that it is a bigger cause than himself.\" Six day S and 1000 km The \"Ride 4 A Reason\" tour will depart Calgary on Aug. 6. In order to cover the 1,000 km route, Noah will be on his bike eight to 10 hours a day. The carefully planned ride will take six days \u2014 five full days of riding with one rest day midway through. The goal of the ride is to raise $250,000 for pediatric cancer research and several organizations that support young cancer patients and their families. Noah says the impetus for this ride, as it was in 2006, is to help raise both funds and awareness. \"A couple of summers ago I met two boys my age that had cancer. One of them passed away,\" he says. \"I wanted to do something for him.\" Jamie's Preschool, a local organization that runs one of North America's only early childhood education programs for immune-compromised children, will be one of the beneficiaries of the ride. Other groups set to benefit include the Kids Cancer Care Foundation of Alberta and the BC Children's Hospital. Ride i S a family effo R t Susie Epp, Noah's mother says arranging logistics has been \"a complete family affair\" from contacting sponsors, working to liaison with charities and the media, as well as helping her son prepare both physically and emotionally for his ride. Noah has been preparing for the ride since late February, often accompanied on his long training rides by his father. He has also been much more involved in the planning aspect of this ride than he was in 2006. \"Now that I am older, I realize how much work has to go into this and how much time it takes,\" he says. Brent will ride a bike alongside his son. The pair will be joined by two others riders: Clare Smart, a sergeant with the Calgary Police Service, and Graham Fischer, a family friend and mentor to Noah. \"Noah is the primary rider that we are all riding in support of,\" Brent says. \"It will be an interesting and challenging journey, but worth it in the end.\" Other members of the Epp family will provide roadside support for the four cyclists. Susie and Noah's siblings will ride in a motor home ahead of the group. Brent Epp's parents will follow behind the cyclists in another vehicle. \"Our role will be to support them and make sure they have what they need to be refuelled,\" Susie says. \"We will also be cheering them on.\"Social media and co R po R ate S pon S o RS hip aiding in fund R ai S ing effo R t S Brent Epp says that although the ride is \"a huge undertaking,\" Noah has been receiving encouragement and donations through his Facebook page, Noah R4R. \"People have been very encouraging and supportive,\" Noah says. Several corporate sponsors have also lent their support. \"Our sponsors have been great,\" Noah says. \"We really couldn't do this ride without their help.\" For their part, his parents say they are very proud of Noah's efforts to prepare for the ride and for wanting to help others. Susie says her son realizes the importance of his efforts. \"He is a 15-year-old kid who is pouring himself into something that can make a difference in somebody else's life.\" \"Noah is working very hard and a little bit of money from a lot of people really adds up,\" Susie says. \"We are really looking forward to what the results will be.\"Teen to pedal 1,000 km supporting kids' cancer research Noah Epp hopes ride will raise $250,000 KARRY TAYLOR | ktaylor@cjournal.ca Photo by: Karry Taylor Noah Epp training includes rides from Calgary to Canmore along with his dad, Brent.
