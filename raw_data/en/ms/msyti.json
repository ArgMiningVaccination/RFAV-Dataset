Clinical signs and symptoms of dyspnea and orthopnea may also be present in patients with valvular dysfunction.3, MR severity is classified as m ild, moderate, or severe disease on the basis of echocardiographic and/or angiographic findings (1+, 2+, and 3+ to 4+ angiographic grade, respectively). Patients with MR generally fall into 2 categories: primary (also called degenerative) and secondary (al so called functional) MR. Primary MR results from a primary structural abnormality in the valve, which causes it to leak. This leak may result from a floppy leaflet (called prolapse) or a ruptured cord that caused the leaflet to detach partially (called fl ail).4, Because the primary cause is a structural abnormality, most cases of primary MR are surgically corrected. Secondary MR results from LV dilatation due to ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy. This causes the mitral valve (MV) leaflets not to coapt or meet in the center.3, Because the valves are structurally normal in secondary MR, correcting the dilated LV using medical therapy is the primary treatment strategy used in the U.S. Standard Management Surgical Management In symptomatic patients with prima ry MR, surgery is the main therapy. In most cases, MV repair is preferred over replacement, as long as the valve is suitable for repair and personnel with appropriate surgical expertise are available. The American College of Cardiology and the American Hea rt Association have issued joint guidelines on the surgical management of MV (See Supplemental Information).5, The use of standard open MV repair is limited by the requirement for thoracotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass, which may not be tolerated by elderl y or debilitated patients due to their underlying cardiac disease or other conditions. In a single -center evaluation of 5737 patients with severe MR in the U.S., Goel et al (2014) found that 53% of patients did not have MV surgery performed, suggesting an unmet need for such patients.6, Isolated MV surgery (repair or replacement) for severe chronic secondary MR is not generally recommended because there is no proven mortality reduction and an uncertain durable effect on symptoms. Recommendations from major societies7,8, regarding MV surgery in conjunction with coronary artery bypass graft surgery or surgical aortic valve replacement are weak because the current evidence is inconsistent on whether MV surgery produces a clinical benefit.9,10,11,12, Transcathe ter Mitral Valve Repair Transcatheter approaches have been investigated to address the unmet need for less invasive MV repair, particularly among inoperable patients who face prohibitively high surgical risks due to age or comorbidities. MV repair devices under development address various components of the MV complex and generally are performed on the beating heart without the need for cardiopulmonary bypass.1,13, Approaches to MV repair include direct leaflet repair,14, repair of the mitral annulus via direct annuloplasty, 4 or indirect repair based on the annulus's proximity to the coronary sinus. There are also devices in development to counteract ventricular remodeling, and systems designed for complete MV replacement via catheter. Direct Leaflet A pproximation Devices currently approved by the FDA for transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) undergo direct mitral leaflet repair (also referred to as transcatheter edge -to-edge repair). Of the TMVR devices under investigation, MitraClip has the largest body of evidence evaluating its use; it has been in use in Europe since 2008.14, The MitraClip system is deployed percutaneously and approximates the open Alfieri edge - to-edge repair approach to treating MR. The delivery system consists of a catheter, a s teerable sleeve, and the MitraClip device, which is a 4 -mm wide clip fabricated from a cobalt -chromium alloy and polypropylene fabric. MitraClip is deployed via a transfemoral approach, with transseptal puncture used to access the left side of the heart an d the MV. Placement of MitraClip leads to coapting of the mitral leaflets, thus creating a double -orifice valve. The PASCAL (PAddles Spacer Clasps ALfieri) Mitral Repair System (Edwards Lifesciences) is also a direct coaptation device and works in a simila r manner to the MitraClip system.15,PASCAL has been in clinical use since 2016 and was approved for use in Europe in 2019.16, The delivery system consists of a 10-mm central spacer that attaches to the MV leaflets by 2 paddles and clasps. Other Mitral Valve Repair Devices Devices for TMVR that use different approaches are in development. Techniques to repair the mitral annulus include those that target the annulus itself (direct annuloplasty) and those that tighten the mitral annulus via manipula tion of the adjacent coronary sinus annuloplasty). Indirect annuloplasty devices include the Carillon Mitral Contour System (Cardiac Dimension) The CE -marked Carillon of -expanding proximal and distal anchors connected with a nitinol bridge, with the proximal end coronary sinus ostium and the distal anchor in the great cardiac vein. The size of the connection is controlled by a manual pull back on the catheter. Th e Carillon system was evaluated in the Carillon Mitral Annuloplasty Device European Union Study and the follow -up Tighten the Annulus Now study, with further studies planned.17,The Monarc system also involves 2 self -expanding stents connected by a nitinol bridge, with one end implanted in the coronary sinus via the internal jugular vein and the other in the great cardiac vein. Several weeks after implantation, the biologically degradable coating over the nitinol bridge degrades, allowing the bridge to shrin k and the system to shorten. It has been evaluated in the Clinical Evaluation of the Edwards Lifesciences Percutaneous Mitral Annuloplasty System for the Treatment System (Mitralign) and the AccuCinch\u00ae System (Guided Delivery Systems), both of which involve transcatheter placement of anchors in the MV; they are cinched or connected to narrow the mitral annulus. Other transcutaneous direct annuloplas ty devices under investigation include the enCorTC device (MiCardia), which involves a percutaneously insertable annuloplasty ring that is adjustable using radiofrequency energy, a variation on its CE -marked enCor sq Mitral Valve Repair System, and dioband Annuloplasty System (Valtech Cardio), an implantable venous delivery system. Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement Permavalve (Micro Interventional Devices), under investigation in the U.S., is a transcathete r MV replacement device that is delivered via the transapical approach. On June 5, 2017, the SAPIEN 3 Transcatheter Heart Valve (Edwards Lifesciences) was approved by the FDA as an MV replacement device. These replacement valves are outside the scope of th is evidence review. Medical Management The standard treatment for patients with chronic secondary MR is medical management. Patients with chronic secondary MR should receive standard therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; standard manage ment includes angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitor beta -blocker and mineralocorticoid receptor 5 antagonist, and diuretic therapy as needed to treat volume overload.4,3, Resynchronization therapy may provide symptomatic relief, improve LV function, and in some patients, lessen the severity of MR. Summary Transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) is an alternative to surgical therapy for mitral regurgitation (MR). MR is a common valvular heart disease that can result from a primary structural abnormality of the mitral valve (MV) complex or a secondary dilata tion of an anatomically normal MV due to a dilated left ventricle caused by ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy. Surgical therapy may be underutilized, particularly in patients with multiple comorbidities, suggesting that there is an unmet need for less inv asive procedures for MV repair. One device, MitraClip, has approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of severe symptomatic MR due to a primary abnormality of the MV (primary MR) in patients considered at prohibitive risk for sur gery and for patients with heart failure and moderate -to-severe or severe symptomatic secondary MR despite the use of maximally tolerated guideline -directed medical therapy. Summary of Evidence For individuals who have symptomatic primary mitral regurgitat ion (MR) and are at prohibitive risk for open surgery who receive transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) using MitraClip or PASCAL, the evidence includes a noninferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT) and single -arm prospective cohort with historical cohort and registry studies. Relevant outcomes are overall survival (OS) , morbid events, functional outcomes, and treatment -related morbidity. The primary evidence includes the pivotal EVEREST II HRR and EVEREST II REALISM studies, the Transcatheter Valv e Therapy Registry study , and the CLASP IID/IIF study. Studies evaluating MitraClip have demonstrated that MitraClip implantation is feasible with a procedural success rate greater than 90%, 30 -day mortality ranging from 2.3% to 6.4% (less than predicted Society of Thoracic Surgeons [STS] mortality risk score for MR repair or replacement; range, 9.5% to 13.2%), postimplantation MR severity grade of 2+ or less in 82% to 93% of patients, and a clinically meaningful gain in quality of life (5 - to 6-point gain s in ySF -36 scores). At 1 year, freedom from death and MR more than 2+ was achieved in 61% of patients but the 1 -year mortality or heart failure (HF) hospitalization rates remain considerably high (38%). Conclusions related to the treatment effect on morta lity based on historical controls cannot be made because the control groups did not provide unbiased or precise estimates of the natural history of patients eligible to receive MitraClip. Given that primary MR is a mechanical problem and there is no effect ive medical therapy, an RCT comparing TMVR with medical management is not feasible or ethical. The postmarketing data from the U.S. is supportive that MitraClip surgery is being performed with short -term effectiveness and safety in a select patient populat ion. The CLASP IID/IIF randomized cohort demonstrated that PASCAL is noninferior to MitraClip in safety and effectiveness for patients with primary MR at prohibitive surgical risk, and the single -arm registry cohort demonstrated that PASCAL is safe and eff ective in patients with complex mitral valve (MV) anatomy precluding the use of MitraClip. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. For individuals who have HF and symptomatic secondar y mitral regurgitation (SMR) despite the use of maximally tolerated guideline -directed medical therapy who receive TMVR using MitraClip, the evidence includes a systematic review, 2 RCTs, and multiple observational studies. Relevant outcomes are OS, morbid events, functional outcomes, and treatment -related morbidity. The trials had discrepant results potentially related to differences in primary outcomes. The larger trial, with patients selected for nonresponse to maximally tolerated therapy, found a signif icant benefit for MitraClip up to 5 years compared to medical therapy alone, including benefits in overall survival and hospitalization for heart failure. Improvements in MR severity, quality of life measures, and functional capacity persisted to 36 months in patients who received TMVR. The systematic review confirmed the benefit of MitraClip found in the larger RCT, but had important methodological limitations. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. For individuals who have symptomatic primary or secondary MR and are surgical candidates who receive TMVR using MitraClip, the evidence includes a systematic review, 1 RCT, and a retrospective comparative observational study in individuals aged 75 years. Relevant outcomes are OS, morbid 6 events, functional outcomes, and treatment -related morbidity. The RCT found that MitraClip did not reduce MR as often or as completely as the surgical control, although it could be safely implanted and was associated with fewer adverse events at 1 year. Long -term follow -up from the RCT showed that significantly more MitraClip patients required surgery for MV dysfunction than conventional surgery patients. For these reasons, this single trial is not definitiv e in demonstrating improved clinical outcomes with MitraClip compared with surgery. Additional RCTs are needed to corroborate these results. The observational study in individuals aged 75 years found that although MitraClip was associated with improved 1 -year survival and a lower rate of all acute complications compared with surgical repair, it had lower 5 -year survival and greater MR recurrence. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outco me. For individuals who have symptomatic primary or secondary MR who receive TMVR using devices other than MitraClip or PASCAL, the evidence includes a randomized study , nonrandomized prospective studies, and noncomparative feasibility studies. Relevant o utcomes are OS, morbid events, functional outcomes, and treatment -related morbidity. The randomized, sham -controlled trial for the indirect annuloplasty device Carillon offers promising safety data; however, further studies are needed to determine efficacy and long -term outcomes. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. Policy History Date Action 7/2023 Annual policy review.
