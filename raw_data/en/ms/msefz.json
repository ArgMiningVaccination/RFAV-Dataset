Bexsero \u00ae(4CMenB) is a new multi-component vaccine approved by the European Commission for use in individuals aged 52 months. A theoretical transmission model was constructed to assess the long-term effectiveness of Bexsero compared to standard care. The model was populated with UK-speci c demographic data and calibrated to ensure that the transmission dynamics of meningococcal disease in theUK were adequately simulated. The model showed the best strategy to be a routine vaccination programme at ages 2, 3, 4, 12 months and 14 years combined with a 5-year catch-up programme in toddlers aged 12 -24 months and adolescents aged 15 -18 years. This would lead to a 94% reduction in meningococcal cases or 150000 cases and 15000 deaths over a 100-year time-frame. Key words : Adolescents, Bexsero \u00ae, dynamic modelling, infants, meningococcal disease. INTRODUCTION Since the introduction of Haemophilus in fluenza type B (Hib) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines,Neisseria meningitidis has become the leading cause of bacterial meningitis and sepsis in the UK and other countries. N. meningitidis can affect otherwise healthy people of all ages; when it occurs, the diseaseprogresses rapidly, even with appropriate medical in- tervention, and can lead to death within 24 -48 h of therst symptoms [ 1]. Furthermore, 10 -20% of survi- vors have serious long-term complications such as deafness, limb amputation or neurological de cits [2].Of the 13 serogroups identi ed, serogroups A, B, C, W-135, X and Y are responsible for nearly all menin- gococcal disease worldwide [ 3,4]. The incidence of N. meningitidis disease is highest in children aged <2 years and shows a secondary peak in adolescents and young adults in many geographical regions [ 5]. In contrast, the number of meningococcal carriers ishighest in young adults [ 6]. Before the introduction of a serogroup C meningo- coccal (MenC) conjugate vaccine in the UK, about 2400 cases of meningitis were reported annually, pre-dominantly due to serogroups B and C [ 7]. In 1999, a MenC vaccination campaign was implemented with catch-up initially targeting all children and ado-lescents aged from 2 months to 18 years and subse- quently extended to individuals up to 24 years of age. As a result, during the rst 2 years of the UK * Author for correspondence: Dr J. Huels, Novartis Vaccines & Diagnostics AG, Lichtstrasse 35, CH -4056 Switzerland.

Serogroup C disease rates declined markedly in both immunized and non-immunized individuals,presumably as a result of reductions in carriage andsubsequent 'herd 'protection. The success of the UK MenC programme led to similar introductions in other countries, e.g. Ireland, The Netherlands,Spain, and Australia [ 9,10]. In countries where vaccination programmes com- prised a large catch-up campaign, such as the UKand The Netherlands, the decline in disease incidence was more immediate than in those countries without such programmes [ 11,12]. Following the introduction of MenC, meningococ- cal serogroup B (MenB) has emerged as the most prevalent serogroup in Europe [ 13]. In the UK, 84% of meningococcal infections are caused by serogroupB, with an average of 1400 cases annually over the decade from 2001 to 2010 [ 7]. No meningococcal vaccine is currently indicated for prevention of MenB infections; however, a new multi-component vaccine -Bexsero \u00ae(Novartis, Switzerland) -was approved by the European Com- mission in January 2013 for use in the European Union in individuals aged 52 months. Bexsero has four components: outer membrane vesicles (OMVs)from the New has generated protective MenB antibodylevels, with acceptable tolerability in subjects as young as 2 months [ 14] and protective antibody levels against meningococci-expressing capsular groupsother than B (mainly serogroups A, C, W-135, X, Y) [15,16]. The objective of this analysis was to quantify the potential bene ts of a Bexsero vaccination programme in the UK for the prevention of meningococcal dis- ease associated with serogroup B and potentialbenetsvs.serogroups W-135, and Y. Serogroups A and X were not considered in this analysis owing to the current low number of cases in the UK. A trans- mission model that considers both the direct effectsof vaccination and the impact of herd immunity was used to recommend a vaccination schedule that would lead to (1) a rapid reduction in the overall num-ber of vaccine-preventable (VP) meningococcal cases, and (2) long-term elimination of VP meningococcal disease.METHODS The model This dynamic transmission model was based on a pub- lished model of meningococcal serogroup C diseasetransmission [ 17] and adapted to describe the trans- mission of Bexsero-preventable meningococcal dis- ease. In addition, using recently published carriagedata, the model was adapted to include the use ofUK-speci c population contact matrices for calculat- ing disease transmission and UK population esti- mates, birth projections and mortality data ratherthan a uniform population distribution. The model was been programmed using Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft, USA). The model is dynamic in that the force of infection changes over time based on rates of carriage within the population; further, the rates of carriage changewith the force of infection. Using this model structure, it was possible to estimate indirect bene ts of the vac- cine on the vaccinated and unvaccinated populationby simulating the vaccine 's impact on carriage acqui- sition. If a vaccine demonstrates an impact on carriage acquisition, the overall number of subjects carrying the bacteria is reduced within a population, in turn, re-ducing the risk of infection for susceptible subjects and leading to herd protection. Structure The transmission model comprised a set of nine mutu- ally exclusive compartments de ned in terms of VP (M) or non-VP (O) meningococcal carriage and vacci- nation status ( Fig. 1 ). At the starting point, subjects are distributed across compartments based onassumptions regarding the current prevalence of vacci-nation, infection and disease. The rst column of Figure 1 represents seroprotected subjects, the second non-seroprotected subjects, and the third those withmeningococcal disease. The top row represents sub- jects infected with VP meningococcal strains, the se- cond row represents uninfected subjects who aresusceptible to infection, and the third row represents subjects infected with non-VP meningococcal strains, for whom it is assumed that co-infection with VPmeningococcal disease cannot occur. Vaccination During each model cycle of 7 hours (100 per 30 days), a proportion of subjects who reach prede ned ages is vaccinated; subjects successfully vaccinatedModelled Bexsero vaccination in the UK 2001 https://doi.org/10.1017/S095026881300294X Published online by Cambridge University Pressmove from the state protected '(O to OR or M to MR, depending on whether the meningococcal strain is VP). To account for <100% vaccine ef cacy, the proportion of subjects transitioning from the non-vaccinated to vaccinatedstate is ef cacy-adjusted so that all subjects in the vac- cinated state are both vaccinated and protected from disease. Vaccine impact An assumption of the model is that successful vacci- nation (seroconversion) confers complete protection against VP meningococcal disease (direct effect) and may confer some protection against VP carriage ac-quisition (indirect effect). Only those subjects carry-ing VP strains (i.e. 'M'compartment) are at risk of VP meningococcal disease, while carriers of non-VP strains ( 'O'compartment) are at risk of non-VP disease. Importantly, the model does not allow for direct transitions from carriage with VP meningococci to carriage with non-VP meningococci, or vice versa.As with previously published MenC vaccination mod- els [18], it is assumed that co-infection with non-VP and VP meningococci does not occur; therefore,carriers of N. meningitidis of a VP strain are protected from infection with non-VP strains. Moreover, con- sistent with MenC models [ 18], transmission was dynamically modelled only in VP meningococci, andforce of infection was for non-VP meningococci.No vaccine cross-protection for non-VP meningo- coccal strains so successfully vaccinatedindividuals acquired infection with non-VP meningo-cocci at the same rate as non-vaccine protected individuals. Infection During each model cycle, susceptible subjects (SR, S) may become infected and acquire carriage of a VP meningococcal strain (M) or a non-VP meningococcal strain (O); they then transition to the infectedcompartment corresponding to their infection and vaccination status. Most carriers of VP or non-VP meningococci recover without developing invasivemeningococcal disease (IMD) and, in time, return to the susceptible state. A small proportion develop VP disease ( 'M'to 'MD ') or non-VP disease Subjects who recover from meningo- coccal disease return to the non-vaccinated susceptible state. The detailed differential model equations are avail- able in the Supplementary online material. Ageing All model compartments are repeated for each 1-year age stratum; thus, for each health state there are 100compartments (ages 0 -99 years). At yearly intervals, all surviving subjects move to the next age stratum. A maximum life expectancy of 100 years was assumedso all subjects not dying before this age (of meningo- coccal disease or other conditions) exit the model at Vaccinated with resulting seroprotection Vaccine-preventable strain carriersMRi Mi MDi MDeathi ODiSRi strain carriersDiseaseNon-vaccinated or vaccinated without seroprotection due to <100% efficacy Fig. 1 [colour online ].

Each year, a new birth co- hort of subjects aged 0 years is introduced into the'non-vaccinated susceptible '(S) compartment. Model parameters Model population The model was populated with UK-speci c historical and projected demographic data (2010 data) [ 13,19, 20]. The age distribution of the UK population is in- corporated into the model in 1-year age groups. The population is assumed to change each year due to age- ing, births and deaths. As birth projections were onlyavailable until 2033, births were assumed constant thereafter. Epidemiology/number of VP cases Meningococcal cases. Data for 2001 -2010 from governmental sources for England and Wales [ 21, 22], Scotland (A. Smith-Palmer, written communi- cation April 2011) and Northern Ireland [ 23] were used to determine the age-strati ed average annual number of meningococcal cases. Lacking data for Northern Ireland, the age distribution of serogroup B and C cases for 2001 -2006 was assumed to match that of 2007 -2010. The age distribution of serogroup W-135 and other cases was assumed to match the 2007 - 2010 age distribution of all laboratory-con rmed cases. Cases de ned as 'other 'or 'non-groupable were redistributed by serogroup based distri- bution of groupable cases. To re flect the reduced number of cases since the MenC vaccination began, only data from 2006 to 2010 were averaged for sero- group C.As evidence suggests that the of cially reported num- bers underestimate the true burden of disease [ 24,25], calculation of cases for the base-case scenario used Health Protection Agency (HPA) data (for IMD) cor-rected to align with hospital admissions data (hospital episode statistics; HES) for meningococcal meningitis, meningococcaemia and other meningococcal infec-tions. This correction factor for underreporting for England was calculated as the percentage difference between cases reported to the HPA for England andWales compared to population weighted cases re-ported to the HES for England only from 2000/2001 to 2010/2011 [ 26]. For Northern Ireland, the factor was calculated as the percentage difference in thetotal (con rmed and probable) and con rmed cases reported to the Public Health Agency for NorthernIreland from 2000 to 2010; no correction has been ap- plied for Scotland. VP meningococcal cases. These are de ned as cases of serotypes B, C, W-135 and Y disease for which Bexsero provides effective coverage. This is consistent with the methods used for evaluating the MenC vac-cine when introduced into the UK vaccination pro- gramme in 1999. The mathematical models used to evaluate conjugated MenC vaccines, proven to elicitbactericidal antibodies leading to killing of serogroupC meningococci in vitro , considered only 'relevant ' meningococcal cases, i.e. those cases caused by menin- gococci effectively targeted by a MenC vaccine. Casescaused by meningococci of other serogroups could not be affected by the new MenC vaccines and therefore were not considered in those evaluations.Preliminary evidence suggests that Bexsero has the potential to kill meningococci of multiple serogroups due to the vaccine antigens shared across serogroups[15,16]. To estimate the coverage potential of Bexsero against circulating meningococcal strains, a meningococcal antigen-typing system (MATS) wasdeveloped. This method is based on (and thereforecorrelates with) killing of strains in the serum bacteri- cidal assay using human complement (hSBA) from pooled infant sera. Based on MATS strain coverage, an estimated 73% of serogroup B cases, 79% of serogroup C W-135 cases and 21% of serogroup Y casesare expected to be VP [ 27]. Consistent with the meth- ods used for evaluation of MenC vaccines, only those 'relevant 'cases were considered in the present evalu- ation. A correlation was established between MATSrelative potency and killing of serogroup B strains in the hSBA by pooled immune serum from people who have been vaccinated [ 27]; however, the corre- lation of MATS and hSBA has not been established for other N. meningitidis serogroups. Consequently, the MATS estimation of coverage in non-serogroupB (serogroups C, W-135, Y) is based on bactericidal thresholds derived from relating MATS relative potency levels to killing of serogroup B strains by in-fant serum pools. Model calibration The model was calibrated to ensure that it accu- rately simulates the incidence of meningococcal car-riage and disease in the UK population. A published WAIFW (who acquires infection from whom) matrixModelled Bexsero vaccination in the UK 2003 https://doi.org/10.1017/S095026881300294X Published online by Cambridge University Press(table S8.4. b in [ 28]) was used to compute trans- mission rates from the age-strati ed force-of-infection data. The age-speci c distribution of meningococcal car- riage was obtained from a meta-analysis of carriageestimates in multiple countries [ 6]. As carriage values have been published for 0 -74 years only, values were carried forward to 75 -99 years assuming the same de- cline (0\u00b71% per year) as reported for years 572. The meta-analysis reported overall carriage only; there- fore, it was assumed that the distribution of VP car- riage in each age group mirrors the distribution ofVP cases. Distribution of case-fatality rates across age groups was obtained from [ 29]; adjustment factors can be ap- plied to modify the absolute case fatalities depending on the modelled scenario. Similar to previously published methods [ 30], the model was calibrated in three steps: (1) the age-speci c force of infection ( ) was calibrated for the starting population and the age-speci c carriage target values; (2) the probabilities of effective contact ( ) were solved for each susceptible and carrier age group combi- nation; and (3) the age-speci c risk of disease given carriage ( ) was calibrated to UK cases reported over the last 10 years [ 21]. The same methods and pre- dened classes of functions as reported in the appen- dix of [ 30] have been used to model the force of infection as well as the risk of disease given infection. Maximum-likelihood methods have then been applied tot the force-of-infection parameters and the risk of disease given infection parameters to the carriage anddisease data. Time-frame In the base-case analysis, meningococcal transmission and outcomes (cases) were tracked over a 5-year and a 100-year time-frame. Model inputs The movement between compartments in the model (Fig. 1 ) is dependent on the values of the input para- meters and the model equations. The base-case par-ameter values with corresponding data sources are shown in Table 1 . Rates of movement between com- partments are assumed to follow an exponential distri-bution in which a constant rate is applied to the population in the relevant compartment.Vaccination strategies evaluated Mathematical modelling allows optimization of the age at which vaccination strategies are implemented, as well as targeting the catch-up programme to the age cohorts yielding the most value. Four basic vacci-nation strategies consistent with the product label have been evaluated. In order to assess the impact of catch-up programmes on the case reduction withintherst years after implementation of a vaccine pro- gramme, the early infant vaccination has been tested in combination with a 5-year and a 17-year catch-up,respectively. Finally, an adolescent component has been added to the combination programmes in ad- dition; all strategies evaluated are summarized inTable 2 . All vaccination programmes mentioned were compared to the current UK standard of care of two MenC doses at ages 3 and 4 months, and the combined Hib and MenC conjugate vaccine given asa booster between ages 12 and 13 months. It is assumed that Bexsero will be added to the cur- rent MenC vaccination programme and hence all ben-ets are assumed to be incremental to the current vaccination schedule. Uncertainty analysis For the combination of routine vaccinations in early infants and adolescents, together with a 5-year catch-up programme ( Table 2 ), a probabilistic sensi- tivity analysis was performed with respect to the num- ber of cases prevented vs.the current standard of care. Parameters assessed included: likelihood of successfulvaccination; vaccine persistence (waning antibodies); vaccine uptake; recovery from carriage; case fatality. Narrow ranges were used when parameter value accu-racy was well established (e.g. vaccination uptake);wider ranges were used for parameters with less accu- racy (e.g. waning rates) ( Table 1 ). In addition, the number of calibrated cases was varied between 0\u00b762and 1\u00b768 of the base-case values, re flecting the range of cases annually in the UK between 2001 and 2010, with the age distribution of cases assumed to be thesame as in the base case. For the probabilistic sensi- tivity analysis, estimates were drawn from a uniform distribution for waning, recovery from carriage andvaccination uptake parameters, while estimates forall probabilities, including the probability of success- ful vaccination vs.VP strains were drawn from a beta distribution. A random-number generator was used to 'draw ' parameter values from each distribution. Next, the2004 J.

The model was then run to generate estimates of the per-centage reduction of VP cases. This process of draw- ing and replacing parameters and then calibration and running the model was repeated 1000 times.Finally, the number of cases prevented standardizedto the case distribution associated with today 's stan- dard of care was calculated for each model run; the 25th ranked and 975th ranked number of cases pre-vented determined the upper and lower bounds of the con dence intervals (CIs). RESULTS Model calibration Results of the calibration of the age-speci c risk of VP disease to the observed incidence of meningococcal disease are presented in Figure 2 . The fact that cases of meningococcal disease are reported in 5-yearcohorts in the UK leads to a suboptimal model t in teenagers and young adolescents. The risk of dis- ease given carriage was highest in infants (1/200)and declined steeply with age, reaching a plateau (1/20000) in the population aged >40 years.Model analysis The estimated number of cases of meningococcal dis- ease under the current standard of care (i.e. without Bexsero vaccination) varies over time because of theprojected changes in the population structure. Under the current standard of care, the model predicts 1640 cases of meningococcal disease in the rst year, 8048 within the rst 5 years ( Table 3 ) and an annualTable 2.

To allow for easier interpretation given population changes over time, projected long- term vaccination outcomes are reported relative to the current standard of care. First 5 years of vaccination programme Model results con rm that the early infant vaccination strategy ( Table 2 ) provides the best direct protection in infants ( Table 3 ). The early infant vaccination strategy is estimated to prevent 2089 cases within the rst 5 years of the vaccination programme, including a55% reduction in VP cases in infants aged <1 year vs.the current standard of care. Under this strategy, >50% of VP cases in infants aged 42 years are averted, whereas <2% of VP cases in teenagers andadults are averted through indirect protection (Table 3 ). Overall, the number of preventable cases is reduced by 26%. In comparison with routine infant vaccination pro- grammes, routine adolescent vaccination programmes are characterized by a slow onset of protection frommeningococcal disease. In the rst 5 years of a vacci- nation programme, routine adolescent vaccination would prevent 655 cases of meningococcal diseasevs.the standard of care, i.e. 31% of the cases averted with early infant vaccination. Catch-up programmes Short-term catch-up programmes in the rst year(s) of the vaccination programme promote a faster re- duction of VP cases. The larger the catch-up pro- grammes, the faster and more complete theprotection from meningococcal disease ( Table 3 ). Compared with an early infant programme alone,adding a 5-year/17-year catch-up prevents an ad- ditional 1389/3253 cases, respectively, within the rst 5 years of the vaccination programme, leading to a 43%/66% reduction of VP cases in year 5 of the vacci- nation programme vs.the current standard of care (Table 3 ). One-hundred-year model time horizon Routine vaccination strategies in the rst 2 years of life can lead to signi cant reductions in VP cases with- in 5 years of introduction of the vaccination pro- gramme but reach a 'plateau '(steady state) about 40 years after the start of the programme ( Fig. 3 ). The addition of a catch-up component to such pro- grammes accelerates reduction in cases; however, ifthe catch-up programme does not lead to the eradi-cation of VP disease, the long-term incidence level will converge in the long-term to the same 'plateau ' as the routine vaccination programme without acatch-up component ( Fig. 3 ). Adding adolescent vaccination Age at adolescent vaccination has been varied from 11 to 16 years, showing that vaccination programmes at higher age lead to higher reduction of meningococcal cases when assuming constant vaccination rates.However, the differences between strategies were small. In practice, however, it is assumed that high rates of routine vaccination are more dif cult to achieve in subjects aged 515 years. If a routine infant programme at ages 2, 3, 4 and 12 months together with routine adolescent vaccination at 14 years is com- bined with a 5-year catch-up programme, results sug-gest that a 1-year catch-up in infants between 12 and 24 months should be administered, together with anTable 3.

In the rst 5 years, strategy G is estimated to reduce the number of VP cases by 69% in children aged424 months, and by 48% in the overall popu- lation. Over the rst 10 years of the vaccine pro- gramme, 75% of cases aged <24 months and 59% of expected cases would be prevented compared to the standard of care. Over a 100-year time-frame, strategyG would prevent 94% of cases ( Table 4 ). Impact on carriage acquisition Indirect protection of the unvaccinated population will occur only if the vaccine reduces carriage acqui- sition. Assuming a 100-year time horizon, the vac- cine 's impact on carriage acquisition and disease prevention under strategy G is shown in Figure 4 . Assuming 555% with only an assumed 30% impact on carriage acquisition,Strategy G nevertheless is estimated to prevent almost 70% of such cases. Assuming no vaccine impact on carriage acquisition at all, Bexsero will prevent almost40% of VP cases ( Fig. 4 ). Uncertainty analysis Results from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis of strategy G indicate that Bexsero is expected to prevent 93\u00b75% (95% CI 84\u00b79 -96\u00b75) of VP cases over 100 years. Figure 5 shows the percentage reduction in VP menin- gococcal disease cases over the modelled 100-year time-frame relative to the standard of care, with theTable 4.

DISCUSSION We developed a mathematical model to compare alternative vaccination programmes for the preventionof meningococcal disease in the UK setting, using similar methods and model structures as recently pub- lished [ 34]. As recommended by international guide- lines [ 35], we used a dynamic model to fully capture the clinical value of a meningococcal vaccine. Incontrast, static models assume a xed force of infec- tion and do not capture potential herd protection;they may, therefore, greatly overestimate the remain- ing cases of disease after the introduction of vacci- nation and underestimate the potential bene ts of a vaccination programme [ 13]. Results indicate that routine adolescent vaccination alone cannot achieve the high protection levels within therst 5 years of a vaccination programme seen with routine vaccination in early infants. This is explained by the relatively low number of meningococcal cases in adolescents and the associated low number ofcases prevented as a result of direct protection, com- pared to infants. Moreover, the results con rm that the earlier infants are successfully vaccinated, thebetter their protection against meningococcal disease. Indeed, meningococcal disease can occur very early in life with a considerable number of cases reported inchildren aged <6 months. Vaccination programmesin which the rst vaccine is given at 6 months or later cannot prevent these early infections. Overall, catch-up programmes promote faster and greater reductions in meningococcal cases, but this trend will converge in the long term to the same 'pla- teau 'as the respective routine vaccination programme without a catch-up component. Our results suggest that the elimination of VP cases requires a twofold ap- proach: (1) a routine infant immunization programmeto provide direct protection to those at greatest risk; (2) persistent reduction of the carriage reservoir, pri- marily in adolescents and young adults, throughon-going vaccination. The reduction of preventablecases through indirect protection provided by routine adolescent vaccination can exceed that of direct pro- tection and can lead to the elimination of VP menin-gococcal disease, assuming a suf ciently high rate of vaccination uptake. The results are sensitive to assumptions about vaccine impact on carriage acqui-sition. An OMV-based vaccine could be shown to re- duce the likelihood of carriage by 85% during an on-going MenB outbreak in the Normandy regionof France [ 36]; OMV is one of the four components of Bexsero. Another study designed to assess pharyn- geal carriage impact of the vaccine in a population with known high pharyngeal carriage rates supportsthe proof of concept that 4CMenB would provide herd protection against meningococcal disease but does not allow quantifying the reduction of individualcarriage acquisition [ 37]. However, an appropriate translation of the individual carriage impact into an estimate of herd protection can only be based upon 100 9080Cases prevented relative to no vaccination (%)70605040302010 02 0 4 0 Vaccine impact on carriage acquisition (%)60 80 1000 Fig. 4.

Based on theevidence and in lieu of any model to predict herd pro- tection, the precedent from previous MenC vacci- nation programmes [ 8] of 67% has been chosen for 4CMenB. There are inherent limitations in disease modelling and this was no different for our evaluation. In par- ticular, there were limited data on relevant parametersand assumptions were made about their likely value and the variability that may exist around them. Evidence-based data were used where available. Forexample, we used clinical trial-derived likelihood of successful vaccination, laboratory-evaluated strain coverage and expected vaccine uptake, althougheven for these values some uncertainty remains. As with many new vaccines, long-term clinical data are unavailable, e.g. vaccine persistence for Bexsero iscurrently not fully assessed. In such cases, expert opi-nion and previous experience were used to de ne ap- propriate parameter values and any possible vari- ability around these values. The reasons for the unpredictable 'natural fluctua- tion 'of cases of meningococcal disease over time, the changes of serogroup distribution within a countryover time as well as the differences across geographies are not yet fully understood. To re flect these phenom- ena the average of reported numbers from 2001 to2010 has been used for the base case (adjusting for the decline in incidence due to MenC vaccination) whereas the full range of reported numbers has beenconsidered in the sensitivity analyses. Since 2010, thenumbers have declined further. Efforts should be taken to fully understand the underlying reasons for the observed fluctuation of IMD incidence. We did not consider the seasonality of meningococ- cal disease. Seasonality needs to be considered if the intention is to estimate the expected reduction of VPcases in the short term (over the rst few years) after the start of the vaccination programme. The subopti- mal model t between estimated and observed menin- gococcal disease numbers, particularly in school-agedchildren and teenagers ( Fig. 2 ), is not considered as a major limitation of this study. As mentioned, the relative poor model t is explained by the fact that reported disease cases are grouped into 5-year cohorts -and the incidence numbers obtained from the tted model are believed to re flect the reality better than the grouped numbers reported. Fitting more complex functions may require more parameters, which are be- lieved to offset any potential gains from obtaining abetter model t. Further investigations in this area may be needed. Estimates of the proportion of circulating meningo- coccal disease preventable by the vaccine can be considered conservative, as the method used forMATS does not include potential synergistic effectsbetween vaccine antigens and does not consider cover- non-PorA P1\u00b74 components (PorA P1\u00b74 is OMV derived from MenB strain NZ98/254) of the OMV. Moreover, vaccine coverage was estimated based on post-vaccination sera collected from infantsaged 12 months; coverage is expected to be greater in older age groups such as adolescents and adults. We did not incorporate strain replacement into the current model. Because Bexsero contains multiple components and half of strains tested are covered by more than one Bexsero antigen, it is likely to retain ef-fectiveness if one antigen is down-regulated ormutated. Thus, based on the characteristics of Bexsero and epidemiological evidence from previous vaccination programmes with serogroup-speci c meningococcal vaccines, we considered the theoretical risk to be low for replacement by serogroups or speci c strains within a serogroup that were not tar- geted by the vaccine. Finally, our intention was to identify a Bexsero vac- cination schedule that achieves both rapid reductionof the overall number of VP meningococcal cases and long-term elimination of VP meningococcal dis- ease. Based upon our ndings, such a programme may comprise routine administration of Bexsero toinfants as early as possible, e.g. at ages 2, 3, 4 and 12 months, routine adolescent vaccination with two doses of Bexsero administered at 14 years and an ado-lescent catch-up programme in the rst year of the vaccination programme. The catch-up programme should at least cover vaccination of all toddlers be-tween ages 12 and 24 months which, in the case of Bexsero, would require two doses, as well as vacci- nation of the four adolescent cohorts between ages15 and 18 years, again with two doses of Bexsero. Ifimplemented in the UK, such a programme would po- tentially prevent about 150000 cases and 15000 deaths over a 100-year period.
