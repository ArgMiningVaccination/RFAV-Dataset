Really all you are telling me with that is that you are overly credulous, or your confirmation bias is overwhelming your critical thinking skills. You like what she says too much to objectively think about it. There is plenty of actual evidence outside the video to help you decide whether to believe her, especially if you don't have a degree in molecular biology or virology so you have the background to actually understand her claims. That she sounds convincing should rally have no bearing on her credibility. That her actual scientific research was invalidated due to lab contamination could be bad luck. That she reacted to bad luck by blaming everyone but herself and refusing to share her actual data even with her employer in an apparent attempt to prevent her findings from being invalidated says a lot more about her character. And lest people respond by saying it was a he-said she-said situation, her findings sparked a rush by multiple researchers to replicate and expand on her discovery. Every other scientist who got similar results eventually acknowledged lab contamination (they were all getting the contaminated chemicals from the same supplier) and voluntarily retracted their papers. Or they never got the same results because they used different chemicals. The whole matter is now considered settled. Her findings have been exhaustively researched by other scientists, and they have all concluded that there is no evidence that Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus is present in humans. That is how science works. And science now says she was wrong. That she won't simply acknowledge that her findings are invalid due to no fault of her own, when the facts are that well documented, is why she has no credibility to me. I'll take the balance of evidence over a claim that a really nice person made the video. And yes, a claim that the evidence against her statements was invented by the deep state to discredit her is a hard one to counter. People will believe what they want to believe, I suppose. As another [debunker ](https://respectfulinsolence.com/2020/05/06/judy-mikovits-pandemic/)put it: \"A good conspiracy theory turns the believer into a hero, a warrior with secret knowledge that none of the other ignorant \"sheeple\" know, against powerful forces arrayed against him. A good conspiracy theory almost always has a part at the end in which the \"people\" (in this case, the people believing the conspiracy theory) \"wake up\" and see what is being \"suppressed\" by the powerful forces seeking to keep them ignorant. Conspiracy theories like this both make the believer feel special and brave for having secret knowledge and fighting to make it public, but also provide an explanation for bad things happening in the world. Yes, the conspiracy theory in Plandemic is utterly ridiculous to those of us who know science, medicine, and history, but most people don't know the relevant science, medicine, and history. To them, it "}
