In that case, you probably start using all the tricks in your acne-treating arsenal, from spot treatments to salicylic acid cleansers. But if it still isn't going away, it could actually be perioral dermatitis. \"Perioral Murphy-Rose](https://www.instagram.com/drblairrose/?hl=en), MD, FAAD, explains. Read on to learn how to distinguish perioral dermatitis, what it is, how to prevent it, and how to treat it. Meet the Expert [Dr. Jodi LoGerfo](https://www.instagram.com/drjlodnp/?hl=en), City. [Blair Murphy-Rose](https://www.instagram.com/drblairrose/?hl=en), MD, FAAD, is a board-certified dermatologist who specializes in facial rejuvenation at the [Laser & Skin Surgery Center of New York](https://www.laserskinsurgery.com/meet-the-doctors/dr-blair-murphy-rose/). She is a Clinical Instructor of Dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College. What Is Perioral Dermatitis? \"Perioral dermatitis is an inflammatory Group](http://www.orentreich.com/) in New York City. \"It mostly affects young women. Those who usually have perioral dermatitis have small, inflammatory, red papules and/or pustules with or without scaling. It occurs around the mouth, chin, nose, or eyes. When it occurs around the mouth, the skin next to the border of the lip is commonly clear.\" Sometimes perioral dermatitis can cause burning or itching, but it's most often asymptomatic, adds Dr. Murphy-Rose. It usually occurs in women ages 20 to 40. What Causes Perioral Dermatitis? \"There have been lots of theories as to what causes perioral dermatitis, but the cause is not so understood,\" Dr. LoGerfo says. \"One of the largest contributors to the condition is topical corticosteroid use.\" Perioral dermatitis has also been associated with external hormones\u2014such as oral contraceptives and IUDs, fluorinated toothpaste, and fluorinated steroids (like those in creams or inhalers), explains Dr. Murphy-Rose. How to Treat Perioral Dermatitis \"Perioral dermatitis is best treated under the care of a board-certified dermatologist,\" Dr. Murphy-Rose says. \"For many cases, I treat perioral dermatitis with a prescription cream and oral medication.\" The most essential part of treatment is discontinuing topical corticosteroids\u2014if patients are using them\u2014on the face, according to Dr. LoGerfo. \"We usually treat perioral dermatitis with medications that are called topical calcineurin inhibitors,\" she says. \"Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) are a newer class of drugs we use in dermatology. There are two drugs in this class: tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream. Both of these drugs act by inhibiting inflammation in the skin. They are used as an alternative to topical corticosteroids. We often use these drugs along with topical antibiotics such as clindamycin and erythromycin and topical antimicrobial/antibacterial metronidazole. I often combine topical medications with oral antibiotics in the tetracycline family, including tetracycline, minocycline, and doxycycline. Oral tetracyclines have great anti-inflammatory effects, which is helpful perioral dermatitis.\" How to Prevent Perioral Dermatitis \"Perioral dermatitis can be triggered by the use of fluorinated toothpaste and fluorinated steroids (like those in creams or inhalers), so avoiding these can help avoid a flare,\" Dr. Murphy-Rose says. \"The same may apply to the use of birth control, though I hesitate to say this because most people on birth control will not experience perioral dermatitis. Moreover, perioral dermatitis often occurs in the absence of any of these. All this to say, there is often nothing you can do to prevent perioral dermatitis; there is likely some inherent predisposition to its development.\" To play it safe, avoiding topical corticosteroids is also best. \"One of the most consequential tools in managing the disease is this,\" Dr. LoGerfo says. \"Another major factor is to practice gentle skincare and minimize using potential skin irritants and allergens. This involves gently cleansing the skin. I usually recommend using something like Cetaphil.\" How Long Does It Take for Perioral Dermatitis to Go Away? With prescription therapy, Dr. Murphy-Rose says most of her patients see significant improvement within two weeks. However, that's not always the case. \"It can take weeks to months for perioral dermatitis to resolve,\" Dr. LoGerfo says. \"Generally, I find that with appropriate topical and oral treatments, it takes about two to three weeks to resolve. However, sometimes it can take longer.\" When to See a Doctor \"Acne around the mouth and perioral dermatitis can look very similar,\" Dr. Murphy-Rose says. \"I recommend seeing an experienced dermatologist at the first sign of symptoms. However, it is reasonable to treat with over-the-counter acne medications first and assess your response over a few weeks. If you notice unusual involvement (i.e., different from your usual acne) around the nose, lips, or eyes, that would also warrant seeking a dermatologist consultation earlier to get on medication and hasten the resolution of your symptoms.\" The Final Takeaway \"It is important to know that perioral dermatitis is often stubborn and frequently will not resolve on its own,\" Dr. Murphy-Rose says. That's why both experts urge you to see a dermatologist once you suspect you have perioral dermatitis. \"You should seek professional dermatological help when you have pustules and scaling that does not resolve with over-the-counter treatments,\" Dr. LoGerfo notes. Once you are diagnosed with perioral dermatitis, it's essential to follow your doctor's treatment plan and stick to a simple, gentle skincare routine. By doing so, you can usually expect your perioral dermatitis flare-up to resolve within three weeks. "}
