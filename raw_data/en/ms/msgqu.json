I've been observing my friends take part in so-called \"Facebook Challenges\". These challenges are typically to post a flower picture or maybe something you are grateful for every day for one month. I decided to make up a challenge of my own, and one that I hope will have a positive impact, you are welcome to join me! Please share, like, or make your own posts! I am going to use this blog to document my research, as well as the questions, comments, and arguments that come my way over the next 45 days. Please send me any questions you have or topics you would like me to write about, and check back frequently for a \"shot\" of straight vaccine talk. It may seem like \"everyone\" is questioning vaccines or attempting to space them out differently, but that is not true. 90% of kids in the USA are vaccinated on time. Which means 28 immunizations in the first two years of life to prevent 14 different diseases. The sheer number alone is frightening for parents. Day 1 In San Diego County alone in 2015, 45 infants under the age of 4 months contracted whooping cough. I have committed to writing about childhood vaccinations every day for 45 days to honor the 45 infants in San Diego County who contracted whooping cough last year due to low herd immunity. However, I'm worried about my challenge. The danger in doing this is real- I might do more harm than good. We know that presenting clinical information to parents who are \"vaccine hesitant\" actually causes them to vaccinate less. In other words, somehow, presenting real clinical data actually strengthens their belief that they are being lied to by the \"establishment\". [\"Attempts to increase concerns about communicable diseases or correct false claims about vaccines may be especially likely to be counterproductive.\"](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/133/4/e835)(1) Day 2 Did you know that immunizations are associated with cutting the risk of SIDS by one half (1/2!!)? On-time immunizations are an important part of SIDS prevention strategies. (2) Epidemiological evidence indicates infants immunized against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) are at decreased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Asymptomatic whooping cough and pyrogenic toxins of Staphylococcus aureus have been implicated in the etiology of SIDS. (3) Day 3 I would like to take this time to remind everyone, I am not an MD, none of this is medical advice, and of course, you should talk to your own doctor. I am just discussing the EVIDENCE BASED recommendations. I am surprised by the positive response this experiment has generated, already, in just two days! A half a dozen people have PMd me to ask me to discuss the research behind questions that have been bugging them. One of those questions was: \"If vaccinated kids are \"safe\" then why are those parents concerned about unvaccinated kids?\" This is a GREAT question! The \"immunity\" that you develop in response to vaccines, is only as good as your own immune system's response to it. The effectiveness does not come from the vaccine, it comes from you. If your body creates a strong response to the vaccine then your immunity will be high. If you have a weak response then your immunity will be low, and you may still get the illness. That is why the effectiveness of vaccines can vary between people. Most childhood vaccines are nearly 100% effective. Nearly. For example: measles antibodies develop in approximately 98 percent of children vaccinated at 15 months or older. It is estimated that about 2-5 percent of children, who receive the vaccine at 12 months of age or younger or who only get one dose of MMR, fail to be protected.The CDC says that vaccine-induced immunity \"appears to be long-term and probably lifelong in most persons.\" However, some studies show that immunity does not last forever. Measles is a terrifying disease. It is nearly 100% contagious (spread through the air, just from BREATHING, not coughing). Diseases like measles exist in all inhabited continents and kill approximately 122,000 people every year \u2014 that's 14 deaths every hour. What's worse? Most of these people are children under five years old (see red dots on map above). There are studies that show measles outbreaks CAN AND DO occur in fully vaccinated populations. For example, an outbreak of measles in the spring of 1985 in Corpus Christi, Texas, occurred in a school where more than 99 percent of the students were fully vaccinated. (4,5,6) Children, and adults that have not received \"boosters\" as well as the thousands and thousands of children who can't get vaccinated for legitimate reasons (kids who have seizure disorders, kids who have had chemotherapy, kids who allergies), are at risk form unvaccinated kids. I believe, we need to protect these people. It has been estimated that there are as many as 10 Million \"immune compromised\" people living in the USA.(7) The BIGGEST worry for parents of vaccinated kids, is simply that the vaccine schedule takes several years to fulfill. When your child is too young to get the vaccines, or when a series of spaced- out shots is needed to make him/her fully immune, that is when they will be at the most risk, and the least able to fight off getting a virus if they are exposed. Parents are usually the most worried when they have older kids going to school with unvaccinated kids, when they also have [very young children at home](http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/02/09/mother-warns-parents-to-vaccinate-after-babys-near-death/). Day 4 Many parents are worried about the risk of seizures following vaccination. Sometimes, fevers can cause a child to experience spasms or jerky movements called seizures. Seizures caused by fever are called \"febrile seizures.\" They are most common with fevers of 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C) or higher, but they can also happen at lower body temperatures or when a fever is going down. Most febrile seizures last for less than one or two minutes. Febrile seizures can be frightening, but nearly all children who have a febrile seizure recover quickly. Febrile seizures do not cause any permanent harm and do not have any lasting effects. Of course, if your child is prone to febrile seizures, they can have one regardless of whether the fever is a mild symptom of vaccination, or from acquiring say.. the actual chickenpox. There are many genetic childhood seizure disorders which start in infancy, right around the time that vaccinations start to be administered, therefore, the two have become linked together in the minds of the public. For example, Dravet syndrome, (also known as Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy (SMEI)), is a rare and catastrophic form of intractable epilepsy that begins in infancy, with an estimated incidence rate of 1:16,000 to 1:21,000. Vaccinating children at the [recommended age](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/index.html) may prevent some seizures by protecting children against measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, influenza, pneumococcal infections and other diseases that can cause fever and febrile seizures. A recent study (8) found no significant association between vaccination in the first year and acute seizure events regardless of the type of vaccine or whether the vaccine was received on time or delayed. However, in the second year of life, delay of the first MMR vaccine until 16 months of age or older resulted in 3 times greater risk for seizures in the 7 to 10 days after vaccination than if administration of MMR vaccine occurred on time. This is the problem with science! Who can read the table above, except a trained scientist? The IRR is the metric you are looking at (for MMR). Divide the 6.53 by 2.65, and you get nearly 3 times the risk. Regardless of vaccination, young children are at their greatest risk for febrile seizures at 16 to 18 months of age (9,10). However, the data are clear, delaying vaccination not only puts your child, and others at risk for getting and spreading disease, but at a higher risk for seizures as well. Day 5 Vaccination during pregnancy is a powerful way to \"close the gap\" of time after birth, but before an infant can be vaccinated. This post is part of a three day series that will also include discussions of flu and whooping cough vaccination during pregnancy. Many times these days we hear about people not vaccinating, but there are some really-really-really bright spots!! For example, the biggest maternal vaccination success story \u2014 on a global scale \u2014 is against tetanus (muscle spasms until you die)(11). Referred to in the Old Testament as the \"seventh-day death,\" neonatal tetanus strikes rapidly, killing newborns soon after birth. Tetanus occurs when a bacterium, Clostridium tetani, enters the body through an open wound or puncture. The bacterial spores are ubiquitous \u2014 they live in the soil, in animal dung, and in feces. Birth and delivery is a particularly dangerous time for women and infants as there are ALWAYS open wounds (umbilical cord.. for example, or the dreaded episiotomy or tear between your vagina and anus) and feces everywhere, as well as unsanitary and unhygienic conditions in many places women deliver babies around the world!!! Tetanus is called the \"silent killer\" because so many of these women and newborns die at home and both the births and the deaths go unreported. In the USA, Tdap is often recommended (I will discuss why tomorrow!). To maximize the \"maternal antibody response\" and transfer across the placenta to the infant, optimal timing for Tdap administration is between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation. This is an \"evidence based\" recommendation, it was not arbitrary! (12) More than one million people died each year from tetanus in the 1980s, about three-quarters of them, infants in the first month of life. Today, the toll of neonatal deaths has been reduced by over 90% and maternal and neonatal tetanus has been eliminated from all but 22 countries. Large studies on use of the tetanus vaccination during pregnancy have not uncovered any clinically severe events (13, 14). There are still 58 countries where tetanus is a public health problem, and there are plans to eliminate it in every one of them, except two. Day 6 Many people don't think that \"flu\" is a big deal, and so they think, why should I get the flu shot? However, pregnancy during flu season can be particularly dangerous, as women are at greater risk for coming down with the flu because of their lowered immune system. Not only that, but pregnant women have been shown to be at increased risk for morbidity and death too (15). A pregnant woman's heart and lungs are already doing extra work handling the pregnancy, so a serious illness like the flu can put her in danger of complications like pneumonia. The flu has also been linked in previous studies with preterm labor and premature birth; and fever from the flu can lead to birth defects. The flu shot has been given to millions of pregnant women over many years. Flu shots have not been shown to cause harm to pregnant women or their babies. It is very important for pregnant women to get the flu shot. Pregnancy is a dangerous time for women. Your fetus is comprised of your own, plus \"foreign\" non-self DNA. Normally, your immune system will do anything it can to kill off a foreign invader. But, you don't want to mount an immune response against your baby during pregnancy. In fact, your immune response will be lowered, so that you can successfully carry your fetus to term. Pretty neat. except..... during flu season. A recent study analyzed 58,008 births in Western Australia between April 2012 and December 2013. Among the women, 8.8 percent had received the flu vaccine, and 377 stillbirths occurred at a rate of 5.0 per 100,000 pregnancy days for women without the vaccine and 3.0 per 100,000 days for women who received the vaccine. Overall, stillbirth was 51 percent less likely among vaccinated mothers, as opposed to unvaccinated mothers, with the largest reduction in stillbirths coming just after flu season ended (16). DAY 7 The Narrative Inquiry in Bioethics (published by Johns Hopkins University Press) is looking for parents to share their story on why they are vaccinating. The call for papers can be found here ( [http://www.nibjournal.org/.../documen.../Vaccine_Call-9-1-16.pdf](http://www.nibjournal.org/authors/documents/Vaccine_Call-9-1-16.pdf)), and it includes specifics on what the journal is looking for. Selected articles will be published in the issue, but they might publish more of the stories online. This is a unique opportunity to share your story and why vaccines matter to you. DAY 8 The rise in autism has been referred to as a [statistical \"mirage\"](https://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2015/10/13/autism-increase-mystery-solved-no-its-not-vaccines-gmos-glyphosate-or-organic-foods/). Just because two things appear to rise together does not mean they are correlated. In the same time that autism has appeared to arise, so for example has the growth of the organic industry, which essentially did not exist prior to the 1970s. Because the public keeps forcing scientists to study this issue, precious dollars keep getting funneled away from .... Actual autism research. Recently, (again) a new study was performed- The study looked at roughly 96,000 children with older siblings. Of this group, nearly all of the children with both affected and unaffected older siblings had measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccinations between the ages two and five. Yet only about 2 percent of the children had an older sibling with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), while only about 1 percent had ASD themselves. From these findings, the study's team concluded that there was no link between MMR vaccine and autism at any age, even among those children who had affected older siblings and thus a higher genetic predisposition for ASD. (17) Scientists know autism begins before birth. Long before vaccines are administered. A detailed study of brain samples of children with autism who died young shows remarkably clear changes in their brains. The differences were observed both on the genetic level and in the physical structure of the brain, and strongly support what scientists have been saying for years \u2014 that autism starts with [disrupted genes that interfere with brain development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22457638). (18) The clinical onset of autism appears to be preceded by 2 phases of brain growth abnormality: a reduced head size at birth and a sudden and excessive increase in head size between 1 to 2 months and 6 to 14 months. [Abnormally accelerated rate of growth may serve as an early warning signal of risk for autism](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=196951). (19) Autism, and the rate of autism seem huge, but the CDC says that only 2% of children in the U.S. Have \"ASD\" DAY 9 Four million infants (2.2 million between 1 and 6 months of age) are estimated to die annually of infection. Many of these infections are vaccine preventable. Preterm and low birth weight infants are at increased risk of infections (in general) and suffer from an increased frequency and severity of vaccine preventable infections. Preterm infants are also at an especially increased risk of influenza virus infections and pertussis, because their lungs are often under-developed. (20-22) Most expectant mothers never plan to have a \"preemie\" baby. Mothers are second only to siblings in transmitting pertussis to babies. Expectant mothers others can protect their babies by getting their recommended vaccinations during pregnancy. DAY 10 Last year in San Diego county alone, 45 infants UNDER 4 months of age contracted whooping cough. This is a 45 day challenge to post a bit of evidence based childhood vaccination information. Maternal vaccination against flu was recommended as far back as 1960 in the US and in 2005 by the World Health Organization (WHO). In England, it was first recommended for pregnant women during the swine flu pandemic of 2009. But take-up rates for the vaccine during pregnancy are low. But, it is safe, and very important, for a woman who is pregnant to receive a flu vaccine. Pregnant women who get the flu are at increased risk for severe illnesses from influenza and their babies are also at risk. Complications from the flu can include premature labor, babies that are small for gestational age, hospitalization, and, rarely, death. Pregnant women can receive the flu shot at any time, during any trimester. In addition, because babies younger than 6 months are too young to receive flu vaccine, it is important that everyone who cares for your baby also get a flu vaccine. Influenza is the most frequent cause of death from a vaccine-preventable disease in the United States. In a study of influenza seasons from 1976-1977 through 2006-2007, the estimated number of annual influenza-associated deaths from respiratory and circulatory causes ranged from a low of 3,349 (1985-1986 season) to a high of 48,614 (2003-2004 season), with an average of 23,607 influenza-associated deaths. In addition to fatalities, seasonal influenza is also responsible for more than 200,000 hospitalizations per year. No study to date has demonstrated an increased risk of either maternal complications or adverse fetal outcomes associated with inactivated influenza vaccination. Moreover, no scientific evidence exists that thimerosal-containing vaccines are a cause of adverse events among children born to women who received influenza vaccine during pregnancy. (23) DAY 11 Is it ok to question vaccines? Of course it is. There is a \"Vaccine Adverse Events Registration\" it is run by the CDC- to monitor vaccines after they go into public use. Doctors or even the patient and his/her family can send in a report of any possible side effects following administration of a vaccine. All the data is public and you can download it yourself on the VAERS website. However.... The system can be highly abused, because anyone can report anything.. (Like say.. You got into a car accident after getting the flu vaccine). And there is a compensation program as well. From an article- \"VAERS was created in 1986 as part of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), one of the most important pieces of health legislation ever passed by the U.S. Congress. It saved the vaccine industry in the U.S., created a system that compensates victims who get a legitimate injury from a vaccination, and created VAERS to monitor adverse effects that may be caused by vaccines. NCVIA created a fund called the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) to pay for non-negligent vaccine injuries, paid for by a small tax on each vaccine. Mass immunization for children has been mandated by public schools in the U.S. since the late 70s so it seems fair that the government should compensate victims who have adverse reactions to the vaccines. VICP has a list of common injuries from vaccines. If your child has an adverse response after receiving a vaccine and this type of injury is listed in the Vaccine Injury Table, then you receive compensation. The family of the victim does not need to prove causation, which can be extremely difficult, only that injury followed the administration of the vaccine.\" DAY 12 What basis is there for \"Dr.\" Sears to claim that measles complications are extremely rare? He provides none, and his claims contradict the data. What are the data? Approximately 30% of reported measles cases (reference below) have one or more complications. Complications of measles are most common among children younger than 5 years of age and adults 20 years of age and older. Here are some direct quotes from \"Dr.\" Sears: \"...the lie is that measles has a high rate of serious complications. It doesn't. It CAN, but it rarely does.\" \"Potentially fatal? Technically true, but herein lies the lie. It's been publicized as \"the deadliest of all childhood fever/rash illness with a high rate of complications.\" Deadly? Not in the U.S., or any other developed country with a well-nourished population. The risk of fatality here isn't zero, but it's as close to zero as you can get without actually being zero. It's 1 in many thousands.\" Measles \u2014 a disease that was completely eliminated in the United States 15 years ago \u2014 has captured national attention recently, thanks recent large outbreaks. From January 2 to May 21, 2016, 19 people from 9 states (Arizona, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Tennessee, and Texas) were [reported to have measles](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/meas.pdf). More than half of reported measles cases in recent outbreaks in the U.S. were among unvaccinated individuals \u2014 most of whom were intentionally unvaccinated for philosophical, rather than medical, reasons. Measles symptoms are high fever and red, painful eyes that are extremely sensitive to light. It can also lead to complications, like pneumonia, and even death in extreme cases. Many parents think that they should 'challenge' or strengthen their child's immune system, by allowing them to acquire a potentially deadly disease, but at the same time, they are worried about challenging their child's immune system with the MMR vaccine. So... your child is strong enough to fight off a deadly disease, but not strong enough to make antibodies to a vaccine? It is actually a false and misguided belief that \"natural\" immunity is preferable to vaccine acquired immunity, or that an immune system can be strengthened this way. Often times, people in the USA compare ourselves to what are perceived as more \"sophisticated\" higher standard of living European countries. Some people want to know, why is the US. schedule so different, than say, Sweden a country admired for many of its practices. Source: [http://vaccine-schedule.ecdc.europa.eu/Pages/Scheduler.aspx](http://vaccine-schedule.ecdc.europa.eu/Pages/Scheduler.aspx) I've seen the \"Drs\" argue that measles deaths can be prevented through modern sanitation and health practices alone. [Measles deaths in France ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23089128)(modern sanitation, nutrition and medicine) were seen at a rate of 3/1000 in recent years.(24) THOSE ARE NOT GOOD ODDS \"DR.\" SEARS!!!!! The Netherlands provides a fascinating case study on measles as it is a country with one of the highest living standards in the world, yet it has a \"Bible Belt\" that does not vaccinate. During a measles outbreak in 2004- 2005, 3292 cases were reported (94% of which were unvaccinated), 3 children died, 157 had to be hospitalized and 519 had complications (5 of which involved encephalitis). The study pointed out that \"even in a wealthy country, measles is not just a mild childhood disease but can cause severe complications and even death.\" Before the introduction of the measles vaccine in the US in the 1960s, for example, there were 4,000 cases of measles encephalitis a year (many of which led to irreversible neurological complications such as blindness, deafness and mental disability), 150,000 cases of respiratory complications a year, and 48 000 measles-related hospitalizations per year (which placed huge financial and emotional burdens on families). DAY 13 Lucky 13. California has many communities where affluent, well-educated parents have banded together and decided not to vaccinate or to follow and \"alternative schedule\". Often times, people in the USA compare our vaccination schedule to what are perceived as more \"sophisticated\", higher standard of living European countries. Some people want to know, why is the US. schedule so different, than say Sweden's, a country admired for many of its practices? (\"Dr.\" Sears' book fans this flame...) Vaccination schedules are not exactly the same from country to country. There are differences in: the types of vaccines included, the ages at which vaccines and boosters are recommended, the number of vaccine doses that are recommended for each vaccine. In the US and Canada, for example, the flu vaccine is recommended for everyone over 6 months old, while in the UK they are targeted to children, adults over 65, and special groups such as people with serious medical conditions. Some vaccines are not included in the UK schedule at all, but are in other countries; for example, chickenpox (varicella) vaccine is recommended routinely in Australia and the USA, but not in the UK. In the UK the pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine is offered to pregnant women in order to protect their newborn babies; however, some countries recommend 'cocooning' (vaccination of close contacts of pregnant women) instead, while most countries just offer the pertussis vaccine to babies. What is the cause of these variations? 1. There are large differences in the epidemiology (patterns and frequency) diseases specific to each country. (that influences the decisions about what and when to recommend). In the USA, our vaccination schedule is evidence based, however, some countries make decisions about which vaccines to offer, that is not evidence based and just boils down to; 2. History and tradition (\"we have always done it this way\"), this includes countries in Europe that people tend to admire for their higher standard of living. Furthermore, there is an OFTEN quoted and deeply flawed paper written by two authors with almost no scientific credentials: \"A new study, published in Human and Experimental Toxicology (http://het.sagepub.com/content/earl...), a peer-reviewed journal indexed by the National Library of Medicine, found that nations with higher (worse) infant mortality rates tend to give their infants more vaccine doses. For example, the United States requires infants to receive 26 vaccines \u2014 the most in the world \u2014 yet more than six U.S. infants die per every 1000 live births. In contrast, Sweden and Japan administer 12 vaccines to infants, the least amount, and report less than three deaths per 1000 live births.\" Seems compelling on the surface, right? There are so many issues with this \"study\" and so many fundamental flaws, that I might debunk it in a separate post entirely. I want to focus on the question of MMR in Sweden, since it seems to be the difference that is pointed to repeatedly by parents in the US. The trivalent MMR vaccine started being used widely in the USA in the mid 1970s (instead of the individual vaccines), and the European countries switched to the combined MMR in the 1980s. Sweden was one of the first countries in Europe to start using it in 1982, the UK in 1988 the Netherlands began in 1987. In Sweden, the vaccine is free and the culture embraces vaccination. There are outreach systems to parents with young babies, there is nothing compulsory about the vaccination programs and vaccines are often given right at schools. Sweden only had 25 cases of measles in 2014. Less than 5% of Swedes go unvaccinated. It is true, in Sweden the recommendation is quite late, 18 months of age. Their herd immunity is quite high and this seems to influences when they recommend vaccination for MMR. What \"Dr\" Sears and the like fail to point out is that in many other countries, which we also admire for their perceived standard of living, the recommendation is much earlier (see picture under day 12). Last year, the United States had 644 measles cases in 27 states. The most since measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. Check out the most recent map of measles outbreaks worldwide. DAY 14 I have been asked, why is it that so MANY more vaccines are recommended now, then when we grew up in the 70s? Why do we have to wear seat belts now, in the front AND the back seat? Why do kids HAVE to wear helmets to ride bikes now? Why will parents get a ticket for smoking in the car with kids now, when through the 70s they could smoke in the pediatrician's waiting room WHILE pregnant. I don't know. The arc of society is supposed to go upward right? Science, reason, and evidence are supposed to prevail, right? That part of my answer is personal opinion, but this part of my answer is evidence based. Haemophilus Influenzae type b, commonly known as Hib, is a bacterium that can cause serious and fast progressing infections, especially among children under five. The risk of a fatal outcome in meningitis and blood poisoning is five to ten percent and survivors can develop permanent disabilities such as deafness or spasm attacks. Antibiotics may be used to treat Hib infections, but the bacteria have developed resistance to some antibiotics, and that problem is only getting worse. (25) The Hib vaccine was introduced in 1985. Before Hib vaccination, about 20,000 children younger than five developed severe Hib disease in the United States each year, and about 1,000 died. Hib is making a deadly comeback in the US, because of vaccination fears. Before the HIB and Pneumococcus vaccines became part of the vaccination schedule (at 2,4, and 6 months) any infant with a high fever and no obvious source for that fever after physical exam was presumed to have a serious bacterial infection of the blood, and possibly urine and/or spinal fluid, until proven otherwise. Doctors were OBLIGATED to draw blood (maybe requiring several attempts), catheterize for a urine sample, and consider performing a spinal tap. Then the infant was treated with high-power antibiotics, usually in the hospital, for at least 48 hours until tests showed that no bacterial infection was present. Now that the HIB and Pneumococcal vaccines are used in the first year of life, an infant who presents with a high fever is much more likely to have a viral infection (or urine infection for girls) and less likely to have a serious blood infection. Thus, the need for obligatory automatic blood tests and antibiotics has decreased quite a bit for the average infant with a fever. However, this is only assuming the infant has been \"properly\" vaccinated, i.e. on schedule. The infants of parents who delay vaccines in the first 2 years of life, and have a high fever, must be treated under a different standard of care, the old, much more invasive, and expensive way. DAY 15 I'm including a wonderful graphic with this post that illustrates the point that a compound properties are different from those of its individual components. For example: Sodium will explode if it contacts water, and chlorine gas is a weapon of mass destruction, but when bonded together- they make completely innocuous table salt. The potential impact of thiomersal (a mercury containing compound used before 1990) on neurodevelopmental disorders has been investigated extensively. Multiple lines of scientific evidence have shown that thiomersal does not cause autism (26-29). In addition, multiple population studies have found no association between thiomersal and neurodevelopmental disorders, and rates of autism, for example have continued to increase despite the removal of thiomersal from vaccines. Thimerosal is no longer used in vaccines in the US, except for multi-dose vials of influenza vaccine Major scientific and medical bodies such as the Institute of Medicine and World Health Organization[ (WHO) as well as governmental agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC reject any role for thiomersal in autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. In spite of the consensus of the scientific community, people continue to contend that thiomersal is linked to neurodevelopmental problems. Day 16 I don't really fee like posting anything about vaccines today*. In a world with so much uncertainty, and danger, why wouldn't you protect your children from the horrors you can prevent, like communicable vaccine preventable diseases? The mass shooting at Pulse in Orlando Florida occurred on Day 16 of this series. Day 17 MUMPS. More contagious than Ebola. The Indiana State Department of Health said Friday the confirmed cases of mumps includes 24 at Butler University in Indianapolis, 18 at Indiana University in Bloomington and four each at Purdue University in West Lafayette and Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. Fifteen other cases unrelated to the campus outbreaks have been confirmed in central Indiana. Mumps symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, swollen glands and loss of appetite. Even with vaccination, mumps can only be prevented 88% of the time. Day 18 \"Dr.\" Bob Sears, is not a vaccine researcher, or a scientist. He inappropriately misleads worried parents by intentionally twisting the data to sell his book, for the low low price of $13.99. In 2008, an \"intentionally undervaccinated\" seven-year-old boy, a patient of \"Dr\" Sears, was identified as the index patient who started a measles epidemic in 2008, an epidemic which was the largest outbreak in San Diego since 1991. The epidemic \"resulted in 839 exposed persons, 11 additional cases (all in unvaccinated children), and the hospitalization of an infant too young to be vaccinated....[with] a net public-sector cost of $10,376 per case.... 48 children too young to be vaccinated were quarantined, at an average family cost of $775 per child.\" \"Dr\" Sears admits that there is no published, peer-reviewed evidence to support the notion of vaccine overload, and that \"my precautions about spreading out vaccines are theoretical, a theoretical benefit to kids...\" Why would you trust this man? He should have his license to practice medicine revoked. Day 19 Flu season extended late this year, and H1N1 is deadly. Particularly for HEALTHY people, who die from a complication called Cytokine Storm. Vaccination protects everyone. [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_storm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_storm) Day 20: Did any of you watch the movie \"Vaxxed\"? What did it make you think, and how did it make you feel? What questions were you left with? Here is a handy guide to the people involved with the film. Day 21 There has been a lot of fear and information spread about TdaP \u2014 the pertussis BOOSTER (as opposed to DapT, the childhood immunization), that is currently being recommended to pregnant women. The \"package insert\" for TdaP clearly states \"not for children under 10 years of age\" and \"not tested in Pregnant women\". So why are doctors recommending this to pregnant women?! The hope is that, since infants don't receive their first DTaP vaccine to protect against pertussis until 2 months old, they will receive sufficient antibodies through the placenta during pregnancy to offer some protection in those first few months, especially since infants under 3 months old are at the highest risk for death from whooping cough. The Tdap is the adult booster for the tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine. While the tetanus booster is important for everyone, it's the pertussis, or whooping cough, protection that is a bigger issue at the moment because rates have been climbing in a big way over the past decade. In fact, the reason for this post, is the horrific rate of pertussis in California currently. Last year, in 2015, in San Diego County ALONE, 45 infants under 4 months of age (before they can get DapT) contracted pertussis. What are the safety data? The latest study involved 123,494 live births at two California sites involved in the Vaccine Safety Datalink. Among mothers who got the Tdap during pregnancy, 6.3% had preterm delivery, compared to 7.8% among unvaccinated mothers. Further, 8.4% of vaccinated mothers and 8.3% of unvaccinated mothers had underweight (small-for-gestational-age) babies. There was no higher risk of preterm delivery, underweight babies or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in vaccinated mothers. (30) Additionally, a large observational study published this past July in BMJ Open looked at wide range of pregnancy outcomes in more than 20,000 pregnant women who received the Tdap during pregnancy. That study found no increased risk of stillbirth in the two weeks after the vaccination or throughout the rest of the pregnancy in vaccinated women, compared to historical rates. There was also no evidence that vaccinated women gave birth earlier or had any increased risk of maternal death, newborn death, pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, hemorrhage, fetal distress, uterine rupture, placenta or vasa previa, C-section, low birth weight or neonatal kidney failure. (31) Day 22 Happy Father's Day! I find the mid-age, healthy man is the hardest to convince to vaccinate. You are a vector. Real men don't spread disease to women, children and the elderly. Recognize your part in the role of herd immunity!!!! Vaccines are the best way to protect yourself, your loved ones and even your community against many dangerous diseases. Vaccines are not just for children. In fact, according to data from the National Center for Health Statistics, vaccine-preventable diseases (such as flu and pneumonia) now kill more adults than children in the U.S. No one wants to get sick and miss weeks of work, school or spending time with family and friends. By getting vaccinated, you can stay healthier and prevent spreading disease to everyone around you. Day 23 Dads play such an important role in helping to keep families healthy! Often times, adult men (with great immune systems) simply act as a vector for disease, many times they have few if any symptoms. Get your flu shot! Day 24 Everything that can be said about the mistrust of science, summed up way better than I could, [originally posted here](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-mistrust-of-science). \"Many people continue to believe, for instance, despite massive evidence to the contrary, that childhood vaccines cause autism (they do not); that people are safer owning a gun (they are not); that genetically modified crops are harmful (on balance, they have been beneficial); that climate change is not happening (it is). Vaccine fears, for example, have persisted despite decades of research showing them to be unfounded. Some twenty-five years ago, a statistical analysis suggested a possible association between autism and thimerosal, a preservative used in vaccines to prevent bacterial contamination. The analysis turned out to be flawed, but fears took hold. Scientists then carried out hundreds of studies, and found no link. Still, fears persisted. Countries removed the preservative but experienced no reduction in autism \u2014 yet fears grew. A British study claimed a connection between the onset of autism in eight children and the timing of their vaccinations for measles, mumps, and rubella. That paper was retracted due to findings of fraud: the lead author had falsified and misrepresented the data on the children. Repeated efforts to confirm the findings were unsuccessful. Nonetheless, vaccine rates plunged, leading to outbreaks of measles and mumps that, last year, sickened tens of thousands of children across the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and resulted in deaths. People are prone to resist scientific claims when they clash with intuitive beliefs. They don't see measles or mumps around anymore. They do see children with autism. And they see a mom who says, \"My child was perfectly fine until he got a vaccine and became autistic.\" Now, you can tell them that correlation is not causation. You can say that children get a vaccine every two to three months for the first couple years of their life, so the onset of any illness is bound to follow vaccination for many kids. You can say that the science shows no connection. But once an idea has got embedded and become widespread, it becomes very difficult to dig it out of people's brains \u2014 especially when they do not trust scientific authorities. And we are experiencing a significant decline in trust in scientific authorities.\" Day 25 I've been asked to comment about the process that vaccines go through to make it to the market, are they studied and approved just like other drugs? I would like to start off with a bit of history, just because I think its interesting! At the end of the 19th century, several vaccines for humans had been developed. They were smallpox, rabies, plague, cholera, and typhoid vaccines. However, no regulation of vaccine production existed. On July 1, 1902, the U.S. Congress passed \"An act to regulate the sale of viruses, serums, toxins, and analogous products\". This was the first modern federal legislation to control the quality of drugs. This act emerged in part, as a response to contamination events in 1901 in St. Louis and Camden involving smallpox vaccine and diphtheria antitoxin. The Act created the Hygienic Laboratory of the U.S. Public Health Service to oversee manufacture of biological drugs. The Hygienic Laboratory eventually became the National Institutes of Health. The Act established the government's right to control the laboratories where vaccines were made. The United States Public Service Act of 1944 mandated that the federal government issue licenses for biological products, including vaccines. After a poliovirus vaccine accident in 1954 (known as the Cutter incident), the Division of Biologics Standards was formed to oversee vaccine safety and regulation. Later, the DBS was renamed the Bureau of Biologics, and it became part of the Food and Drug Administration. It is now know as the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Our current vaccine regulatory process is standardized for all vaccine development. Vaccine development is a long, complex process, often lasting 10-15 years and it involves a combination of public and private institutions. All vaccine research starts off with an idea, a grant, some federally funded disease priority in an academic institution. That takes about 2-4 years of lab work, and then pre-clinical studies start. Pre-clinical studies use tissue-culture or cell-culture systems and animal testing to assess the safety of the candidate vaccine and its ability to provoke an immune response. Animal subjects might be mice or monkeys. These studies give researchers an idea of the responses they might expect in humans. They may also suggest a safe starting dose for the next phase of research as well as a safe method of administering the vaccine. Researchers try to increase the efficiency of the vaccine during this stage, or perform challenge studies with the animals, meaning that they vaccinate the animals and then try to infect them with the target pathogen. Many candidate vaccines never progress beyond this stage because they fail to produce the desired immune response. The pre-clinical stages often lasts 1-2 years and usually involves researchers in private industry. Meaning, the academic discovery has been licensed to a start-up or big industry player to take it through the next stage. Day 26 Clinical Trials. What happens after the lab research is done? An application for an Investigational New Drug (IND) is submitted to FDA. The company describes the manufacturing and testing processes, summarizes the laboratory reports, and describes the proposed study. An institutional review board, representing an institution where the clinical trial will be conducted, must approve the clinical protocol. The FDA has 30 days to approve the application. Once the IND application has been approved, the vaccine is subject to three phases of testing. Next Steps: Clinical Studies with Human Subjects Phase I: This first attempt to assess the candidate vaccine in humans involves a small group of adults, usually between 20-80 subjects. If the vaccine is intended for children, researchers will first test adults, and then gradually step down the age of the test subjects until they reach their target. Phase I trials may be non-blinded (also known as open-label in that the researchers and perhaps subjects know whether a vaccine or placebo is used). The goals of Phase 1 testing are to assess the safety of the candidate vaccine and to determine the type and extent of immune response that the vaccine provokes. In a small minority of Phase 1 vaccine trials, researchers may use the challenge model, attempting to infect participants with the pathogen after the experimental group has been vaccinated. The participants in these studies are carefully monitored and conditions are carefully controlled. In some cases, an attenuated, or modified, version of the pathogen is used for the challenge. A promising Phase 1 trial will progress to the next stage. Day 27 Clinical Trials: What happens after Phase II? Phase III Vaccine Trials Successful Phase II candidate vaccines move on to larger trials, involving thousands to tens of thousands of people. These Phase III tests are randomized and double blind and involve the experimental vaccine being tested against a placebo (the placebo may be a saline solution, a vaccine for another disease, or some other substance). One Phase III goal is to assess vaccine safety in a large group of people. Certain rare side effects might not surface in the smaller groups of subjects tested in earlier phases. For example, suppose that an adverse event related to a candidate vaccine might occur in 1 of every 10,000 people. To detect a significant difference for a low-frequency event, the trial would have to include 60,000 subjects, half of them in the control, or no vaccine, group (32). Vaccine efficacy is tested as well. These factors might include 1) Does the candidate vaccine prevent disease? 2) Does it prevent infection with the pathogen? 3) Does it lead to production of antibodies or other types of immune responses related to the pathogen? Day 28 What happens after a vaccine is released to the field, after clinical trial stage III and it doesn't work as well as it did during trials? If CDC just pushes vaccines indiscriminately, why would they recall this? If the CDC was in the pockets of Big Pharma, wouldn't there be a cover up and continued recommendation of using the vaccine as before? The process of science (it's a process not an endpoint) works, vaccines are tested and monitored heavily after their release. Moral of this story: GET YOUR FLU SHOT EARLY THIS YEAR!!!! Supplies WILL be low. Day 29 The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) of 1986 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-1 to 300aa-34) was enacted in the United States to reduce the potential financial liability of vaccine makers due to vaccine injury claims. The legislation was aimed at ensuring a stable market supply, and to provide cost-effective arbitration for vaccine injury claims. Under the NCVIA, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) was created to provide a federal no-fault system for compensating vaccine-related injuries or death by establishing a claim procedure involving the United States Court of Federal Claims. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) established this system, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP), in 1988. NVICP is funded by a tax of $0.75 per vaccine dose, collected from vaccine manufacturers by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The NVICP does not cover all vaccines; however, vaccines routinely given to children as part of the recommended immunization schedule are included, and some adult vaccines are covered as well. Under the NVICP, those claiming a vaccine injury from a covered vaccine cannot sue a vaccine manufacturer without first filing a claim with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Certain medical events are presumed to be side effects of vaccination as long as no other cause is found. The claim filer is reimbursed according to a formula, provided that all the medical records meet NCVIA standards and that review by the U.S. Department of Justice determines that all legal standards have been met. If a claim is denied, or if the claim is approved and the claimant rejects the compensation, only then may the claimant file a civil lawsuit. Day 30 SB277 took effect on July 1, 2016 in California. Referred to as no shot, no daycare, no school. \"EVERY SHOT, EVERY CHILD.\" California's strict new vaccine laws go into effect!!! Personally, I could not be happier. Children are people too, and the ABSOLUTELY deserve to have the right to health. Their right to health OUTWEIGHS a parent's right to refuse science. Families that do not comply will lose their right for a free and appropriate education in public and private K-12 schools. The use of licensed daycare facilities, in-home daycare, public or private preschools and even after school care programs are also included in SB277. Day 30 The HPV vaccine is recommended for preteen boys and girls at age 11 or 12 so they are protected before ever being exposed to the virus. HPV vaccine also produces a more robust immune response during the preteen years. Finally, older teens are less likely to get heath check-ups than preteens. If your teen hasn't gotten the vaccine yet, talk to their doctor or nurse about getting it for them as soon as possible. HPV is the most commonly sexually transmitted organism in the US. It is estimated that about 20 million people are presently infected with HPV, and there are about six million new cases of HPV every year in the United States. To assert that \"serious research\" has not been done for Gardasil (or the other one on the market, Cervarix) is to assert that the World Health Organization, the FDA and the governments of Australia, Canada, Europe and the United States have not done their jobs with respect to protecting citizen's health, when in fact it is EXACTLY the opposite. HPV is a scourage on modern health. Both vaccines protect against the two HPV types (HPV-16 and HPV-18) that cause 70% of cervical cancers, 80% of anal cancers, 60% of vaginal cancers, and 40% of vulvar cancers. The governments of the world have funded \"serious research\" for the development of these vaccines, using tax dollars in public and private institutes all across the world, because HPV is such a common health hazard. These vaccines have been studied (\"serious research\") since the 1980's. That means over 30 years of research has already been performed. HPV vaccines are approved for use in over 100 countries, with more than 100 million doses distributed worldwide. Extensive clinical trial and post-marketing safety surveillance data indicate that both Gardasil and Cervarix are well tolerated and safe. For instance- [A study of approximately 1 million girls](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3805482/) found no evidence supporting associations between exposure to quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine and autoimmune, neurological, and venous thromboembolic adverse events (33) If you search Pubmed (the online library where you can find all the scientific studies you would ever want to read) you get over 315 results for hpv vaccines. If this is not serious research I don't know what is. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=hpv+vaccine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=hpv+vaccine) Day 31 A [ 5 week old infant is the latest victim ](http://www.countynewscenter.com/local-infant-dies-from-pertussis/)of whooping cough here in San Diego. I've made a number of posts already about pertussis, but, one more reminder can't hurt, as the 45 infants under 4 months of age who contacted whooping cough in SD last year was the whole reason I started this post anyway. Reminder- whooping cough is deadly. A Tdap booster is recommended for pregnant women during their third trimester of each pregnancy, even if they got a booster before becoming pregnant. The best time to get the shot is between the 27th and the 36th week of pregnancy. Day 32 I have been asked to address \"if vaccines have been tested in combination with each other\". The answer is YES: They are fully tested in every conceivable combination. Please see references 34-50. Day 33 Should parents have the right to hold \"beliefs\" that harm, maim, and kill children? The common good is also a paramount concern. The government has an actual, real obligation to protect the right to health (\"life\") of its citizens, and that includes children. Death is a real consequence of parent's vaccine refusal, as the recent deaths in San Diego county alone prove. Children are endowed with the same inalienable rights as adults. Of course, medical exemptions can and should be allowed when the risk to the child outweighs the benefit. I was truly hoping that the efforts to educate parents would work. In fact, efforts to educate in many cases have done the exact opposite. They have caused a tightening around the held beliefs, no matter how inaccurate they are. We are also starting to see cases of parents being brought on charges of neglect or homicide when they try to use homeopathy or fundamentalist religious beliefs to cure their children. This topic is an interesting one- in this case, should the government value freedom of religious expression over the fundamental right to not be deprived of life by the actions of others? Secular persons such as myself, believe that children don't have a choice when they are born into the belief system of a family- whether your spiritual belief is in the \"all natural\" or in the \"laying on of hands and prayers\". Children should not suffer maiming, disfigurement, or the risk of loss of their life because of those beliefs. \" [There are many ethically gray areas of medicine, but this is not one](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2016/07/vaccination_should_be_mandatory_but_it_isn_t.html). Our laws must unambiguously and without loopholes reflect this, and there cannot be conflicting standards of child protection based on race, wealth, and education. By continuing to allow exceptions, we are fueling the misconception that vaccinations are an option, a choice, a subjective topic about which people can have different opinions that ought to be respected, when in fact all of the data proves they are not.\" Day 34 [HPV vaccine will now be free for boys AND girls and access to the chickenpox virus will be expanded](http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/309605/anti-cancer-vaccine-now-free-for-boys) in New Zealand. Great-wonderful-fantastic news!!! (There's \"big pharma\" making so much money off people and keeping the cure for cancer secret). The Gardasil vaccine has been available free for Year 8 girls but boys have been excluded because of the cost. Pharmac has announced it will now fund the vaccine for all children and adults up to the age of 26 from next year. It means boys will be included in the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme in schools. The current four-strain vaccine will be replaced with one covering nine strains. Day 35 Fundamentalist religious beliefs can include belief systems in the \"All Natural\" a belief that anything natural is better than any technological achievement from roughly the past 10,000 years. The funny thing is, they often result in the very same prohibitions as more traditional religious belief systems, including: restrictions of food choice (Halal, Kosher = Anti-GMO, organic only, Raw, Paleo), eschewing western medicine and anti-vaccine stances (very similar to many fundamentalist Christian / Protestant and Jehovah's Witness type religions), and surprisingly enough, abstinence ONLY! The HPV vaccine is quite an interesting case because it combines two of those beliefs into one giant prohibition against the HPV vaccine. Myth #1: The HPV Vaccine is not safe. Status- Debunked: A huge study of over 190,000 young women, receiving over 350,000 doses of Gardasil showed no serious adverse effects. This study actually tracked every patient who received the vaccine very closely, attempting to observe adverse effects. [Their conclusion: \"this study did not detect evidence of new safety concerns among females 9 to 26 years of age secondary to vaccination with HPV4 (quadrivalent HPV vaccine).\" ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23027469/)It is a safe vaccine. This is just one of many many studies. (51) Myth #2: Getting the HPV vaccine will allow teenagers to be more sexually active. Status- Debunked: Using health databases in Ontario, the researchers studied more than 128,000 girls, half of whom were eligible for the vaccine in school. The researchers were able to examine the health records of those girls, finding that by the time they reached grades 10-12, more than 10,000 of the girls became pregnant, while 6,000 had contracted a sexually transmitted infection (STI). But the girls who had been vaccinated were no more or less likely to experience pregnancy or an STI than those who had not been vaccinated, the researchers reported in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. (52-54) The authors concluded that: \"We present strong evidence that HPV vaccination does not have any significant effect on clinical indicators of sexual behavior among adolescent girls. These results suggest that concerns over increased promiscuity following HPV vaccination are unwarranted and should not deter from vaccinating at a young age. There are in fact dozens if studies about the impact of getting the vaccine on sexual activity rates and risky behavior.\" Day 36 Here is a personal story, published on [Voices for Vaccines,](http://www.voicesforvaccines.org/why-i-keep-posting/#.V6IrJPpg9cw.facebook) that reflects my own reasons for posting, no matter what. \"What I find most interesting about the anti-vaccine movement is that the loudest, most frequently voices heard are those with little understanding of medicine, biology, statistics, or epidemiology who just so happen to have an alternative for sale. Those are the ones who seem to do the most talking and grab all the headlines. And it's easy for them to be heard: No one is shouting from a mountaintop that \"My kid got all his vaccines didn't get sick and is fine!\" That is hardly a newsworthy story. As a result, unverified fearmongering gets plenty of press time, while vaccine success stories become \"non-events.\" So I post, because my goal is to celebrate immunization for the amazing medical achievement that it is, to normalize it, and to bring it to people's attention, in order to counter ill-informed fearmongering. I sometimes wonder what my friends and other Facebook contacts think of all my posts. My own kids say \"Ugh! Vaccines again, Mom?\" But recently I heard something I didn't expect, from someone I didn't expect to hear from. As I attended a high school award ceremony I ran into a fellow mom I've known since our kids were in kindergarten. We are Facebook friends, though I rarely see her comment or post anything. In fact I hardly see her around anymore now that our kids are well past the \"class mom\" and PTO meeting years. At the ceremony, I learned that her son was going to college the following year at a school that recently seen a couple of cases of meningococcal B meningitis. Of course, I couldn't help myself, and asked her to please consider having him get the new meningitis B vaccine series started before he goes to school in the fall. How she answered made me swell with pride. \"I already had him start it, Lori. I read all of your posts and learned a lot from you. I rely on you for that kind of information.\" Day 37 Here is another post about the movie VAXXED. The anti-vaccine propaganda film is directed by a discredited British researcher (former doctor, stripped of his title), Andrew Wakefield, known for promoting the debunked notion that vaccines are linked to autism. One of the most [scorned men](http://www.vox.com/2015/2/2/7965885/the-research-linking-autism-to-vaccines-is-even-more-terrible-than) in the medical world. Wakefield, who also co-wrote the film, helped launch and sustain an anti-vaccine movement that public health experts estimate is responsible for thousands of preventable deaths. In 1998, Wakefield published a [study](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)11096-0/abstract) in the Lancet that suggested the widely administered vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella (known as MMR) could cause autism. In the subsequent years, Wakefield's research methodology came under fire. As did his financial ties to an attorney seeking to collect damages from vaccine makers. Wakefield's paper was [retracted](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/health/research/03lancet.html) and eventually found [fraudulent](http://healthland.time.com/2011/01/06/study-linking-vaccines-to-autism-is-fraudulent/). And the UK's medical regulator [revoked](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/health/policy/25autism.html?_r=0) his medical license. Day 38 This is one of the first times in history where you have the chance to prevent your kids from getting cancer. The HPV vaccine, introduced a decade ago to combat the sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer has already reduced the virus's prevalence in teenage girls by almost two-thirds. (55) Not just cervical cancer, but head and neck cancer, anal cancer, vulvar cancer, and penile cancer. High-risk HPV types cause approximately 5 percent of all cancers worldwide. Since there is no test to check one's overall HPV status, and no standard screening to detect HPV in the mouth or throat, getting an HPV vaccine is an effective way to prevent illness rather than leave people vulnerable to infections that can lead to cancer. Cervical cancer kills fast and mercilessly, women in the prime of their lives (30, 40 years old). My generation will hopefully be the last to lose women to this scourge, to have had thousand of abnormal pap smears, painful colposcopies, cryosurgeries, and LEEP procedures. People with HPV-associated head and neck cancers have disfiguring masses in their mouth and throat, which makes it hard for them to eat and speak. their vocal cords must be removed by surgery, and suffering and deaths from mouth and throat cancers are possibly the worst of all cancers. Nearly all sexually-active individuals will contract HPV at some point in their lives. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States and is often referred to as the common cold of the genitals. HPV is not a new virus, but many people are unfamiliar with how dangerous and prevalent it is. Consider these staggering statistics: Approximately 80 million Americans (about 1 in 4) are currently infected. About 14 million people become newly infected each year. About half (49%) of these new infections will be among people ages 15-24. Not only is HPV infection common, but most people rarely know they're infected because it typically occurs without any symptoms. Since it's possible to develop symptoms years after first being infected, it's especially difficult to diagnose exactly when a person first became infected. In about 90% of cases, an HPV infection will eventually clear in about a year or two. However, during that time, those infected with HPV are often unknowingly spreading the infection to others. As many as 10% of those infected will eventually develop cancer. While 90% of people may clear the infection, the other 10% end up developing cancerous cells years, or even decades, after initial exposure. Since there is no way to determine which cases will clear and which will lead to cancer, universal vaccination is the most effective means of prevention. Abstract BACKGROUND: Since mid-2006, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has been recommended for females aged 11 to 12 years and through 26 years if not previously vaccinated. METHODS: HPV DNA prevalence was analyzed in cervicovaginal specimens from females aged 14 to 34 years in NHANES in the prevaccine era (2003-2006) and 4 years of the vaccine era (2009-2012) according to age group. Prevalence of quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV) types (HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18) and other HPV type categories were compared between eras. Prevalence among sexually active females aged 14 to 24 years was also analyzed according to vaccination history. RESULTS: Between the prevacccine and vaccine eras, 4vHPV type prevalence declined from 11.5% to 4.3% ratio [aPR]: 0.36 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.21-0.61]) among females aged 14 to 19 years 18.5% to 12.1% (aPR: 0.66 [95% CI: 0.47-0.93]) among females aged 20 to 24 years. There was no decrease in 4vHPV type prevalence in older age groups. Within the vaccine era, among sexually active females aged 14 to 24 years, 4vHPV type prevalence was lower in vaccinated (1 dose) compared with unvaccinated females: 2.1% vs 16.9% (aPR: 0.11 [95% CI: no statistically significant changes in other HPV type categories that indicate cross-protection. CONCLUSIONS: Within 6 years of vaccine introduction, there was a 64% decrease in 4vHPV type prevalence among females aged 14 to 19 years and a 34% decrease among those aged 20 to 24 years. This finding extends previous observations of population impact in the United States and demonstrates the first national evidence of impact among females in their 20s. Day 39 One persistent myth in the anti-vaccine community is that toxic metals, such as aluminum and mercury, are being directly injected into your child's bloodstream. Vaccines are not injected into the bloodstream. If they were, they wouldn't stick around long enough for your immune system to make antibodies to them. They would be eliminated within a day. Instead, they are injected into a nice muscle, where they can sit in the spaces between cells and do their job- provoke an immune response. The second scary boogyman here is that everyone KNOWS metals are bad, right? But, the properties of chemicals are defined by ALL of the elements in the compound- not just one element. For example, nitrogen makes up most of the air we breath, but also, explosive fertilizer bombs. We are not afraid to breath N2 (it like to bond with itself for stability), however, bond one nitrogen with three iodines, and you get the extremely sensitive contact explosive, nitrogen triiodide. Aluminum, which has been used as an adjuvant in many vaccines for over 80 years to [increase the ability of antigens to provoke the desired immune response](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/9615.php). It has become other of the top two chemicals that antivaccinationists like to cite to demonize vaccines (along with the preservative thimerosal, which was removed from vaccines about 6 years ago anyway). Aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, and aluminum potassium sulfate are all used in vaccines. These are \"aluminum salts\". Notice the other elements they are bonded with? Pure sodium metal reacts violently (and sometimes explosively) with water, chlorine gas, has a very sharp odor, and was used in gas warfare during World War I. Sodium chloride however, which is familiar to almost everyone in the world, is just innocuous table salt. Day 40 Even the moms that don't question the need for vaccines, occasionally question the need for the HepB vaccine to be given at or near birth, particularly if they themselves have recently tested negative for Hepatitis B. An estimated 1.25 million people are chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus in the United States alone, resulting in an estimated 2,000-4,000 deaths each year. Surprisingly, 30%-40% of these chronic infections were acquired during childhood. This fact alone presents a compelling case for vaccinating infants \u2014 before they become infected. The hepatitis B virus can be spread by infectious blood and body fluids, as well as not through sexual contact. Children suffer countless scrapes, cuts, nose bleeds and even bites from frustrated playmates during childhood. These are realistic opportunities for exposure since the CDC has stated that the virus remains viable and infectious in the environment for at least 7 days and can remain present in inanimate objects absent of visible blood. Since only 7 out of 10 infected adults show any signs or symptoms, and infected children under age 5 rarely show any symptoms at all, it is obvious how the infected population can easily, and unknowingly, transmit the disease to others. It's definitely a complex topic, the theoretical risks run from how medical errors might occur and why testing isn't infallible, to how exposures could occur in an infant. While OBGYNs suggest mothers be tested prior to delivery, there are many instances when this does not occur, or when it is possible that the mother contracts the disease in the period after testing, but before birth. Properly identifying infected mothers is complicated since there can be errors in test ordering, result interpretation or even test inaccuracy. Administering the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine soon after birth minimizes the risk for infection from the mother or from other infected persons who may be living in the household. Additionally, the hepatitis B vaccine can actually help prevent infection in infants who are born from mothers with the virus in their blood. Studies also indicate that the long-term chronic health issues related to this virus, such as liver failure, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, are directly related to when a person is first infected. For example, 90% of infants who are infected will ultimately develop chronic symptoms later in life, however, when the illness is contracted at an older age, the chronic effects are less prominent. Therefore, to have the largest preventative effect on a population, HepB vaccine should be started as soon as possible after birth. Most importantly, we have [ data to back up these claims](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11694691) (56). Vaccination for at-risk infants began in 1982 and was broadened to include all children in 1994. Before the vaccine was recommended for all children in 1994, 30% of infected adults had no risk factors. Vaccinating only those infants from at-risk groups was not halting the spread of the infection to children. This was because of incomplete maternal screening and a \"substantial proportion of infections occurred in children of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG)-negative mothers.\" Let that sink in a bit. A substantial number of infections in children came from mothers who had tested negative. You got it. Testing all mothers doesn't help. The study estimates that 16,000 children under the age of ten were infected with Hep B a year and that does not include the additional 15,000 children a year who acquired Hep B from their mothers, perinatally. Most of these 16,000 children had clinically silent infections that will lead to chronic liver infections later in life, with 25% leading to death. The study concludes that routine vaccination of infants will save 2700 deaths a year. Day 41 Day 41: it is SUCH an honor to work at the institute founded by Jonas Salk. There were 78 cases of polio last year, worldwide. The polio eradication effort has been immense, coordinated and worldwide. In the 1950s, polio infected ~60,000 children a year, and parents were terrified of this terrible scourge that could leave their once perfectly healthy children bound to an iron lung for the rest of their lives, overnight. Here are [some poignant pictures from the era when polio stalked and paralyzed 60k children a year.](http://www.upworthy.com/19-fascinating-pictures-to-remind-us-what-polio-used-to-look-like) \"Jonas Salk developed the vaccine for Polio, which has saved countless lives all over the world. But what if Brooklyn College had not been free (or practically free) when he was getting his education? And what about the Salks of today? They can not afford to go to college. This is costing us all. We need to provide educational opportunities to the Jonas Salks of today. It may not seem feasible a first glance, but we must find a way to not deprive young Americans of education.\" Interestingly, after city college he attended NYU. \"Tuition was \"comparatively low, better still, it did not discriminate against Jews,... while most of the surrounding medical schools \u2014 Cornell, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, and Yale \u2014 had rigid quotas in place.\" Day 42 If you think the \"immune system needs to work\" by acquiring a virus the \"natural\" way through infection rather than vaccines, you have misunderstood several basic concepts about how viruses, vaccines and the immune system work. GETTING AND SURVIVING SYMPTOMS IS NOT WHAT MAKES OUR IMMUNE SYSTEMS \"STRONG\". People often think this about the chicken pox virus. Why not let kids get it, the way we did? It's not THAT dangerous right? And isn't natural infection better anyway? No, no, no!!!! Viruses use our cells to reproduce and spread, they cannot replicate or move on their own. Most people don't know that getting a vaccine actually does \"work\" your immune system. Just as hard as actually acquiring a \"natural\" infection. It puts your immune system to work making antibodies against the virus, the EXACT same way as if you were infected, but without the miserable, costly or even deadly \"symptoms\". GETTING AND SURVIVING SYMPTOMS IS NOT WHAT MAKES OUR IMMUNE SYSTEMS \"STRONG\". Viruses are basically a ribonucleic acid syringe. They are paragons of Darwinian evolution, having shed every single functional organelle (for example, they do not have mitochondria, ribosomes, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, or nuclei). They inject their DNA or RNA right into our own cells where it gets incorporated into our own DNA, where it is then translated and transcribed, so that our cell's protein production machines are put to work, making new viral particles. The immune system protects the body from viruses. Specialized cells (Macrophage and T cells) roam around and when they encounter a viral particle they capture it, engulf it, break it apart, and present a small piece of it to the immune system. The immune system then goes to war, and becomes an antibody factory, making antibody-soldier cells against the small piece of virus that has been shown to it. THIS Is what makes our immune systems \"strong\". Virtually hundreds of antibodies are released all day everyday by our immune systems. Vaccines work by mimicking viral infection and stimulating the immune system to build up defensive antibodies against the pathogen for if it is ever encountered again. You want your immune system to detect the most deadliest and destructive viruses before they can insert their DNA (or RNA) into yours. You get symptoms after a viral infection because your body tries to kill the cells (YOUR CELLS) that are infected. Other \"cold symptoms\" come from instructions provided to your cells by the virus itself, for example, it will make you cough and sneeze (etc). The virus uses your body to spread itself to other people. It doesn't have legs or arms or independent \"locomotion\", it needs you to spread it around. Most children with chickenpox completely recover. But it can be serious, even deadly, especially for babies, pregnant women, adolescents, adults, and people with weakened immune systems. Remember, vaccinating is not just about you. It is a civic duty and responsibility to the weakest among us not to be disease vectors. The most vulnerable members of our society need to be protected by us when we provide herd immunity. [The CDC credits vaccination with preventing more than 3.5 million cases of chickenpox each year, as well as 9,000 hospitalizations and 100 deaths.](http://www.rawstory.com/2016/09/chickenpox-nearly-wiped-out-in-the-us-despite-the-best-efforts-of-snake-oil-salesmen-and-anti-vaxxers/) Day 43 The last few months of my pop-science writing has been devoted to debunking the myths, fear, and dangerous inaccuracies peddled by the \"Dr.s\" (and I use that word in the most general sense). I'm happy to see that a formal complaint has finally be filed against \"Dr.\" Bob Sears. [ The complaint calls for](http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2016/09/09/the-medical-board-of-california-initiates-disciplinary-action-against-antivaccine-dr-bob-sears/comment-page-1/#comment-446411): - Revoking or suspending Physician's and Surgeon's Certificate Number A60936 issued to Robert Sears, MD; - Revoking, suspending, or denying approval of his authority to supervise physician assistants, pursuant to section 3527 of the Code; - If placed on probation, ordering him to pay the Board the costs of probation monitoring; - Taking such other and further action as deemed necessary and proper. I could not be happier about this, honestly, it is long long over due, and I hope, for every time a child gets a vaccine preventable disease, another year or dollar amount gets added to this guy's punishment. Day 44 A vaccine advocate, scientist and mom wrote in to me to ask \"why TDaP and Polio can't be given sooner?\" It's a great question, and it addresses multiple fine nuances of the post-natal immune system. The immune system is nearly fully functional after birth, but it's robustness is \"built\" by your body over time, particularly the first two years of life. It is fully capable of fighting off nearly everything, and by the way, responding SAFELY to the vaccinations, however, we delay administration of them for one reason- the body's ability to create long lasting immunity to the antigen. The whole answer hinges on the \"T\" Cell. We discussed the function of T cells in Day 42. The generation of some aspects of T-memory is poor during infancy (57), despite apparently normal levels of initial T-cell activation, but the underlying reasons for this are not fully understood yet. One broad measure of immune memory functions is the postnatal rate of accumulation of T memory cells. The available studies suggest that adult-equivalent levels of T-memory cells, are achieved by approximately the age of 15 years, but the rate at which this occurs within the population is extremely variable (58-60). This is also why multiple booster shots are needed for some vaccines, and why on an individual (not population level) results may vary. Vaccines are only as good as your own immune system's response to them! Day 45 A favorite logical fallacy of antivaxxers, is to quote vaccine package inserts (called a Patient Information Leaflet in EU countries and Instructions for Use in other cases) to \"prove\" that vaccines are dangerous. These inserts provide background information on a drug and instructions for the proper administer of the drug.The insert protects the pharmaceutical company in the event of a lawsuit if the drug is administered improperly. It is actually a binding legal document. If for example, the package insert says \"do not prescribe this drug to someone who abuses alcohol\", and a physician prescribes it to that type of patient, then the company has some protection from a legal action from the patient or physician. However, this legal document has no requirement to list the incidence of adverse events or the relative risk, it just has to list what has been reported in clinical trials and on VAERS. We have previously discussed the problem with VAERS (refer to Day 11). One great example of this is the adverse events listed in the Tripedia (DTaP vaccine). Included are a lists of deaths that occurred during a trial ( [http://goo.gl/OBGaNC](http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2FOBGaNC&h=pAQHE_T_5&enc=AZOIV-nEZGqG91x89Q6sCaB0pJedrc9rydlv4AFQ_wVZwl9GL8m-JJxYwqFQsoGcnADpHi8kxBtrQ3NMH9l2V9hPa8-l5S9SFagmbouQOobqNN_VnPNlgbDpy_k5vjkmHrobSOXC1A3TFCN94gSxRq2i&s=1); top of page 13 of the insert), which include SIDS, accidental drownings, and car accidents. The most misinterpreted and misused section of vaccine package inserts is the \"Adverse Reactions\" section. Anitvaxxers publicize these incidents (for example, by claiming that DTaP causes SIDS) while ignoring the car accidents and drownings!! The FDA states that the section should include events \"for which there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event.\" \"Believe\" does not have to be based on evidence that the event is caused by the administration of the vaccine. Here is the exact guidance from FDA: \"The ADVERSE REACTIONS section must list adverse reactions identified from domestic and foreign spontaneous reports. This listing must be separate from the listing of adverse reactions identified in clinical trials and must also be preceded by information necessary to interpret the adverse reactions. To help practitioners interpret the significance of data obtained from postmarketing spontaneous reports, the following statement, or an appropriate modification, should precede these data: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \"The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of drug X. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\" References 1) Effective Messages in Vaccine Promotion: A Randomized Trial [Pediatrics](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/), [April 2014, VOLUME 4](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/133/4), Brendan Nyhan, Jason Reifler, Sean Richey, Gary L.
