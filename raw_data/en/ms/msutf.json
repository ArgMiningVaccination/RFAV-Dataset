The relentless efforts and research have enabled us to overcome most of the diseases through the use of antiviral and antibiotic agents discovered and employed. Unfortunately, the microorganisms have the capability to adapt and mutate over time and antibiotic and antiviral resistance ensues. There are many challenges in treating infections such as failure of the microorganisms to respond to the therapeutic agents, which has led to more chronic infections, complications, and preventable loss of life. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach and collaboration is warranted to create more potent, effective, and versatile therapies to prevent and eradicate the old and newly emerging diseases. In the recent past, natural medicine has proven its effectiveness against various illnesses. Most of the pharmaceutical agents currently used can trace their origin to the natural products in one way, shape, or form. The full potential of natural products is yet to be realized, as numerous natural resources have not been explored and analyzed. This merits continuous support in research and analysis of ancient treatment systems to explore their full potential and employ them as an alternative or principal therapy.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-10-09", "cleaned_text": "Introduction to Traditional Medicine and Their Role in Prevention and Treatment of Emerging and Prevention of the disease is the only measure to avoid its ferocious effects. The immune system can be modulated using multiple vaccines that have been developed, and also with natural supplements. During the COVID-19 pandemic, communities around the world have also been advised to adhere to the set health protocols in their localities to avoid getting infected and transmitting the virus to others. Nutrition-based interventions have shown to play a pivotal role in preventing and managing viral infections, particularly those affecting the respiratory system [ [2](#B2-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [3](#B3-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Studies have suggested that the suppression of immunity is discernible in individuals who have micronutrient deficiencies [ [4](#B4-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The immune system functions are greatly influenced by the T cell-mediated immune responses and the adaptive responses of the antibodies. Enhanced immunity enables the host to fight viral respiratory infections adequately [ [2](#B2-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [5](#B5-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The governments and other pertinent health organizations of a country had the role of verifying the information that their citizens were exposed to. Multiple organizations and companies had been warned on issuing misleading and false information related to the cure and the treatment of COVID-19 [ [6](#B6-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [7](#B7-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The popularity of natural therapy has been on the rise all around for maintaining good health, as it plays a role in the prevention of diseases and illnesses. It has been used as both complementary and conventional therapy in managing both curable and incurable diseases [ [7](#B7-biomolecules-12-01442)]. More emphasis has been placed in using natural products as complementary and alternative therapies ( [Figure 1](#biomolecules-12-01442-f001)). Approximately 25% of the contemporary drugs are derived from plants and 60% of the anti-infectious drugs in the market and under development are of natural origin [ [8](#B8-biomolecules-12-01442)]. About 75% of liver disease patients in the US and Europe consume herbal medications. In Germany alone, the use of silymarin, a hepatoprotective and antioxidant natural product, has surpassed $180 million [ [9](#B9-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [10](#B10-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Multiple phytochemicals and their derivatives have been studied and have exhibited the potential in becoming successful remedies. Some examples are glycyrrhizin, which has been used in the management of viral hepatitis; ellagic acid, which has been used to manage fibrosis; and hepatitis B has been managed with phyllanthin [ [11](#B11-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The compounds have different mechanisms of action and characteristics, usually presenting an intrinsic beneficial or toxic effect, and have been used as hepatoprotective agents and as antioxidants [ [12](#B12-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [13](#B13-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Three groups have been used as a simple classification of these compounds. The first group is the terpenoids synthesized from mevalonic acid and composed of only carbon and hydrogen. The second group is the phenolic compounds synthesized from simple sugars composed of benzene rings, oxygen, and hydrogen. Lastly, the alkaloids are nitrogen-containing compounds [ [14](#B14-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [15](#B15-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Based on the available studies and data, the continuous evaluation of various natural products will enhance our knowledge, perception, and attitude towards the use of plant-derived products as therapies for different conditions [ [15](#B15-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Herein, we explore traditional Chinese and Indian medicine, and other natural products, for preventing and managing microbial infections, including COVID-19. 2. Traditional Indian Medicine 2.1. Ayurveda [16](#B16-biomolecules-12-01442)]. It has been proven to date back tens of thousands of years; the longest period determined for any traditional system ( [Figure 2](#biomolecules-12-01442-f002)). [17](#B17-biomolecules-12-01442)]. All these systems ascribe to a common and accepted body-mind-spirit orientation; that holds that disease and health are a product of the interaction of these three fragments. They are also based on the heating and cooling energy processes. There is also an apparent relationship between yoga and Ayurveda [ [18](#B18-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The popularity of both has been on the rise in current times; they are almost inseparable; one cannot be mentioned without the other. History has shown that the spiritual teachers who first introduced Ayurveda combined it with other morally accepted practices such as vegetarianism, which has become acceptable as a harmonious pivotal system for the former, rather than an established holistic healing system which it truly is [ [19](#B19-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [20](#B20-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The recommendations and prescriptions are dynamic and not limited to specific people based on ethnicity, belief, or religion. [21](#B21-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Most of the natural products utilized in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and the modern-day era are also found in Ayurveda. However, even though traditional Indian medicine has been in existence for thousands of years, there is still more to be discovered with the application of modern technology and science. The world we live in is constantly evolving and so is our body, thus, to accommodate these changes. The systems of medicine available, including Ayurveda, will also change to meet the needs and gaps in these changes. [22](#B22-biomolecules-12-01442)]. This knowledge gap would have perhaps addressed issues that remain a mystery to this date. [23](#B23-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The Vata dosha oversees the body's electrolyte balance, transport of cellular components, and getting rid of waste products. Its effects on the body are resonated by dryness [ [24](#B24-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The different tissues interact with one another to maintain the normal physiological functioning of the body. The blood circulation and production of the important blood components in the body are performed by the Rakta Dhatu. On the other hand, the Mamsa Dhatu (Muscle tissue) maintains the support of the skeletal muscles for the adipose tissue (Meda Dhatu). The bones are made up by the Asthi Dhatu, while the Majja Dhatu consists of the fluids that oleate the bones and the bone marrow. The Shukra Dhatu controls the reproductive functions of the body [ [24](#B24-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [25](#B25-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [26](#B26-biomolecules-12-01442)]. 2.2. Siddha System [27](#B27-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [28](#B28-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The cornerstone of the treatment of Siddha is based on a holistic approach. The system's interventions aim to restore the normalcy of the vital factors of life. For instance, the taste of foods and the medicines used are considered important in treatment. The taste is accorded much attention, as it is the basis of selecting the drugs used for treatment. It has been used to treat both acute and chronic illnesses that include, but are not limited to, diabetes mellitus, obesity, hemiplegia parkinsonism, muscular disorders, skin diseases, digestive disorders, respiratory diseases, and arthritis [ [28](#B28-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [29](#B29-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [30](#B30-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [31](#B31-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [31](#B31-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [32](#B32-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The healer also various therapeutic approaches. One of them is dietotherapy (Ilaj-bi-ghiza), which involves recommending a specific diet to the patient. It is usually a natural course of treatment in the simplest form. In the illustration, in case of fever, the hakim may recommend a nutrient-rich and low-roughage remedy composed of porridge (Daria) and milk broth (kheer). The therapy takes into consideration the amount and the quality of food. Another intervention that may be used is organotherapy, which entails using organs from healthy animals to heal the same diseased organ in the human body. The tissue of the diseased organ is extracted from the healthy organ in the animal [ [32](#B32-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [33](#B33-biomolecules-12-01442)]. 2.4. Homeopathy [34](#B34-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The renowned Dr. Samuel Hahnemann is the protagonist of this system, who popularized it in the mid 17 and 18 centuries. The basic principle of this system is, \"like can cure like.\" If a substance can elicit symptoms in the human body, it can also cure the same symptoms in sick people. The principle has been around for some time, but it was until 200 years ago that it was applied in medicine. Hahnemann believed that the correct and accurate remedy presented the body's vital force with mild disease. For instance, if the disease itself is so strong, it overwhelms the ability of the vital force of the body to correct it. The used substances to treat the initial infections are gentle so that it mounts a response that can correct the imbalance existing in the body due to the disease. Since the symptoms produced by the disease are similar to those induced by the medical disease, the body's responses can lead to healing. The principles of this system are like those of vaccination. A response caused by the disease will protect the body against any amount of disease that can stimulate the body's response. The difference between vaccination and homeopathy is that the body responds to the vibration of energy instead of a product of disease, preventing both infectious and non-infectious diseases [ [35](#B35-biomolecules-12-01442)]. 2.5. Yoga [36](#B36-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Multiple studies examined the effects of yoga on the physical fitness aspects such as muscular endurance, balance, flexibility, and spinal mobility. Cognitive functions have also been studied, such as attention span, memory, processing speed, and executive function [ [36](#B36-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [37](#B37-biomolecules-12-01442)]. After several weeks of observation, it was found out that the flexibility of the involved muscles increased over time. Two studies focused on particular postures and the effects they had on specific muscles of the body. One of these studies after three months determined that surface electromyographic signals, while performing the different poses, suggested that the downward facing poses were the most effective to strengthen abdominal muscles [ [38](#B38-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The gluteus maximus muscles could be strengthened by the upward facing poses. Another study that focused on the flexibility of the joints showed that there was increased flexibility and balance in those who performed yoga than those who did not. The practice has been compared to other exercises like stretching and strengthening exercises and calisthenics. Slow movements have been determined to be more effective. At the end of some studies, the mobility of the spine and flexibility of the hamstring had increased. Similarly, yoga also increased the cognitive functioning and the execution speed, and thinking had increased in those who practiced yoga [ [38](#B38-biomolecules-12-01442)]. 2.6. Naturopathy [39](#B39-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [39](#B39-biomolecules-12-01442), [40](#B40-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [40](#B40-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The traditional allopathic procedures utilized by this system may entail some surgical procedures to cure the disease. However, they may be some side effects [ [41](#B41-biomolecules-12-01442), [42](#B42-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [43](#B43-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The current interventions are environmental- or pathogen-focused. Optimizing the host's immunity is important to regulate the effects of the host and reduce the potency of the agent. Apart from the use of vaccines, other ways can also be used to increase the host's immunity to fight against the viruses. Alternative interventions have made it easier for traditional medicine like Ayurveda and yoga to come into play. There has been immense research into the effects of yoga and Ayurveda on respiratory health, immunity, and mental health. Inarguably, traditional medicine has played a prophylactic and add-on management option for the pandemic [ [44](#B44-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [45](#B45-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [45](#B45-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Based on these preliminary results, the local Kerala government has collaborated with other public health organizations to expand the use of traditional medicine in the treatment of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has helped shorten the recovery time and reduce the complications usually experienced [ [46](#B46-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [46](#B46-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [47](#B47-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [48](#B48-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Consumption of hot food and water plays a significant role in ensuring that digestion and waste removal are effective. The removal of waste from the body is particularly important because it plays a significant role in one's susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections. Together with the reliance on medication, other medical conditions that lead to allergy, asthma, fever, and medication issues can be treated. Spices such as ginger, nut-grass rhizomes, coriander, fennel seeds, catechu barks, and cinnamon can be added to boiling water and consumed during the day to provide prophylactic protection to the patients [ [49](#B49-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [50](#B50-biomolecules-12-01442)]. 3. Traditional Chinese Medicine [Figure 3](#biomolecules-12-01442-f003)). [51](#B51-biomolecules-12-01442)]. One of the most prominent beliefs held by the system is the prevention of disease and secondary infections after the treatment. This system also holds the theory that the body contains four different systems: Wei (defense), qi (vital energy), ying (nutrients), and Xue (blood) [ [52](#B52-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The interaction of these four components can describe a pathology and guide the interventions accordingly. Concentrations of medicines obtained from various plants and herbs, usually boiled, are also used in the treatment process. The system seeks to reinforce qi and is made strong by boosting the defense mechanism and maintaining the body's homeostasis at equilibrium. This system's diagnostic tools include some modern techniques integrated with traditional Chinese methods such as listening, physical inspection of the clients, and touching to identify the causes of disease [ [52](#B52-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [53](#B53-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [53](#B53-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The body is divided into different parts in the TCM based on five elements: wood, fire, water, metal, and earth. All these systems have different features that can be understood by analyzing the five elements. The body's physiology is explained by observing the movement and interchanging among the five elements [ [53](#B53-biomolecules-12-01442), [54](#B54-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [53](#B53-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [55](#B55-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Different stages of the illness may have the same patterns due to the similarity of the pathogenesis during the disease's progress. Apart from using the physical cues, the healer may also ask the patients to state how they feel. The practice utilizes the following four major diagnostic methods; listening and smelling, asking, palpation, and inspection to obtain more information. The practitioner is expected to apply their skills to identify the correct Zheng while also considering subjective information. Recently, scientific studies have been carried out to make the four diagnostic tools more objective [ [56](#B56-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The Zheng theory is utilized in the TCM to treat infections with similar patterns (Zhengs). One phenomenon observed in the system is that one preparation can treat several diseases. If the disease shows different Zhengs, different interventions may be used to treat it. It is very common for one disease to be treated with multiple therapies. The healer identifies the correct Zheng by utilizing the observed symptoms and signs obtained by observation and feeling; they are not completely accurate [ [57](#B57-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [58](#B58-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The exact location of the Zheng needs to be established before carrying forward with treatment. This can only be possible through Zangfu Zheng identification. The condition of the illnesses can be summarized by the nature and the location of the illness. Some of the interventions that can be used to treat the Zheng, in this case, include warming of the uterus to mitigate the cold, relieve pain, and decrease the stasis. Most of the practitioners have adopted at least two methods to identify the accurate Zheng [ [55](#B55-biomolecules-12-01442), [58](#B58-biomolecules-12-01442), [59](#B59-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [60](#B60-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Fifteen specific oral and injectable TCM agents were identified to be used against the virus. Studies have shown that these agents have compounds that contain broad antiviral and antibacterial properties, and they are more advantageous in treating pneumonia and other diseases [ [61](#B61-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [62](#B62-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [63](#B63-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The virus affects the lungs, the liver, spleen, and the stomach as it develops and spreads throughout the body. The TCM perspective holds that the virus has an expeditious onset, spreads expressively, presents strong infectivity, and has seasonal symptoms. There are several TCMS recommended in the guidelines [ [64](#B64-biomolecules-12-01442)]. 4. Miscellaneous Natural Products 4.1. Curcumin [65](#B65-biomolecules-12-01442)]. It has been named the \"Indian saffron\" and the \"Golden spice\" because of its use as a potent agent in medicinal applications. The compound has been used in Unani, Ayurveda, and Chinese medicine. The discovery of the compound dated back 200 years when it was determined as a pure compound in 1842 [ [66](#B66-biomolecules-12-01442)]. There have been numerous studies showing this as a powerful medicinal agent including antimicrobial properties [ [67](#B67-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [68](#B68-biomolecules-12-01442)]. It has been used to add flavor to rice, meat, pasta, and vegetable dishes. It is speculated that it has been used for over 2500 years to treat different diseases and illnesses. It has been used in Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine for different conditions. The importance of the plant in treatment is from its orange-yellowed color, which is the most potent component [ [69](#B69-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Studies on the plant have determined that curcumin has antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, antiplatelet, and antimutagenic properties. These properties have preventive and protective abilities against various diseases such as autoimmune, neurological, metabolic, liver, lung, and cardiovascular. The examination of the effects of curcumin on health is therefore necessary [ [69](#B69-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [70](#B70-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [71](#B71-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [70](#B70-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [72](#B72-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The modulation of the molecular targets has a role in the development of the disease. Curcumin has been shown to play vital roles in regulating cytokines, kinases, growth factors, metastatic, receptors, and apoptotic molecules in most phases during most diseases' development. The curcumin structure's inclination increases its free radical scavenging activities to low-level hydrogenation and a high level of methoxylation [ [71](#B71-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The structure additionally enables the curcumin to antioxidant, pathogens' inflammation and oxidative stress on the respiratory system. Studies have shown a direct effect of curcumin on the COVID-19 variant. It has been predicted that curcumin interacts with ACE2 protein and S protein and intervenes by inhibiting the entry of the virus into the lung cells. It has been postulated that curcumin may prevent the entry of the virus into the body and its replication [ have been observed to help the host avoid losing any weight in the disease process. It also stimulated the local and systemic immune system responses. Other studies have helped to show the strong inhibitory effects of the extracts on the feline immunodeficiency virus. The extracts have antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria that cause frequent upper respiratory infections. The infusions made from the leaves showed great inhibitory effects on the growth of bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus) and against yeast. There was also antibacterial against nosocomial pathogens, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The antimicrobial activity of the flower extracts was more pronounced than that of the fruit extracts [ [84](#B84-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [85](#B85-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [86](#B86-biomolecules-12-01442)]. 4.3. Glutathione [87](#B87-biomolecules-12-01442)]. It has also been used to prevent other adverse effects caused by radiation therapy and antineoplastic agents and other disorders like poisoning by heavy metals and other elements, corneal disorders, eczema, and liver disorders [ [88](#B88-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Furthermore, glutathione has been employed treat peripheral vascular disorders and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It is a vital extracellular antioxidant of the lungs, and there is a high concentration of the substance in the epithelial lining fluid of the lungs. It has been shown that a deficiency of glutathione can contribute to the damage of the epithelial lining that is witnessed in different lung disorders. Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis treated with glutathione [89](#B89-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [90](#B90-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [91](#B91-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [92](#B92-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [93](#B93-biomolecules-12-01442)]. There are immunoinflammatory mechanisms that have been implicated in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Oxidative stress is still a key factor in almost all disease processes; it affects the body's homeostasis. Glutathione and its precursors such as N-acetylcysteine have been considered for treatment because they influence the binding of the viral proteins to the ACE2 receptor proteins in the cells of the hosts that have been implicated in the COVID-19 infection [ [94](#B94-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The SGH is found in the cytosol of most cells in the body. It comprises three substances: glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. It also plays a role in DNA synthesis, a foreign mechanism that viruses used to replicate and induce an infection. It is the first line of defense against oxidative stress caused by foreign pathogens in the epithelial lining of the lower respiratory tract [ [95](#B95-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [94](#B94-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Low amounts of endogenous GSH have been implicated to be the cause of the pathogenesis of most illnesses that act through inflammation and oxidative stress, COVID-19 being one of them [ [96](#B96-biomolecules-12-01442)]. COVID-19 is more established in populations with natural or pathological depletion of GSH. The precursor is also important in activating other mechanisms that lodge attacks against the pathophysiological pathways of the vital attacks and the inflammation that follows. It can increase the response of the T cells and decrease the plasma levels of TNF. The precursor also has mucolytic properties that strengthen the protection against pulmonary diseases [ [97](#B97-biomolecules-12-01442)]. 4.4. Medical Mushrooms [98](#B98-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Its bioactive properties enable them with an antioxidant capacity to prevent diseases related to increased oxidative stress and the formation of free radicals. The antimicrobial activities of the compounds and extracts from the mushrooms have been well documented over the years. The use of medical mushrooms has a long tradition in Asian countries. Medicinal compounds from the mushrooms are extracted in multiple ways, through cultivation in the farms or collection from the wild. The fruiting bodies of the mushroom are harvested, or the mycelium is cultivated in the fermenters with solid or liquid substrates. Components in the mushroom can mitigate assaults that make the body vulnerable to cardiovascular illnesses, cancer, and neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders [ [99](#B99-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [100](#B100-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The therapeutic effects of the traditionally used species have been corroborated with modern research. The species used for food have good amounts of carbohydrates; their structure has chitin that fills the dietary role. They also have large amounts of proteins that contain essential amino acids and may be alternated with animal products. They have low-fat content making them a good source with low calories, but they have adequate stores of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) which present many health benefits to the body. The medicinal and dietary uses of the edible mushrooms are supported by the fact that they contain numerous health-promoting and biologically active compounds. They have secondary metabolites that have a range of benefits, such as antiviral, antibacterial, antioxidative, anticancer, the ability to improve the functioning of the cardiovascular system, and anti-inflammatory properties. The most profound application of medical mushrooms is to prevent inflammation [ [101](#B101-biomolecules-12-01442), [102](#B102-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [103](#B103-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [104](#B104-biomolecules-12-01442)]. They also regulate glycemia; therefore, they prevent the development of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. The -Glucans, usually contained in the Basidiomycota species, are the biological response modifiers because of their broad-spectrum activities in the immune system [ [105](#B105-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Additionally, they have antioxidant properties, decrease carcinogenic elements' metabolite levels, and prevent DNA damage. They have also been shown to play a role in producing anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the body. They have a high binding affinity to the surface of the immune cell receptors with the pattern recognition receptors in the form of pathogen-associated patterns of molecules. Such receptors include dectins-1, toll-like receptors, and complementary receptor 3. Thus, the immune cells' maturation and proliferation, stimulation, and activation of the natural killer cells and the macrophages can be activated by -glucans. Lentinan from the Lentinula species is one of the most typical -glucan and has been used for a long in the medical realm [ [105](#B105-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [106](#B106-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The anti-inflammatory properties of the oyster mushroom have been explained by the presence of isoleucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and leucine amino acids. The arginine can inhibit the growth of tumor cells and decrease the risk of developing metastases. Patients who have cancer and who are under arginine supplementation have shown to have a stronger immune system, gained body weight, and have a favorable prognosis than patients who are not under any supplementation. Ergothioneine in mushrooms is an essential amino acid and acts as an antioxidant. It is absorbed by the tissues from the food and is essential for cells prone to oxidative stress like the lens of the eye, semen, skin, and the erythrocytes. The presence of histidine derivatives in A. bisporus has been attributed to relieving oxidative stress. Ergothioneine is chemo and radio-protective they are efficient against diabetes. They showcase a strong ability to the tumor and inflammation-associated diseases. The fatty acids present in the A. bisporus and other mushrooms can protect the body against hormone-dependent cancers of the breasts. The mechanism of action is by inhibiting aromatase activities, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of pigments, it has antioxidant properties that have been reported to be stronger than those caused by -tocopherol and -carotene. Due to these properties, it has been said to protect the organisms from a wide range of diseases such as different types of cancer, cardiovascular-related illnesses, and diseases related to the immune system [ [117](#B117-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [118](#B118-biomolecules-12-01442)]. However, apart from acting as antioxidants, the carotenoids can also induce oxidative stress on the cells. The AX antioxidative activity is more than ten times stronger than the other carotenoids [ [119](#B119-biomolecules-12-01442)]. It reacts vigorously with other free radicals, depending on the polyene system length and the terminal rings [ [120](#B120-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [121](#B121-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Due to known regulatory properties of AX for the expression of pro-inflammatory factors as well as antiviral effects, it has been explored as potential adjuvant therapy for COVID-19 disease [ of the astrocytes and oxidative stress by mediating the out of the cell signal-regulated kinase and Nrf2-p38-MAPK signaling pathways in the primary astrocytes. Regulating the p38-MAPK signaling pathway can protect the MCAO-induced brain injury. It is also involved in suppressing the generation of free radicals, brain infarction, and the blood-brain barrier disruption. It has also shown tremendous benefits in Alzheimer's diseases; patients prescribed with andrographolide recover spatial memory, learning performance, and synaptic basal transmission. The compound has also shown neuroprotection on the regulation of the synaptic proteins, reduction of the phosphorylated tau proteins, and the maturation of the amyloid-beta aggregate in the aged degus [ [128](#B128-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [129](#B129-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The administration of A. paniculata extract shows antiviral properties. It exerts the antiviral action by partially blocking the entry of viruses within the cells; this affects the replication steps of the virus into the cells and leads to the degradation of the RNA before the virus enters into the cells or after supernatant is released by the cells. Antifungal properties of propolis have been documented as well; it inhibits the aflatoxigenic fungi, decreasing the percentage of germination of conidia in isolates of flavus. Some of the different types also exerted effects against Candida albicans [ [135](#B135-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [89](#B89-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Special attention has been paid to quercetin, a flavanol in propolis; in combination with vitamin C, it has been shown to inhibit aminopeptidase. Quercetin and some of its derivatives inhibit in vitro the proteases involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis. The derivative also modulates the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR). Through the modulation of this pathway, Quercetin may have potential anti-coronavirus effects [ [136](#B136-biomolecules-12-01442), [137](#B137-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [90](#B90-biomolecules-12-01442)]. It is hypothesized to act as a RAC/CDC42-activated inhibitor of the kinase. This experimental evidence suggests that CAPE can help inhibit fibrosis induced by the COVID-19 virus. However, hypersensitivity reactions should be considered when using it for treatment [136](#B136-biomolecules-12-01442), [138](#B138-biomolecules-12-01442)]. 4.8. Probiotics [139](#B139-biomolecules-12-01442), [140](#B140-biomolecules-12-01442), a randomized, quadruple-blinded, placebo-controlled trial reported a notable increase in specific IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using a four-strain probiotic composition, indicating its effects on host's immune system. The COVID-19 outpatients and early viral and symptomatic remission [ [144](#B144-biomolecules-12-01442)]. 4.9. N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) [145](#B145-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [146](#B146-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The latter goes through the epithelial cell membranes and helps synthesize glutathione, an important antioxidant in several physiological processes in the body [ [147](#B147-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Some of these processes include detoxification of the electrophilic xenobiotics, regulations of the immune responses, leukotriene and prostaglandin metabolism, redox-regulated signal transduction modulation, antioxidant defense, signaling of neurotransmitters, and modulation of the proliferation of the cells [ [148](#B148-biomolecules-12-01442), [149](#B149-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [150](#B150-biomolecules-12-01442)], not surprisingly, it has also shown great promise in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic mostly by diminishing the cytokine storm and thus preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the leading cause of death from (~2%) and gets rapidly eliminated in urine and feces. The absorbed Quercetin goes through II metabolism and gets excreted in urine through kidney and bile through liver [ [157](#B157-biomolecules-12-01442)]. [158](#B158-biomolecules-12-01442)], Quercetin was also extensively evaluated as possible adjuvant therapy and a preventive measure against COVID-19 [ [159](#B159-biomolecules-12-01442), [160](#B160-biomolecules-12-01442), [161](#B161-biomolecules-12-01442), [162](#B162-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Quercetin 2 (NRF2) agonists and these agonists are known prevent SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro [ [163](#B163-biomolecules-12-01442), [164](#B164-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Quercetin has prevented various zoonotic coronaviruses as well as other viruses' entry into host cells [ [165](#B165-biomolecules-12-01442), [166](#B166-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Quercetin is a potent immune modulator, it inhibits inflammatory pathways leading to cytokine storm, and also reduces the dendritic cells stimulation and expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II [ [167](#B167-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Quercetin has shown strong inhibitory activity against human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors (hACE2) expression, thus blocking the SARS-CoV-2 entry in the human cells [ [168](#B168-biomolecules-12-01442)]. Further, querceitin has been shown to (3CLpro), Papain-like protease (PLpro), ( [Figure 5](#biomolecules-12-01442-f005)). [170](#B170-biomolecules-12-01442)]. The results show, using Quercetin alone and in combination with other natural products (curcumin, zinc, vitamin C, etc.) and drugs, results in lessening the clinical manifestations [ [160](#B160-biomolecules-12-01442), [171](#B171-biomolecules-12-01442)]. 5.
