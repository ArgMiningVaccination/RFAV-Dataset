Our kindergarten programs have a breathing rhythm of creative child-led play time interspersed with teacher-led activities. Through play, young children gain a sense of the world and themselves. The simple natural toys found in a Waldorf kindergarten provide endless possibilities. Baskets of river rocks, seashells, slices of birch branch, simple cloth dolls and wooden frames draped with shimmering silk come alive during creative play. These materials are transformed by the children into villages, castles, ships and forests as the moment's drama unfolds. Nature Oriented We show our gratitude in the way we care for our toys and environment, taking care to roll up silks and tuck in our baby dolls. In the yard, we treat the lizards, frogs and other tiny creatures that share our yard with care. We strive for the children to live with a sense of wonder and to be filled with awe and joy in the beauty found in the world. Play connected to the seasons of the year engenders a love and respect of our earth. Our large kindergarten yard provides ample space for a variety of outdoor exploration. Here the children enjoy climbing trees, building forts, playing house, and so much more. On rainy days, our students suit up in rain gear for their outdoor play so they can enjoy the bliss of a good mud pie or a slide down our muddy mountain. A Strong Foundation Over the two kindergarten years the children are growing exponentially. Their bodies are lengthening after leaving toddlerhood, and they are becoming more and more capable. The children take walks in the greenbelt weekly to support large motor skill development. Circle time provides opportunities for healthy movement: crawling, rolling, and crossing midlines while playing games and singing songs. Outside, the children are encouraged to try the monkey bars, jump rope and practice other milestones. Fine motor skills are acquired through the practical arts of sewing, finger-knitting and woodworking, as well as through artistic endeavors such as coloring and watercolor painting. A Space for Imagination The children experience the richness of language through the art of storytelling. Teachers typically tell stories in four week blocks allowing a story to live deeply in the children. The stories are initially told by heart and without images, allowing each child to develop the capacity to mentally picture the story and the characters. After several story circles, a puppet show is performed followed by a people play. In the people play, the children are given the opportunity to take on a character in the story, experiencing the human archetypes that we all carry. Language skills are acquired through song, finger games, nursery rhymes, and verses. Meaningful Work The children participate in meaningful work, chopping vegetables, raking leaves, feeding the chickens, sweeping, folding, washing and more. A warm and hearty snack is served daily in the kindergartens, which the children often help prepare. These purposeful activities strengthen the children's will and confidence. With each task, work grows easier and becomes more enjoyable. Such activities develop a sense of responsibility and foster a sense of self-confidence and achievement. The children feel capable and proud when they know they can do real work and serve others. Community Focused In the kindergarten, there is always an occasion to express gratitude and to come together. From Michaelmas in the fall to May Faire in the spring, there seems to always be something to look forward to and prepare for. Festivals and birthdays are celebrated allowing the child and their family to connect to the natural cycle of the year. Parents work in partnership with teachers to support their child's development and, through volunteering, enhance the curriculum and festivals in the kindergarten. Parents form close bonds through parent evenings and time spent after school together while the children play.
